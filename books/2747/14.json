Then he turned to the boy next to me, stretched out a hand, and said, \"I\u0027m Zach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeeDee looked at Zach then back to me, and smiled that all-American-girl smile of hers like this was the most superfun reunion ever!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Josh didn\u0027t smile. He looked between Zach and me with the same kind of expression he used to have while doing his chemistry homework—as if the answer were right in front of him but he couldn\u0027t quite see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zach,\" I said as my Culture and Assimilation training kicked in, \"this is DeeDee. And Josh. They\u0027re …\" I started before I realized I had no idea how that sentence was supposed to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re friends of Cammie\u0027s,\" DeeDee said, saving me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zach and I …\" I started, but then somehow couldn\u0027t find the words to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I go to school with Cammie,\" Zach said, and I marveled for a moment about how smoothly he had lied, before I realized it wasn\u0027t a he at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" DeeDee looked confused. \"I thought it was a girls\u0027 school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, my school\u0027s doing an exchange with Gallagher this semester.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen (and I swear I\u0027m not making this stuff up) Zach slipped his hand into mine!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" DeeDee\u0027s eyes got wide as she looked at Zach, then at me, then at our joined hands. \"That\u0027s really great!\" She beamed, and since DeeDee is about the most un-spylike girl I know, there wasn\u0027t a doubt in my mind she was happy for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Zach, trying to see him as DeeDee did. He was sort of tall, and his shoulders were pretty broad. I guess if you have to run into your ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend, then there are probably worse kinds of cover. (I know, because my mom told me a story once about the Privolzhsky region of Russia and a very unfortunate hat.) But that didn\u0027t change the fact that I was finally with Josh again, but Josh…was with DeeDee. And I was holding the wrong boy\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam,\" Zach said, and I realized it was the first time he\u0027d actually called me by my name—not Gallagher Girl. It sounded … well…different. \"The van\u0027s leaving in ten.\" He nodded at Josh and DeeDee. \"It was nice meeting you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You too,\" DeeDee said, but Josh didn\u0027t make a sound as we watched Zach go. He\u0027d already turned the corner by the dry cleaners before I realized he had taken the quarter with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs little as I liked to admit it, Zachary Goode was officially it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh…well…I\u0027ll let you guys get back to your party plans,\" I said as I stepped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could come,\" Josh called after me. I stopped. \"Next Friday. You know, the whole town\u0027s gonna be there. You could come if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And bring Zach,\" DeeDee hurried to add.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds like fun,\" I said, except, if you asked me, a party with Josh and DeeDee and Zach sounded like the kind of torture that had been outlawed by the Geneva Convention. But of course I couldn\u0027t say that. Of course I had to smile. And lie. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePROS AND CONS TO BEING A SPY WITH A BROKEN HEART:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: Whenever you feel like punching someone, you can. As hard as you want. For credit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: The person you punch may very well punch you back. Harder. (Especially if that person is Bex.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: High stone walls and state-of-the-art security greatly reduce the chance of seeing ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend in tremendously awkward social settings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: Advanced training means that your photographic memory is now so reliable that you\u0027ll never be able to forget the sight of the happy couple together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: You\u0027re perfectly capable of putting all your old love letters and ticket stubs into a burn bag and hiding it really, really well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: Realizing that, despite everything, you can\u0027t set the bag on fire. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: Knowing that, no matter what the operation, you can always count on your friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We hate her,\" Bex proclaimed that night as the four of us walked downstairs for supper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, guys, we don\u0027t hate DeeDee,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you can\u0027t hate her—that would be petty,\" Liz said in the manner of someone who had given it a great deal of thought. \"But we can totally hate her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sounded great in theory, except… well… DeeDee wasn\u0027t exactly easy to hate. I mean—she\u0027s the kind of person who dots her I\u0027s with little hearts (I know because we found a note from her in Josh\u0027s trash last semester), and she wears pink mittens and invites her boyfriend\u0027s ex-girlfriend to parties even though she totally doesn\u0027t have to. DeeDee was utterly un-hate-able. (And that\u0027s what I despised most of all.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corridors were virtually empty. Delicious aromas drifted from the Grand Hall as Macey McHenry placed one hand on the railing of the Grand Staircase, turned to me, and said, \"We could hack into the DMV and set her up with a dozen unpaid parking tickets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macey!\" I cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might make you feel better,\" she rationalized. \"It would make me feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t think anything could make me feel better right then, especially when we reached the marble floor of the foyer and Bex said, \"You could go to that party and show him what he\u0027s missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, going to that party was the last thing I needed, because A) I\u0027d sort of promised under oath that I wouldn\u0027t sneak off campus anymore. B) If I went I\u0027d have to take Zach with me (like that was going to happen). And C) I didn\u0027t have a thing in my closet that could possibly compete with pink mittens on the adorableness scale!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was just getting ready to point out those simple facts when I really heard what Bex had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I said. \"How did you know about the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam,\" Bex said softly, \"you were on comms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. My. Gosh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if it weren\u0027t bad enough that I\u0027d just had one of the most traumatic and heartbreaking conversations of my young life—I\u0027d had it while wearing a comms unit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy classmates had heard everything…Mr. Solomon had heard everything…Dr. Steve had heard everything!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been my chance to redeem myself in front of the Blackthorne Boys, and I had frozen. I, Cammie the Chameleon, had been seen … by my ex-boyfriend…and his new girlfriend…and I had frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took all three of my roommates to drag me into the Grand Hall for supper. I barely managed to stay through dessert before slipping away. (Really, there\u0027s no reason to waste perfectly good crème brûlée.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I found myself roaming dusty corridors that I know are rarely used, passing entrances to secret passageways and fighting the temptation to slip inside, until finally I was standing in a long, empty hall, staring at a tapestry of the Gallagher family tree, longing to ease behind it—to enter my all-time favorite secret passageway and disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I might have, too, if I hadn\u0027t heard a voice behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I don\u0027t think I ever got the rest of my tour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach. Zach was standing behind me. Zach was halfway down the corridor watching me, and I don\u0027t know what was scarier, that I had been sloppy enough not to have heard him or that he was good enough not to have been heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you say, Gallagher Girl?\" He walked toward me then hooked one finger behind the ancient tapestry and peeked behind it. \"Is this when I get my Cammie Morgan no-passageway-too-secret, no-wall-too-high tour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know about…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to himself and said, \"Spy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach cocked his head and placed one shoulder against the cold stone wall, and suddenly I became acutely aware of the fact that we were…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he said, \"that was Jimmy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh,\" I corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" Zach said, waving the detail away. \"He\u0027s a cutie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd … well… Josh is a cutie, but I highly doubted that Zach meant it seriously, so I just rolled my eyes. \"What do you want, Zach? If you came to make fun, go ahead,\" I said, laying myself bare (or as bare as a girl can be in a government-approved school uniform). \"Mock away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied me for a long time, his face fighting a smile before saying, \"Gee, you know, I would…but you just took the fun out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a quick step, but Zach blocked my path. \"Hey,\" he whispered. \"Why\u0027d you freeze out there today?\" Suddenly he wasn\u0027t the boy who had winked at me in D.C., and bore no resemblance to the guy who had sunned himself on the gazebo steps. So far I\u0027d seen three different faces for Zachary Goode, and at the moment I didn\u0027t have a clue which was real and which was legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I said. \"I\u0027m over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No you aren\u0027t, Gallagher Girl. But you will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking to my mother\u0027s office on Sunday night, I couldn\u0027t help wondering when it was all going to get easier. Josh wasn\u0027t even my boyfriend anymore, yet my life was still full of boy-related drama. Hadn\u0027t I spent a good portion of my winter break trying to put those things behind me? But that was before I knew that I\u0027d stink at countersurveillance—that the drama would follow me wherever I went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later Mom appeared in the doorway of her office. \"How are you, kiddo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut one of the downsides of having a top government operative for a mother is that, most of the time, she knows when you\u0027re lying—even to yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Mom said. I heard the click of the door as it locked into place. \"You\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have told her it was nothing; I might have informed her that I was as fine as I could be, considering that Eva Alvarez had barged into our room at six a.m. in the morning (on a Sunday) asking to borrow Macey\u0027s curling iron. But my mother knew better, so I just walked over to the leather sofa, sank into the soft cushions, and said, \"I saw Josh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd my mom said, \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I knew she\u0027d know, because—well, she is a spy, and my headmistress, and there was probably a tape of the whole ordeal floating around somewhere. (Note to self: find and destroy that tape.) But right then Rachel Morgan was looking at me not as a spy, but as a mother. Maybe that\u0027s why I had to look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sank to the couch beside me. \"I know it may not seem like it, but this is a good thing, Cam. Seeing him was a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it didn\u0027t feel like a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tea we gave Josh is quite effective, but sometimes certain triggers can cause people to remember the things we need them to forget. Josh has seen you. He\u0027s talked to you. We know that he doesn\u0027t remember following you on your CoveOps final. He has no recollection of coming back here and being debriefed. The Gallagher Academy is just an elite boarding school to him,\" my mother said. \"Josh is no longer a security threat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now we knew that Josh would never know the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been punched hard before, lots of times, by people who know what they\u0027re doing, but something about my mother\u0027s words made me lose my breath. I know it\u0027s crazy— me thinking that maybe one day Josh would dump DeeDee the Adorable and suddenly remember the truth about me and love me anyway. I know that was a crazy dream. But it was my dream. And a part of me hated to watch it die. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-spy-gallagher-girls-2/page-14.html","bookId":2747,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:29 PM"}
