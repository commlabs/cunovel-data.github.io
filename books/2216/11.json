I’m not what you would call a motivated seller, so don’t try to wait me out, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not interested in buying your home, although I have to admit it’s ungodly beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m looking for your tenant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Juan Carlos? I didn’t know he was lost.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Disappeared Saturday morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who says?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His girlfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Riley Brodin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a detective, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a manner of speaking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can see why Riley would hire one. She’d be anxious if Juan Carlos up and left her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did he up and leave her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How should I know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mrs. Rogers, when was the last time—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we’re going to continue this conversation, McKenzie, two things need to happen. First, you have to call me Irene. Better yet. My close friends call me Reney. Call me Reney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Reney,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Second…” Reney held the empty martini glass straight above her head, not unlike the way Lady Liberty held her torch. A passing waitress took it from her and a few minutes later returned with two fresh drinks. I hadn’t finished my first martini yet, and Reney watched with intense curiosity until I downed it. Damn thing nearly killed me, and I told her so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lightweight,” she said. “Where were we? Riley Brodin. I’ve been a member of this club since before Riley was born, and gossip is such that I pretty much know everything about her. She’s spoiled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hadn’t noticed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spoiled children aren’t always malicious. Sometimes they can be very sweet. But she wants what she wants when she wants it. At the same time she’s—what shall I say? When it comes to dealing with people of the opposite sex, she’s an innocent. I think Riley’s had a grand total of three boyfriends in her entire life, and her grandparents arranged all of them. Partly it’s the fault of her screwed-up family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her family is screwed up?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn expression crossed Reney’s face suggesting that the number of fools she’d met in her lifetime had just increased by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you really that uninformed?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, my inner voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like to get a different perspective,” I spoke aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have Walter, who’s the Prince of frickin’ Darkness. That would be Walter Muehlenhaus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I know him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Although his wife, Maggie, is a sweetheart. She’s an old broad, like me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heady praise, indeed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have her mother, who’s the Whore of Babylon, and then you have Riley’s father, who is, to be generous, a dumb ass. A girl like Riley, she must feel isolated both because of her family and because of her looks. Don’t get me wrong, McKenzie. I think she’s adorable. She reminds me of a tabby cat. Other people—the people on Lake Minnetonka, they all try so hard to fit in with everyone else, so naturally they reject those that don’t fit in with them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s probably true of most people no matter where they live,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then along comes Juan Carlos, who can play Prince Charming with the best of them. He batted those baby browns at her … McKenzie, the girl didn’t stand a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure that’s what happened? Could be she chased him with the idea of breaking away from her screwed-up family and making a life of her own. I only say that because I met the girl and she doesn’t strike me as a pushover.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReney wagged her finger at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might be onto something there,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What can you tell me about Navarre?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like him. Most people do. I invited him to the club; kinda gave him the run of the place as my guest, and he’s settled in quite nicely. There’s no question that’s he’s a cultivated young man of independent means. The question, of course, is how cultivated and how independent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He dances superbly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m always suspicious of men who dance well. It requires a great deal of practice. Tell me, McKenzie—why would a man practice his dancing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To impress his partner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly. He wants so much to impress—with his manners, with his wealth. Of course, that’s true of just about every member of the club.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think Navarre is after Riley’s money?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t say that. God knows the girl has more to offer than a healthy bank account. On the other hand, you know what they said about Lord Tennyson, the poet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He married where money was. ’Course, along with money, there’s status. This club is filled with social climbers. Why else would you join except to say that you’re a member?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-may-care-mac-mckenzie-11/page-11.html","bookId":2216,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:49 PM"}
