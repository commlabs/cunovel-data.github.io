Harriet searched around for landmarks. They were somewhere in Arlington. Harriet knew they had crossed the Potomac after being kidnapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black Dodge van was parked half a block away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorning traffic was already picking up. A few homeless men and women were gathered in an alcove of a Laundromat. A shopping cart stood by them, piled high with stuffed plastic bags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnishen ignored the homeless and led her group to the van. She unlocked it with her remote and the rear side door slid open on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack walked in a leaden daze, barely noting his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet waited until they were even with the men gathered around the shopping cart. Her right hand still rested on Jack\u0027s belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pinched his skin through his shirt and twisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack jerked straight, snapping out of his passivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noooo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fought the guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know you people!\" he hollered. \"Get away from me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet tugged at him. \"Jack . . . Jack . . . Jack. Calm down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swatted at her, striking her hard on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" one of the homeless men called out. He was skeletally thin with a ragged beard. He clutched a bottle, snugged in a paper sack. \"What are you doing to that guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome faces inside the Laundromat lifted to stare out the steamy, streaked windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnishen stepped back toward Harriet. She wore a thin smile, staring straight at Harriet. One hand rested in the pocket of her light hooded sweater, the threat plain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet rubbed Jack\u0027s belly and faced the bearded stranger. \"He\u0027s my husband. He has Alzheimer\u0027s. We\u0027re . . . we\u0027re taking him to the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words soothed the wary cast to the man\u0027s face. He nodded. \"Sorry to hear that, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet led Jack into the van. They were soon settled in, and the doors closed. Annishen sat in the front passenger seat. As they pulled away, she turned to Harriet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those pills had better kick in,\" she said. \"Or next time, we\u0027ll leave him hanging from one of those butcher\u0027s hooks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnishen turned back around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men reached from the backseat and pulled a black hood over her head. She heard a moan of protest from Jack as the same was done to him. She reached a hand over and gripped her husband\u0027s hand. His fingers gripped hers back, if only in a reflex of love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry, Jack. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet\u0027s other hand slipped into the pocket of her sweater. Her fingertips nudged the pile of pills—the pills she had only pretended to give her husband. Before and now. She needed to keep Jack agitated, confused enough to act out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be seen ... to be remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes, despairing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgive me, Lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp; 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf a Map forbidden\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 6, 4:44 p.m. Strait of Hormuz\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Russian seaplane, a Beriev 103, coasted up from Qeshm Island International Airport and sailed out over the aquamarine waters of the Strait of Hormuz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray was impressed with the short turnaround at the airport. Their jet from Istanbul had touched down only ten minutes ago. The amphibious plane had been waiting: fueled, engine warmed, its twin propellers slowly turning. The seaplane sat only six people, including the pilot, three sets of paired seats, lined one behind the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was swift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea crossing to the island of Hormuz would take no more than twenty minutes. They had made good time. Still, it would leave them only two hours to find the last key and use it and the others to decipher the angelic script on the obelisk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had used the time aboard the private jet, provided via Seichan\u0027s black market connections, to study the obelisk\u0027s complicated code. Even on such a short flight as this, every minute counted. Seated in the back row by himself, he pulled out his notebook again, scribbled with notes and possibilities. He had already tried converting all the obelisk\u0027s scripts into letters, like Vigor had done with the Vatican\u0027s angelic script, which spelled out HAGIA. But he had made no real headway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with Vigor\u0027s help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack on the jet, the two of them had poured over the cryptogram. Vigor was better with ancient languages. But it proved no use. Decoding was made especially difficult because they didn\u0027t know which of the four surfaces of the obelisk was the starting point, and in which direction it should be read, clockwise or counterclockwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat created eight possibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor had finally rubbed his eyes, admitting defeat. \"Without the third key, we\u0027ll never figure this out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray refused to believe that. The two had even gotten into a brief argument. They mutually decided to take some time apart, to quit banging their heads together over the riddle. Gray knew much of the shortness of his temper was tied to the knot in his stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now he felt like vomiting. Every time he closed his eyes, he pictured his mother\u0027s face. He saw the blame in his father\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Gray stopped closing his eyes and continued to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all he could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray stared again at one of the letter-substitution pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven more possibilities covered the next pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was right? Where to even begin?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, a loud snort drew his attention forward. Kowalski had already fallen asleep. Probably before the wheels even left the tarmac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor shared the neighboring seat, poring over the silk diary yet again. It was surely a dead end. The monsignor scowled at Kowalski\u0027s racket and undid his belt. He slid back to join Gray and collapsed in the next seat. He held the scroll in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment of awkward silence stretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray closed his notebook. \"Back there . . . earlier . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Vigor reached out and gently patted his hand. \"We\u0027re all worried. But 1 wanted to run something by you. Get your thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray straightened. \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you want to solve the obelisk\u0027s code. But since we\u0027re about to land, maybe now\u0027s a good time to figure out where on Hormuz Island the third key might be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we already knew where to search,\" Gray said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to resist he reopened the notebook and tapped the angelic symbol found on the back of the third gold paitzu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had compared it to a map of the island and discovered that the blackened circle marked the location of the ruins of an old Portuguese castle, built about a century before the keys were hidden. In its prime, it had been a prominent stronghold. Built on an isthmus and separated by a moat, it had overlooked the town of Hormuz and the best anchorage ports. To those Vatican mystics looking to hide a key for the ages, the castle would have appeared to be a good place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were headed to its ruins now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor nodded. \"Yes, the Portuguese castle. But what I meant was why are we searching there. If we knew that, we might figure out what to look for inside the castle ruins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, so where do we begin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor pointed out Gray\u0027s porthole window. The island could be seen ahead. \"Hormuz was a major trading port, trafficking in jewels, spices, and slaves. Important enough that the Portuguese invaded during the sixteenth century and built their castle. But during Marco\u0027s time, it was also important enough for Kublai Khan to send a young woman of his household here to be married off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kokejin, the Blue Princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was purely a commercial arrangement. In fact, the Persian king to whom she was betrothed died while Marco and Kokejin were en route. She ended up marrying the man\u0027s son. But again it was a marriage of convenience. She ended up dying only three years later. Some say at her own hand, some say because she was pining for another love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray turned. \"You don\u0027t mean—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even Marco did not marry until after Kokejin was dead. And when Marco did die, he had two treasures in his room. The gold paitzu that Kublai Khan had given to him. But also a golden headpiece, encrusted with jewels.\" Vigor stared pointedly at him. \"A princess\u0027s headpiece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray straightened, imagining Marco\u0027s long two-year voyage, traveling and exploring exotic lands. Marco was still relatively young when he left Kublai Khan\u0027s palace, in his midthirties. Kokejin was seventeen when she left China, nineteen when she reached Persia. It was not impossible to imagine them falling in love, a love that could never last beyond Hormuz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray rubbed at the headache he\u0027d been fighting. He remembered the brick back at Hagia Sophia, the interior glazed in royal blue, a secret hidden in stone. But could the brick also represent Marco\u0027s heart, symbolic of his secret love for Kokejin?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ve forgotten another clue left to us,\" Vigor continued. He lifted the scroll. \"The story was embroidered on silk. Why silk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray shrugged. \"It\u0027s a material from the Far East, where Marco had traveled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but could it signify something more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray remembered Vigor bent over the scripture, even examining it with a loupe. \"What did you discover?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monsignor lifted the scroll. \"This silk was not new when it was embroidered with the text. The silk was worn thin and uneven. I found oils and old stains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it was a used piece of silk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what was it used for?\" Vigor asked. \"One of the most common uses for silk—due to its expense and rarity—was as shrouds, burial shrouds of royalty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor waited, staring at Gray. He slowly understood, picturing a hollow blue brick. Amazement crept into his voice. \"You think it might be Kokejin\u0027s burial shroud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possibly. But if I\u0027m right, then I know what we must search for within that old castle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray knew, too. \"Kokejin\u0027s tomb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:56 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated in the copilot\u0027s seat, Seichan had an expansive view of the island as the seaplane dove toward a sheltered bay. It was not a large island, no more than four miles across. Its center was rocky and hilly, with sparse veins of green. Most of its coastlines were cliffs and isolated jagged bays, home to many smugglers\u0027 coves. But to the north, the higher slopes fell more gently toward the sea. Here, the land turned greener with date palms and tilled fields, nestling a small township of thatched huts. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-49.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
