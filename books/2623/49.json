Just for a moment Maxim thought the kid was going to turn round and dash back in, slamming the heavy, code-locked door behind him. Run, then, run!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy took a step forward, holding the door so that it wouldn\u0027t slam too hard. He looked into Maxim\u0027s eyes, frowning slightly, but without any sign of fear. Maxim couldn\u0027t understand this. The boy hadn\u0027t taken him for a chance passer-by, he\u0027d realised the man was waiting for him. And he\u0027d come to meet him. Because he wasn\u0027t afraid? Because he had faith in his Dark power?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re a Light One, I can see that,\u0027 the boy said quietly but confidently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027 He had trouble getting the word out, he had to force it out of his throat. Cursing himself for his weakness, Maxim took hold of the boy\u0027s shoulder and said: \u0027I am the judge.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy still wasn\u0027t frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I saw Anton today.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho? Maxim didn\u0027t say anything, but the bewilderment showed in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have you come to see me because of him?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No. Because of you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What for?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was behaving almost aggressively, as if he\u0027d had a long argument with Maxim, as if Maxim had done something wrong and he ought to admit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I am the judge,\u0027 Maxim repeated. He felt like turning round and running away. This was all wrong, it wasn\u0027t supposed to happen like this! A child couldn\u0027t be a Dark One, not a child the same age as his own daughter! A Dark Magician should defend himself, attack, run away, but not just stand there with an offended look on his face, as if he was expecting an apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if there was something that could protect him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s your name?\u0027 Maxim asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Egor.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m really sorry things have worked out this way,\u0027 Maxim said quite sincerely. He wasn\u0027t getting any sadistic satisfaction from dragging things out. \u0027Dammit. I\u0027ve got a daughter the same age as you!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow that was what hurt the most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But if not me, then who?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 The boy tried to remove Maxim\u0027s hand. That strengthened his resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy, girl, adult, child . . . What difference did it make? Dark and Light – that was the only distinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I have to save you,\u0027 said Maxim. He took the dagger out of his pocket with his free hand. \u0027I have to save you – and I will.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIRST I RECOGNISED the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I recognised the Maverick, when he got out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly felt desperate. It was the man who\u0027d saved me when I was running away from the Maharajah, when I was in Olga\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I ought to have guessed at the time. Probably, if I\u0027d been more experienced, with more time to think and more presence of mind. All it would have taken was to look at the aura of the woman in the car with him. Svetlana had given a detailed description of her, after all. I could have recognised the woman – and the Maverick. I could have ended it all right there in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how could I have ended it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dived into the Twilight when the Maverick looked in my direction. It seemed to work, and he kept walking towards the entrance to the staircase where I\u0027d once sat by the garbage chute and had a gloomy conversation with a snowy owl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Maverick was on his way to kill Egor. Just as I\u0027d expected. Just as Zabulon had planned it. The trap was right there in front of me. The tightly stretched spring had already begun to contract. One more move from me, and the Day Watch could celebrate the success of their operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where are you, Zabulon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Twilight gave me time. The Maverick was still walking towards the apartment block, moving his feet slowly. I looked around for signs of the Dark. The slightest trace, the slightest breath, the slightest shadow . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was immense magical tension all around me. The threads of reality that led into the future all came together here. This was the intersection of a hundred roads, the point at which the world decided which way it would go. Not because of me, not because of the Maverick, not because of the kid. We were only part of the trap. We were extras on the set: one of us had been told to say \u0027Dinner is served\u0027, another had to act out a fill, another had to mount the scaffold, proudly holding his head high. For the second time this spot in Moscow was the arena for an invisible battle. But I couldn\u0027t see any Others, Dark or Light. Only the Maverick, and even now I didn\u0027t think of him as an Other, except that he had a scintillating focus of power at his chest. At first I thought I was seeing his heart. Then I realised that it was a weapon – the one he used to kill the Dark Ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s going on here, Zabulon? I suddenly felt absurdly insulted. Here I am! I\u0027m stepping into your trap, look, I\u0027ve already raised my foot, it\u0027s all just about to happen, but where are you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither the great Dark Magician had hidden himself so carefully that I couldn\u0027t find him, or he wasn\u0027t there at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d lost. I\u0027d lost even before the game was over, because I hadn\u0027t understood my enemy\u0027s intentions. There ought to have been an ambush here, the Dark Ones needed to kill the Maverick the moment he killed Egor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t let him kill Egor!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was here, wasn\u0027t I? I\u0027d explain to him what was going on, tell him about the Watches and the way they monitored each other, about the Treaty that meant we had to maintain a neutral stance, about humans and the Others, about the world and the Twilight. I\u0027d tell him everything the same way I\u0027d told Svetlana, and he\u0027d understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr would he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he really couldn\u0027t see the Light!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor him the human world was a grey, mindless flock of sheep. The Dark Ones were the wolves who circled round him, picking off the fattest ones. And he was the guard dog. But he couldn\u0027t see the shepherds, he was blinded by his fear and fury. So he hurtled about crazily, just him against all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t believe me, he wouldn\u0027t let himself believe me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raced forward, towards the Maverick. The door was already open, and the Maverick was talking to Egor. Why had the stupid kid come out so late at night when he knew perfectly well what kind of powers rule our world? The Maverick wasn\u0027t able to summon his victims to him, was he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalk would be useless. Attack him from the Twilight. Pin him down. And explain everything afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Twilight screeched with a thousand wounded voices when I crashed into the invisible barrier at full speed. Just three steps away from the Maverick, as I was already raising my hand to strike, I suddenly found myself flattened against a transparent wall. I slid down off it slowly with my ears ringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was bad. He didn\u0027t understand the nature of his power. He was a self-taught magician, a psychopath on the side of Good. But when he set out to do his work, he protected himself with a magical barrier. The fact that it was purely spontaneous wasn\u0027t any comfort to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Maverick said something to Egor and took his hand out from inside his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wooden dagger. I\u0027d heard something about that kind of magic, naïve and powerful at the same time, but this wasn\u0027t the right time to try to remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid out of my shadow into the human world and jumped the Maverick from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he raised the dagger, Maxim was knocked off his feet. The world around him had already turned grey, the boy was already moving in slow motion, Maxim could see his eyelids moving down for the last time before they would part in terror and pain. The night had been transformed into the twilit stage where he held court and passed sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly someone had stopped him. Knocked him aside and pushed him down on to the tarmac. At the very last moment Maxim managed to put out his hand, roll over and jump to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA third character had appeared on the stage. Why hadn\u0027t Maxim noticed his sly approach? While he was busy with his vital work, chance witnesses and unwanted company had always been kept away by the power of the Light, the power that led him into battle. Why not this time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was young, maybe a bit younger than Maxim. In jeans and a sweater, with a bag hanging over his shoulder – he shrugged it off carelessly on to the ground. He had a pistol in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Stop,\u0027 said the man, as if Maxim had been about to run. \u0027Listen to me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA passer-by who\u0027d taken him for an ordinary maniac? But then what about the pistol, and the way he\u0027d crept up without being noticed? A special forces soldier out of uniform? No, he would have shot Maxim and finished him off, he wouldn\u0027t have let him get up off the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaxim peered at the stranger in horror, trying to figure out who he was. He could be another Dark One, but Maxim had never come across two at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t any Dark there. There simply wasn\u0027t, none at all!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who are you?\u0027 asked Maxim, almost forgetting about the boy magician, who was slowly backing away towards his rescuer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anton Gorodetsky, Night Watch agent. You have to listen to me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton caught hold of Egor with his free hand and pushed him behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Night Watch?\u0027 Maxim was still trying to detect a trace of the Dark in the stranger. He couldn\u0027t find it, and that frightened him even more. \u0027Are you from the Dark?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t get it. He tried to probe me: I could feel him searching fiercely and determinedly, but clumsily. I don\u0027t even know if I could have screened myself against it. I could sense some kind of primordial power in this man, or this Other – both terms could apply here – a wild, fanatical energy. I didn\u0027t even try to shield myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Night Watch? Are you from the Dark?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No. What\u0027s your name?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Maxim,\u0027 said the Maverick, walking slowly towards me. Looking at me as if he could sense that we\u0027d already met, but I\u0027d looked different then. \u0027Who are you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I work for the Night Watch. I\u0027ll explain everything, just listen to me. You are a Light Magician.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaxim\u0027s face trembled and turned to stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You kill Dark Ones. I know that. This morning you killed a female shape-shifter. This evening, in the restaurant, you killed a Dark Magician.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you do that too?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I just imagined it. Or maybe there really was a tremor of hope in that voice. I deliberately stuck the pistol back in its holster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m a Light Magician. Although not a very powerful one. One of hundreds in Moscow. There are many of us, Maxim.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes opened wide and I realised I\u0027d hit the target. Now he knew he wasn\u0027t a lunatic who\u0027d imagined he was Superman and felt proud of it. He\u0027d probably never wanted anything so much in his life as to meet a comrade-in-arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We didn\u0027t spot you in time, Maxim,\u0027 I said. Was it really going to be possible to settle everything peacefully, without bloodshed, without an insane battle between two Light Magicians? \u0027That was our fault. You started a war of your own, and you\u0027ve created a messy situation, Maxim, but things can still be put right. You didn\u0027t know about the Treaty, did you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t listening to me. He couldn\u0027t give a damn for some Treaty he\u0027d never heard of. He wasn\u0027t alone, that was the only thing that mattered to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You fight the Dark Ones?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And there are many of you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-49.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
