I took the little gun from her fingers, checked routinely for a pulse, then wrapped a sofa pillow around the gun to muffle its report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fired one round into the soft tissue below the rib cage, another into her open mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped the gun into a pocket and got out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY found the gun in Tommy Tillary\u0027s house on Colonial Road, stuffed between the cushions of the living-room sofa. The outside of the gun had been wiped clean of prints, but they found an identifiable print inside, on the clip, and it turned out to be Tommy\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBallistics got a perfect match. Bullets can shatter when they hit bone, but the shot into her abdomen didn\u0027t hit any bones and it was recovered intact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the story made the papers, I picked up the phone and called Drew Kaplan. \"I don\u0027t understand it,\" I said. \"He was free and clear, why the hell did he go and kill the girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask him yourself,\" Kaplan said. He did not sound happy. \"You want my opinion, he\u0027s a lunatic. I honestly didn\u0027t think he was. I figured maybe he killed his wife, maybe he didn\u0027t, not my job to try him, right? But I didn\u0027t figure the son of a bitch for a homicidal maniac.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no question he killed the girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No question that I can see. The gun\u0027s pretty strong evidence. Talk about finding somebody with the smoking pistol in his hand, here it was in Tommy\u0027s couch. The idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny he kept it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he had other people he wanted to shoot. Go figure a crazy man. No, the gun\u0027s damning evidence, and there was a phone tip, some man called in the shooting, reported a man running out of the building and gave a description that fitted Tommy better than his clothes. In fact his clothes were in the description. Had him wearing that red blazer of his, tacky thing makes him look like an usher at the old Brooklyn Paramount.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds tough to square.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, somebody else\u0027ll have to try to do it,\" Kaplan said. \"I told him it wouldn\u0027t be appropriate for me to defend him this time. What it amounts to, I wash my hands of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of all this when I read that Angel Herrera got out just the other day. He did all ten years of a five-to-ten because he was at least as good at getting into trouble inside the walls as he had been outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomebody killed Tommy Tillary with a homemade knife after he\u0027d served two years and three months of a manslaughter stretch. I wondered at the time if that was Herrera getting even, and I don\u0027t suppose I\u0027ll ever know. Maybe the checks stopped going to Santurce and Herrera took it the wrong way. Or maybe Tommy made the wrong remark to some other hard case, and did it face-to-face instead of over the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many things have changed, so many people are gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntares \u0026amp; Spiro\u0027s, the Greek bar on the corner, is gone. It\u0027s a Korean fruit store now. Polly\u0027s Cage is now Cafe 57, changed from sleazy to chic, with the red flocked wallpaper and the neon parrot long gone. The Red Flame is gone, and the Blue Jay. There\u0027s a steak house called Desmond\u0027s where McGovern\u0027s used to be. Miss Kitty\u0027s closed about a year and a half after they bought their books back. John and Skip sold the lease and got out. The new owners opened a gay club called Kid Gloves, and two years later it was out and something else was in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gym where I watched Skip do lat-machine pulldowns went out of business within the year. A modern-dance studio took over the premises, and then a couple of years ago the whole building came down and a new one went up. Of the two side-by-side French restaurants, the one where I had dinner with Fran is gone, and the latest tenant is a fancy Indian restaurant. The other French place is still there, and I still haven\u0027t eaten there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Diebold is dead. A heart attack. He was dead six months before I even heard about it, but then we didn\u0027t have much contact after the Tillary incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kasabian left the city after he and Skip sold Miss Kitty\u0027s. He opened up a similar joint out in the Hamptons, and I heard he got married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorrissey\u0027s closed late in \u002777. Tim Pat skipped bail on a federal gunrunning charge and his brothers disappeared. The ground-floor theater is still running, oddly enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkip is dead. He sort of hung around after Miss Kitty\u0027s closed, spending more and more of his time by himself in his apartment. Then one day he got an attack of acute pancreatitis and died on the table at Roosevelt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillie Keegan left Armstrong\u0027s in early \u002776, if I remember it right. Left Armstrong\u0027s and left New York, too. The last I heard he was off the drink entirely, living north of San Francisco and making candles or silk flowers or something equally unlikely. And I ran into Dennis a month or so ago in a bookstore on lower Fifth Avenue, full of odd volumes on yoga and spiritualism and holistic healing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie Koehler retired from the NYPD a couple of years back. I got cards from him the first two Christmases, mailed from a little fishing village in the Florida panhandle, I didn\u0027t hear from him last year, which probably only means that he\u0027s dropped me from his list, which is what happens to people who don\u0027t send cards in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, where did ten years go? I\u0027ve got one son in college now, and another in the service. I couldn\u0027t tell you the last time we went to a ball game together, let alone a museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnita\u0027s remarried. She still lives in Syosset, but I don\u0027t send money there anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many changes, eating away at the world like water dripping on a rock. For God\u0027s sake, last summer the sacred ginmill closed, if you want to call it that. The lease on Armstrong\u0027s came up for renewal and Jimmy walked away from it, and now there\u0027s yet another goddamned Chinese restaurant where the old joint used to be. He reopened a block farther west, at the corner of Fifty-seventh and Tenth, but that\u0027s a little out of my way these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn more ways than one. Because I don\u0027t drink anymore, one day at a time, and thus have no business in ginmills, be they sacred or profane. I spend less of my time lighting candles and more in church basements, drinking my coffee without bourbon, and out of Styrofoam cups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when I look ten years into the past I can say that I would very likely have handled things differently now, but everything is different now. Everything. All changed, changed utterly. I live in the same hotel, I walk the same streets, I go to a fight or a ball game the same as ever, but ten years ago I was always drinking and now I don\u0027t drink at all. I don\u0027t regret a single one of the drinks I took, and I hope to God I never take another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause that, you see, is the less-traveled road on which I find myself these days, and it has made all the difference. Oh, yes. All the difference. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-37.html","bookId":2324,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:57 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:57 AM"}
