I reached over and picked it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlaire,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a phone.\u0026amp;nbsp; You need one. I spoke with your dad and he said to get it for you. It\u0027s from him. Talk and text are unlimited so use it as you wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad had told Rush to get me a phone? Really? I opened the box and a white iPhone complete with a durable case was tucked safely inside. I pulled it out and studied it a moment. I pressed the small round button on the bottom and the screen lit up. My dad hadn\u0027t given me a gift since the birthday before he\u0027d left. Before Valerie had died. He\u0027d given us matching electric scooters and helmets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed into the truck and held my phone in my hand. Could I call my dad on this? It would be nice if he explained to me why he wasn\u0027t here. Why he\u0027d sent me to a place where I was unwanted? Had he met Nan? Surely, he would have known that she wouldn\u0027t accept me. Besides, if she was Rush\u0027s sister then she was my stepsister. Was that why she was so mad? I had grown up with less money than her? God, she was cruel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tapped on contacts and saw that I only had three numbers saved in my phone. The first one was Bethy, then Darla, and then Rush. He\u0027d put his number in here. That surprised me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone started playing a Slacker Demon song I\u0027d heard on the radio before and Rush\u0027s name flashed on the screen. He was calling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" I said, still not sure what to think of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you got the phone. Do you like it?\" Rush asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it\u0027s really nice. But why did Dad want me to have it?\" He hadn\u0027t cared much about anything else I\u0027d needed over the years. This seemed trivial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Safety measure. All females need a phone. Especially ones that drive vehicles older than they are. You could break down at any moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a gun,\" I reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. \"Yeah, you do, badass. But a gun can\u0027t tow your truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoint made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you coming home?\" he asked. The way he said \"home\" like his house was my home too made me feel warm inside. Even if he hadn\u0027t meant it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, if that\u0027s okay. I can go do something else if you need me to stay away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I want you here. I cooked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d cooked? For me? \"Oh. Okay. Well, I\u0027ll be there in a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you soon,\" he said and the line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere he went being incredibly strange again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I walked into the house the distinct smell of taco seasoning met my nose. I closed the door and headed for the kitchen. If this was actual homemade Mexican food then I was going to be seriously impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush\u0027s back was to me as I entered the kitchen.\u0026amp;nbsp; He was humming along to a song I didn\u0027t recognize playing over the sound system. It was smoother and slower than what he normally listened to. A bottle of Corona was opened on the bar with a slice of lime on the rim. I\u0027d fixed many just like that while working on the course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smells good,\" I said. Rush glanced back over his shoulder and a slow smile spread across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" he replied, wiping his hands on the hand towel beside him. He picked up the Corona and handed it to me. \"Here, drink up. The enchiladas are almost finished. I need to flip the quesadillas and they need a few more minutes. We should be ready to eat soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the Corona to my lips and took a small sip. Mostly for courage. This was not how I expected our next encounter to go. Rush was a puzzle that I might never figure out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hoping you eat Mexican,\" he said as he pulled the enchiladas out of the oven. Rush Finlay did not look like someone who belonged in the kitchen cooking.\u0026amp;nbsp; But dang, if he wasn\u0027t sexy doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love Mexican food,\" I assured him. \"I will admit I\u0027m really impressed that you can cook it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush looked up at me and winked. \"I got all kinds of talents that would blow your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no doubt. I swallowed a larger gulp of the Corona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy girl. You gotta eat something too. When I said drink up I didn\u0027t mean for you to gulp it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and wiped off the small drop that was clinging to my bottom lip. Rush watched me intently. It made my hand shake a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his eyes away quickly and started taking the quesadillas off the skillet. He put them on a platter full of hard and soft tacos. There were even burritos. He\u0027d made some of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything else is on the table already. Grab me a Corona out of the fridge and follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly did as I was told and hurried after Rush. He didn\u0027t stop in the dining room. Instead, he stepped outside onto the large back porch overlooking the ocean. Two hurricane lamps stood in the middle of the table so that we could have candlelight without it blowing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit. I\u0027ll fix your plate,\" he said, motioning for me to take a seat at the first seat we came to. There were only two out here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down and Rush began to dish one of everything onto my plate. Then he put the tray of food down and placed the napkin from beside my plate on my lap. His mouth was so close to my ear that his warm breath made me shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get you another drink?\" he whispered in my ear before standing back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. I wouldn\u0027t be able to drink if he was going to do things like that. My heart was racing like crazy already. I couldn\u0027t swallow a thing like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush picked up his drink and took the seat across from me. I watched as he fixed his plate then his eyes lifted to mine. \"If you hate it, don\u0027t tell me. My ego can\u0027t handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sure nothing he made would taste bad. I grinned and picked up my fork and knife to cut off a small piece of the enchilada he\u0027d placed on my plate. There was no way I could eat all this but I could taste some of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minute it touched my tongue it surprised me. It was as good as any I\u0027d eaten at a Mexican restaurant. Smiling, I looked at him. \"It\u0027s delicious and I can\u0027t say I\u0027m surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush put a forkful in his mouth and smirked. His ego could never be crushed. It might even need to be brought down a few pegs. I started to taste the other things and found myself hungrier than I\u0027d first thought. Everything was so good I didn\u0027t want to waste anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my fourth taste of everything on the plate, I knew I had to stop. I sipped my Corona and settled back in my seat. Rush was washing down his food as well. Once he finished he set the bottle down and his eyes went serious. Uh-oh. We were about to talk about last night. I had wanted to forget last night. Especially since tonight had been so nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry about how Nan treated you today,\" he said with a pained sincere voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know about that?\" I asked suddenly feeling uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Woods called me. He was warning me that Nan would be asked to leave the next time she was rude to an employee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods was a nice guy. He could be a little too much at times but he was a good boss. I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She shouldn\u0027t have spoken to you that way. I\u0027ve had a talk with her. She promised me it wouldn\u0027t happen again. But if it does, somewhere else, then please come tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had been an apology meal for his younger sisters bad behavior, not a mending of fences between us. I wasn\u0027t on a romantic date like my imagination had managed to concoct in my head. This was just Rush apologizing for Nan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed my chair back and picked up my plate. \"Thank you. I appreciate the gesture. It was very nice of you. I assure you that I don\u0027t intend to tattle to Woods if Nan is rude to me in the future. He just happened to witness it first-hand today.\" I picked up my drink. \"Dinner was lovely. Nice to have after a long day at work. Thank you so much.\" I didn\u0027t make eye contact with him. I just wanted to get away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurrying inside, I rinsed off my plate and placed it in the dishwasher before rinsing out my bottle and putting it in the recycle container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blaire,\" Rush said from behind me and his body was suddenly right there caging me in. His hands were on each side of the counter and all I could do was stand there and look down at the sink in front of me. His hard warm body brushed against my back and I bit my tongue to keep from making a whimper. I would not let him see how he affected me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This wasn\u0027t an attempt to apologize for Nan. It was an attempt to apologize for me. I\u0027m sorry about last night. I lay in bed all night wishing you were there with me. Wishing I hadn\u0027t pushed you away. I push people away Blaire. It\u0027s a protective mechanism for me. But I don\u0027t want to push you away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking away from him and keeping him at a distance was the smart thing to do. Rush wasn\u0027t and never would be anyone\u0027s Prince Charming. I couldn\u0027t ever let myself think he was the one who would love me and cherish me. He would never be that guy for me. But my heart had grown a little attached to him. It didn\u0027t mean forever but for right now I wanted Rush to be my first. He wouldn\u0027t be my last. He\u0027d just be a stop along the path of life. A stop I might never forget or get over. That was what scared me the most. Not being able to move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached up and brushing my hair from the side of my neck and then pressed a kiss to the curve of my shoulder. \"Please. Forgive me. One more chance, Blaire. I want this. I want you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush would be my first. It just felt right. Inside I knew he was meant to be the guy that taught me about life. Even if he broke my heart eventually. I turned in his arms and slipped my hands around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll forgive you on one condition,\" I said, gazing up into his emotion-filled eyes that made me hope for so much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to be with you tonight. No more flirting. No more waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worried expression was instantly gone and replaced with a hungry gleam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, yes,\" he growled and pulled me against him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fallen-too-far-too-far-1/page-17.html","bookId":1993,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:23 AM"}
