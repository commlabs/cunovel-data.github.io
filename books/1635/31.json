He loved the men and women un- der his command as if they were his own sons and daughters. It was the old axiom of command: To be a good leader, you had to love the service. To be a great commander, you had to be willing to destroy that which you loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatic crackled, and the Master Chief reported in: \"We\u0027re in position, Admiral. ETA for repairs is two minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger, Chief,\" Admiral Whitcomb replied. \"When you\u0027re done give the word and get secure. We\u0027ll be accelerating immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder rumbled through the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plasma impacts, sir,\" Cortana explained. \"Their energy profile has diffused, but they were still powerful enough to knock the lateral sensors and cameras offline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb smoothed his thick fingers over his mus- tache. \"We\u0027ve got only a few minutes before this space tears us apart.\" He squinted at the wall displays, trying to count the number of enemy craft. \"That\u0027s if those Covenant ships don\u0027t do the job first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Cortana. \"How many enemy ships are there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich are real and which are illusion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible to accurately determine, sir. I counted fourteen targets before they started firing and filling the space between us with ionizing plasma. Now? ...\" Mathematical symbols raced along her length, flashing blue and indigo. \"Cross-indexing similar mirrored images and extrapolating, I estimate there are currently between three and five operational ships, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb gritted his teeth and concentrated. He had to get this ship moving—take out one or two enemy craft. Maybe the tangled plasma-filled space would cook the rest of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was their best chance. Their only chance. He\u0027d have to trust the Master Chief to get that drive conduit fixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, Cortana,\" he said. \"Heat the Gettysburg\u0027s reactor to maximum power and prepare to flood the main-engine plasma conduit. Charge all available weapons turret capacitors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. Standby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at a screen that showed the Gettysburg sitting atop them inverted. \"Is the launch bay on the Gettysburg intact? Can it hold an atmosphere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCortana blinked. \"Yes, sir. It has a slow leak of thirty-two kilo pascals per—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pressurize the bay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Acknowledged, Admiral. However,\" Cortana replied, \"that will leave our air reserves dangerously low.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral stared at the ships surrounding them—a plasma bolt struck a distant cruiser head-on, and its nose buckled. Gouts of flame flared along its lateral plasma lines. The ship looked like a fish spit with a red-hot poker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat could have been them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry up, Chief,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the displays the Admiral spotted two ships. There was a carrier far away; it looked undamaged. Closer, off the port bow, was a cruiser that, aside from a hole punched through its aft sec- tion, was also undamaged ... and only ten thousand kilometers away. That was the priority target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lay in a new course,\" the Admiral ordered. \"Two-four-zero by zero-three-five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson took an involuntary step closer to the display, and his face contorted as he worked out the math in his head. \"That\u0027s. . . a collision course, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad you concur with my calculations,\" the Admiral re- marked dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson glanced at the Gettysburg and nodded, finally understanding. \"Aye, sir. A good plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Admiral,\" the Master Chief\u0027s voice broke through in a wash of static. \"Hull breach is sealed, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on, son,\" Admiral Whitcomb said. \"This might be a rough ride. Cortana, give me flank speed now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Complying,\" Cortana said. \"Flank speed. Conduit is holding. Coming about to two-four-zero by zero-three-five. Colli- sion with Covenant cruiser at this speed and heading in eighteen seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAscendant Justice-Gettysburg accelerated toward a line of wavering orange plasma—and steamed through it like a ship smashing through a storm wave on the open seas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire splashed over their hulls and burned away layers of ar- mor. The entire hull superstructure groaned. Explosions rever- berated through the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fire on decks eight through twelve,\" Cortana reported. \"We have lost plasma turret five. Distance to enemy ship six thousand kilometers and closing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Initiate a roll, Cortana. Make it thirty degrees per second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027ll spread out the damage over more surface area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roll maneuver, aye. Attitude thrusters set to maximum burn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe exhaled, and her holographic image flickered with irrita- tion. \"This will make a targeting solution difficult, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Set firing range of plasma turrets for point blank,\" the Admiral told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCortana hesitated for a full second. \"Yes, Admiral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe space on the external cameras slowly began to spin as their ship spiraled toward their intended target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant cruiser came about to face them. Its plasma tur- rets glowed like angry red eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant, take the weapons station. Cortana, give us a firing solution and manual fire control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaverson\u0027s hands moved quickly over the Covenant holo- graphic control surfaces. \"Cortana has a firing solution, sir. Activate weapons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand by, Lieutenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll get off the first salvo, sir,\" Lieutenant Haverson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough his voice was calm, a drop of sweat trickled down his freckled cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope they do,\" the Admiral replied. \"It may be the only thing that saves us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson took a deep breath, nodding. \"Weapons standing by, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cortana, make ready to vent the Gettysburg\u0027s launch bay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, sir. Overriding bay door safeties. Distance to target three thousand kilometers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant cruiser fired. Lances of energy launched and veered toward Ascendant Justice ... and arced away in cork- screw spirals and right angles. The space between the two large masses was still tangled and fractured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two thousand kilometers,\" Cortana reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay on course,\" the Admiral said. \"And continue to hold fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson\u0027s jaw clenched, and his hands trembled over the controls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enemy cruiser filled the displays. Its plasma turrets re- cycled and glowed a dull red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One thousand kilometers,\" Cortana announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Admiral?\" Lieutenant Haverson asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold your fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five hundred kilometers,\" Cortana said. \"Three hundred...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwo... collision imminent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral\u0027s fist clenched. He barked, \"Fire! All turrets, fire! Cortana, depressurize the launch bay and give us full power to port.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAscendant Justice was a kilometer from the Covenant ship on an intercept course when it fired. The Gettysburg\u0027s launch bay doors opened and the air inside explosively decompressed— propelling the conjoined ships to port—just enough to miss the cruiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlasma rocketed toward their target. There was no way to miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite-hot fire impacted on the cruiser\u0027s hull, splashed across its surface, boiled off the armored skin, and corroded the skeletal framework underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aft cameras,\" the Admiral ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn screen he saw fire explode out the opposite side of the cruiser. The warship tilted and rolled belly-up, plasma disinte- grating the interior from stern to stem until it reached the fusion core. The ship detonated in a ball of flame. An instant later the explosion twisted and curved as the warped Slipspace field swept away all traces of the enemy ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson exhaled and wiped his brow. \"Excellent maneuvering, Admiral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t waste your breath on victory speeches yet, son.\" The Admiral scrutinized the tactical display and spotted the other ship. \"There. We\u0027ve got a new target.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to a ship half obscured in the plasma fog: the car- rier, intact, with a cloud of gnats swarming about it. Seraph fighters dived and intercepted plasma and meteor bolts that got too close. The resulting fireballs deflected the impacts from the hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s got a smart Captain,\" the Admiral muttered. \"So we can\u0027t use the same trick twice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive explosions rattled Ascendant Justice, and the ambient blue light on the bridge flickered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meteor impact,\" Cortana replied. \"We just lost plasma turrets two and three. All functionality on decks eight and below has been lost. The structural integrity of this ship, sir, is in danger of imminent collapse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another minute, Cortana,\" the Admiral told her and continued to search the tactical display. \"We either take out that carrier here—where their shields can\u0027t regenerate—or we face them in normal space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped the TAC map. \"Gotcha! Cortana, come about to zero-three-zero by one-four-five, calculate the fastest accelera- tion and deceleration burns this ship can handle to get us to this object, and move this ship ASAP.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Admiral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson looked at the map and located what the Admiral pointed at. \"That object is just part of a Covenant ship, the aft section of a cruiser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral nodded. \"Exactly, Lieutenant. Cortana, how\u0027s the structural integrity of our ship\u0027s nose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir? The nose?\" Cortana paused, then reported, \"Intact, sir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the damage has been to the lateral—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring us into direct contact with that hunk of metal, Cortana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, sir,\" Cortana replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAscendant Justice accelerated toward the broken Covenant ship, and then slowed. The two warships touched; there was a slow grinding noise that echoed along the ship\u0027s frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Contact,\" Cortana reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect,\" Admiral Whitcomb replied. \"New course three-two-zero by two-two-zero. Flank speed. Lieutenant, charge any plasma turret we have left. Cortana, get this ship ready for full reverse power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAscendant Justice—Gettysburg turned and moved toward the Covenant carrier—pushing the broken hull of the other ship be- fore them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey accelerated on a collision course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe turrets on the Covenant carrier heated to white hot—but they held their fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight thousand kilometers to enemy ship,\" Cortana announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold this course, Cortana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six thousand kilometers, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand by,\" the Admiral ordered and gripped the railing again with his sweating hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two thousand kilometers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Full reverse power now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engines rumbled, and the hull of Ascendant Justice shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wrecked Covenant ship on their nose screeched as its mo- mentum carried it along at the faster velocity. It pulled free of Ascendant Justice ... tumbled directly toward the enemy carrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mass impact on carrier in four seconds,\" Cortana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carrier fired its plasma at the incoming mass. Flames heated the wreckage, punched though its armor and hull, and melted the alloy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mass, however, continued forward, shattered and molten— but its velocity was undiminished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt crashed into the carrier and sent it spinning to starboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carrier\u0027s hull breached along a dozen rents, and atmosphere vented and fanned the red-hot metal into gold flames.
