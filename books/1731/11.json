In his time, Greece had long passed the days of its military splendor and was utterly dominated by Rome, then at the very height of its empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnxious to remind the Romans (and Greeks too) of what the Greeks had once been, Plutarch wrote a series of short biographies about a.d. 100 in which he dealt with men in pairs, one Greek and one Roman, the two being compared and contrasted. Thus, Theseus (see page I-18), the legendary unifier of the Attic peninsula under Athens, was paired with Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome. For this reason, the book is commonly called The Parallel Lives. Plutarch\u0027s style is so pleasing that his book, with its gossipy stories about great historical figures, has remained popular ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was put into English in 1579 (from a French version) by Sir Thomas North, who did it so well that his book turned out to be one of the prose masterpieces of the Elizabethan Age. Shakespeare read it and used it as the basis for three of his plays. He paid the translation the ultimate compliment of scarcely changing its words in some cases. They made almost perfect blank verse as they stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShakespeare wrote Coriolanus about 1608 and it was the last of his three Plutarchian plays. Its subject matter was, however, the earliest in time, so I am placing it first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe action opens in 494 b.c. (according to legend), only fifteen years after the rape of Lucrece, the expulsion of the Tarquins, and the establishment of the Republic by Brutus (see page I-211). The events described in the play are therefore of extremely dubious value historically, for they take place a century before the destruction of the Roman annals by the Gallic invaders (see page I-204).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, with Plutarch\u0027s guidance, Shakespeare can draw upon a complete and interesting story, though perhaps one that is too romantic to sound completely true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... to die than to famish\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoriolanus opens in the streets of Rome, with citizens hurrying onstage in a fever of agitation, carrying weapons. Some crisis is taking place and the men are desperate. Their leader is called \"First Citizen\" in the play and he calls out to them:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are all resolved\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erather to die than to famish?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 4-5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly fifteen years before, King Tarquin had been driven out of Rome and the institution of the monarchy had been destroyed. The Roman Republic was set up and was to last for five centuries. Control was placed in the hands of the aristocracy (the \"patricians\"), with numerous checks and balances, to make sure that no one of the aristocrats could gain so much power as to make himself a king and start the round of tyranny and revolt over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat did not mean, however, that Rome had become a little corner of heaven. The patricians, now that they had power in their hands, intended to keep it there. They reserved to themselves virtually all the rights, both political and economic, and yielded very little to the common people (\"plebeians\").\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plebeians in those days were small farmers who were expected to leave their farms and fight the city\u0027s battles whenever duty called. In the years after the first founding of the Republic, duty called frequently, for the exiled king tried to regain his position and made use of neighboring tribes as allies. Rome had to fight for its life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of those wars, though, the plebeian soldier might return from battle to find his farm neglected, or even ravaged, and would be in need of capital to begin again. The city did not consider itself economically responsible for its farmers and the loans a plebeian could get from the patricians were on harsh terms; and if they were not repaid, he and his family could be sold into slavery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, when food was scarce there was nothing to prevent the patricians (who had the capital for it) from buying up the supplies and then reselling it to the plebeians at a profit, thus capitalizing on the general misfortune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be utterly inhuman to expect that the plebeians would sit still for all this. Undoubtedly, their lot had worsened under the Republic and they found it intolerable that they were expected to give their lives for the patricians while getting nothing in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe riotous citizens onstage are rebelling plebeians, then, and the First Citizen reminds them whom they are chiefly to blame for their misfortunes. He cries out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst you know, Caius Marcius\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eis chief enemy to the people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 7-8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaius Marcius is the proper name of the hero of the play. He is to gain the surname of Coriolanus under circumstances to be described later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaius Marcius came from an old patrician family. According to Plutarch (in a passage Shakespeare quotes later in the play) he was a descendant of Ancus Marcius, the fourth king of Rome. This did not mean that Caius Marcius, as the descendant of a king, was necessarily a royalist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRome\u0027s seven kings could be divided into two groups, in fact, with Ancus Marcius belonging to the older. When he became king, he established an advisory body consisting of a hundred of the older representatives of the various clans that made up the city\u0027s people. This group of older men was the \"Senate,\" so called from the Latin word for \"old men.\" These senators were called \"patricians\" from the Latin word for \"father,\" because they were, in theory, the fathers of the people. The word was then extended to all the old families from whom senators might be drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to tradition, Ancus Marcius brought in new colonists from among conquered tribes outside Rome, since the growing city could use the extra hands. These, however, were not granted the political powers of the old Romans. It was their descendants who became plebeians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAncus Marcius was not succeeded by his sons, but by a king called Tarquinius Priscus (\"Tarquin the Elder\"), who was an Etruscan from the north. (The Etruscans to the north of Rome were at that time the dominant people in Italy, and the succession of Tarquinius Priscus may be actually a sign of Etruscan overlordship of Rome-a situation softened in the Roman legends out of Roman pride.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder Tarquinius Priscus, Rome prospered materially, but the power of the king increased at the expense of the patricians. He was finally assassinated by those on the side of the old kings, but eventually the son of Tarquinius Priscus gained the throne. This was the Tarquinius Superbus who was expelled from Rome after the events outlined in The Rape of Lucrece (see page I-211).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaius Marcius, by family tradition, then, would be against the Tarquinian notion of monarchy. And he would be strongly pro-patrician and anti-plebeian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... dog to the commonalty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Second Citizen, a less extreme leader of the plebeian mob, expresses reservations against aiming at Marcius particularly, the First Citizen replies firmly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst him first:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe\u0027s a very dog to the commonalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 28-29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the key to Marcius\u0027 character. He is a \"dog\" to his enemies. He snarls and bites. Plutarch says of him: \"he was so choleric and impatient, that he would yield to no living creature, which made him churlish, uncivil, and altogether unfit for any man\u0027s conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is his tragedy: the tragedy of his personality. What he might have gained, and ought to have gamed for the better qualities within himself, he threw away by his perpetual anger and willfulness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt may have been just this which was the challenge that interested Shakespeare and made him decide to write the play. In Antony and Cleopatra (see page I-317), which he had written a year or so earlier, Shakespeare shows us a flawed hero, Mark Antony, who sacrificed honor and worldly ambition to love and to sexual passion. In Coriolanus he shows us the reverse, a hero who served only military honor and who allowed nothing to stand in his way (with one exception).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet although Antony is loaded to the breaking point with weaknesses, while Marcius is stuffed to the bursting point with virtues, we end by loving Antony and feeling a cold dislike for Coriolanus. Surely Shakespeare is far too good a playwright to have done this by accident. Might not Coriolanus be viewed as a frigid satire of the military virtues; as an example of Shakespeare\u0027s distaste for war, a distaste that shows through even the official idolatry of the English hero-king in Henry V (see page II-481)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... to please his mother.. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Second Citizen urges in Marcius\u0027 defense that he has served his country well, the First Citizen admits that much but insists it was not done for Rome. He says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... though soft-conscienced men can be content\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto say it was for his country,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe did it to please his mother...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 37-39\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is Marcius\u0027 one weakness. He loves his mother. And even that weakness is, looked at superficially, another piece of nobility. Why should not a man love his mother? Certainly the United States of today, with its Mother\u0027s Day and its semiofficial matriolatry, is no society in which to argue that to love one\u0027s mother is wrong, or even a weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it is made plain as the play progresses that the love-of-mother in Coriolanus\u0027 case is extreme. It is the clearest case of an Oedipal fixation in Shakespeare, far clearer than in the dubious case of Hamlet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the legend, Marcius\u0027 father died while he was very young and the boy was then brought up by his mother. The rearing was successful in establishing a close relationship between them. Here are Plutarch\u0027s words: \"... touching Marcius, the only thing that made him to love honor was the joy he saw his mother did take of him. For he thought nothing made him so happy and honorable, as that his mother might hear everybody praise and commend him, that she might always see him return with a crown upon his head, and that she might still embrace him with tears running down her cheeks for joy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sort of thing, we can see, is not calculated to endear him to Rome generally. Those plebeians who got only the rough side of Marcius\u0027 tongue and the harsh side of his advice on policy might not feel any necessity to be grateful for something he did only to please his mother. Let his mother reward him, not the people, and this is what the First Citizen seems to be implying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, Marcius\u0027 attitude as described by Plutarch and as adopted by Shakespeare is that of a boy, not a man. Marcius is a boy who never grew up, except physically. Emotionally he remains a boy, not only with respect to his mother but with respect to everything else. If we are to understand the play, this point must not be forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... To th\u0027Capitol\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the citizens talk, there are shouts from offstage which seem to signify the revolt is spreading. The First Citizen cries out impatiently:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy slay we prating here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo th\u0027Capitol!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 48-49\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city of Rome eventually spread out over seven hills. One of the earliest to be occupied was the Capitoline Hill. This had steep sides in some directions, which made it suitable for defense. A large temple to Jupiter was built upon it which could also serve as a last-ditch fortress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name of the hill is from a Latin word meaning \"head,\" and the legend arose that a head or skull was uncovered when the foundations of the temple were being dug. The Senate met in the Capitol fortress and so it was the center of the city\u0027s politics; in that sense the hill was the head (or most important part) of the city, and perhaps that is how the name really arose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, the plebeians would want to storm the Capitol and seize control of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorthy Menenius Agrippa.. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now a patrician steps on the scene who is not assaulted. He is a very unusual patrician; one who can speak to the people bluffly and pleasantly and make himself liked by them-the antithesis of Marcius. The newcomer is Menenius Agrippa, and the Second Citizen identifies him at once as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorthy Menenius Agrippa,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone that hath always loved the people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 52-53\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the extremist First Citizen says, rather churlishly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s one honest enough;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould all the rest were so!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 54-55\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMenenius Agrippa\u0027s role in history (even the legendary history of the times before 390 b.c., as purveyed by Livy and Plutarch) is confined to the one incident that is about to be related. Nothing else is known of him either before or after. Everything else about him in this play is Shakespeare\u0027s own invention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the actual tale told by Livy and Plutarch, the occasion is not a brawl in the street but, in a way, something more serious. The plebeians have decided to secede altogether. If Rome takes all and gives nothing, she is not a true mother and the plebeians will make one for themselves. They withdraw to a neighboring hill and prepare to found a city of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a deadly danger for the patricians, for they need plebeian hands on the farms and in the army. What\u0027s more, Rome cannot endure the founding of a neighboring city that is bound to become and remain a deadly enemy. The plebeians must be brought back and, for a wonder, the Senate tried persuasion and gentleness. They sent Menenius Agrippa, a patrician with a reputation for good humor and with no record of animosity toward the plebeians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pretty tale...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMenenius urges the citizens to desist, saying the shortage of food is the fault of the gods, not of the patricians. The First Citizen answers bitterly that the patricians have cornered the food market and now grind the faces of the poor for their own profit. We are strongly tempted to believe the First Citizen, for all he speaks in prose where Menenius orates La gentle pentameters, especially since Menenius drops the subject and decides to be more indirect. He says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/ shall tell you A pretty tale;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit may be you have heard it;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 90-91\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tale he tells is the fable of the organs of the body rebelling against the belly. The organs complain that they do all the work while the belly gets all the food. The belly answers that it is his function to digest the food and send it out to all the body. Without the belly, all the rest of the organs would weaken and die. The Senate and the patricians are then compared to the belly by Menenius. Through their careful management of the commonwealth, the patricians distribute benefits to all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fable may sound well, but surely to the plebeians of the time it must have been unconvincing, since it was precisely their complaint that the patricians were not distributing benefits to all the commonwealth but were reserving them for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlutarch says of the tale, \"These persuasions pacified the people conditionally.\" Note the word \"conditionally.\" Words alone were not enough. The people demanded a reform of the government and got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... let me use my sword.. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Shakespeare gets to these reforms, however, he wants to bring on Marcius and display him as he is. Marcius comes whirling in, acknowledges Menenius\u0027 greetings in the briefest possible way, and grates out harshly to the citizens:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s the matter, you dissentious rogues\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, nibbing the poor itch of your opinion,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake yourself scabs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 165-67\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMenenius is attended because he speaks gently. Does Marcius think he can get anywhere by scolding? It doesn\u0027t matter whether he does or not, for there is no other way he can act, and the First Citizen indicates that by his dryly ironic rejoinder:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have ever your good word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, line 167b\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcius continues to rail, denouncing them as utterly untrustworthy. He says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrust ye?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith every minute you do change a mind,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd call him noble that was now your hate,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim vile that was your garland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 182-85\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is, of course, a standard complaint against the common people; that they are fickle and unreasoning. This dates back to the Greek historians, who showed that the Athenian democracy was subject to radical changes in its policies and that Athenian politicians suffered drastic changes in fortune at the hand of the fickle public-in contrast to the steady policies of Sparta, which was certainly no democracy. (And yet who would prefer the death-in-life of Sparta to the brilliance of Athens?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman writers referred to the mobile vulgus (\"fickle multitude\") and about half a century after Shakespeare\u0027s death this was abbreviated to \"mob,\" a word now used for any dangerous and disorderly crowd of people. Had Shakespeare had the use of the word it would undoubtedly have appeared somewhere in this speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Elizabethan England, with its strong oligarchy, the view of the public by \"gentlemen\" was very much like the view of the Roman patricians. Shakespeare himself was born of a prosperous middle-class family and certainly held himself superior to those he considered plebeian. Furthermore, he was patronized by the aristocracy and liked to identify himself with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen, therefore, he had occasion to speak of the common people, he was rarely kind or sympathetic. He makes much of their dirtiness, greasi-ness, and bad breath. And he is never quite as unkind to them as in this play. This is one reason why Coriolanus is not one of Shakespeare\u0027s more popular plays in modern times. His social views embarrass mid-twentieth-century America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt may be that Shakespeare is antiplebeian in this play partly because of the conditions in England at the time the play was written. The unpopular Scottish king, James VI, was on the English throne now as James I and there was a rising clamor against him. Voices from below were beginning to be heard against James\u0027s theory of absolute monarchy and against his contention that decisions in religion were entirely in the hand of the King. Those voices were to grow louder until (a generation after Shakespeare\u0027s death) they led England into revolution and James\u0027s son to the headsman\u0027s ax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Shakespeare was writing with at least part of his attention fixed on securing the approval of the aristocratic portion of his audience, on whose approval so much depended from an economic standpoint, this was the time for harsh words against the commons. The application would be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe amazing thing, though, is that with all the animus against the commons which Shakespeare possesses, for both personal and economic reasons, he does not therefore make Marcius sympathetic. His integrity as a writer and his hatred of war forces Shakespeare to display Marcius\u0027 reaction to the commons as an overreaction, and the patrician champion loses us at the very start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis response to the cry of the people for food, to their protest that they are starving, is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould the nobility lay aside their ruth,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd let me use my sword, I\u0027d make a quarry\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith thousands of these quartered slaves, as high\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I could pick my lance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 198-201\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are acquainted, of course, with people who think the proper answer to the protesting poor is the policeman\u0027s club, the cattle prod, and the gun. Such people are difficult to like, and Marcius is one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive tribunes. ..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Marcius must grumble forth the news that the patricians have not done as he would have liked them to do. They have compromised instead and granted the plebeians a new kind of officer. Marcius describes them as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf their own choice. One\u0027s Junius Brutus-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSicinius Velutus, and-I know not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sdeath! The rabble should have first unroofed the city,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEre so prevailed with me...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 216-20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the grant of the tribunes, rather than Menenius\u0027 fable, that brought the plebeians back to Rome. The tribunes were officials drawn from the plebeian ranks and elected by the plebeians only. Their purpose was to safeguard the interests of the plebeians and to keep the patricians from passing laws they felt would be unfair to the common people. Eventually, indeed, the tribunes gained the power of stopping laws they disapproved of by merely crying out \"Veto!\" (\"I forbid!\"). Not all the power of the government could pass a law against a tribune\u0027s veto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, the institutions of the Republic developed only gradually and received their familiar form only by 367 b.c. However, later Roman historians tended to push back several of the features into the undocumented period before 390 b.c. to give them the added sanctity of extra ancient-ness. The history of the tribunate during the fifth century b.c. is quite obscure and the supposed first tribunes listed by Plutarch (he names only two out of the five and Shakespeare follows him in this) make no mark in actual history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs Junius Brutus a descendant or relative of the Lucius Junius Brutus who helped found the Republic (see page I-210)? From the name one would suppose so, yet if he were, he would be a patrician and it is of the essence that the tribunes are plebeians. Or was there some dim feeling on the part of the legendmakers that since a Junius Brutus was one of the first two consuls of the Republic, a Junius Brutus ought also to be one of the first two tribunes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the standpoint of the play, of course, it doesn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... the Volsces .\"..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, civil broils must now be buried in the face of a foreign menace.

It is the home of the Latin language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Volscians were the tribes occupying the southeastern half of Latium. Under the last kings of Rome, they along with the other Latin tribes had been part of a loose confederacy headed by Rome, and it may be that all were more or less under Etruscan control. With the expulsion of the Roman kings and the weakening of the Etruscan hold, the Latin tribes squabbled among themselves. The Volscians fought with the Romans throughout the fifth century b.c. and were in the end defeated.

They were the chief executives of the city, having replaced the office of the ousted king.

It seemed reasonable to suppose that neither consul could take any real steps toward tyranny without the other jealously stepping in to stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chief duties of the consuls were to be in charge of the armed forces of Rome and to lead the Roman armies in warfare. Cominius, as consul, was to be the army leader, and Marcius, who was not a consul, would have to be a subordinate officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe senators are clearly not at all certain that Marcius will agree to this; a commentary on his sullen spirit of self-absorption.

Brutus is simply putting his own style of shrewdness into Marcius\u0027 mind. What is much more likely is that Marcius doesn\u0027t care who commands and who does not, whom Rome praises and whom she does not.

At the time of the traditional date of this war, 493 b.c. (a year after the plebeian uprising, although Shakespeare, in the interest of speeding the action, makes it take place immediately afterward), what records we have indicate that Corioli was not a Volscian city but was in alliance with that portion of Latium which was under Roman leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is very likely that the tales of Coriolanus that were dimly remembered had to be adjusted to account for the name.

She put them off with one ruse or another, the most famous being that she wanted first to finish a shroud she was weaving for Ulysses\u0027 aged father, Laertes. Every day she wove and every night she ripped out what she had woven, keeping it up a long time before she was caught.

The Cato referred to is Marcus Porcius Cato, often called Cato the Censor (an office which he held with vigor), for he was a model of old-fashioned Roman virtue. He was completely honest and completely bound to duty, but he was cold, cruel, sour, miserly, and narrow-minded. He was heartless to his slaves and lacked any tender feelings for his wife and children. As censor, he was perfectly capable of fining a Roman patrician for kissing his own wife in the presence of their children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was perfectly proper for Plutarch to quote Cato in this connection, for he lived over three centuries after Cato. Shakespeare, however, is guilty of negligence in placing the remark in Lartius\u0027 mouth without making the necessary modification, for it now becomes an amusing anachronism. The siege of Corioli took place, according to legend, in 493 b.c., and Cato wasn\u0027t born till 243 b.c., two and a half centuries later (and didn\u0027t become censor till 184 b.c.).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaius Marcius Coriolanus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Marcius is not dead. If the tale were not a legend, magnified in the telling, even if we allow a kernel of truth, he would undoubtedly be dead. Perhaps this part of the tale of Marcius was inspired by a similar incident in the life of Alexander the Great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 326 b.c. Alexander was conducting his last major campaign in what was then called India, but in a region which is now part of Pakistan. They laid siege to a town called Multan, which is located about 175 miles southwest of Lahore, on one of the chief tributaries of the Indus. In a fever of excitement, Alexander pressed forward to the walls and managed to climb them and leap into the city without looking to see whether the army was following or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while, he was alone in the midst of enemies. One or two men managed to join him and when Alexander was struck down and seriously wounded they protected him until the army made its way into the city. Alexander survived, but it was a very near thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcius does better than that, however. No one joins him and he appears on the battlements, bleeding, but not seriously wounded. Only now does the rest of the army, in a fever of enthusiasm, storm the city and take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcius then leads part of the army to join Cominius and together they defeat the Volscians under Tullus Aufidius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the army rings with praises for Marcius, but when Titus Lartius tries to put those praises into words, Marcius says, gruffly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePray now, no more.

Marcius is a loner. His universe consists of himself alone, plus his mother. He is willing to enter Corioli alone, to fight alone against an army; the soldiers under his command are but a source of annoyance to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, then, should he want their praise? Who are they to praise him? Far from this being a true mark of modesty, it might rather be interpreted as the sign of a most confounded arrogance. Only his mother has a right to praise him and even that is not entirely acceptable to him. In the remark, further, he naively reveals the fact that he places his mother (as far as the right of praise is concerned) above Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, he is not to get away without some mark of favor. Cominius, the consul, gives him an added name, saying:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... from this time,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor what he did before Corioles, call him,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith all th\u0027applause and clamor of the host,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaius Marcius Coriolanus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene ix, lines 62-65\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a Roman custom, when one of their generals won a signal victory over some particular foreign enemy, to give him an additional name taken from the conquered place or people. Sometimes the individual was thereafter known by his new title almost exclusively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most renowned case of this in Roman history is that of Publius Cornelius Scipio. Scipio was the final conqueror of Hannibal, the Carthaginian general, the greatest and most feared enemy Rome ever had in the days of its greatness, and certainly one of the most remarkable captains in the lamentable history of warfare. The battle in which Scipio finally overcame Hannibal was fought at Zama in 202 b.c., a city in northern Africa. As a consequence, the title \"Africanus\" was added to Scipio\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coriolanus\" is formed in the same fashion.

Menenius is particularly annoyed because the tribunes call Marcius proud, and at one point he says to them:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeeting such wealsmen as you are-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cannot call you Lycurguses.. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act II, scene i, lines 54-56\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wealsmen\" are statesmen, a term Menenius uses ironically, since he considers them anything but that. And lest their denseness allow them to mistake his remark for a compliment, he specifically denies that they can be compared to Lycurgus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLycurgus, according to tradition, was a Spartan leader of the ninth century b.c. who devised the social, economic, and political system under which the Spartans lived in ancient times. The Spartan aristocracy devoted themselves to a military regime that made even the Roman system look pallid. (Actually it was developed in the seventh century b.c. and may have been attributed to the legendary Lycurgus to give it greater authority.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a narrow, constricted, miserable way of life that won the Spartans many victories and therefore gained them much praise by those who valued victories for themselves and who did not have to live in Sparta at the time.

The city of Rome, in its great days, had its water supplied through aqueducts. No other city of ancient or medieval times had such an elaborate water system. In fact, Rome had a better water system than Shakespeare\u0027s London did. Naturally, writers of both ancient and later times tended to be awed by Rome\u0027s aqueducts and, if anything, to overemphasize them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rome of Coriolanus\u0027 day was still a small town, quite rude and uncivilized.

A full-fledged riot is in progress, despite everything Menenius can do to try to calm matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tribune Sicinius manages to seize the floor and denounces Coriolanus, demanding not only his arrest, but his instant conviction of treason and his execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore lay hold of him;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear him to th\u0027rock Tarpeian,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand from thence Into destruction cast him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act III, scene i, lines 211-13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tarpeian Rock is a cliff that formed part of the Capitoline Hill (see page I-217). To explain its name a legend arose in later times that went as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first decades of Rome\u0027s existence, when it was under its founder and first king, Romulus, there was war with the Sabines, a tribe of the vicinity. The Sabines laid siege to the Capitoline Hill and their chance at victory came through Tarpeia, the daughter of the Roman commander who held sway over the defending forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sabines managed to persuade Tarpeia to open the gates for them in return for what they wore on their left arms. (Tarpeia set that condition with reference to the gold bracelets they wore there.) That night she secretly opened the gates, and the first few Sabines, as they entered, threw their shields at her, for they wore their shields on their left arms too. The Sabines, who (like most people) were willing to make use of traitors, but didn\u0027t like them, in this way kept their bargain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first criminal to be executed on the Capitoline Hill gave her name, therefore, to the later place of execution. (The story was undoubtedly made up to account for the name and is very unlikely to have even the slightest foundation in historical fact.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... his trident\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoriolanus draws his sword. He is certainly not going to be led tamely to execution, and the riot sharpens. When the plebeians are temporarily driven off, Menenius and the other patricians manage, just barely, to persuade Coriolanus to leave. He is forced away for his own safety and because there can be no peacemaking as long as he is there to fire up popular resentment with his own strident tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMenenius says of him when he is gone:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nature is too noble for the world:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would not flatter Neptune for his trident,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr Jove for\u0027s power to thunder. His heart\u0027s his mouth:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act III, scene i, lines 254-56\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJupiter (Jove) has the lightning bolt as his chief weapon. Neptune\u0027s trident (\"three teeth\") is the three-pointed spear with which he (like Triton and his shell) calmed the waves or drove them to fury. Both lightning bolt and trident were unique attributes, and if Coriolanus would not stoop to beg for them, how much less would he stoop for a mere consulship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet does Menenius really believe that this is a sign of nobility-or of stupidity? In his very next speech, he bursts out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the vengeance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he not speak \u0027em fair?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act III, scene i, lines 261-62\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the plebeians return, Menenius just barely manages to talk them out of their determination for instant execution and gains Coriolanus the chance of a trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/ muse my mother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoriolanus is at home, utterly unrepentant. He feels he has done completely right and would do it again at whatever risk. Only one thing bothers him. His mother, somehow, is not happy. Coriolanus says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/ muse my mother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes not approve me further, who was wont\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo call them [the plebeians] woolen vassals...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act III, scene ii, lines 7-9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when his mother conies in, he says to her in a child\u0027s aggrieved tone:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI talk of you:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did you wish me milder?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould you have me False to my nature?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather say I play The man I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act III, scene ii, lines 13-16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she does wish him milder. It is not because she (or Menenius for that matter) are more liberal than Coriolanus or less likely to use harsh measures. It is a matter of being more politic. First get the consulship, by any means, and then, with power, crush the plebeians. She says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a heart as little apt as yours,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut yet a brain that leads my use of anger\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo better vantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act III, scene ii, lines 29-31\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMenenius and the rest are urging him now to stand trial voluntarily, to repent his words and, in effect, crawl a little. Coriolanus is horrified at the very thought, but his mother adds her pleas, saying in one phrase exactly what is wrong with him:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are too absolute;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act III, scene ii, line 39\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that, of course, is her own fault, since she taught him to treat the world as though it consisted of nothing but gilded butterflies which he might tear apart at a mindless whim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tells him now flatly that he must treat this as a stratagem of war. He would play a part to deceive an enemy in arms and cajole a town to surrender. Let him now play a part to deceive the plebeians. (There is no thought in the mind of Volumnia or the other patricians-or probably in those of Shakespeare\u0027s audience-that such a course of action is dishonorable.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo force Coriolanus to do this, Volumnia does not scruple to pull hard at the Oedipal ties that bind him to her:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/ prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy praises made thee first a soldier, so,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo have my praise for this, perform a part\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThou hast not done before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act III, scene ii, lines 107-110\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is it. Coriolanus would not be swayed by thoughts of his own safety, by the city\u0027s danger, by his friend\u0027s reasoning, but once his mother has pled, he says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I must do\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act III, scene ii, line 110b\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, though, his resolution wavers even now. He can\u0027t go through with it. Thereupon Volumnia throws up her hands and tells him angrily to do as he pleases. At that, Coriolanus promptly gives in, out of the absolute terror of being in the position of disobeying his mother\u0027s wishes. He says, in little-boy terms:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePray, be content:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother, I am going to the marketplace;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChide me no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act III, scene ii, lines 130-32\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, after all that, when he comes to trial, he can no more hold his tongue than he can jump to the moon. It is an easy task for the tribunes to irritate him into madness again. He is convicted of treason and condemned, not to death at the Tarpeian Rock, but to lifelong exile. (This is actually supposed to have taken place in 491 b.c.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a politic commutation of sentence, for the tribunes could now say that Coriolanus had deserved death, but that they had shown mercy out of consideration for his services in war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... to pluck from them their tribunes.. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoriolanus leaves the city, after showing himself surprisingly cheerful, firm, resolute, and in good heart, cheering up his mother and his friends. (Plutarch describes the leave-taking similarly.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShakespeare has him make a significant comment, however. Coriolanus says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shall be loved when I am lacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene i, line 15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a strange optimism on his part. He does not show elsewhere in this play any such general confidence in his fellowmen. It almost sounds as though he has something specific in mind; that he has firm information that his friends intend to take action to bring him back; even unconstitutional action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat this may be so is strengthened by an odd scene that follows hard thereafter and which seems somewhat irrelevant to the action. A Roman named Nicanor and a Volscian named Adrian meet somewhere between Rome and Antium. Their speeches are ascribed merely to \"Roman\" and \"Volsce.\" They appear nowhere else in the play and the only purpose of the scene is to highlight gathering treason in Rome on the part of the patricians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Roman says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... the nobles receive so to heart\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe banishment of that worthy Coriolanus,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat they are in a ripe aptness to take all power\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom the people and to pluck from them their tribunes forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene iii, lines 21-25\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo attain this end, it may be that the patricians are even considering allying themselves with the common enemy. The Volscian had said of his own people:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... they are in a most warlike preparation,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand hope to come upon them [the Romans]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the heat of their division.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene iii, lines 17-19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Roman\u0027s response to this news of the Volscian activity is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/ am joyful to hear\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof their readiness...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene iii, lines 48-50\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy birthplace hate I ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet the next scene does not follow this up. There is a sudden break. Coriolanus has made his way to Antium. It is his intention to seek out Tullus Aufidius himself and throw himself upon his mercy. He says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy birthplace hate I, and my love\u0027s upon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis enemy town. I\u0027ll enter. If he slay me,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe does fair justice; if he give me way,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll do his country service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene iv, lines 23-26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened? According to the previous scene, it looked as though there were a conspiracy to bring Coriolanus back, even with Volscian help. Nothing further of that is mentioned in the play. Plutarch, to be sure, says that the nobles turned against Coriolanus, but only after the exiled man had joined the Volscians. As for his motive in joining the enemy, Plutarch cites merely rage and desire for revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it almost seems as though Shakespeare had something better in mind...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt often happened in the history of the Greek cities that there were internal disturbances between the social classes and that the leaders of one side or the other would be exiled. In such cases, it was common for the exiles to join a foreign enemy and fight their own city with the aid of their sympathizers within, as was the case of Alcibiades, for instance (see page I-142), some eighty years after the time of Coriolanus. (Indeed, Plutarch gives his biographies of Coriolanus and Alcibiades as a pair, showing himself aware of the similarities in their histories.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was this constant civil war and almost constant treason that helped bring down the Greeks and place them at last at the mercy of first the Macedonians and then the Romans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt never happened in Rome. There were internecine struggles within the city in plenty throughout the history of the Republic, but never in the face of an outside enemy. When the foreign armies invaded, all Romans locked arms and this was never so remarkable or admirable as when Hannibal nearly ruined the realm two and a half centuries after the time of Coriolanus. It was this which saved Rome and brought her to world empire at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would almost seem, then, as though there were a missing scene here. Perhaps there should be a scene in Rome after the meeting of the Roman and Volsce, one in which the patricians are meditating treason. The news of the Volscian invasion comes, and after some soul searching, Cominius might rise and insist that the city must come before class and that even Coriolanus must be sacrificed in the greater need of the defense of Rome. And with that the conspiracy would collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... our dastard nobles.. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoriolanus, hearing of this, is more than disappointed. It is the last straw. Everyone has deserted him. Surely it must be this which makes him turn to the Volscians. Plutarch doesn\u0027t have it this way, but Plutarch is only repeating a legend and in my opinion he could have worked it out better at this point. Shakespeare seems to have started in this direction and then never wrote or dropped out the crucial scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is only that missing scene that can explain what happens next. Coriolanus makes his way, in disguise, to the house of Tullus Aufidius, who is there presiding over a feast to the Volscian nobles, and reveals himself as a suppliant. He tells Aufidius he has nothing left but his name:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cruelty and envy of the people,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePermitted by our dastard nobles, who\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave all forsook me, hath devoured the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene v, lines 78-80\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy \"dastard nobles?\" How have they \"forsook\" him? Only that missing scene would make this plain and account for the colossal bitterness of Coriolanus during the remainder of the play, against not only the plebeians, but the entire city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Coriolanus legend up to this point, by the way, bears a suspicious resemblance to the tale of Themistocles, a famous Athenian who was actually a contemporary of Coriolanus (except that Themistocles is a historical character and Coriolanus is not).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThemistocles was the moving spirit behind the Athenian-led Greek victory over the Persians in 480 b.c. (thirteen years after the supposed capture of Corioli). After the defeat, however, when Athens was secure, Themistocles\u0027 growing pride offended the Athenians. About 472 b.c. he was exiled from the city. In exile, evidence of treason was found against him and he had to make his way to Persia itself as the only place he could be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his way there he passed through the city of a man who was his personal enemy-Admetus, King of the Molossians. (Molossia was later known as Epirus and is, in modern times, called Albania.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThemistocles came to Admetus in disguise and appealed to him as a fugitive, just as Coriolanus appealed to Aufidius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere the stories part company, however. Themistocles was accepted by Admetus and finally made his way to Persia, where he lived out the remainder of his life. He never took any actual action against Athens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoriolanus did not wish escape. He wished revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoined with Aufidius...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAufidius accepts Coriolanus\u0027 help joyfully. In fact, he offers him generalship over half the army, for what may seem to us perfectly valid reasons. It may seem odd to take the chance of turning over half his forces to someone who until recently had been the chief enemy of the Volscians, but by now Aufidius must know Coriolanus\u0027 character well. He must know that Coriolanus has in his mind room for nothing but rage. If the rage is now turned against Rome, the breach between man and city will be made permanent. Coriolanus will have to continue aiding the Volscians, placing his fighting ability and his inside knowledge of Rome at Volscian disposal. And then, when Rome is utterly defeated and wiped out, Coriolanus can be taken care of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRome, meanwhile, is in a temporary state of utter peace and the tribunes congratulate themselves at having brought things to such a happy conclusion. The bad news comes soon enough, however. A messenger dashes in saying:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is spoke freely out of many mouths,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow probable I do not know, that Marcius,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoined with Aufidius, leads a power \u0027gainst Rome,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene vi, lines 65-67\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps this is why the missing scene is missing (either taken out or never written). For the missing scene to have worked, there would have had to be news of a Volscian advance, followed by a patrician refusal to abandon the city, so that Coriolanus would have had to join the enemy in a rage. But then he would merely be joining a marching army as a hanger-on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis way, the Volscians don\u0027t move until Coriolanus joins them, and the news arrives that not only is the enemy approaching but the exiled Coriolanus is at their head. So, for the sake of this added drama, the missing scene is removed. It means that the meeting between the Roman and the Volsce is made irrelevant and Coriolanus\u0027 desertion to the Volscians and his anger against the \"dastard nobles\" left inadequately motivated. In this case, apparently, Shakespeare had his choice of two lines of development and did not manage to make a clear decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... cowardly nobles.. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe failure to make a clear decision between the two courses of development haunts this sixth scene of the fourth act. At first the patricians seem rather exultant about Coriolanus\u0027 assault. Cominius says of the Vol-scians:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey follow him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst us brats with no less confidence\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThan boys pursuing summer butterflies,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene vi, lines 93-95\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCominius is actually proud of Coriolanus\u0027 ascendancy over the Vol-scians, but note the picture of butterfly killing again. It is as though Shakespeare were reminding us that a child who is brought up as a butterfly killer may end as a city destroyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the absence of the missing scene, it is perhaps here that the patricians ought to overcome their sympathy and admiration for Coriolanus and decide that patriotism takes priority. The necessary speech does not occur (perhaps because it was originally in the lost scene and was not shifted when the scene was lost). That it may have at one time been present might be indicated by a bitter remark of Menenius to the tribunes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe loved him, but, like beasts\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene vi, lines 122-23\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it might refer to the patricians acceding to the sentence of exile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... more proudlier\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet all is not well with Coriolanus, either. He is still Coriolanus and can no more bend to the Volscians, now that he is leading them, than he could ever bend to the Romans. The Volscian officers are uneasy and even Tullus Aufidius is unhappy, saying:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bears himself more proudlier,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven to my person, than I thought he would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen first I did embrace him; yet his nature\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that\u0027s no changeling. ..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene vii, lines 8-11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet he must be used, for he is conquering Rome without even having to fight. Aufidius says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll places yield to him ere he sits down,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the nobility of Rome are his;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe senators and patricians love him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene vii, lines 28-30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, even though the patricians of Rome have agreed to resist, there remain some who cling more tightly to party than to country. And even those who are intending to resist can do so with only half a heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet can the patricians honestly think that the Volscians are willing to serve as nothing more than a bunch of errand boys for them, to help them back to power out of love and kindness? The outside power, brought in to help in an internal fight, stays (all history shows) to help itself at the expense of all. And Aufidius says, at the end of the scene, apostrophizing the absent Coriolanus (to whom he refers by the familiar first name as though the man is someone he can now consider a tool or servant):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen, Caius, Rome is thine,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThou art poor\u0027st of all; then shortly art thou mine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act IV, scene vii, lines 56-57\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patricians who decide to resist Coriolanus may be moved by abstract love of country, but they may also be moved by a realization of the danger of accepting foreign help under any circumstances. This is something the Greeks never learned (and few nations since).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... one poor grain or two ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon Rome knows the worst. It is Coriolanus\u0027 vengeful desire to burn it to the ground. Surrender will not satisfy him; only destruction will. (This is purely psychotic unless the patricians had specifically deserted Coriolanus in the scene I postulate to be missing.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCominius, the ex-consul, and Coriolanus\u0027 old general, had gone to plead and had been met coldly. Cominius had reminded Coriolanus of his friends in the city and reports that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer to me was,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not stay to pick them in a pile\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf noisome musty chaff.

Cominius says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... all hope is vain\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless his noble mother and his wife,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho (as I hear) mean to solicit him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor mercy to his country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene i, lines 70-74\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWife, mother, child...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven this faint possibility seems to wither. Menenius is urged to try his luck with Coriolanus, but he is thrust scornfully away and Coriolanus denies that anyone, even his dearest, can sway him. He says to Menenius:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWife, mother, child, I know not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy affairs Are servanted to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene ii, lines 83-84\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHas Coriolanus the strength to turn against his own mother? Perhaps, but only because he has a substitute. He remains the little boy who must have parental approval. Having brutally turned away Menenius, he turns to Aufidius and seeks approval with what might almost be a simper:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis man, Aufidius,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas my beloved in Rome; yet thou behold\u0027st.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene ii, lines 93-94\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAufidius knows his man. Gravely, he gives him what he wants and tells him he is a good boy:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou keep a constant temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene ii, line 95\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...

His young son is also there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoriolanus kneels to his mother, but holds firm, saying:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo not bid me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDismiss my soldiers, or capitulate\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain with Rome\u0027s mechanics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell me not Wherein I seem unnatural.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesire not T\u0027allay my rages and revenges with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour colder reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene iii, lines 81-86\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is determined to place his own grievances above Rome and wishes to cancel his mother\u0027s arguments even before she makes them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now Volumnia, in a speech of noble eloquence, shows that she places Rome before him and herself. Too late she tries to teach him that life is not a matter of blows and rages alone; that there are softer and nobler virtues:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink\u0027st thou it honorable for a noble man\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill [always] to remember wrongs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene iii, lines 154-55\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when Coriolanus remains obdurate, she rises to return to Rome to die and then uses the one remaining weapon at her disposal, and the most terrible of all:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome, let us go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis fellow had a Volscian to his mother;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wife is in Corioles, and his child\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am hushed until our city be a-fire,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I\u0027ll speak a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene iii, lines 177-82\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a terrible understatement, she makes it clear that when the city is burning, she will call down a dying mother\u0027s curse upon her son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO my mother, mother...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd before this Coriolanus cannot stand. He collapses utterly and cries out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO my mother, mother! O!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have won a happy victory to Rome;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, for your son-believe it, O, believe it!-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost dangerously you have with him prevailed,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf not most mortal to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene iii, lines 185-89\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns away; he will not fight further against Rome; and he asks Au-fidius to make peace. Aufidius is willing to do so. With Coriolanus not in the fight, Rome will be difficult to take. It would be better to make the peace, use the results against Coriolanus, and perhaps fight Rome another time when Coriolanus is not present either to help or to hinder. So much we can assume. Aufidius actually says, in an aside, that he is glad at this development since it will help him ruin Coriolanus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... made for Alexander\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Rome Menenius is gloomy. He tells an anxious Sicinius that he doesn\u0027t think Volumnia will prevail; after all, he himself did not. He describes Coriolanus in the most forbidding terms as nothing but a war machine:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sits in his state\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas a thing made for Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene iv, lines 22-23\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is, in other words, as immobile, as aloof, as untouched by humanity as a statue of Alexander the Great. This is an anachronism, for Alexander lived nearly a century and a half after Coriolanus and died in 323 b.c.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut almost at that moment comes the news that Coriolanus has given in and that the army is gone. Rome goes mad with joy and flocks to the gates to greet Volumnia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... thou boy of tears\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Volscian army is back in Corioles now and Aufidius is ready to strike and rid himself of the incubus he had earlier accepted; an incubus that would have been worth its cost if it had brought them the destruction of Rome. But it had not, for, as Aufidius says bitterly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... at his nurse\u0027s tears\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whined and roared away your victory;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene vi, lines 97-98\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoriolanus, stupefied, calk on Mars, the god of war, and Aufidius says, with contempt:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eName not the god, thou boy of tears!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene vi, line 101\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, Coriolanus has been openly called what he is. He is a boy; a tearful, butterfly-killing mamma\u0027s boy who never grew up except in muscles; who did all his warlike deeds so that his mother might clap her hands over him; and who broke up at last when his mother said \"Bad boy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoriolanus cannot accept Aufidius\u0027 sneer because in his heart he knows it is true, and he dare not let himself know it consciously. He keeps repeating that word, shouting:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boy!\" False hound!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have writ your annals true, \u0027tis there,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, like an eagle in a dovecote,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI Fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone I did it. \"Boy\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene vi, lines 113-17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis last boast is of his feat at Corioli in entering the city and fighting alone. At the end as at the beginning he is alone in the universe, he with his mother. Is that being a boy, he asks? Of course it is. A foolish act of boyish braggadocio is no less foolish because it succeeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd once again, Coriolanus\u0027 rage and tactlessness draws down anger upon himself. He is killed by numerous swords that have been prepared for the purpose by Aufidius himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Volscian nobles are taken aback. They regret the sudden killing without trial, but one says of Coriolanus:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis own impatience\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTakes from Aufidius a great part of blame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s make the best of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act V, scene vi, lines 145-47\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is at this point of the climax of self-ruin that Shakespeare ends the tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlutarch tells a little more. Coriolanus is honorably buried and the city of Rome pays homage to the mother, if not the son, by allowing her to mourn for him the full period of ten months that was then customary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at some time, in a future battle, Tullus Aufidius died in arms against Rome. Roman power grew steadily and Volscian power declined, and in the end it was Rome, Rome, Rome, over all Latium, all Italy, all the Mediterranean world. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/asimov-s-guide-to-shakespeare/page-11.html","bookId":1731,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:00 AM"}
