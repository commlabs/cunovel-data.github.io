He peered up through his lashes. “This is an absolutely amazing gift, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” I clasped my hands together, pleased. “I hoped you’d like it. I mean, I know not playing soccer sucks and I hope this doesn’t make you sad going to the game and you don’t have to take me—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam claimed my mouth like a man half-starved. There was nothing slow about the kiss; it was a whole different level of seduction. “Of course I’m taking you. The gift is perfect,” he said, nipping at my lower lip in a way that caused heat to sweep over me, leaving me needy. “You’re perfect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn insidious voice crept in. If he only knew how far from perfect I really me. I pushed that thought away, letting myself fall into his kiss. That wasn’t hard. Not when he drank from me as if he’d been deprived of the act for far too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands dropped to my hips and he pulled me to him. Against my belly, I felt his arousal. Cam was a… sexual man, so it came as no surprise he was that hard that quickly, but it always amazed me how badly he did want me but never pushed for what I knew he’d be oh-so down for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his grip on my hips tightened, I looped my arms around his neck. We seemed to be on some unconscious agreement, because he lifted me as I wrapped my legs around his waist. I moaned as he pressed against me and his tongue swept across mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started walking, and my blood thundered in my veins. I knew where he was heading and excitement and nervousness warred inside me. He laid me on the bed and I leaned back, down the center. Pausing long enough to tug his sweater off over his head, he then placed his hands on either side of my head. The power and strength in his arms and body was overwhelming but not frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching up, I traced my finger over the flames surrounding the sun on the left side of his chest. “I love this tattoo,” I admitted. “Why did you get it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half-grin appeared. “You really want to know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s pretty lame.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed the sun around his pec. “I’ll be the judge of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got it after the fight.” Cam shifted so his knees were against my outer thighs and slid his hands under my shirt. I lifted up, helping him take it off. I have no clue where it ended up. He sort of just tossed it behind him. “I was kind of messed up for a while. Couldn’t go back to school, was stuck in my home, and I’d done that to myself. I was worried that there had been something wrong with me to lose it like I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands fell to my sides as he placed one of his on my bare stomach. The tips of his fingers reached the underwire of my bra and the front closure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was depressed,” he admitted. His hair tumbled forward, falling over his forehead as he placed his other hand beside my head. “I was pissed off at myself and the world and all that bullshit.” Pausing, he ran his hand down my belly and then back up, causing me to wiggle. That slight smile was back. “I think I drank just about every liquor my dad had in his bar over the course of a couple of weeks. I knew my parents were worried, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam trailed off as he lowered his head, kissing the space between my breasts. I sucked in a sharp breath and he did it again. “Jase came to visit me often. So did Ollie. I probably would’ve lost my fucking mind without them. May I?” He looked up, eyes filled with intent, his fingers on the clasp of my bra.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart jumped. This was a first for us. Mouth dry, I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” he said, and I thought that was a strange thing to be thankful for. His gaze lowered again, and my breath caught. He unhooked the delicate clasp, but didn’t part the cups. “It was something Jase had said to me while I was drunk off my ass. Don’t know why, but it stuck with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drew in a ragged breath as he trailed a finger down the center of my chest. “What did… what did he say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam glanced up through thick lashes. “He said something like things can’t be that bad if the sun is out and shining. Like I said, that stuck with me. Maybe because it’s the truth. As long as the sun’s shining, shit can’t be that bad. So that’s why I got a tattoo of the sun. Sort of a reminder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not lame,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm…” He plucked up the edge of my bra and gently pushed it to the side and then repeated the same motion on the other cup. Cool air teased the tips of my already hard breasts. I was completely bare for him from the waist up. “God, you’re beautiful, Avery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I said thank you, but I wasn’t sure if the words were coherent or not. He ran his hands over my breasts and my back arched off the bed at the contact of his flesh against mine. He said something too low for me to understand as he smoothed his thumb over my nipple. Beside my head, his arm flexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam looked up, meeting my gaze as he lowered his hand to the button on my jeans. There was a question in his eyes, and I nodded, wanting to know what he was going to do more than I was afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tugged my jeans off, then my socks. He commented on the skull and bones design, but the pounding in my body made it hard to pay attention. He then slid the bra off completely and when he had me just in my panties, his slow perusal of my body was like stepping out in the flaming August sun of Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur lips touched as he eased his weight onto his side. The kisses were slow and deep as his hand traveled over my chest. His touch was teasing and practiced as his kisses trailed over my chin, down my throat. I tensed in that second before his hot mouth closed on the tip of my breast. He’d done this before through my bra, but nothing could compare to the feeling of there being nothing between us. My blood turned to molten lava and my hips moved restlessly in tiny circles. As he sucked deep, his other hand traveled down, skimming my skin and then sliding under my panties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy toes curled as his finger brushed the nub. New, stronger sensations pulsed throughout me. My head fell back as he slowly worked his head down, his fingers following the length of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his head, his eyes boring into mine as he slipped the tip of his finger inside me. I gasped out, my fingers digging into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this okay?” he asked, voice deep and smooth like aged whiskey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing in a breath, I nodded again. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small, intimate smile tugged at his lips as pushed a little harder. My body was aflame as he started a pace, his eyes locked with mine. My entire body was shaking. The knot that formed whenever he touched me was much deeper and intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re so tight,” he murmured, and then his kiss consumed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hips were moving faster and he twisted his palm, pressing down on the sensitive numb. The feel of his bare chest rubbing against mine, his hand in my panties, his finger inside me—all of it was too much. I clenched around his hand, my thighs squeezing, and broke the kiss, crying out his name as release thundered through my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam made a deep sound as he nipped at my throat. “I love how you say my name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could barely breathe, let alone speak as he continued to move inside me, working out every last spasm. When the tremors finally subsided, he eased his hand away and I was flush all over and heady. I wanted to give him more than what I’d been doing. Nervous and excited, I pressed my hands to his chest lightly and he rolled onto his back. Taking a deep breath, I straddled him and before I lost my nerve, I slid down him and unbuttoned his jeans, tugging them down his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam caught on the moment I wrapped my fingers around him and my warm breath blew across his tip. His hands immediate fisted in my comforter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh shit,” he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at the tortured sound of his voice and then I closed my mouth over him. His entire body jerked and his back bowed. I really didn’t have a clue when it came to doing this, but I figured it didn’t take much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam enclosed one hand around mine as I took him and his other hand rested on the back of my neck with the slightest pressure, guiding my less than skilled movements. I wasn’t embarrassed or worried about doing it wrong. If his body and deep groans were any indication, I was doing enough right for him to be enjoying this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me away before his release shuddered through him, sitting up half way and capturing my mouth as he came. I loved the way his body shook, but most of all, I loved that I felt safe and secure enough to do this. Tired I broke away, easing onto my back as he did the same, his chest rising and falling sharply. “This was the best fucking Valentine’s Day ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep, throaty laugh escaped me. “I have to agree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand found mine between our bodies and squeezed. “You hungry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I smothered a yawn. “Are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea what time it was, but I felt boneless and it would take an act of God to get me out of this bed. Or chocolate. One thing I did know was that I didn’t want him to leave. I worked up the nerve to ask for what I wanted. “Stay with me? The night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam’s hand trailed over my bare shoulder. “You don’t have to ask twice.” He kissed the edge of the shoulder. “Be right back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled onto my side as he left, pulling the covers up over me. I heard water running in the bathroom and then he was back, sliding in behind me. With his arms around my waist and the length of his body pressed against mine, I smiled sleepily and thought about the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was shining all of February and through March. I spent half of spring break hanging out with Cam and Ollie at home and then the later part back at his parents’ house and we even got to hang out with Brit while she was home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found it strange that Brit didn’t seem to know what happened between Cam and his sister’s ex-boyfriend, but I didn’t bring it up. What Cam had told me had been personal and no matter my curiosity over whether or not she knew, I wasn’t going to violate that trust between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially when there’d been so many opportunities for me to open up to him. It was something that, no matter how many times I told myself I would do it, I couldn’t get the words past my tongue. The idea of confiding in Cam terrified me. It wouldn’t be easy and I really didn’t even know where to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I went out of my way to make sure my phone was never unsupervised around Cam. I was still receiving the texts and phone calls, at least two times a week, and I shied away from my email. Several times over the last two months, I almost responded to the text. Or I almost pulled up my email and responded to one of the messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like with Cam, I rather pretend it wasn’t happening than deal with it. I hated that part of me, loathed it really, because I was still running instead of facing anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs winter loosened its hold on the tiny speck of the state and the ground began to thaw, Cam was deciding on if he should pay a visit home over the mid-April weekend or hang out here and be lazy while Jacob spent lunch trying to convince Brit to accompany him to some kind of volunteer garden planting adventure. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wait-for-you-wait-for-you-1/page-44.html","bookId":2001,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM"}
