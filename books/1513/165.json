Even the surrounding ground turned even softer and muddier, turning into a marsh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the light from part of the defensive spell formation trembled under the corrosive power of the green fog, as if it was going to shatter at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is it? You actually dare to attack a division of the Ennea Ivory Ring Tower?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn enraged voice sounded out. Following which, a figure wearing black armour flew up into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill!” The black clothed figure coldly shouted, and smoke billowed from the ground, turning into a skull as it struck the green fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehehe…” The Magus in the green fog cackled. Under his command, the green fog took on the form of a scorpion as it clashed with the skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Boom!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surroundings seemed to have been struck by 10 different hurricane force winds, which then dissipated in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mighty destructive power immediately caused the division’s building to be shaven off by a layer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this the might of a Magus who has fulfilled the requirements for breaking through to the next rank?” Leylin watched the actions of the Magus in mid-air closely, a strange light in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Magus in the green mist taking control, the battle in the air became increasingly one-sided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s our turn now!” Rodent, who was half the size of a regular man, licked his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Newbie! Don’t get intimidated! If you hinder this operation, I’ll be the first to claim your life!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenom Snake threatened him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you obstruct me, you’ll definitely be the one dead!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin, who was going by the name of Blood Rogue, made a sound as he snickered. A potion exploded and formed a red membrane on his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Giant’s green fog is an extremely powerful type of area of effect spell. It can deal devastating damage to all targets within the area of effect!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old witch who was wearing the mask explained to Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be careful; although Giant has lured the strongest enemy away, the remaining enforcers won’t be easy to deal with either...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehe… Those light Magi are like little rabbits. I’ve long since wanted to rip open their chests and savour the taste of their innards…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA zombie-like dark Magus licked his lips as he turned into a gust of black wind, charging into the division’s building, whose defensive spell formation had broken down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Whoosh!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if his action signalled the start, dozens of strange colours with powerful energy waves radiating from them charged towards the division.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crap! It’s a trap, inform the team leader quickly!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light Magi who were by the entrance watched the dozens of dark Magi dashing towards them, and their expressions immediately changed. Even their voices cracked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha… Boss Giant may have some difficulty killing your leader, but it’s not a problem for him to stall for time! Even if your leader finds something wrong, it’ll be too late for him to save you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old witch laughed loudly as she tossed two silver coloured metal balls towards the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Boom!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver metal balls both exploded like grenades. After the shock waves had dissipated, a spell continuously encircled the area and the air was contorted, even to the point that the energy particles in the air were unstable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bzzt bzzt* The sound of electromagnetic interference boomed throughout the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not good! It’s an Elemental Fluctuation Bomb! They actually have something like that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light Magi’s faces were ashen as they quickly retreated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright! None of the communication spells work, and space magic is now impossible to use. Comrades enjoy this blood fest! You only have a limit of 5 minutes…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old witch waved her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spirit Explosion!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Boom!* A translucent spirit suddenly appeared in the surroundings of the light Magi and exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst the energy waves that targeted the spirit, one light Magus retreated several steps. Blood began to flow from his seven facial orifices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in the instant that he retreated, a translucent worm appeared from the contortions in the air, directly charging towards the light Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Ka-Cha!* A defensive lightning shield appeared around the light Magus’ body, protecting him within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Pu!* The lightning shield crumpled like paper in the face of the worm, shattering from just the first touch. The crystal like worm drove its way right into the Magus’ mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh…” The light Magus’ face turned purple, looking like an eggplant as he clutched at his throat and collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehe, I don’t usually have the luxury of using magic as I please and collecting souls! Same rules, all spirits collected in battles must be handed over to me. I guarantee a good price!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilver light permeated the old witch’s hands as she retrieved a crystal ball from her robes and approached the light Magus, who had lost all signs of resistance. Her lips moved non-stop as she chanted something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing her incantation, the light Magus’ eyes became blurry, and an indistinct human figure was pulled out from that Magus’ body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This old witch is really a lunatic! She’s actually collecting spirits directly from the battlefield!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin watched her work, unperturbed by her surroundings, and suddenly began to regret his initial decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was just for a moment that he shot a glance in the direction of the old witch. Immediately after, he spilled some red powder onto his two hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crimson Palm!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he chanted, a layer of crimson coloured light suffused both of Leylin’s arms. His palms turned extremely slender, and his fingernails turned razor sharp and also slightly transparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a rank 1 spell from the Book of Giant Serpent that Leylin had long since recorded into his memory through the A.I. Chip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough his rank 1 spell’s might was a little lower, with only a degree of 20 or so, with the addition of his elemental essence conversion, it was enough to deal with a normal rank 1 Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, Leylin was hiding his identity, so innate gifts and spells that were eye catching could not be used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he had already prepared another set of spells to cast in times like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Host’s palms have had a slight adjustment in strength. Strength in arms are now stronger, with an added effect of poison!] The A.I. Chip’s voice intoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the surroundings, where every Magus had found his or her own opponent, Leylin smiled as he casually picked on a light Magus who came charging at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Crash!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slender, yet extremely menacing fingers clawed through the void, and large energy waves surged through the air as if the surface of a lake had been ripped through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s body flashed as his red shadow rapidly moved around on the battlefield, leaving behind only a series of mirages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who exactly are you guys? Which organisation are you from?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opponent that Leylin chose was a middle-aged man wearing loose white robes, yet an extremely aged voice came from his larynx.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin only clawed viciously as a reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Thump!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin struck with his right hand, directly slashing a few marks onto the opposing Magus’ body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of Leylin’s Crimson Palm, the official Magus’ standard white robes were like paper, getting slashed into pieces, and leaving behind a large hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elemental Shield!” The middle-aged Magus roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown energy particles gathered unceasingly and solidified to form a thin, yellow, full-body armour, protecting his entire body. Even his head was shielded with a helmet, leaving just a pair of sparkling eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will ask again, who is behind this attack, dark Magus!” The middle aged man continuously staggered backwards, his hands stealthily reaching into his robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You talk too much!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin struck again, his crimson claws leaving a scratch on the yellow armour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s useless!” The middle aged Magus howled. Traces of brown energy particles were continuously being absorbed into the dents of the armour, quickly restoring most traces of damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Target’s innate spell has been scanned and recorded. Beginning simulation and parameter testing to find out the weakest point!]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe A.I. Chip’s voice intoned. It also projected the 3D image of a human figure wearing the yellow armour. Several points on the armour were marked red, representing the weak points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Leylin attacked, the middle-aged Magus withdrew a scroll from his robes, from which tremendous energy waves emanated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A formidable spell in a scroll? I can’t let him activate it!” Leylin’s pupils contracted as he let loose an extremely high-pitched shriek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hisssss…” This was the voice of an extremely venomous snake, and was so unpleasant to the ears that it could draw goosebumps from others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the sound waves reached the middle-aged Magus, a blank look appeared on his face, and the speed at which he was opening the scroll slowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right here!” Leylin’s footsteps moved in a bizarre manner as he rapidly increased his speed and covered a distance of over ten meters. In the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of the middle-aged Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bright red light of the Crimson Palm on his right hand shone even more vividly as he clawed at the area 3 inches above the Magus’ abdomen, which was protected by his armour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first claw! A depression the size of a fist appeared in the brown armour, and a large part of the armour fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second claw! The middle-aged Magus’ innate defensive spell was destroyed by Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! Please forgive me, the value of a Magus kept in captive is high!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was obvious that this light Magus was used to living a privileged lifestyle, and lacked the will to even fight for his own life, sinking to his knees in front of Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Leylin’s face was ice cold, like a thousand year old frost. His right hand struck again, crushing the middle-aged Magus’ head like a watermelon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Crunch!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite brain matter and scarlet blood stained Leylin’s hands. His hands seemed even more demonic and alluring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s an unexpected reward!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin picked up the Magus’ scroll, his face filled with glee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A pretty good scroll; the energy waves are extremely strong. It seems like it should be able to hold its own even amongst rank 1 spells! It should be worth quite a bit of magic crystals…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at this moment, a wretched scream caught Leylin’s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-164\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-166\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-165","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
