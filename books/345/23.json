Fifteen months ago I was in Californy, and down on my luck. Things had been goin\u0027 contrary, and I hadn\u0027t money enough to buy a square meal.

Well, I should smile. I did smile all over my face, as I sat down to the table. You\u0027d better calculate that I made my knife and fork fly.

They could not afford, now that success was in their grasp, to have it snatched away. But they discovered no suspicious movements on the part of anyone. In fact, no one suspected that they had \"struck it rich.\" So poor was the general opinion of their claim, that they would have found it hard to obtain a purchaser at any price.
