{"id":12415,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"Jack had no great confidence that Mrs. Cleaver would stand by him unless he were right there to assert his supremacy; she meant well, but she was as weak as water. Therefore he took care to be on hand early at her house next morning, and was prepared to hang around all day if necessary listening for the telephone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By great good luck the call came while he was in the room with her, so that she had no opportunity to betray him, even if she were disposed to do so. By the instant change in her when she heard the voice over the wire, Jack knew that it was he whom they were expecting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In dumb play Jack ordered her to hold the receiver an inch from her ear. Then by bringing his head close to hers he was able to hear practically all the man said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good morning. Is there anything you want to tell me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack thrilled a little hearing the veritable voice of his adversary. It was the nearest he had yet come to him. A familiar quality in the sound tantalized him. But he could not place it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Cleaver. Her breathlessness seemed quite natural. \"I\u0027m so glad you called up. I can\u0027t explain very well. There\u0027s something queer. I\u0027m afraid they may be listening at the switch down-stairs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Something in connection with our two young gentlemen?\" asked the voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, one of them is acting so strangely.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The principal one?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, the other. He seems well—suspicious. I could explain better if I saw you. Can I see you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, if you wish,\" came the calm reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me see—you\u0027ll have to come at once, because I am leaving town this afternoon. Suppose you come to the Hotel Bienvenu, and meet me in the main lobby.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Half an hour,\" Jack whispered to Mrs. Cleaver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll come just as soon as I can dress,\" she said over the \u0027phone. \"Can you give me half an hour?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well. I shall expect you in half an hour.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack\u0027s heart beat high with hope. He immediately called up police headquarters and got the Third Deputy Commissioner on the wire. After identifying himself to that individual, he asked to have a plainclothes man meet him in the bar of the Hotel Bienvenu in twenty minutes time, to make an arrest. The Deputy Commissioner said he would bring the man up himself, so there could be no possibility of missing Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To Mrs. Cleaver Jack said: \"I will go to the Bienvenu now and wait for my men. You leave here in precisely twenty-five minutes. Have your chauffeur let you out at the side door of the Bienvenu, and then walk around by the street to the front door. This will bring you past the windows of the bar, and will give me a chance to point you out to my policeman. Then I\u0027ll send him up into the lobby, and I can remain in the background. He will arrive in the lobby at the same moment with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the preliminaries passed off as Jack had planned. The Deputy Commissioner and the plainclothes man turned up in the bar of the Bienvenu at the very moment of the time appointed. They took up their post at a window, and sure enough in five minutes Mrs. Cleaver swam past their ken, regal and languid in her silver fox furs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s the woman,\" Jack said to the policeman. \"Mark her well. Now go up into the lobby. As you get there she will just be coming in the front door. Watch who approaches her. Arrest the man with whom she gets in conversation. He\u0027s supposed to be an elderly man, short, stocky, with gray hair brushed forward of his ears, gray mustache and Imperial. But he may be disguised. Arrest any man that goes up to her and engages her in conversation. Watch yourself well, for he\u0027s a desperate character.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ll wait down here,\" added the Deputy Commissioner. \"If you need help blow your whistle.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The policeman departed upstairs, and Jack ordered the Deputy Commissioner a drink. Jack thought he was perfectly cool, until he became aware of a curious little fluttering in his veins. It became increasingly difficult to sit still. When the drink was brought he forgot all about it. He could not keep his imagination within bounds. He tasted the great glory that would be his when it became known that he, single-handed, had broken up the amazing traffic in blackmail. He saw himself taking his rightful place as John Farrow Norman, and enjoying his riches with an easy mind. He saw Kate relenting at last. Meanwhile his eyes were glued to the dragging minute hand of the clock.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Something must be the matter with that clock!\" he cried. \"Oh, this is fierce! If I could only go up there and see what is going on!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Give him time,\" said the Deputy Commissioner soothingly. \"He hasn\u0027t been gone three minutes yet. Your man may be late.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In five minutes the plainclothes man was back in the bar. One look in his perplexed face told Jack that things had not gone off as he had planned. The bright bubble of his dreams burst.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s the matter?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The man shrugged. \"She wants you, the lady. Told me to bring you quick.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But the man?\" asked Jack as he followed him back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Never came. She hadn\u0027t any more than sat down when a bell-hop begun paging her. Mrs. Cleaver, he was calling. He had a letter for her. She begun to read it, and jumped up and sat down again quick. I thought she was going to faint, and hung around like. She sees me looking at her and says: \u0027Are you the policeman?\u0027 I nods, and she says: \u0027Bring Mr. Robinson quick.\u0027 That\u0027s all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They entered the lobby, and Jack saw Mrs. Cleaver sitting in one of the big chairs. The brave air with which she had sailed past the window was in eclipse. She looked limp and white. As he came to her she held out an open letter without speaking. He read:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dear Mrs. Cleaver:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So you have decided to turn against me—after spending a hundred and fifty thousand of my money. Well, that\u0027s your affair of course. I hope you know where you\u0027re going to get more. This was a clumsy trap to expect to take the old fox in. Tell the young secretary he will have to do better than this if he expects to make that great reputation he is dreaming of. Like most young men he is prone to go of at half cock. Tell him that he had better be sure that he has anything against me before he calls in the police. But give him and the Third Deputy Commissioner my regards. They are waiting in the bar.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Cordially yours,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Mr. B.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61355.html","bookId":443,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:41:13 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:41:13 AM"}
