It gathered into a billowing cloud, a thunderhead on the ground, and shapes on horses charged down it. Figures of legend. Buad of Albhain, as regal as any queen. Amaresu, holding aloft her glowing sword. Hend the Striker, dark-skinned, a hammer in one hand and a spike in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure rode through the mists at the front of the heroes. Tall and imperious, with a nose like a beak, Artur Hawkwing carried Justice, his sword, on his shoulder as he rode. Though the rest of the hundred-odd heroes followed Flawkwing, one broke off in a streak of mist, galloping away. Mat didn’t get a good look at the rider. Who had it been, and where was he going so quickly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat pulled his hat on tighter, nudging Pips forward to meet the ancient king. I suppose I’ll know which side summoned him, Mat thought, if he tries to kill me. Mat lifted the ashandarei across his saddle. Could he fight Artur Hawkwing? Light, could anyone beat one of the heroes of the Horn?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Hawkwing\", Mat called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gambler\", Hawkwing replied. \"Do take better care of what has been allotted you. Almost, I worried we would not be summoned for this fight\". Mat let out a relaxing breath. \"Bloody ashes, Hawkwing! You needn’t have drawn it out like that, you bloody goat-kisser. So you fight for us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course we fight for the Light\", Hawkwing said. \"We would never fight for the Shadow\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I was told—\" Mat began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were told wrong\", Hawkwing said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides\", Hend said, laughing. \"If the other side had been able to summon us, you’d be dead by now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did die\", Mat said, rubbing at the scar on his neck. \"Apparently that tree claimed me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the tree, Gambler\", Hawkwing said. \"Another moment, one that you cannot remember. It is fitting, as Lews Therin did save your life both times\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember him\", Amaresu snapped. \"I have seen you murmur that you fear his madness, but all the while you forget that every breath you breathe—every step you take—comes at his forbearance. Your life is a gift from the Dragon Reborn, Gambler. Twice over\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood and bloody ashes. Even dead women treated him the way Nynaeve did. Where did they learn it? Were there secret lessons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawkwing nodded toward something nearby. Rand’s banner; Dannil still held it aloft. \"We arrive here to gather at the banner. We can fight for you because of it, Gambler, and because the Dragon leads you—though he does it from afar. It is enough\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well\", Mat said, looking at the banner, \"I guess since you’re here, you can fight the battle now. I’ll pull my men back\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawkwing laughed. \"You think we hundred can fight this entire battle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’re the bloody heroes of the Horn\", Mat said. \"That’s what you do, isn’t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can be defeated\", said pretty Blaes of Matuchin, dancing her horse to the side of Hawkwing’s. Tuon couldn’t be mad if he looked a little at a hero, right? People were supposed to stare at them. \"If we are wounded in dire ways, we will have to withdraw and recover in the World of Dreams\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Shadow knows how to incapacitate us\", Hend added. \"Bind us hand and foot, and we can do nothing to aid the battle. It doesn’t matter if one is immortal when one cannot move\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can fight well\", Hawkwing said to Mat. \"And we will lend you our strength. This is not our war alone. We are just one part of it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bloody wonderful\", Mat said. That Horn was still sounding. \"Then tell me this. If I didn’t blow that thing, and the Shadow didn’t do it . . . who did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThick Trolloc nails scored Olver’s arm. He kept blowing the Horn through his tears, eyes squeezed shut, in the small cleft in the rocky outcrop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry, Mat, he thought as a dark-haired hand scrabbled for a hold on the Horn. Another grabbed him by the shoulder, nails digging deeply, making blood pulse down his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Horn was ripped from his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trolloc yanked Olver upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen dropped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver tumbled to the ground, dazed, and then jumped as the Horn fell into his lap. He grabbed it, shaking and blinking away his tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadows churned above. Grunting. What was happening? Cautiously, Olver raised his head, and found someone standing above, one foot planted on either side of him. The figure fought in a blur, facing down a dozen Trollocs at once, his staff whirling this way and that as he defended the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver caught sight of the man’s face, and his breath caught. \"Noal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoal clubbed a Trolloc arm, forcing the creature back, then glanced at Olver and smiled. Though Noal still appeared aged, the weariness was gone from his eyes, as if a great burden had been lifted from him. A white horse stood nearby, with a golden saddle and reins, the most magnificent animal that Olver had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noal, they said you died!\" Olver cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did\", Noal said, then laughed. \"The Pattern was not finished with me, son. Sound that Horn! Sound it proudly, Hornsounder!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver did so, blowing the Horn as Noal fought the Trollocs back in a small circle around Olver. Noal. Noal was one of the heroes of the Horn!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalloping horses announced others, come to rescue Olver from the Shadowspawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Olver felt a deep warmth. He had lost so many people, but one of them . . . one . . . had come back for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 40\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolfbrother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne’s captors looked at Birgitte, stunned, and Elayne took the moment to jerk her body sideways. She rolled to her knees; her pregnancy made her awkward, but she was hardly incapable. The medallion that Mellar had been holding against her slipped to the ground, and she found the glow of saidar awaiting her grasp. She filled herself with the Power, and held her belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer children stirred within. Elayne wove flows of Air, knocking her captors backward. Nearby, Elayne’s Guards, having rallied, burst through Mellar’s soldiers. A few stopped when they saw Birgitte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep fighting, you daughters and sons of goats!\" Birgitte yelled, loosing arrows at the mercenaries. \"I might be dead, but I’m still your bloody commander, and you will obey orders!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat spurred them into motion. The rising mist curled upward, fogging the battlefield. It seemed to glow faintly in the darkness. In moments, Elayne’s channeling, Birgitte’s bow, and her Guards’ work sent the remnants of Mellar’s Darkfr \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-281.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
