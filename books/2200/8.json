I\u0027d already warmed up some TrueBlood for him, and he made a face but gulped it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is the child?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hadley\u0027s son,\" I said. Eric had met Hadley when she\u0027d been going with Sophie-Anne Leclerq, the now-finally-deceased Queen of Louisiana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was married to a breather?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, before she met Sophie-Anne,\" I said. \"A very nice guy named Remy Savoy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that him I smell? Along with a big scent of fairy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-oh. \"Yes, Remy came to pick up Hunter this afternoon. I was keeping him because Remy had to go to a family funeral. He didn\u0027t think that would be a good place to take a kid.\" I didn\u0027t bring up Hunter\u0027s little problem. The fewer who knew about it, the better, and that included Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant to tell you this the other night,\" I said. \"My cousin Claude?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He asked if he could stay here for a while, because he\u0027s lonely in his house with both his sisters dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are letting a man live with you.\" Eric didn\u0027t sound angry - more like he was poised to be angry, if you know what I mean? There was just a little edge in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, he\u0027s not interested in me as a woman,\" I said, though I had a guilty flash of him walking in on me in the bathroom. \"He is all about the guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you are fully aware of how to take care of a fairy who gives you trouble,\" Eric said, after an appreciable silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d killed fairies before. I hadn\u0027t particularly wanted to be reminded of that. \"Yes,\" I said. \"And if it\u0027ll make you feel better, I\u0027ll keep a squirt gun loaded with lemon juice on my bedside table.\" Lemon juice and iron - the fairy weaknesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would make me feel better,\" Eric said. \"Is it this Claude that Heidi scented on your land? I felt you were very worried, and that\u0027s one reason I came over last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood bond was hard at work. \"She says neither of the fairies she tracked was Claude,\" I said, \"and that really worries me. But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It worries me, too.\" Eric looked down at the empty bottle of TrueBlood, then said, \"Sookie, there are things you should know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I\u0027d been about to tell him about the fresh corpse. I was sure he would have led off the discussion with the body if Heidi had mentioned it, and it seemed pretty important to me. I may have sounded a little peeved at being interrupted. Eric gave me a sharp look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I was at fault, excuse me. I should have been longing to be chock-full of information that Eric felt would help me negotiate the minefield of vampire politics. And there were nights I\u0027d have been delighted to learn more about my boyfriend\u0027s life. But tonight, after the unusual stresses and strains of Hunter care, what I\u0027d wanted was (again, excuse me) to tell him about the body-in-the-woods crisis and then have a good long screw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, Eric would be down with that program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not tonight, apparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat opposite each other at the kitchen table. I tried not to sigh out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember the summit at Rhodes, and how a sort of strip of states from south to north were invited,\" Eric began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. This didn\u0027t sound too promising. My corpse was way more urgent. Not to mention the sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once we had ventured from one side of the New World to another, and the white breathing population migrated across, too - we were the first explorers - a large group of us met to divide things up, for better governing of our own population.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were there any Native American vampires here when you came? Hey, were you on the Leif Ericson expedition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not my generation. Oddly enough, there were very few Native American vampires. And the ones that were here were different in several ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, that was pretty interesting, but I could tell Eric wasn\u0027t going to stop and fill in the blanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At that first national meeting, about three hundred years ago, there were many disagreements.\" Eric looked very, very serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really?\" Vampires arguing? I could yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he didn\u0027t appreciate my sarcasm, either. He raised blond eyebrows, as if to say, \"Can I go on and get to the point? Or are you going to give me grief?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spread my hands: \"Keep on going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Instead of dividing the country the way humans would, we included some of the north and some of the south in every division. We thought it would keep the cross-representation going. So the easternmost division, which is mostly the coastal states, is called Moshup Clan, for the Native American mythical figure, and its symbol is a whale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, maybe I looked a little glazed at that point. \"Look it up on the Internet,\" Eric said impatiently. \"Our clan - the states that met in Rhodes compose this one - is Amun, a god from the Egyptian system, and our symbol is a feather, because Amun wore a feathered headdress. Do you remember that we all wore little feather pins there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh. No. I shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it was a busy summit,\" Eric conceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat with the bombs, and the explosions, and all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To our west is Zeus, from the Roman system, and a thunderbolt is their symbol, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure. I nodded in profound agreement. Eric may have sensed that I was not exactly on board, by then. He gave me a stern look. \"Sookie, this is important. As my wife, you must know this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t even going to get into that tonight. \"Okay, go ahead,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fourth clan, the West Coast division, is called Narayana, from early Hinduism, and its symbol is an eye, because Narayana created the sun and moon from his eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of things I\u0027d like to ask, like \"Who the hell sat around and picked the stupid names?\" But when I ran my questions through my inner censor, each one sounded snarkier than the last. I said, \"But there were some vampires at the summit in Rhodes - the Amun Clan summit - that should be in Zeus, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, good! There are visitors at the summits, if they have some vested interest in a topic under discussion. Or if they are engaged in a lawsuit against someone in that division. Or if they\u0027re going to marry someone in the division whose time it is to have a summit.\" His eyes crinkled at the corners with his smile of approval. Narayana created the sun from his eyes, I thought. I smiled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" I said. \"So, how come Felipe conquered Louisiana, since we\u0027re Amun and he\u0027s ... Ah, is Nevada in Narayana or Zeus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Narayana. He took Louisiana because he wasn\u0027t as frightened of Sophie-Anne as everyone else. He planned, and executed quickly and with precision after the governing ... board ... of Narayana Clan approved his plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had to present a plan before he moved on us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the way it\u0027s done. The kings and queens of Narayana wouldn\u0027t want their territory weakened if Felipe failed and Sophie-Anne managed to take Nevada. So he had to outline his plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn\u0027t think we might want to say something about that plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not their concern. If we\u0027re weak enough to be taken, then we are fair game. Sophie-Anne was a good leader, and much respected. With her incapacitation, Felipe judged we were weak enough to attack. Stan\u0027s lieutenant in Texas has struggled these past few months since Stan was injured in Rhodes, and it\u0027s been hard for him to hold on to Texas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would they know how hurt Sophie-Anne was? How hurt Stan is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spies. We all spy on each other.\" Eric shrugged. (Big deal. Spies.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if one of the rulers in Narayana had owed some favor to Sophie-Anne and decided to tip her off to the takeover?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure some of them considered it. But with Sophie-Anne so severely wounded, I suppose they decided that the odds lay with Felipe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was appalling. \"How do you trust anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t. There are two exceptions. You, and Pam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I said. I tried to imagine feeling like that. \"That\u0027s awful, Eric.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought he\u0027d shrug that off. But instead, he regarded me soberly. \"Yes. It\u0027s not good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know who the spies in Area Five are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felicia, of course. She is weak, and it\u0027s not much of a secret that she must be in the pay of someone; probably Stan in Texas, or Freyda in Oklahoma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know Freyda.\" I\u0027d met Stan. \"Is Texas in Zeus or Amun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric beamed at me. I was his star pupil. \"Zeus,\" he said. \"But Stan had to be at the summit because he was proposing to go in with Mississippi on a resort development.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He sure paid for that,\" I said. \"If they have spies, we have spies, too, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who? I\u0027m not missing anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You met Rasul in New Orleans, I believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Rasul had been of Middle Eastern stock, and he\u0027d had quite a sense of humor. \"He survived the takeover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, because he agreed to become a spy for Victor, and therefore for Felipe. They sent him to Michigan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michigan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a very large Arab enclave there, and Rasul fits in well. He tells them he fled the takeover.\" Eric paused. \"You know, his life will be ended if you tell anyone this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, duh. I\u0027m not telling anyone any of this. For one thing, the fact that you-all named your little slices of America after gods is just ...\" I shook my head. Really something. I wasn\u0027t sure what. Proud? Stupid? Bizarre? \"For another thing, I like Rasul.\" And I thought it was pretty damn smart of him to take the chance to get out from under Victor\u0027s thumb, no matter what he\u0027d agreed to do. \"Why are you telling me all this, all of a sudden?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you need to know what\u0027s going on around you, my lover.\" Eric had never looked more serious. \"Last night, while I was working, I found myself distracted by the idea that you might suffer for your ignorance. Pam agreed. She\u0027s wanted to give you the background of our hierarchy for some weeks. But I thought the knowledge would burden you, and you had enough problems to handle. Pam reminded me that ignorance could get you killed. I value you too much to let yours continue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy initial thought was that I\u0027d really enjoyed that ignorance, and it would have been okay with me if I\u0027d retained it. Then I had to hop all over myself. Eric was really trying to include me in his life and its ins and outs. And he was trying to help me acclimatize to his world because he considered me a part of it. I tried to feel warm and fuzzy about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I said, \"Thanks.\" I tried to think of intelligent questions to ask. \"Um, okay. So the kings and queens of each state in a particular division get together to make decisions and bond - what, every two years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric was eyeing me cautiously. He could tell not all was well in Sookieville. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Unless there\u0027s some crisis that calls for an extra meeting. Each state is not a separate kingdom. For instance, there\u0027s a ruler of New York City and a ruler of the rest of the state. Florida is also divided.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" That took me aback. Until I considered. \"Oh, lots of tourists. Easy prey. High vampire population.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric nodded. \"California is in thirds - California Sacramento, California San Jose, and California Los Angeles. On the other hand, North and South Dakota have become one kingdom, since the population is so thin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting the hang of looking at things through vampire eyes. There\u0027d be more lions where the gazelles crowded around the watering hole. Fewer prey animals, fewer predators. \"How does the business of - well, of Amun, say - get conducted between those biennial meetings?\" There had to be stuff that came up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Message boards, mostly. If we have to have a face-to-face, committees of sheriffs meet, depending on the situation. If I had an argument with the vampire of another sheriff, I\u0027d call that sheriff, and if he wasn\u0027t ready to give me satisfaction, his lieutenant would meet with my lieutenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if that didn\u0027t work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d kick the dispute up the ladder, to the summit. In between meeting years, there\u0027s an informal gathering, with no ceremony or celebration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could think of a lot of questions, but they were all of the \"what if\" variety, and there wasn\u0027t any immediate need for me to know the answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okeydokey,\" I said. \"Well, that was real interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t sound interested. You sound irritated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t what I expected when I found out you were sleeping in the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you expect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I expected you\u0027d come over here because you couldn\u0027t wait an extra minute to have fabulous, mind-blowing sex with me.\" And to hell with the corpse, for the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve told you things for your own good,\" Eric said soberly. \"However, now that that\u0027s done, I am as ready as ever to have sex with you, and I can certainly make it mind-blowing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then cut to the chase, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a movement too fast for me to follow, Eric\u0027s shirt was off, and while I was admiring the view, his other clothes followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I actually get to chase you?\" he asked, his fangs already out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made it halfway to the living room before he caught me. But he carried me back to the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was great. Even though I had a niggling anxiety gnawing at me, that gnawing was successfully stifled for a very satisfying forty-five minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric liked to lie propped on his elbow, his other hand stroking my stomach. When I protested that since my stomach wasn\u0027t completely flat, this made me feel fat, he laughed heartily. \"Who wants a bag of bones?\" he said, with absolute sincerity. \"I don\u0027t want to hurt myself on the sharp edges of the woman I\u0027m bedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made me feel better than anything he\u0027d said to me in a long time. \"Did women ... Were women curvier when you were human?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t always have choices about how fat we were,\" Eric said dryly. \"In bad years, we were all skin and bones. In good years, when we could eat, we did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt abashed. \"Oh, sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a wonderful century to live in,\" Eric said. \"You can have food anytime you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you have the money to pay for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you can steal it,\" he said. \"The point is, the food is here to be had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in Africa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know people still starve in many parts of the world. But sooner or later, this prosperity will extend everywhere. It just got here first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found his optimism amazing. \"You really think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said simply. \"Braid my hair for me, would you, Sookie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got my hairbrush and an elastic band. Color me silly, but I really enjoyed doing this. Eric sat on the stool in front of my vanity table, and I threw on a robe he\u0027d given me, a beautiful peach-and-white-silk one. I began brushing Eric\u0027s long hair. After he said he didn\u0027t mind, I got some hair gel and slicked the blond strands back so there wouldn\u0027t be any loose hairs ruining the look. I took my time, making the neatest braid I could, and then I tied off the end. Without his hair floating around his face, Eric looked more severe, but just as handsome. I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this sound coming from you?\" he asked, turning from side to side to get several views of himself in the mirror. \"Are you not happy with the result?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you look great,\" I said. Only the fact that he might accuse me of false modesty kept me from saying, \"So what on earth are you doing with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I\u0027ll do your hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in me flinched. The night I\u0027d had sex for the very first time, Bill had brushed my hair until the sensuality of the movement had turned into a very different kind of sensuality. \"No, thanks,\" I said brightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized that I felt very odd, all of a sudden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric swung around to look up at me. \"What\u0027s making you so jumpy, Sookie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, what happened to Alaska and Hawaii?\" I asked at random. I still had the brush in my hand, and without meaning to, I dropped it. It clattered on the wooden floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Eric looked down at the brush, then up at my face, in some confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What section are they in? They both in Nakamura?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Narayana. No. Alaska is lumped in with the Canadians. They have their own system. Hawaii is autonomous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just not right.\" I was genuinely indignant. Then I remembered there was something very important I had to tell Eric. \"I guess Heidi reported back to you after she sniffed out my land? She told you about the body?\" My hand jerked involuntarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric was watching my every move, his eyes narrowed. \"We already talked about Debbie Pelt. If you really want me to, I\u0027ll move her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shivered all over. I wanted to tell him that the body was fresh. I\u0027d started out to do that, but somehow I was having trouble formulating my sentence. I felt so peculiar. Eric cocked his head, his eyes locked on my face. \"You\u0027re behaving very strangely, Sookie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think Alcide could tell from the smell that the corpse was Debbie?\" I asked. What was wrong with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not from the scent,\" he said. \"A body is a body. It doesn\u0027t retain the distinctive scent that identified it as a particular person, especially after this long. Are you so worried about what Alcide thinks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as much as I used to be,\" I said, babbling on. \"Hey, I heard on the radio today that one of the senators from Oklahoma came out as a Were. He said he\u0027d register with some government bureau the day they pried his fangs from his cold, dead corpse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the backlash from this will benefit vampires,\" Eric said with some satisfaction. \"Of course, we\u0027d always realized the government would want to keep track of us somehow. Now it seems that if the Weres win their fight to be free of supervision, we may be able to do the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better get dressed,\" I said. Something bad was going to happen soon, and Eric needed clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and peered at himself in the mirror one last time. \"All right,\" he said, a little surprised. He was still nude and magnificent. But at the moment, I wasn\u0027t feeling a bit lusty. I was feeling jangly, and nervous, and worried. I felt like spiders were crawling all over my skin. I didn\u0027t know what could be happening to me. I tried to speak but found I couldn\u0027t. I made my fingers move in a \"hurry up\" gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric gave me a quick, worried glance and wordlessly began searching for his clothes. He found his pants, and he pulled them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank down to the floor, my hands on both sides of my head. I thought my skull might detach from my spine. I whimpered. Eric dropped his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you tell me what\u0027s wrong?\" he asked, sinking down to the floor beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone\u0027s coming,\" I said. \"I feel so strange. Someone\u0027s coming. Almost here. Someone with your blood.\" I realized I\u0027d felt a faint, faint trace of this same oddness before, when I\u0027d confronted Bill\u0027s maker, Lorena. I hadn\u0027t had a blood bond with Bill, or at least not one anything like as binding as the one I had with Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric rose to his feet in less than the blink of an eye, and I heard him make a sound deep in his chest. His hands were in white fists. I was huddled against my bed, and he was between me and the open window. In the blink of an eye, I realized there was someone right outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Appius Livius Ocella,\" Eric said. \"It\u0027s been a hundred years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeez Louise. Eric\u0027s maker. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-in-the-family-sookie-stackhouse-10/page-8.html","bookId":2200,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:35 PM"}
