A loud splash followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They were most recalcitrant about divesting themselves of their horrid masks, but in the end my mother’s will prevailed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShurq Elalle frowned. Masks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sailors made a mess of things as the Lesser Watered, in her pain and panic, used the sorcery of her voice to command them, and it was some time before the handmaid worked her way through the howling mob. Frenzied rage had shock value, and the crew’s utter lack of the instinct for self-preservation made things rather frantic for a few moments, but there was nothing tactical in their efforts to bring her down. When at last the handmaid stepped over a sprawl of bleeding bodies and approached the Inquisitor, she was breathing hard and sweat stung her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman facing her cradled a broken arm, stood hunched over a dislocated shoulder, and glared across at the handmaid. ‘What manner of demon are you?’ she demanded in a ragged hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For an answer to that,’ the handmaid replied with a half-smile, ‘best look elsewhere.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Inquisitor scythed out one leg. The handmaid leapt high, swung down, and severed the limb just above the knee. As she came down, her other cutlass cut into the vertical hinge of the woman’s face, splitting it in two. A back-swing with the pommel of the first cutlass slammed into the side of the Inquisitor’s skull, punching through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePouring out blood, the corpse crumpled at her feet. The handmaid looked round. No movement among any of the other bodies. Just as Mother taught . She glanced down at the cutlasses in her hands, and then let them fall with a clatter. Pieces of shit . She went looking for her knives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHood returned to the deck once they were under way. The once-god of death looked back, frowned at the burning ship in their wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Would’ve stopped her firing it,’ Shurq Elalle muttered, following the Jaghut’s gaze, ‘if I’d had the chance.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh? Why is that, Captain?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, that column of smoke can be seen from a long way off.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed.’ And Hood turned to her then, and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I must leave you now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala grunted. ‘I knew you weren’t my friend.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I assure you,’ Draconus said, ‘that I am, Ublala Pung. But events have occurred that now force my hand. As for you, a different destiny awaits.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I hate destiny.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you understand the meaning of the word?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala looked across at Ralata and scowled. ‘Of course I do. It’s the place where you end up. Everyone knows that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In a manner of speaking, perhaps. I fear you have mistaken it for “destination”. Ublala, destiny is the fate you find for yourself. Many hold to the belief that it is preordained, as if the future was already decided and there is nothing you can do to escape it. I do not. Each of us is free to decide.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then I’m going with you. My wife can go somewhere else. She keeps talking about babies but I don’t want babies – they get in the way of having fun, and people who end up having them spend all day talking about how great it is, but they look miserable even when they’re smiling. Or worse, there’re those ones who think their baby is the God of Genius reborn and even its poo smells like flowers, and all they do is talk about them for ever and ever and it’s so boring I want to run away, or break their necks, or drown them all in the slop bucket.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A rather uncharitable view, Ublala.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t give nothing for free, that’s for sure. Whole people disappear when a baby arrives. Poof! Where’d they go? Oh, I know, they’re crawling around making baby noises. It makes me sick.’ He ducked the rock Ralata threw at him and continued, ‘So I’m going with you and if you were a real friend you’d take me because if I make a baby my life is over. Over!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can you fly, Ublala?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s not fair!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nevertheless, and no, I will not carry you. Now, listen to me. We have gone as far west as needed – now you must strike northward.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDraconus glanced away, eyes narrowing, and then he sighed and said, ‘Your innocence is a gift, Ublala Pung. A rare gift. It must endure. It must be protected, but that I can no longer do. Walk northward, that is all I ask.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where am I going?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I cannot say for certain,’ Draconus admitted. ‘Nothing is certain, especially now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Will you come back?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-270.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
