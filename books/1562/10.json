You blackmailed Theo Crowe?\" She was pacing her kitchen. Tuck sat at the counter, wearing a gold oxford-cloth shirt that complemented the bat on his head while accentuating the sea blue of his eyes. The bat, for once, wasn\u0027t wearing sunglasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. It was only sort of implied. He\u0027d figured out that I\u0027d been in your ex-husband\u0027s truck.

Like us.\" He flashed what Lena thought was supposed to be a charming grin, which was somewhat defused by his trying to untangle one of Roberto\u0027s wing claws from his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena turned from him and leaned against the counter in front of the dishwasher, hoping to steel herself for what she had to do. Unfortunately Tuck had just run a load of dishes and the steam from the vent in front was streaming through her thin skirt and making her feel inappropriately moist for righteous indignation. She spun around with resolve and allowed the dishwasher to steam her backside as she made her pronouncement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Tucker, you are a very attractive man...\" She took a deep breath on the pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way.

The bat, now on his shoulder, nodded as well. Lena had to look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your bat is freaking me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, you should have been around when he used to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out!

Roberto the fruit bat hung his head. Tucker Case looked at the fruit bat, who, in turn, looked at Lena, as if to say, Well, I hope you \u0027re happy, you broke his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get my stuff,\" Tuck said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena was crying, and she didn\u0027t want to be crying, but she was. She watched Tuck pick up his things around the house and stuff them into a flight bag, wondering how he had spread so much crap around her house in only two days. Men, they were always marking territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused at the door and looked back. \"I\u0027m not going to go to the authorities. I\u0027m just going to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena rubbed her forehead as if she had a headache but mainly to cover her tears. \"Okay, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going, then...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good-bye, Tucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t have anyone to sex up under the Christmas tree...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena looked up. \"Jeez, Tuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I\u0027m going now.\" And he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena Marquez went into her bedroom to call her friend Molly. Maybe crying over the phone to a girlfriend would bring a sense of normalcy back into her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSour Nerds? Cinnamon Geeks? Or Gummy Boogers? Sam Applebaum\u0027s mom was picking out a \u0026amp;laquo;nice\u0026amp;raquo; reasonably priced Cabernet, and Sam was allowed one item of candy from the rack at Brine\u0027s Bait, Tackle, and Fine Wines. Of course the Boogers would last the longest, but they were all mundane green-apple finish, while the Nerds proffered a fruity variety and an impudent little top note of tang. Cinnamon Geeks had a rich nose and a bit of a bite up front, but their tiny certified-public-accountant shape betrayed their bourgeois origins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam was learning wine words. He was seven and he very much enjoyed unnerving adults with his wine-word vocabulary. Hanukkah had just ended and there had been a lot of dinners at Sam\u0027s house over the last week, with a lot of wine talk, and Sam had joyfully freaked out a whole table of his relatives by pronouncing after the blessing that the Manischewitz blackberry (the only wine he was allowed to taste) was a \"tannacious little cunt of a red, but not without a certain buttery geranium charm.\" (He finished dinner in his room over that one\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but it was tannacious. Philistines.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are one of the Chosen?\" said a voice up and to the right of Sam. \"I destroyed the Canaanites so your people would have a homeland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up and saw a man with long blond hair wearing a long black duster. A jolt went through Sam like he\u0027d just licked a battery. This was the guy that had scared his friend Josh so badly. He looked around and saw his mom was in the back of the store with Mr. Masterson, the owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get these with this?\" asked the man. He had three candy bars in one hand, and a small silver coin about the size of a dime in the other. The coin looked very old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a foreign coin. I don\u0027t think they take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man nodded thoughtfully and looked very sad at the news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Nestle\u0027s Crunch is a fine choice,\" said Sam, trying to buy time, and keep the guy from going off on him. \"A bit naive, but an undergrowth of ambergris and walnut gives it legs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam looked around for his mom again. She was still talking wine with Mr. Masterson, flirting about it\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Sam could be cut up in pieces and put away in freezer bags and she wouldn\u0027t notice. Maybe he could get the guy to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, they aren\u0027t looking. Why don\u0027t you just take them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" said the blond man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because no one has told me to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no. This guy looked like a grown-up, but actually he had the mind of a dumb little kid inside. Like that guy in Sling Blade, or the president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll tell you to, okay?\" Sam said. \"Go ahead. Take them. You\u0027d better get going, though. It\u0027s going to rain.\" Sam couldn\u0027t remember ever talking to an adult like this before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond man looked at his candy bars, then at Sam. \"Thank you. Peace on Earth, goodwill toward men. Merry Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Jewish, remember? We don\u0027t celebrate Christmas. We celebrate Hanukkah, the miracle of the lights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that wasn\u0027t a miracle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I remember. Someone snuck in and put more oil in the lamp. But I will grant a Christmas miracle tomorrow. I must go.\" With that, the blond man backed away, hugging his candy bars to his chest. \"Shalom, child.\" And in an instant he was just gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great!\" Sam said. \"Just great. Throw that in my face!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendra\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the Warrior Babe of the Outland, combat mistress of the hot-oil arena, slayer of monsters, menace to mutants, scourge of the sand pirates, sworn protector of the cud-beast herdsmen of Lan, and intramural Blood Champion of the Termite People (mounds seven through twelve inclusive)\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;enjoyed cheese. So it came to pass, on that twenty-third of December, with her noodles wet and congealing in the colander, that she did raise her well-muscled arm to the sky and call the wrath of all the Furies down upon her higher power, Nigoth the Worm God, for allowing her to leave the mozzarella at the Thrifty-Mart checkout counter. But the gods do not concern themselves in the affairs of lasagna, so the sky did not explode with vengeful fire (or at least not that she could see from the kitchen window) to incinerate the mingy god who would dare desert her in her most dire hour of cheese. What happened was nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Curse be unto yon, Nigoth! Would that my blade was not broken, I would track you to the ends of the Outland and sever your thousand and one eyestalks, just to make sure I got your favorite. Then I would feed them raw to the most heinous\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Helloo,\" Molly sang sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Molly?\" Lena said. \"You sound out of breath. Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quick, think of something,\" said the Narrator, \"Don\u0027t tell her what you were doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Narrator had been with Molly almost constantly for the last two days, mostly an irritation, except that he had remembered how much oregano and thyme to use in the red sauce. Nevertheless, she knew that he was a sign she needed to get back on her meds ASAP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah, I\u0027m fine, Lena. Just buffing the muffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know, gray afternoon, storm coming in, Theo\u0027s a mutant\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I thought I\u0027d cheer myself up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence on the line, and Molly wondered if she\u0027d sounded convincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Completely convincing,\" said the Narrator. \"If I wasn\u0027t here, I\u0027d swear you were still doing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not here!\" Molly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon?\" said Lena. \"Molly, I can call back if this is a bad time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, no, no.

How\u0027s it going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I forgot the mozzarella. Paid for it, then left it at the check stand.\" She looked at the three cartons of ricotta sitting on the counter, mocking her. Soft cheeses could be so smug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go pick it up and bring it over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Molly felt a jolt of adrenaline at the thought that she\u0027d have to push through a long girlfriend session with Lena. Things were getting so blurry between Pine Cove and the Outland. \"I mean, it\u0027s okay. I can do it. I enjoy cheese\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;shopping for cheese.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly heard a sniffle on the other end of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mol, I really need to help you with the goddamn lasagna, okay? Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she sounds as nutty as you are,\" said the Narrator. Molly swatted at the air to shut him up\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;did a finger-to-lip emphatic rocking shush mime. \"She\u0027s a crisis junkie if I ever saw one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to talk to someone,\" Lena said with a sniff. \"I broke up with Tucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m so sorry, Lena.

You\u0027re supposed to be my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly nodded at the phone, then realized that Lena couldn\u0027t hear her. True, she wasn\u0027t being a very good friend. After all, she was sworn protector of the cud-beast herdsmen of Lan, as well as a member of the Screen Actors Guild, it was her duty to pretend she cared about her friend\u0027s problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring the cheese,\" she said. \"We\u0027ll be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me. Bring the cheese, Lena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo Crowe showed up at Brine\u0027s Bait, Tackle, and Fine Wines just in time to miss everything. Robert Masterson, the owner of Brine\u0027s, had called him as soon as he\u0027d seen the mysterious blond man talking to Sam Applebaum, and Theo had rushed right over, only to find that there was nothing to find. The blond guy hadn\u0027t hurt or threatened Sam, and the boy seemed fine, except that he kept babbling about changing his religion and becoming a Rastafarian like his cousin Preston who lived on Maui. Theo realized midway through the interview that he was not the guy to enumerate the reasons why one should not spend his life smoking dope and surfing like Sam\u0027s cousin Preston because he: (A) had never learned to surf, and (B) didn\u0027t have the foggiest idea how Rastafarianism worked, and (C) would eventually have to use the argument: And look at what a complete loser I am\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;you don\u0027t want that for yourself, do you, Sam? He left the scene feeling even more useless than he had after the verbal bitch-slapping he\u0027d taken from the pilot at Lena Marquez\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Theo pulled into his driveway at lunchtime, hoping he might be able to patch things up with Molly and get some sympathy and a sandwich, he saw Lena\u0027s truck parked in front of the cabin and his heart sank. He debated shuffling over to the commercial pot patch and smoking a sticky bud before going in, but that sounded an awful lot like the behavior of an addict, and he was simply on a little slide from grace, not a blowout. Still, he came through the door humbled, not sure at all how he was going to handle Lena, who might be a murderer, let alone Molly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Traitor!\" Molly said from over a pan of noodles she was layering into a pan with sauce, meat, and cheese. She had sauce on her hands up to her elbows and looked like she\u0027d been engaged in some very messy surgery. The back door out of the kitchen had slammed shut as he came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Lena?\" Theo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She went out the back. Why, are you afraid she\u0027ll reveal your secret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo shrugged and approached his wife, his arms out to the side in a \"gimme a break\" gesture. Why was it that when she was angry her teeth looked really sharp? He never noticed that any other time. \"Mol, I was just doing it so I could get you something for Christmas\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I didn\u0027t mean to\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t care about that\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;you\u0027re investigating Lena. My friend Lena. You just went to her house like she\u0027s a criminal or something. It\u0027s the radiation, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s evidence, Molly. And it\u0027s not that I got high. I found fruit-bat hairs in Dale\u0027s truck and her boyfriend has a fruit bat. And the little Barker kid said\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\" Theo heard a car start up outside. \"I should talk to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lena wouldn\u0027t hurt anyone.

It sort of looked like she was shaking a living creature, but then, he was still a little buzzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Molly, what are you talking about, \u0027my mutant self\u0027? Are you taking your meds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How dare you accuse me of being crazy. That\u0027s worse than if you asked me if it was my time of the month, which it isn\u0027t, by the way. But I can\u0027t believe that you\u0027d imply that I need to be medicated. You mutant bastard!\" She flung the noodle at him and he ducked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do need to be medicated, you crazy bitch!\" Theo didn\u0027t deal well with violence, even in the form of soggy semolina, but after the initial outburst, he immediately lost the will to fight. \"I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t know what I was thinking. Let\u0027s just\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine!\" Molly said. She wiped her hands on a dish towel, then tossed it at him. In dodging it, he felt like he was moving in blurred bullet time in the Matrix, but in truth he was just a tall guy who was a little baked and the towel would have missed him anyway. Molly stomped through the little house, into their bedroom, and dropped to the floor on the far side of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Molly, you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came up holding a package the size of a shoe box wrapped in Christmas paper with a few dust bunnies clinging to it. She held it out to him. \"Here. Take it and go. I don\u0027t want to see you, traitor. Go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo was stunned. Was she leaving him? Asking him to leave her? How had this gone so wrong so fast?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to go. I\u0027m having a really bad day, Molly. I came home hoping to find a little sympathy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Okay. Here you go. Aw, poor stoned Theo, I\u0027m so sorry that you have to investigate my best friend the day before Christmas Eve when you could be out playing in an illegal pot patch that looks like the jungle plateau of the gibbon people.\" She held out his present and he took it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell was she talking about? \"So it is about the victory garden?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open it,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t say a word more. She put a hand on her hip and fixed him with that \"I am so going to kick your ass or fuck your brains out\" look that excited and terrified him, as he wasn\u0027t always sure which way she would go with it, only that she was going to get satisfaction one way or the other and he was going to be sore the next day because of it. It was a Warrior Babe look, and he realized fully, then, that she was having an episode. She probably really was off her meds. This had to be handled just right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe backed away a few steps and tore the paper off the package. Inside was a white box with the silver seal of a very exclusive local glassblower, and inside that, wrapped in blue tissue, was the most beautiful bong he\u0027d ever seen. It was like something out of the Art Nouveau era, only fashioned from modern materials, blue-green dichromatic glass with ornate silver branches running through it that gave it the appearance of walking through a forest as he turned it in his hand. The bowl and handle, which fit his hand perfectly, appeared to be cast of solid silver with the same organic tree-branch design seeming to leap right out of the glass. This had to have been made just for him, with his tastes in mind. He felt himself tearing up and blinked back the tears. \"It\u0027s beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" Molly said. \"So you can see it\u0027s not your garden that bothers me. It\u0027s just you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Molly, I only want to talk to Lena. Her boyfriend threatened to blackmail me. I was only growing\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it and go,\" Molly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, you need to call Dr. Val, maybe see if she\u0027ll see you\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out, goddammit. You don\u0027t tell me to see the shrink. Get out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no use. Not now, anyway. Her voice had hit the Warrior Babe frenzy pitch\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he recognized it from the times he\u0027d taken her to the county hospital before they\u0027d become involved as lovers. When she\u0027d just been the town\u0027s crazy lady. She\u0027d lose it if he pressed her any more. \"Fine. I\u0027ll go. But I\u0027ll call you, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just gave him that look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Christmas...\" One last try maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Your present is on the top shelf in the closet. Merry Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dug some underwear and socks out of the drawer, grabbed a few shirts out of the closet, and headed out the front door. She slammed it hard enough behind him to break one of the windows. The glass hitting the sidewalk sounded like a summary of his whole life. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stupidest-angel-pine-cove-3/page-10.html","bookId":1562,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:37:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:37:37 PM"}
