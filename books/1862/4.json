It was just too ridiculous. Besides, she had a lot to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo-school started in just over two weeks. At the beginning of June she had been sure summer would last\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforever, sure that she would neversay, \"Wow, this summer has gone by so fast.\" And now here she stood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein mid-August, and she was saying, \"Wow, it\u0027s gone by so fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need clothes, Mary-Lynnette thought. And a new backpack, and notebooks, and some of those little\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epurple felt-tip pens. And I need to make Mark get all those things, too, because he won\u0027t do it by himself\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand Claudine will never make him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudine was their stepmother. She was Belgian and very pretty, with curly dark hair and sparklingdark eyes. She was only ten years older than MaryLynnette, and she looked even younger. She\u0027d been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe family\u0027s housecleaning helper when Mary Lynnette\u0027s mom first got sick five years ago. MaryLynnette\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eliked her, but she was hopeless as a substitute mother, and Mary-Lynnette usually ended up taking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echarge of Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I don\u0027t have time to go over to Mrs. B.\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spent the day shopping. It wasn\u0027t until after dinner that she thought about Mrs. Burdock again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was helping to dear dishes out of the family room, where dinner was traditionally eaten in front of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe TV, when her father said, \"I heard something today about Todd Akers and Vic Kimble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those losers,\" Mark muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette said, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They had some kind of accident over on Chiloquin Road-over between Hazel Green Creek and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeavercreek.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A car accident?\" Mary-Lynnette said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this is the thing,\" her father said. \"Apparently there wasn\u0027t any damage to their car, but they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboth thought they\u0027d been in an accident. They showed up at home after midnight and said that something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad happened to them out there-but they didn\u0027tknow what. They were missing a few hours.\" He looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat Mark and Mary-Lynnette. \"How about that, guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the UFOs!\" Mark shouted immediately, dropping into discus-throwing position and wiggling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"UFOs are a crock,\" Mary-Lynnette said. \"Do youknow how far the little green men would have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto travel-and there\u0027s no suchthing as warp speed. Whydo people have to make things up when the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003euniverse is just just blazing with incredible things that are real-\"She stopped. Her family was looking at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher oddly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually Todd and Vic probably just got smashed,\" she said, and put her plate and glass in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe sink. Her father grimaced slightly. Claudine pursed her lips. Mark grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a very real and literal sense,\" he said. \"We hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as Mary-Lynnette was walking back to the family room that a thought struck her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChiloquin Road was right off Kahneta, the road her own house was on. The road Mrs. B.\u0027s house was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon.It was only two miles from Burdock Farm to Chiloquin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere couldn\u0027t be any connection. Unless the girls were burying the little green man who\u0027d abductedVic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand Todd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it bothered her. Two really strange things happening in the same night, in the same area. In a tiny,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esleepy area that never saw any kind of excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, I\u0027ll call Mrs. B. And she\u0027ll be fine, and that\u0027ll prove everything\u0027s okay, and I\u0027ll be able to laugh\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout all this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nobody answered at the Burdock house. The phone rang and rang. Nobody picked it up and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanswering machine never came on. Mary-Lynnettehung up feeling grim but oddly calm. She knew what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe had to do now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snagged Mark as he was going up the stairs. \"I need to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, if this is about your Walkman-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? It\u0027s about something we have to do tonight.\" Mary-Lynnette looked at him. \"What aboutmy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalkman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, nothing. Nothing at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette groaned but let it go. \"Listen, Ineed you to help me out. Last night I saw something weird\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen I was on the hill....\" She explained as succinctly as possible. \"And now more weird stuff with Todd\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand Vic,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark was shaking his head, looking at her in something like pity. \"Mare, Mare,\" he said kindly. \"You\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereally are crazy, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Mary-Lynnette said. \"It doesn\u0027t matter.

If I can talk to her, I\u0027ll feel better. And if I can find\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout what\u0027s buried in that garden, I\u0027ll feel a wholelotbetter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they were burying Sasquatch. That government study in the Klamaths never did find him,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark, you owe me for the Walkman. For whatever happened to the Walkman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...\" Mark sighed, then muttered resignedly.\"Okay, I owe you. But I\u0027m telling you right now,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not going to talk to those girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to talk to them. You don\u0027t evenhave to see them. There\u0027s something else I want\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyouto do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was just setting. They\u0027d walked this roada hundred times to get to Mary-Lynnette\u0027s hill-the only\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edifference tonight was that Mark was carryinga pair of pruning shears and Mary-Lynnette had pulled the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubylith filter off her flashlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t reallythink they offed the old lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Mary-Lynnette said candidly. \"I just want to put the world back where it belongs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know how you have a view of the way theworld is, but every so often you wonder, \u0027Oh,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emyGod, what if it\u0027s really different?\u0027Like, \u0027What if I\u0027m really adopted and the people I think are my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eparentsaren\u0027t my parents at all?\u0027 And if it were true, it would change everything, and for a minute you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t know what\u0027s real. Well, that\u0027s how I feel right now, and I want to get rid of it. I want my old world\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what\u0027s scary?\" Mark said. \"I think Iunderstand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time they got to Burdock Farm, it was full dark. Ahead of them, in the west, the star Arcturus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed to hang over the farmhouse, glittering faintly red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette didn\u0027t bother trying to deal withthe rickety gate. She went to the place behind the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblackberry bushes where the picket fence had fallen flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe farmhouse was like her own family\u0027s, but with lots of Victorian-style gingerbread added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryLynnette thought the spindles and scallops and fretwork gave it a whimsical air-eccentric, like Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurdock. Just now, as she was looking at one of the second-story windows, the shadow of a moving\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efigure fell on the roller blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood, Mary-Lynnette thought. At least I know somebody\u0027s home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark began hanging back as they walked down the weedy path to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said I could hide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Right. Look, why don\u0027t you take thoseshears and sort of go around back-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And look at the Sasquatch grave while I\u0027m there? Maybe do a little digging? I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Mary-Lynnette said calmly. \"Then hidesomewhere out here and hope they don\u0027t see you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen they come to the door. At least with the shears you have an excuse to be in the back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark threw her a bitter glance and she knew she\u0027dwon. As he started off, Mary-Lynnette said suddenly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark, be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark just waved a dismissive hand at her without turning around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was out of sight, Mary-Lynnette knockedon the front door. Then she rang the doorbellitwasn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea button but an actual bellpull. She could hear chimes inside, but nobody answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knocked and rang with greater authority. Every minute she kept expecting the door to open to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereveal Mrs. B., petite, gravelly-voiced, blue-haired,dressed in an old cotton housedress. But it didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappen. Nobody came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette stopped being polite and began knocking with one hand and ringing with the other. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas somewhere in the middle of this frenzy ofknocks and rings that she realized she was frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally frightened. Her world view was wobbling.Mrs. Burdock hardly ever left the house. She always\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanswered the door. And Mary-Lynnette had seenwith her own eyes that somebody was home here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why weren\u0027t they answering?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s heart was beating very hard. She had an uncomfortable falling sensation in her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should get out of here and call Sheriff Akers. It\u0027s his job to know what to do about things like this.But it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas hard to work up any feeling of confidence in Todd\u0027s father. She took her alarm and frustration out on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich opened. Suddenly. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s fist hit air and for an instant she felt sheer panic, fear of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was soft and beautifully modulated. Thegirl was just plain beautiful. What Mary-Lynnette\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehadn\u0027t been able to see from the top of her hill was that the brown hair was aglow with rich chestnut\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehighlights, the features were classically molded, the tall figure was graceful and willowy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re Rowan,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou couldn\u0027t be anything else; I\u0027ve never seen anybody who looked so much like �� tree spirit. \"Your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaunt told me about you. I\u0027m Mary-Lynnette Carter, Ilive just up Kahneta Road. You probably saw my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehouse on your way here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan looked noncommittal. She had such a sweet,grave face-,and skin that looked like white orchid\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epetals, Mary-Lynnette thought abstractedly. She said, \"So, I just wanted to welcome you to the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneighborhood, say hello, see if there\u0027s anything you need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan looked less grave; she almost smiled and her brown eyes grew warm. \"How nice of you. Really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost wish we did need something ... but actually we\u0027re fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette realized that, with the utmost civility and good manners, Rowan was winding up the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econversation. Hastily she threw a new subject into the pool. \"There are three of you girls, right? Are you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing to school here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sisters are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great. I can help show them around. I\u0027ll be a senior this year.\" Another subject, quick,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryLynnette thought. \"So, how do you like Briar Creek? It\u0027s probably quieter than you\u0027re used to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it was pretty quiet where we came from,\"Rowan said. \"But we love it here; it\u0027s such a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewonderful place. The trees, the little animals. . .\" She broke off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, those cute little animals,\" Mary-Lynnette said. Get to the point, her inner voices were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etelling her. Her tongue and the roof of her mouth felt like Velcro. Finally she blurted, \"So-so, um, how is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour aunt right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s-fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat instant\u0027s hesitation was all Mary-Lynnette needed. Her old suspicions, her old panic, surged up\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eimmediately. Making her feel bright and cold, like aknife made of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found herself saying in a confident, almost chirpy voice, \"Well, could I just talk to her for a minute?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould you mind? It\u0027s just that I have something sort of important to tellher....\" She made a move as if to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estep over the threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan kept on blocking the door. \"Oh, I\u0027m sosorry. Butwell, that\u0027s not really possible rightnow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, is it one of her headaches? I\u0027ve seen her in bed before.\" Mary-Lynnette gave a little tinkly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not a headache.\" Rowan spoke gently, deliberately. \"The truth is that she\u0027s gone for a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efew days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Rowan made a little grimace acknowledging that this was odd. \"She just decided to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etake a few days off. A little vacation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-gosh, with you girls just getting here...\" Mary-Lynnette\u0027s voice was brittle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you see, she knew we\u0027d take care of thehouse for her. That\u0027s why she waited until we\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-gosh,\" Mary-Lynnette said again. She felt aspasm in her throat. \"Where-just where did she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ego?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up north, somewhere on the coast. I\u0027m not sure of the name of the town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But . . .\" Mary-Lynnette\u0027s voice trailed off. Back off, her inner voices warned.Now was the time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto be polite, to be cautious. Pushing it meant showing this girl that Mary-Lynnette knew something was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewrong with this story. And since somethingwas wrong, thisgirl might be dangerous....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to believe that while looking at Rowan\u0027ssweet, grave face. She didn\u0027t look dangerous. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethenMary-Lynnette noticed something else. Rowan was barefoot. Her feet were as creamy-pale as the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erest ofher, but sinewy. Something about them, the way they were placed or the clean definition of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoes, made Mary-Lynnette think of those feet running. Of savage, primal speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she looked up, there was another girl walking up behind Rowan. The one with dark golden hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer skin was milky instead of blossomy, and her eyes were yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Kestrel,\" Rowan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Mary-Lynnette said. She realized she was staring. And realized, the moment after that,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat shewas scared. Everything about Kestrel made her thinkof savage, primal movement. The girl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewalked as if she were flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" Kestrel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Mary-Lynnette,\" Rowan said, her, voice still pleasant. \"She lives down the road. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecame to see Aunt Opal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really just to see if you needed anything,\" MaryLynnette interjected quickly. \"We\u0027re sort of your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eonly neighbors.\" Strategy change, she was thinking. About-face. Looking at Kestrel, she believed in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edanger. Now all she wanted was to keep these girls from guessing what she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a friend of Aunt Opal\u0027s?\" Kestrel asked silkily. Her yellow eyes swept Mary-Lynnette,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efirst up, then down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I come over sometimes, help her withthe\"-oh, God, don\u0027t say gardening-\"goats. Um, I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eguess she told you that they need to be milked everytwelve hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan\u0027s expression changed fractionally. MaryLynnette\u0027s heart gave a violent thud. Mrs. B. would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever,everleave without giving instructions aboutthe goats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course she told us,\" Rowan said smoothly, justan instant too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s palms were sweating. Kestrelhadn\u0027t taken that keen, dispassionate, unblinkinggaze off\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher for a moment. Like the proverbial birdof prey staring down the proverbial rabbit. \"Well, it\u0027sgetting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elate and I bet you guys have things to do. I should let you go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan and Kestrel looked at each other. Then theyboth looked at Mary-Lynnette, cinnamon-brown\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes and golden eyes fixed intently on her face.Mary-Lynnette had the falling feeling in her stomach again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t goyet,\" Kestrel said silkily. \"Why don\u0027tyou come inside?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-4.html","bookId":1862,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:54 PM"}
