I\u0027ve heard lots of talk from the girls at school about how dads really like having sons. Personally,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d much prefer a sister, but I guess this is just one of those things that we\u0027ll leave up to God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea where she comes up with this stuff,\" Royce whispered for Catherine\u0027s benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does this mean we\u0027re moving?\" Kelly wanted to know next, her look pensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce went tense behind Catherine. She realized this was the part Royce dreaded most. Bangor was the only Navy base Kelly had ever known, although Royce had been stationed in other Puget Sound bases. Uprooting his daughter had been Royce\u0027s primary concern about the two of them marrying. \"More than likely we\u0027ll be moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter having a good deal to say about everything else, Kelly simply nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that bother you?\" Catherine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. Lots of other kids in my school have lived all over the world. Everyone says that if you join the Navy you get shipped everywhere. I think it\u0027s our turn. Actually, when you think about it, it\u0027s time we left Bangor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know where we\u0027re going yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where do you think?\" Kelly pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hoping to be assigned to the Navy station in Bremerton, but we can\u0027t count on that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really!\" Kelly jumped off the couch and clapped her hands. \"That\u0027d be great. We could move to Catherine\u0027s apartment and Sambo could sleep with me and it\u0027d hardly be moving at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we can\u0027t count on that. Admiral Duffy\u0027s promised to see what he can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s always a chance I\u0027ll go to Pensacola, Florida.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again Kelly was on her feet clapping wildly. \"All right, Disney World here I come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart,\" Royce said, looking more than a little surprised by his daughter\u0027s reaction to the possibility of moving across the country. \"Just remember, I haven\u0027t a clue where we\u0027re headed. So we should be prepared for anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it matter where we move?\" Kelly asked with a sanguine smile. \"Catherine will be with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Royce corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly\u0027s bright blue eyes narrowed suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set her fists against her hipbones and glared across the room. \"Exactly what do you mean by that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First we have to find out where your father\u0027s going to be stationed,\" Catherine explained, loving the expressive way Kelly had of letting her feelings be known. \"Then I need to request a transfer there myself, or at least to a base close to where your dad\u0027s stationed. We still won\u0027t be able to be in the same command, but—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens if the Navy decides to send Dad one place and you another?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a distinct possibility, and one Catherine prayed they\u0027d never have to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll cross that bridge when we come to it,\" Royce assured the three of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKellv\u0027s nod was profound. \"Good thinking.\" She crossed her arms and leaned back against the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that we\u0027ve got that out of the way, there are a couple of other things we need to discuss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a fact?\" Royce said, but the look he shared with Catherine suggested that he was as much at a loss as she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly cleared her throat, and her face grew dark and serious. \"No hanky-panky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon.\" Royce was indignant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard me.\" Kelly\u0027s index finger shot out in a way that would have made teachers across America proud. \"Not until you\u0027re married at least. I\u0027m not a little kid anymore,\" Kelly informed them with a righteous tilt to her chin. \"I know what kind of stuff goes on between men and women. I watch MTV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe this is any of your concern, young lady.\" Royce was frowning, but Catherine wasn\u0027t entirely sure what was bothering him; the fact Kelly watched racy music videos, or that she was insisting on curtailing their romantic involvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t want to taint my young mind, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027m going to taint anything, it\u0027ll be your backside,\" Royce announced loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe threat was real enough for Kelly to sit on her hands to protect her posterior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the same kid who was afraid in a power outage,\" Catherine whispered to Royce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a trick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She turned off all the lights herself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Royce said, and shook his head for emphasis. \"She called you over knowing I\u0027d be back any minute, thereby forcing the two of us to deal with each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always told me it\u0027s impolite to whisper,\" Kelly said indignantly from across the room. She stood, yawned once and headed for the stairs. \"I\u0027ll be back in just a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be back?\" Royce repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I\u0027ll need to go with you when you take Catherine home. You don\u0027t honestly expect me to stay here alone, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, love?\" Catherine murmured, flexing her long nails against Royce\u0027s arms, which were wrapped securely around her waist. \"Has the cat got your tongue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll only be a minute,\" Kelly said, rushing up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means...\" Royce said, drawing Catherine back on to the thick sofa cushions. He felt solid and strong, and just the feel of him was enough to ease the terrible loneliness that had haunted her for nights on end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine raised her arms to link them around his neck. His eyes were on her. \"So much for us being bad.\" He lowered his mouth and feasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ho hum.\" Kelly coughed loudly, disrupting them a few minutes later. \"Not a good idea,\" she announced. \"There\u0027s plenty of time for that sort of thing later. Right now we\u0027ve got a wedding to think about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A flower girl,\" Royce murmured, slowly untangling his arms from around Catherine. \"I have a feeling that by the time this wedding takes place, Kelly may be in a boarding school in Switzerland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following week was impossible. That was the only way Catherine could think to define it. Knowing Royce was being transferred, but not knowing where made any planning impossible. They couldn\u0027t arrange for a wedding until several factors were figured into the equation. First and foremost they needed to know when Royce would be dispatched. The news of his new duty assignment could come at any moment, and Royce could be ordered to ship out with as little as twenty-four-hours notice and as much as six months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe restrictions upon them were just as stringent as before. As Kelly had so eloquently put it, no hanky-panky. Catherine would have paid anything just for the opportunity to \"be bad\" with Royce, but that, too, was prohibited. They\u0027d come too far to risk everything now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine was sitting at her desk when Royce strolled into the office. \"Lieutenant Commander, could I see you in my office, right away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElaine Perkins scooted back to her chair as Catherine left her office, her secretary\u0027s gaze following Royce. \"OP stoneface seems to be in a pleasant enough mood lately, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t know,\" Catherine said before she let something slip that she\u0027d soon regret. She\u0027d long suspected that her observant secretary was aware of her feelings for Royce, but it was a subject neither dared broach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you not have noticed?\" Elaine demanded. \"I actually saw Commander Nyland smiling the other day. Smiling. Not that I could see there was anything to smile about, but that\u0027s not my concern. Up until recently I assumed it would take an act of Congress to get that man to so much as grin. Lately that\u0027s all changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine didn\u0027t comment. \"Do you want me to ask him what he found so amusing? I\u0027ll tell him you\u0027re curious to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny, Catherine, very funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmused herself, Catherine walked into Royce\u0027s office and closed the door. \"You wanted to see me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel about living in Virginia?\" he asked without warning. \"I\u0027ve been assigned to Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet at Norfolk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Virginia,\" she repeated slowly. Her heart was pounding hard. \"I\u0027d love Antarctica if I could be there with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce grinned, and their eyes held each other. \"I feel the same way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much time do I have?\" She arched her brows expectantly, waiting for him to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two weeks.\" Catherine\u0027s heart sank as she lowered herself into a chair and closed her eyes. Her mind started buzzing. It wasn\u0027t possible. It simply wasn\u0027t possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it had to be! She\u0027d do whatever she must to arrange it so they could be married before he was deployed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Catherine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was on her feet again and not quite sure how she got there. She blinked once, then smiled over to Royce, confident her smile covered her entire face. \"Two weeks,\" she repeated, and nodded once, willing to accept the challenge. \"I\u0027ve got a whole lot of planning to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce looked concerned. \"I don\u0027t want to postpone the wedding.\" It went without saying that the ceremony would have to be discreet. For the two of them to marry so quickly after Royce was detached from the command would be a problem. They\u0027d discussed it at length and had agreed to fly to San Francisco for the ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine cast him a look that assured him otherwise. \"I don\u0027t want to wait, either.\" They were both well aware that it would be better for them to let several months pass. But neither found that acceptable. \"I\u0027ll contact my mother right away. She\u0027ll help with the arrangements. Personally, I doubt that I\u0027d be able to pull this off without her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can contact the whole state of California if that\u0027s what you want. Just as long as you\u0027re at the church on time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there, don\u0027t you worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, it\u0027s Catherine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart.\" Her mother\u0027s voice was elevated with pleasure. \"It\u0027s so good to hear from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s work...I mean, you\u0027re not into anything heavy, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more than usual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Catherine hesitated. She really would be asking a good deal of her mother, who was a newlywed herself, but there was no help for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good? Why\u0027s that?\" Once again her mother\u0027s voice was raised with curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I need you to do something for me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, whatever you need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need your expertise—\" She wasn\u0027t allowed to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Catherine, you\u0027re a fine lawyer, I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t need my opinion, and furthermore I don\u0027t think the Navy would take kindly to my interfering in something that has to do with the military.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in the courts, Mom.\" Catherine couldn\u0027t keep from grinning. The happiness was oozing out of her. \"Royce asked me to marry him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he\u0027d already done that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t serious then, only jealous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take it he\u0027s serious this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very serious. He arranged for a transfer before he proposed. He\u0027s been assigned to the submarine base in Virginia. I\u0027ve put in for a transfer there myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" The question came after a noticeable pause. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-woman-navy-4/page-25.html","bookId":1959,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:25 AM"}
