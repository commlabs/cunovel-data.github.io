It hasn’t been working. He’s not as strong as you, Daemon. You are different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon drew in a breath. Will was offering Daemon everything he’d wanted—his brother. There was no way he’d turn that down. And he was fighting not to show any emotion. To Will, he was expressionless, but I recognized the minute ticking in his jaw, the way his eyes flickered, and the tight line of his mouth. He was caught between excitement and the knowledge that he was creating someone who could ultimately destroy the ones he loved. And someone who would be tied to him irrevocably—and to me. If Daemon healed Will, their lives would be joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d prefer to hunt you down and break every bone in your body for what you’ve done,” Daemon said finally. “Rip your flesh off your body slowly and then feed it to you for hurting Kat. But my brother means more than vengeance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisibly shaken by his words, Will paled. “I was hoping that would be your decision.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, you have to be hurt for this to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill nodded, aiming the gun at his leg. “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon looked disappointed. “I was so hoping I was going to get to inflict the damage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I don’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened next was truly macabre. Part of me wanted to look away or cave to the pain, but I didn’t. I watched Will cock his arm back and then after a minute, he shot himself in the leg. The man didn’t make a sound. Something didn’t seem right about that other than the obvious, but then Daemon placed his hand on Will’s arm. The onyx didn’t block his healing powers. Daemon could’ve let him bleed out, but he would never get passed the onyx to get me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blacked out again, unable to really fight through the pain anymore. Coming to, I saw Will unlatching the cage door. He moved over me, healthy and whole, unlocking the chains above me. The manacles slipped off my wrists, and I almost cried just for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill’s eyes met mine. “I suggest you don’t tell your mother about this. After all, it would kill her.” He smiled, having gotten what he wanted. “Behave, Katy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was out of the cage, and out of the room. I didn’t know how much time we had left. Couldn’t be more than ten minutes. I tried to sit up, but my arms gave out. “Daemon…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here.” And he was. Carefully entering the cage and helping me out. “I’ve got you, Kitten. It’s over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe healing warmth was in his hands, fueling what strength I had left. By the time he placed me on my feet outside of the cage, I could stand alone, and I gently brushed his hands off me. After healing Will, I knew he wasn’t at full strength. And there were officers on their way, limited time to reach Dawson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m all right,” I whispered in a throaty voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking a deep sound in the back of his throat, he clutched my cheeks and placed his lips on mine. I closed my eyes, sinking into his touch. When he pulled away, both of us were gasping for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you do?” I asked, wincing at the sound of my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon pressed his forehead against mine, and I felt his half grin against my lips. “For the mutation to work, both parties have to be willing, Kitten. Remember what Matthew said? I wasn’t entirely into it, if you get my drift. And not to mention, he needed to be dying or close to it. The mutation probably won’t work. At least not to the extent he thinks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed in spite of everything, the sound rasping. “Evil genius.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You betcha,” he replied, his eyes moving over me, his fingers threading through mine. “You sure you’re okay? Your voice…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I whispered. “I’ll be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me again, soft and deep, and he took away most of the hours spent there, even though I was sure they’d linger for some time, creeping up like most dark things do. But for a moment, we weren’t in such a terrible place, there wasn’t this giant clock ticking over our heads, and I was safe in his arms. Treasured. Loved. We were together. Two halves of the same atom brought back to make one that was infinitely stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon sighed against my mouth, and then I felt his lips curve into a real smile. “Now let’s go get my brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 36\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy boots and sweater were MIA, so Daemon tugged his sweater on over my head, leaving him in a thin cotton shirt and jeans. There was nothing we could do about the shoes. I’d survive, though. Chilled feet were actually pleasant in comparison to what I’d just experienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith no time to waste, Daemon scooped me up and rushed from the warehouse. Once outside and no longer affected by the onyx, I felt the biting wind sting my cheeks as he picked up speed. Seconds later, he was buckling me into his passenger seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can do it,” I mumbled, willing my fingers around the metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated as he saw my hands tremble and then nodded. In a heartbeat, he was behind the steering wheel, turning the key. “Ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the belt clicked into place, I leaned back against the seat, out of breath. The onyx had done more than block the Source. I felt like I’d climbed Mount Everest while carrying a hundred-pound weight strapped to my back. I couldn’t imagine how Daemon was still going full throttle, especially after the admittedly half-assed healing job on Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could leave me,” I realized then. “You’d be faster…without me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s brows shot up as he eased the SUV around the Dumpsters. “I’m not leaving you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew how badly he needed to get to the office building—to Dawson. “I’ll be fine. I can stay in the car and…you can just do your zippy speed stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “Not going to happen. We have time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not going to happen, Kat.” He gunned it out of the parking lot. “I’m not leaving you alone. Not for a freaking second, okay? We have time.” He brushed the dark waves off his forehead with one hand, his jaw clenching tightly. “When I got your message about your mom and when you didn’t respond back to me, I thought maybe you were already at the hospital in Winchester, so I called and when they told me your mom hadn’t been admitted…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief coursed through me. Mom was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon shook his head. “I thought the worst—I thought they’d gotten you. And I was ready to tear this whole damn town apart. And then I got the text from Will…so, yeah, I’m not letting you out of my sight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest ached. While I’d been panicking in that cage, I hadn’t had a chance to really consider Daemon was aware of what was happening, but now I knew those hours must’ve been pure hell for him, a flashback to the days after Dawson’s supposed death. My heart wept for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m okay,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at me sideways as we sped onto the highway heading east. If we didn’t get pulled over for speeding, it would be a miracle. “Are you really okay, though?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded instead of speaking because I had a feeling hearing my damaged voice would probably get to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Onyx,” he said, gripping the steering wheel. “It’s been years since I saw it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you know it would do that?” Keeping my voice low took away most of the raspy sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back when we were being assimilated, I’d seen it used on those who were causing problems, but I was young. I should’ve recognized it, though, when I first saw it. I just never saw it in that capacity—on bars and chains. And I didn’t know it would affect you the same way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It…” I trailed off, taking a deep breath. It had been the worst pain I’d ever experienced. I imagined it was like childbirth plus surgery without anesthesia. Like the mutated cells under my skin were trying to break free, bouncing off one another. Like being ripped apart from the inside—at least that was how it felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the thought of anyone else suffering like that caused my stomach to twist. They controlled Luxen like that, the ones who caused problems? It was inhumane and torturous. No leap of the imagination to think that was how they’d be controlling Dawson…and Blake’s friend. And they’d had Dawson for over a year and Chris for how many?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours—I only had hours in that cage with the onyx. Hours that would linger with me until I took my last breath, but it was only hours, while others had years, most likely. In those hours, parts of my soul had darkened…hardened. There’d been moments when I would’ve done anything to make it stop. Knowing that, I couldn’t even fathom what it had done to others—to Dawson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnxiety thrummed through me. I couldn’t bear Daemon being in something like that. Caged and in pain with no end in sight—the hopelessness that would eventually creep into him, the pain that would shape him into a different person. I couldn’t live with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat?” Concern clouded his tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose hours, the knowledge I’d gained from them, had changed me. No. I had been changing before then—going from someone who hated confrontation to someone who wanted to train and gain the power to fight…and to kill. Lying to those I cared about had become second nature when I’d been a pretty honest person before. Sure, it was to protect them, but lying was lying. I was bolder now, braver. Parts of me had changed for the better, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I knew without a doubt I’d kill to protect Daemon and those I loved without a moment of hesitation. Old Katy couldn’t fathom that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I was nothing but a shade of gray—my moral compass ambiguous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something I needed him to know. “Blake and I aren’t very different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Daemon looked at me sharply. “You’re nothing like that son—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I am.” I twisted toward him. “He did everything to protect Chris. He betrayed people. He lied. He killed. And I get that now. Doesn’t make anything he did okay, but I get that now. I…I would do anything to protect you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me as what I didn’t say hung in the air between us and then sunk in. I wasn’t sure if what I’d become was a better version of me or not. And I also wasn’t sure if that was going to change how Daemon looked at me, but he had to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon reached over with one hand, threading his fingers through mine. He remained focused on the dark road as he pressed our hands to his thigh, keeping them there. “You’re still nothing like him, because in the end, you wouldn’t hurt someone who was innocent. You’d make the right call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t so sure about that, but his faith in me brought tears to my weary eyes. I blinked them back and squeezed his hand. Daemon didn’t say it, but I knew he wouldn’t make the “right call” if someone he loved was in danger. He hadn’t made the “right call” when the two DOD officers caught us at the warehouse. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-57.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
