She had talked to Andy, and convinced her to wait for Brent to return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had learned some things about ghosts, as well. Sometimes Andy could concentrate and be where she wanted to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was easiest to be in the cemetery, and it was fairly easy to be in Nikki\u0027s apartment, except that unexpected noises made her evaporate. She was still afraid, very afraid, and not at all sure how she could be a ghost and still be afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, she was already dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy, you don\u0027t have to convince me,\" Brent told her seriously. \"Nikki has told me about you. I believe that you were murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" Andy said with a little sob. \"Murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ve known that,\" Brent reminded her gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I just don\u0027t like hearing it. It makes it so… real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nikki tells me that you\u0027re here because of the man, the bum. And he\u0027s dead, too,\" Andy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent nodded, never taking his eyes off Andy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw him, you know. I saw him wandering the streets. I tried to get here, you see. I knew Nikki believed in me. I knew she would help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain seared into Nikki\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t been able to help her friend at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy,\" Brent said, \"we both want to help you now. And we need your help. Desperately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy\u0027s beautiful eyes widened, appearing deeply troubled. \"I don\u0027t know how I can help you. I don\u0027t know what happened. And there are times now… it\u0027s like learning to walk again. Sometimes Nikki\u0027s able to see me, hear me… and now you can see me, too. Sometimes I want to be with her, but I can\u0027t. Sometimes I can talk. I try to lift things, move things… but I\u0027m not real, am I? Sometimes,\" she said wistfully, \"I wonder just where I\u0027m supposed to be. I need to leave, but I don\u0027t know where I\u0027m going, and I need to be here because… what happened to me was wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need your help, Andy,\" Brent repeated. \"You\u0027re here now, so tell me, please, do you remember leaving the bar, leaving your friends, that night?\" Brent asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else do you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I made it home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. So you made it home. Did anyone follow you?\" Brent asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy rolled her eyes. \"A herd of rhinos could have followed me home and I wouldn\u0027t have known it,\" she said with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, but you didn\u0027t notice anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I said… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, how about at the bar. Did you see anyone watching you there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki sighed. \"Everyone was watching her. She\u0027s very attractive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was kind of cute, huh?\" Andy asked Nikki wistfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gorgeous, actually,\" Nikki assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stunning,\" Brent agreed. \"Did you notice anyone weird at all that day?\" he asked. \"Do anything weird?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Well, we went to a voodoo shop. But this is New Orleans. I guess that makes Contessa normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the shop,\" Brent murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki felt a twinge of guilt. She still hadn\u0027t mentioned her own strange visit to the shop or what Contessa had said. And she wasn\u0027t going to say anything. Not right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bum,\" Andy said. \"The way he ran into the two of us at Madame\u0027s… that was weird. And that was it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember if you locked your apartment door?\" Brent asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her shoulders. \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy,\" Brent said tensely, \"this could be important. Really important. Think back for me. Did you lock your apartment door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know… I… yes. Yes, I think I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent sat back thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you looking for?\" Nikki demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just going to get mad when I tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Andy locked her door. There was no sign of breaking and entering when she was found. That means someone else had a key. Who else had your key, Andy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy gave him a grim smile. \"Only Nikki.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I didn\u0027t give it to anyone,\" Nikki told him firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not, I don\u0027t believe you did,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then… ?\" Nikki asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s obvious. Someone borrowed it from you without your knowing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t start on that again,\" Nikki snapped. She instantly regretted her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy began to fade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, Andy, please,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Nikki, I\u0027m sorry… I\u0027m not a very good ghost. Yet… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the sound of Andy\u0027s \"yet\" faded away, so did she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki hopped to her feet. \"There, you\u0027ve done it. She\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t even respond to her anger. He was deep in thought once again. \"She\u0027ll be back,\" he said. He looked up at her. \"Don\u0027t get angry. There\u0027s a connection somewhere. You know there has to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki shook her head. \"It wasn\u0027t one of my friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nikki, don\u0027t get mad,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he ignored her. She wanted to fight it out. He wasn\u0027t going to be baited. He was deep in thought again, not looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki shook her head, exasperated, and started for the stairs. She really needed some sleep. Maybe that was it…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sleep deprived, living in a world she had created in her own mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki dropped her robe and slipped into bed. She closed her eyes and thought how remarkable it was that she really wasn\u0027t afraid now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began drifting to sleep, exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t even start when she felt the hand on her hip, the soft whisper of his words as they drifted against her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How mad are you?\" Brent asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to him. Saw his face in the shadows, felt his warmth, the vitality and life that radiated from his body, so near her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty mad,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How mad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched her, sliding in beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not that mad,\" she said, and seconds later she whispered, \"Never that mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered vaguely that she had heard couples should never spend a night in anger. And she wondered even more vaguely if it was still night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, just before she drifted to sleep, she wondered if she dared believe that they were a couple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she knew that she didn\u0027t care if she spent the rest of her life seeing ghosts. She wanted the rest of her life to be with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey stared at Brent Blackhawk with disbelief. \"You\u0027re not even a cop, but you want me to let you talk to a victim of a purse snatching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a lot of nerve, buddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did. The guy always managed to appear relaxed and in control—except when he was with Nikki DuMonde. When he thought that she was threatened. Then he was as wired as a pit bull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was important. Massey made a mental note of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, we both want to catch the perp who killed a federal agent and an innocent woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We still don\u0027t know the two are related. In fact, a lot of the guys don\u0027t think they can possibly have anything to do with each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re wrong, and we both know it,\" Brent said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey felt a little chill. Could this guy read minds, as well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, it\u0027s not legal for me to give you names and addresses. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re talking public record,\" Brent reminded him. \"There was a police report, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Public record and contacting a victim are two different things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be perfectly legal for you to leave a slip of paper on your desk, and then I could read it,\" Brent pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey shook his head. \"Look, I\u0027m supposed to be helping you out. But you haven\u0027t given me anything. Nothing at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlackhawk actually hesitated, dead-black lashes falling over those green eyes that seemed to cut like a laser. \"Give me a few hours. I may have something for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just need a little time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blackhawk—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave that slip of paper on your desk. I swear, I\u0027ll have something in a few hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey shook his head in exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re becoming a bigger pain in the ass than that FBI guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe not quite. Hell, now I\u0027ve got some of his partners in here looking for him. The guy wants to be the Lone Ranger, without even letting Tonto in. Sorry, no offense meant, no ethnic slur intended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No offense taken,\" Brent said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least he thinks the rest of his own office is as inept as we are. Hold on,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dug in his desk, then shoved a file toward Brent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been playing straight with you, Blackhawk. So help me, you\u0027d better be playing straight with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be back with info. Honest Injun,\" Brent said wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki realized, as she went to meet the morning cemetery tour, mat she had forgotten to ask Brent about his late-night excursion. She had even forgotten to ask what he was doing that morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was scheduled to work with Julian. She arrived at Madame\u0027s first, and as she nursed a café au lait, she wondered how his romance was going, and then began to hope that he would show up. She realized that she was feeling good—better than she had felt in what seemed like forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all because she\u0027d had a good conversation with a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no intention of telling Julian about the previous evening, and she knew now why you rarely heard about people who had conversations with ghosts—they kept quiet because the rest of the world would think they were crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian arrived in sunglasses, looking sharp in a polo shirt and chinos. He sat across from her, sipping coffee as if it were a lifesaver. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-38.html","bookId":2268,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
