{"id":80679,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\u003cp\u003eYour police friend put a lockdown order on my ship,\" Holden said. He sounded outraged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround them, the hotel restaurant was busy. Last shift\u0027s prostitutes mixed with the next shift\u0027s tourists and businessmen at the cheap pink-lit buffet. The pilot and the big guy - Alex and Amos - were vying for the last bagel. Naomi sat at Holden\u0027s side, her arms crossed, a cup of bad coffee cooling before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did kill some people,\" Miller said gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you got us out of that with your secret police handshake,\" Holden said. \"So why\u0027s my ship in lockdown?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember when Sematimba said we shouldn\u0027t leave the station without telling him?\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember you making some kind of deal,\" Holden said. \"I don\u0027t remember agreeing to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, he\u0027s going to keep us here until he\u0027s sure he won\u0027t get fired for letting us go. Once he knows his ass is covered, the lock goes down. So let\u0027s talk about the part where I rent a berth on your ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim Holden and his XO exchanged a glance, one of those tiny human burst communications that said more than words could have. Miller didn\u0027t know either of them well enough to decode all of it, but he guessed they were skeptical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had reason to be. Miller had checked his credit balance before he\u0027d called them. He had enough left for another night in the hotel or a good dinner, but not both. He was spending it on a cheap breakfast that Holden and his crew didn\u0027t need and probably wouldn\u0027t enjoy, buying good will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to make very, very sure I understand what you\u0027re saying,\" Holden said as the big one - Amos - returned and sat at his other side holding the bagel. \"Are you saying that unless I let you on my ship, your friend is going to keep us here? Because that\u0027s blackmail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Extortion,\" Amos said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not blackmail,\" Naomi said. \"That would be if he threatened to expose information we didn\u0027t want known. If it\u0027s just a threat, that\u0027s extortion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s not what I\u0027m talking about,\" Miller said. \"Freedom of the station while the investigation rolls? That\u0027s no trouble. Leaving jurisdiction\u0027s another thing. I can\u0027t hold you here any more than I can cut you loose. I\u0027m just looking for a ride when you go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re going to Julie\u0027s asteroid,\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m willing to bet there\u0027s no port there,\" Holden said. \"Did you plan on going anyplace after that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m kind of low on solid plans. Haven\u0027t had one yet that actually happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear that,\" Amos said. \"We\u0027ve been fucked eighteen different ways since we got into this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden folded his hands on the table, one finger tapping a complicated rhythm on the wood-textured concrete top. It wasn\u0027t a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem like a... well, like an angry, bitter old man, actually. But I\u0027ve been working water haulers for the past five years. That just means you\u0027d fit in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" Miller said, and let the word hang there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027ve been shot at a lot recently, and the machine guns yesterday were the least lethal thing I\u0027ve had to deal with,\" Holden said. \"I\u0027m not letting anyone on my ship that I wouldn\u0027t trust with my life, and I don\u0027t actually know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can get the money,\" Miller said, his belly sinking. \"If it\u0027s money, I can cover it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not about negotiating a price,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the money?\" Naomi said, her eyes narrowing. \" \u0027Get the money,\u0027 as in you don\u0027t have it now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a little short,\" Miller said. \"It\u0027s temporary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have an income?\" Naomi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More like a strategy,\" Miller said. \"There\u0027s some independent rackets down on the docks. There always are at any port. Side games. Fights. Things like that. Most of them, the fix is in. It\u0027s how you bribe cops without actually bribing cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s your plan?\" Holden said, incredulity in his voice. \"Go collect some police bribes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the restaurant, a prostitute in a red nightgown yawned prodigiously; the john across the table from her frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Miller said reluctantly. \"I play the side bets. A cop goes in, I make a side bet that he\u0027s going to win. I know who the cops are mostly. The house, they know because they\u0027re bribing them. The side bets are with fish looking to feel edgy because they\u0027re playing unlicensed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he said it, Miller knew how weak it sounded. Alex, the pilot, came and sat beside Miller. His coffee smelled bright and acidic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the deal?\" Alex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t one,\" Holden said. \"There wasn\u0027t one before and there still isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It works better than you\u0027d think,\" Miller said gamely, and four hand terminals chimed at once. Holden and Naomi exchanged another, less complicit glance and pulled up their terminals. Amos and Alex already had theirs up. Miller caught the red-and-green border that meant either a priority message or an early Christmas card. There was a moment\u0027s silence as they all read something; then Amos whistled low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stage three?\" Naomi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t say as I like the sound of that,\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mind if I ask?\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden slid his terminal across the table. The message was plaintext, encoded from Tycho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCAUGHT MOLE IN TYCHO COMM STATION. YOUR PRESENCE AND DESTINATION LEAKED TO UNKNOWN PERSONS ON EROS. BE CAREFUL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Little late on that,\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep reading,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMOLE\u0027S ENCRYPTION CODE ALLOWED INTERCEPT OF SUBSIGNAL BROADCAST FROM EROS FIVE HOURS AGO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINTERCEPTED MESSAGE FOLLOWS: HOLDEN ESCAPED BUT PAYLOAD SAMPLE RECOVERED. REPEAT: SAMPLE RECOVERED. PROCEEDING TO STAGE THREE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any idea what that means?\" Holden asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t,\" Miller said, pushing the terminal back. \"Except... if the payload sample is Julie\u0027s body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which I think we can assume it is,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller tapped his fingertips on the tabletop, unconsciously copying Holden\u0027s rhythm, his mind working through the combinations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This thing,\" Miller said. \"The bioweapon or whatever. They were shipping it here. So now it\u0027s here. Okay. There\u0027s no reason to take out Eros. It\u0027s not particularly important to the war when you hold it up to Ceres or Ganymede or the shipyard at Callisto. And if you wanted it dead, there\u0027re easier ways. Blow a big fusion bomb on the surface, and crack it like an egg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a military base, but it is a shipping hub,\" Naomi said. \"And, unlike Ceres, it\u0027s not under OPA control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re shipping her out, then,\" Holden said. \"They\u0027re taking their sample out to infect whatever their original target was, and once they\u0027re off the station, there\u0027s no way we\u0027re going to stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller shook his head. Something about the chain of logic felt wrong. He was missing something. His imaginary Julie appeared across the room, but her eyes were dark, black filaments pouring down her cheeks like tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I looking at here, Julie? he thought. I\u0027m seeing something here, but I don\u0027t know what it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vibration was a slight, small thing, less than a transport tube\u0027s braking stutter. A few plates rattled; the coffee in Naomi\u0027s cup danced in a series of concentric circles. Everyone in the hotel went silent with the sudden shared dread of thousands of people made aware of their fragility in the same moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh-kay,\" Amos said. \"The fuck was that?\" and the emergency Klaxons started blaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or possibly stage three is something else,\" Miller said over the noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe public-address system was muddy by its nature. The same voice spoke from consoles and speakers that might have been as close as a meter from each other or as far out as earshot would take them. It made every word reverberate, a false echo. Because of that, the voice of the emergency broadcast system enunciated very carefully, each word bitten off separately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attention, please. Eros Station is in emergency lockdown. Proceed immediately to the casino level for radiological safety confinement. Cooperate with all emergency personnel. Attention, please. Eros station is in emergency lockdown... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd on in a loop that would continue, if no one coded in the override, until every man, woman, child, animal, and insect on the station had been reduced to dust and humidity. It was the nightmare scenario, and Miller did what a lifetime on pressurized rocks had trained him to do. He was up from the table, in the corridor, and heading down toward the wider passages, already clogged with bodies. Holden and his crew were on his heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was an explosion,\" Alex said. \"Ship drive at the least. Maybe a nuke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are going to kill the station,\" Holden said. There was a kind of awe in his voice. \"I never thought I\u0027d miss the part where they just blew up the ships I was on. But now it\u0027s stations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn\u0027t crack it,\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure of that?\" Naomi asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can hear you talking,\" Miller said. \"That tells me there\u0027s air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are airlocks,\" Holden said. \"If the station got holed and the locks closed down... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman pushed hard against Miller\u0027s shoulder, forcing her way forward. If they weren\u0027t damn careful, there was going to be a stampede. This was too much fear and not enough space. It hadn\u0027t happened yet, but the impatient movement of the crowd, vibrating like molecules in water just shy of boiling, made Miller very uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a ship,\" Miller said. \"It\u0027s a station. This is rock we\u0027re on. Anything big enough to get to the parts of the station with atmosphere would crack the place like an egg. A great big pressurized egg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd was stopped, the tunnel full. They were going to need crowd control, and they were going to need it fast. For the first time since he\u0027d left Ceres, Miller wished he had a badge. Someone pushed into Amos\u0027 side, then backed away through the press when the big guy growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" Miller said, \"it\u0027s a rad hazard. You don\u0027t need air loss to kill everyone in the station. Just burn a few quadrillion spare neutrons through the place at C, and there won\u0027t be any trouble with the oxygen supply.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cheerful fucker,\" Amos said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They build stations inside of rocks for a reason,\" Naomi said. \"Not so easy to force radiation through this many meters of rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I spent a month in a rad shelter once,\" Alex said as they pushed through the thickening crowd. \"Ship I was on had magnetic containment drop. Automatic cutoffs failed, and the reactor kept runnin\u0027 for almost a second. Melted the engine room. Killed five of the crew on the next deck up before they knew we had a problem, and it took them three days to carve the bodies free of the melted decking for burial. The rest of us wound up eighteen to a shelter for thirty-six days while a tug flew to get us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds great,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"End of it, six of \u0027em got married, and the rest of us never spoke to each other again,\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead of them, someone shouted. It wasn\u0027t in alarm or even anger, really. Frustration. Fear. Exactly the things Miller didn\u0027t want to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That may not be our big problem,\" Miller said, but before he could explain, a new voice cut in, drowning out the emergency-response loop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, everybody! We\u0027re Eros security, que no? We got an emergency, so you do what we tell you and nobody gets hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout time, Miller thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So here\u0027s the rule,\" the new voice said. \"Next asshole who pushes anyone, I\u0027m going to shoot them. Move in an orderly fashion. First priority: orderly. Second priority is move! Go, go, go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first nothing happened. The knot of human bodies was tied too tightly for even the most heavy-handed crowd control to free quickly, but a minute later, Miller saw some heads far ahead of him in the tunnel start to shift, then move away. The air in the tunnel was thickening and the hot plastic smell of overloaded recyclers reached him just as the clot came free. Miller\u0027s breath started coming easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they have hard shelters?\" a woman behind them asked her companion, and then was swept away by the currents. Naomi plucked Miller\u0027s sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They should, yes,\" Miller said. \"Enough for maybe a quarter million, and essential personnel and medical crews would get first crack at them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And everyone else?\" Amos said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they survive the event,\" Holden said, \"station personnel will save as many people as they can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" Amos said. Then: \"Well, fuck that. We\u0027re going for the Roci, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell yes,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead of them, the fast-shuffling crowd in their tunnel was merging with another flow of people from a lower level. Five thick-necked men in riot gear were waving people on. Two of them were pointing guns at the crowd. Miller was more than half tempted to go up and slap the little idiots. Pointing guns at people was a lousy way to avoid panic. One of the security men was also far too wide for his gear, the Velcro fasteners at his belly reaching out for each other like lovers at the moment of separation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller looked down at the floor and slowed his steps, the back of his mind suddenly and powerfully busy. One of the cops swung his gun out over the crowd. Another one - the fat guy - laughed and said something in Korean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had Sematimba said about the new security force? All bluster, no balls. A new corporation out of Luna. Belters on the ground. Corrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name. They\u0027d had a name. CPM. Carne Por la Machina. Meat for the machine. One of the gun-wielding cops lowered his weapon, swept off his helmet, and scratched violently behind one ear. He had wild black hair, a tattooed neck, and a scar that went from one eyelid down almost to the joint of his jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller knew him. A year and a half ago, he\u0027d arrested him for assault and racketeering. And the equipment - armor, batons, riot guns - also looked hauntingly familiar. Dawes had been wrong. Miller had been able to find his own missing equipment after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever this was, it had been going on a long time before the Canterbury had picked up a distress call from the Scopuli. A long time before Julie had vanished. And putting a bunch of Ceres Station thugs in charge of Eros crowd control using stolen Ceres Station equipment had been part of the plan. The third phase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, he thought. Well. That can\u0027t be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller slid to the side, letting as many bodies as he plausibly could fill the space between him and the gunmen dressed as police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get down to the casino level,\" one of the gunmen shouted over the crowd. \"We\u0027ll get you into the radiation shelters from there, but you\u0027ve got to get to the casino level!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden and his crew hadn\u0027t noticed anything odd. They were talking among themselves, strategizing about how to get to their ship and what to do once they got there, speculating about who might have attacked the station and where Julie Mao\u0027s twisted, infected corpse might be headed. Miller fought the impulse to interrupt them. He needed to stay calm, to think things through. They couldn\u0027t attract attention. He needed the right moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corridor turned and widened. The press of bodies lightened a little bit. Miller waited for a dead zone in the crowd control, a space where none of the fake security men could see them. He took Holden by the elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go,\" he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-wakes-expanse-1/page-27.html","bookId":2454,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM"}
