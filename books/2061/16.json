Lissa had been gone when I woke up, so I staggered across the room, trying not to ruin my wet nail polish. Opening up the door, I saw one of the hotel staff standing outside with a large box in both arms. He shifted it slightly so that he could peer around and look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for Rose Hathaway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the box from him. It was big but not all that heavy. With a quick thank-you, I shut the door, wondering if I should have tipped him. Oh well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on the floor with the box. It had no markings on it and was sealed with packing tape. I found a pen and stabbed at the tape. Once I\u0027d hacked off enough, I opened the box and peered inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was filled with perfume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had to be at least thirty little bottles of perfume packed into the box. Some I\u0027d heard of, some I hadn\u0027t. They ranged from crazy expensive, movie-star caliber to cheap kinds I\u0027d seen in drugstores. Eternity. Angel. Vanilla Fields. Jade Blossom. Michael Kors. Poison. Hypnotic Poison. Pure Poison. Happy. Light Blue. J?van Musk. Pink Sugar. Vera Wang. One by one, I picked up the boxes, read the descriptions, and then pulled out the bottles for a sniff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about halfway through when reality hit. These had to be from Adrian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know how he\u0027d managed to get all of these delivered to the hotel in such a short amount of time, but money can make almost anything happen. Still, I didn\u0027t need the attention of a rich, spoiled Moroi; apparently he hadn\u0027t picked up on my signals. Regretfully, I started to place the perfumes back in the box- then stopped. Of course I\u0027d return them...but there was no harm in sniffing the rest before I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, I started pulling out bottle after bottle. Some I just sniffed the cap of; others I sprayed in the air. Serendipity. Dolce \u0026amp; Gabbana. Shalimar. Daisy. Note after note hit me: rose, violet, sandalwood, orange, vanilla, orchid ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I was finished, my nose barely worked anymore. All of these had been designed for humans. They had a weaker sense of smell than vampires and even dhampirs, so these scents were extra strong. I had a new appreciation for what Adrian had meant about only a splash of perfume being necessary. If all these bottles were making me dizzy, I could only imagine what a Moroi would smell. The sensory overload wasn\u0027t really helping the headache I\u0027d woken up with either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI packed up the perfume for real this time, stopping only when I came to a certain kind that I really liked. I hesitated, holding the little box in my hand. Then, I took the red bottle out and re-sniffed it. It was a crisp, sweet fragrance. There was some kind of fruit- but not a candied or sugary fruit. I racked my brain for a scent I\u0027d once smelled on a girl I knew in my dorm. She\u0027d told me the name. It was like a cherry...but sharper. Currant, that\u0027s what it was. And here it was in this perfume, mixed with some florals: lily of the valley and others I couldn\u0027t identify. Whatever the blend, something about it appealed to me. Sweet- but not too sweet. I read the box, looking for the name. Amor Amor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fitting,\" I muttered, seeing how many love problems I seemed to have lately. But I kept the perfume anyway and repacked the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoisting the box up in my arms, I took it down to the front desk and acquired some packing tape to reseal it. I also got directions to Adrian\u0027s room. Apparently, the Ivashkovs practically had their own wing. It wasn\u0027t too far from Tasha\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling like a delivery girl, I walked down the hall and stopped in front of his door. Before I could manage to knock, it opened up, and Adrian stood before me. He looked as surprised as I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Little dhampir,\" he said cordially. \"Didn\u0027t expect to see you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m returning these.\" I hoisted the box toward him before he could protest. Clumsily, he caught it, staggering a bit in surprise. Once he had a good grip, he took a few steps back and set it on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you like any of them?\" he asked. \"You want me to get you some more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t send me any more gifts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t a gift. It\u0027s a public service. What woman doesn\u0027t own perfume?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do it again,\" I said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a voice behind him asked, \"Rose? Is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peered beyond him. Lissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween my headache and what I had assumed was some interlude with Christian, I\u0027d blocked her out as best I could this morning. Normally I would have known the instant I approached that she was inside the room. I opened myself up again, letting her shock run into me. She hadn\u0027t expected me to show up here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies, ladies,\" he said teasingly. \"No need to fight over me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared. \"We\u0027re not. I just want to know what\u0027s going on here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA breath of aftershave hit me, and then I heard a voice behind me: \"Me too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped. Spinning around, I saw Dimitri standing in the hallway. I had no clue what he was doing in the Ivashkov wing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his way to Tasha\u0027s room, a voice inside me suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri no doubt always expected me to get into all sorts of trouble, but I think seeing Lissa there caught him off guard. He stepped past me and came into the room, looking between the three of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Male and female students aren\u0027t supposed to be in each other\u0027s rooms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew pointing out that Adrian wasn\u0027t technically a student wasn\u0027t going to get us out of trouble here. We weren\u0027t supposed to be in any guy\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you keep doing this?\" I asked Adrian, frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep making us look bad!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. \"You guys are the ones who came here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have let them in,\" scolded Dimitri. \"I\u0027m sure you know the rules at St. Vladimir\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian shrugged. \"Yeah, but I don\u0027t have to follow any school\u0027s stupid rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps not,\" said Dimitri coldly. \"But I would have thought you\u0027d still respect those rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian rolled his eyes. \"I\u0027m kind of surprised to find you lecturing about underage girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the anger kindle in Dimitri\u0027s eyes, and for a moment, I thought I might have seen the loss of control I\u0027d teased him about. But he stayed composed, and only his clenched fists showed how angry he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" continued Adrian, \"nothing sordid was going on. We were just hanging out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want to \u0027hang out\u0027 with young girls, do it at one of the public areas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t really like Dimitri calling us \u0027young girls,\u0027 and I kind of felt like he was overreacting here. I also suspected part of his reaction had to do with the fact that I was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian laughed just then, a weird kind of laugh that made my skin crawl. \"Young girls? Young girls? Sure. Young and old at the same time. They\u0027ve barely seen anything in life, yet they\u0027ve already seen too much. One\u0027s marked with life, and one\u0027s marked with death...but they\u0027re the ones you\u0027re worried about? Worry about yourself, dhampir. Worry about you, and worry about me. We\u0027re the ones who are young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of us just sort of stared. I don\u0027t think anyone had expected Adrian to suddenly take an abrupt trip to Crazyville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian was calm and looked perfectly normal again. He turned away and strolled toward the window, glancing casually back at the rest of us as he pulled out his cigarettes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ladies should probably go. He\u0027s right. I am a bad influence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exchanged looks with Lissa. Hurriedly, we both left and followed Dimitri down the hall toward the lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was...strange,\" I said a couple of minutes later. It was stating the obvious, but, well, someone had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very,\" said Dimitri. He didn\u0027t sound angry so much as puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached the lobby, I started to follow Lissa back toward our room, but Dimitri called to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose,\" he said. \"Can I talk to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a sympathetic rush of feeling from Lissa. I turned toward Dimitri and stepped off to the side of the room, out of the way of those passing through. A party of Moroi in diamonds and fur swept past us, anxious looks on their faces. Bellhops followed with luggage. People were still leaving in search of safer places. The Strigoi paranoia was far from over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri\u0027s voice snapped my attention back to him. \"That\u0027s Adrian Ivashkov.\" He said the name the same way everyone else did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the second time I\u0027ve seen you with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I replied glibly. \"We hang out sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri arched an eyebrow, then jerked his head back toward where we\u0027d come from. \"You hang out in his room a lot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral retorts popped into my head, and then a golden one took precedence. \"What happens between him and me is none of your business.\" I managed a tone very similar to the one he\u0027d used on me when making a similar comment about him and Tasha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, as long as you\u0027re at the Academy, what you do is my business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not my personal life. You don\u0027t have any say in that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not an adult yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m close enough. Besides, it\u0027s not like I\u0027ll magically become an adult on my eighteenth birthday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clearly,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed. \"That\u0027s not what I meant. I meant- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you meant. And the technicalities don\u0027t matter right now. You\u0027re an Academy student. I\u0027m your instructor. It\u0027s my job to help you and to keep you safe. Being in the bedroom of someone like him ... well, that\u0027s not safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle Adrian Ivashkov,\" I muttered. \"He\u0027s weird-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;really weird, apparently- but harmless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI secretly wondered if Dimitri\u0027s problem might be that he was jealous. He hadn\u0027t pulled Lissa aside to yell at her. The thought made me slightly happy, but then I remembered my earlier curiosity about why Dimitri had even wandered by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of personal lives ... I suppose you were off visiting Tasha, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it was petty, and I expected a \"none of your business\" response. Instead he replied, \"Actually, I was visiting your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You going to hook up with her too?\" I knew of course that he wasn\u0027t, but the quip seemed too good to pass up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to know that too and merely gave me a weary glance. \"No, we were looking over some new data about the Strigoi in the Drozdov attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy anger and snarkiness dried up. The Drozdovs. The Badicas. Suddenly, everything that had happened this morning seemed incredibly trivial. How could I have stood there arguing with Dimitri about romances that might or might not be happening when he and the other guardians were trying to protect us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d you find out?\" I asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve managed to track some of the Strigoi,\" he said. \"Or at least the humans with them. There were witnesses who lived nearby who spotted a few of the cars the group used. The plates were all from different states- the group appears to have split up, probably to make it harder for us. But one of the witnesses did catch one plate number. It\u0027s registered to an address in Spokane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spokane?\" I asked incredulously. \"Spokane, Washington? Who makes Spokane their hideout?\" I\u0027d been there once. It was about as boring as every other backwoods northwest city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strigoi, apparently,\" he said, deadpan. \"The address was fake, but other evidence shows they really are there. There\u0027s a kind of shopping plaza that has some underground tunnels. There\u0027ve been Strigoi sightings around that area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then ...\" I frowned. \"Are you going to go after them? Is somebody going to? I mean, this is what Tasha\u0027s been saying all along.... If we know where they are ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"The guardians can\u0027t do anything without permission from higher up. That\u0027s not going to happen anytime soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Because the Moroi talk too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re being cautious,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt myself getting worked up again. \"Come on. Even you can\u0027t want to be careful on this one. You actually know where Strigoi are hiding out. Strigoi who massacred children. Don\u0027t you want to go after them when they don\u0027t expect it?\" I sounded like Mason now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that easy,\" he said. \"We answer to the Guardian Council and the Moroi government. We can\u0027t just run off and act on impulse. And anyway, we don\u0027t know everything yet. You should never walk into any situation without knowing all the details.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zen life lessons again,\" I sighed. I ran a hand through my hair, tucking it behind my ears. \"Why\u0027d you tell me this, anyway? This is guardian stuff. Not the kind of thing you let novices in on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered his words, and his expression softened. He always looked amazing, but I liked him best like this. \"I\u0027ve said a few things...the other day and today...that I shouldn\u0027t have. Things that insulted your age. You\u0027re seventeen...but you\u0027re capable of handling and processing the same things those much older than you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest grew light and fluttery. \"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"You\u0027re still really young in a lot of ways-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and act young- but the only way to really change that is to treat you like an adult. I need to do that more. I know you\u0027ll take this information and understand how important it is and keep it to yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t love being told I acted young, but I liked the idea that he would talk to me like an equal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dimka,\" came a voice. Tasha Ozera walked up to us. She smiled when she saw me. \"Hello, Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere went my mood. \"Hey,\" I said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe placed a hand on Dimitri\u0027s forearm, sliding her fingers over the leather of his coat. I eyed those fingers angrily. How dare they touch him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got that look,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What look?\" he asked. The stern look he\u0027d worn with me vanished. There was a small, knowing smile on his lips. Almost a playful one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That look that says you\u0027re going to be on duty all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? I have a look like that?\" There was a teasing, mocking tone to his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"When does your shift technically end?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri actually looked- I swear- sheepish. \"An hour ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t keep doing this,\" she groaned. \"You need a break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ... if you consider that I\u0027m always Lissa\u0027s guardian...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now,\" she said knowingly. I felt sicker than I had last night. \"There\u0027s a big pool tournament going on upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" he said, but the smile was still on his face. \"Even though I haven\u0027t played in a long time ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the- ? Dimitri played pool?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, it didn\u0027t matter that we\u0027d just had a discussion about him treating me like an adult. Some small part of me did know what a compliment that was- but the rest of me wanted him to treat me like he did Tasha. Playful. Teasing. Casual. They were so familiar with each other, so completely at ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, then,\" she begged. \"Just one round! We could take them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" he repeated. He sounded regretful. \"Not with everything going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sobered a little. \"No. I suppose not.\" Glancing at me, she said teasingly, \"I hope you realize what a hard-core role model you have here. He\u0027s never off duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I said, copying her lilting tone from earlier, \"for now, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTasha looked puzzled. I don\u0027t think it occurred to her I\u0027d be making fun of her. Dimitri\u0027s dark look told me he knew exactly what I was doing. I immediately realized I\u0027d just killed whatever progress I\u0027d made as an adult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re finished here, Rose. Remember what I said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said, turning away. I suddenly wanted to go to my room and veg for a while. This day was making me tired already. \"Definitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t gotten far when I ran into Mason. Good God. Men everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re mad,\" he said as soon as he looked at my face. He had a knack for discovering my moods. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some ... authority problems. It\u0027s been a weird morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, unable to get Dimitri off the brain. Looking at Mason, I remembered how I\u0027d been convinced I wanted to get serious with him last night. I was a head case. I couldn\u0027t make up my mind about anyone. Deciding the best way to banish one guy was to pay attention to another, I grabbed Mason\u0027s hand and steered him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on. Wasn\u0027t the deal to go somewhere...um, private today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured you weren\u0027t drunk anymore,\" he joked. But his eyes looked very, very serious. And interested. \"I assumed it was all off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I stand by my claims, no matter what.\" Opening my mind, I searched for Lissa. She was no longer in our room. She\u0027d gone off to some other royal event, no doubt still practicing for Priscilla Voda\u0027s big dinner. \"Come on,\" I told Mason. \"We\u0027ll go to my room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from when Dimitri inconveniently happened to be passing by someone\u0027s room, nobody was really enforcing the mixed-gender rule. It was practically like being back in my Academy dorms. As Mason and I went upstairs, I related to him what Dimitri had told me about the Strigoi in Spokane. Dimitri had told me to keep it to myself, but I was mad at him again, and I didn\u0027t see any harm in telling Mason. I knew he\u0027d be interested in this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was right. Mason got really worked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he exclaimed as we walked into my room. \"They\u0027re not doing anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged and sat on my bed. \"Dimitri said- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know ... I heard you. About being careful and all that.\" Mason paced around my room angrily. \"But if those Strigoi go after another Moroi...another family...damn it! They\u0027re going to wish they weren\u0027t so careful then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget about it,\" I said. I felt kind of miffed that me on a bed wasn\u0027t enough to deter him from crazy battle plans. \"There\u0027s nothing we can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped walking. \"We could go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go where?\" I asked stupidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Spokane. There are buses you can catch in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... wait. You want us to go to Spokane and take on Strigoi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Eddie\u0027d do it too ... we could go to that mall. They wouldn\u0027t be organized or anything, so we could wait and pick them off one by one ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could only stare. \"When did you get so dumb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I see. Thanks for the vote of confidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not about confidence,\" I argued, standing up and approaching him. \"You kick major ass. I\u0027ve seen it. But this ... this isn\u0027t the way. We can\u0027t go get Eddie and take on Strigoi. We need more people. More planning. More information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested my hands on his chest. He placed his over them and smiled. The fire of battle was still in his eyes, but I could tell his mind was shifting to more immediate concerns. Like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean to call you dumb,\" I told him. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just saying that now because you want to have your way with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I am,\" I laughed, happy to see him relax. The nature of this conversation reminded me a little of the one Christian and Lissa had had in the chapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to be too hard to take advantage of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Because there are lots of things I want to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid my hands up and around his neck. His skin was warm beneath my fingers, and I remembered how much I\u0027d enjoyed kissing him last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, out of nowhere, he said, \"You really are his student.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belikov\u0027s. I was just thinking about when you mentioned needing more information and stuff. You act just like him. You\u0027ve gotten all serious since you\u0027ve been hanging out with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason had pulled me closer, but now I suddenly didn\u0027t feel so romantic. I\u0027d wanted to make out and forget Dimitri for a while, not have a conversation about him. Where had this come from? Mason was supposed to be distracting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t notice anything was wrong. \"You\u0027ve just changed, that\u0027s all. It\u0027s not bad ... just different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about that made me angry, but before I could snap back, his mouth met mine in a kiss. Reasonable discussions sort of vanished. A bit of that dark temper started to rise in me, but I simply channeled that intensity into physicality as Mason and I fell on top of each other. I yanked him down on the bed, managing to do so without stopping the kissing. I was nothing if not a multitasker. I dug my nails into his back while his hands slid up the back of my neck and released the ponytail I\u0027d just made minutes ago. Running his fingers through the unbound hair, he shifted his mouth down and kissed my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are ... amazing,\" he told me. And I could tell that he meant it. His whole face glowed with affection for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arched upward, letting his lips press harder against my skin while his hands slipped under the bottom of my shirt. They trailed upward along my stomach, just barely tracing the edge of my bra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering we\u0027d just been having an argument a minute ago, I was surprised to see things escalating so quickly. Honestly, though ... I didn\u0027t mind. This was the way I lived my life. Everything was always fast and intense with me. The night Dimitri and I had fallen victim to Victor Dashkov\u0027s lust charm, there\u0027d been some pretty furious passion going on too. Dimitri had controlled it, though, so sometimes we\u0027d taken things slowly...and that had been wonderful in its own way. But most of the time, we hadn\u0027t been able to hold ourselves back. I could feel it all over again. The ways his hands had run over my body. The deep, powerful kisses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then that I realized something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was kissing Mason, but in my head, I was with Dimitri. And it wasn\u0027t like I was simply remembering either. I was actually imagining I was with Dimitri- right now- reliving that night all over again. With my eyes closed, it was easy to pretend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when I opened them and saw Mason\u0027s eyes, I knew he was with me. He adored me and had wanted me for a long time. For me to do this ... to be with him and pretend I was with someone else ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiggled out of his reach. \"No ... don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason stopped immediately because that\u0027s the kind of guy he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too much?\" he asked. I nodded. \"That\u0027s okay. We don\u0027t have to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for me again, and I moved farther away. \"No, I just don\u0027t... I don\u0027t know. Let\u0027s call it quits, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...\" He was speechless for a moment. \"What happened to the \u0027lots of things\u0027 you wanted to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah ... it looked pretty bad, but what could I say? I can\u0027t get physical with you because when I do, I just think about the other guy I actually want. You\u0027re just a stand-in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, feeling stupid. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mase. I just can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up and ran a hand over his hair. \"Okay. All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear the hardness in his voice. \"You\u0027re mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over at me, a stormy expression on his face. \"I\u0027m just confused. I can\u0027t read your signals. One moment you\u0027re hot, the next you\u0027re cold. You tell me you want me, you tell me you don\u0027t. If you picked one, that\u0027d be fine, but you keep making me think one thing and then you end up going in a completely different direction. Not just now- all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true. I had gone back and forth with him. Sometimes I was flirty, other times I completely ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there something you want me to do?\" he asked when I didn\u0027t say anything. \"Something that\u0027ll... I don\u0027t know. Make you feel better about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"Then what do you want in general?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri, I thought. Instead, I repeated myself. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a groan, he stood up and headed for the door. \"Rose, for someone who claims she wants to gather as much information as possible, you really have a lot to learn about yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slammed behind him. The noise made me flinch, and as I stared at where Mason had just stood, I realized he was right. I did have a lot to learn. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/frostbite-vampire-academy-2/page-16.html","bookId":2061,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:14 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:14 AM"}
