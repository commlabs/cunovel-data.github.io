There is no doubt that there were several men of the name of Josiah Klegg in the union Army, and who did valiant service for the Government. They had experiences akin to, if not identical with, those narrated here, and substantially every man who faithfully and bravely carried a musket in defense of the best Government on earth had sometimes, if not often, experiences of which those of Si Klegg are a strong reminder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Publishers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e THIS BOOK IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO THE RANK AND FILE OF THE GRANDEST ARMY EVER MUSTERED FOR WAR.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63234.html","bookId":439,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 8:15:27 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 8:15:27 AM"}
