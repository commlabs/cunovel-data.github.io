In this wood, there was a small cottage, and Alfred asked the woman who lived there if he might go in and rest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now the woman did not know the king, but she saw that he was an English soldier, and that he was very tired, so she let him come in and sit in her kitchen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Upon the hearth before the fire, some cakes were baking, and the woman told the stranger that if he watched them, and took care that they did not burn, she would give him some supper. Then she went away to do her work.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At first, King Alfred watched the cakes carefully; when they were well cooked on one side he turned the other to the fire. But, after a time, he began to think of his country, and of his poor people, and then he forgot his task.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the woman came back, the cakes were black and burnt. \"You are an idle fellow,\" cried she angrily. \"You would be quite ready to eat the cakes, but you will not take the trouble to watch them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While she was loudly scolding, her husband came home.
