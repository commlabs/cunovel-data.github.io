I wasn\u0027t alive, but I wasn\u0027t altogether dead, either. As I\u0027d suspected, a careful questioning of my dad spanning the entire day confirmed that not only did he not have a clue I had been dead at the hospital, but he didn\u0027t even remember the accident. He thought I\u0027d ditched Josh when I found out I was a pity date, got a ride home with Seth and Barnabas, and watched TV all night, pouting in my costume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t pleased I had ruined the rental, either. I didn\u0027t appreciate him taking the cost of it out of my allowance, but I wasn\u0027t going to complain. I was here, sort of alive, and that was all that mattered. My dad seemed surprised at my meek acceptance of my punishment, telling me I was growing up. Oh, if he only knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched my dad closely all day as I unpacked and put my stuff in drawers and on shelves. It was clear he knew something wasn\u0027t right, though he couldn\u0027t put his finger on it. He hardly let me out of his sight, coming upstairs to bring me snacks and pop until I could have screamed. More than once I caught him watching me with a frightened expression, hiding it when he saw me return his gaze. Dinner was a forced conversation over pork chops, and after picking at my food for a good twenty minutes, I excused myself, claiming I was tired after last night\u0027s prom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. I ought to be tired, but I wasn\u0027t. No, it was two in the morning, and here I was out on the roof, pitching stones, pretending to be asleep as the world turned in a chilly darkness. Maybe I didn\u0027t need to sleep anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoulders slumping, I picked another bit of tar off the shingles and flicked it at the chimney. It hit the metallic cap with a ting, ricocheting into the black. I scooted up the shallow pitch of the roof, then tugged my jeans back up where they ought to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint feeling of unease crept through me, starting from the tops of my hands in a soft prickling, slipping inward with an increasingly jagged spike. The sensation of being watched exploded into existence, and I spun, gasping, when Barnabas fell out of the tree arching overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" I shouted, heart thumping while he landed in a crouch like a cat. \"How about some warning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose to stand in the moonlit darkness with his hands on his hips. There was a faint shimmer on him visible right along with his disgust. \"If I had been a black reaper, you\u0027d be dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, I\u0027m already dead, aren\u0027t I?\" I said, flicking a stone at him. He didn\u0027t move as it arched over his shoulder. \"What do you want?\" I asked sullenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of answering, he shrugged his narrow shoulders and looked east. \"I want to know what you didn\u0027t tell Ron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood still as a rock, arms crossed over his chest and staring. \"Seth said something to you in that car. It was the only time you were out of my sight. I want to know what it was. It might be the difference between you getting to play out this lie of being alive, or you getting carted off to a black court.\" Now he moved, his motion rough and angry. \"I\u0027m not going to fail again, and not because of you. You were important to Seth before you stole that stone. That\u0027s why he came to get you at the morgue. I want to know why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at the stone, glittering in the moonlight, then shifted my gaze to my feet. The awkward angle of the roof made my ankles hurt. \"He said my name had come up too many times in the affairs of men, and he was going to cull my soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarnabas moved, coming to sit beside me with a lot of space between us. \"He\u0027s done that. You\u0027re not a threat now that you\u0027re dead. Why did he come back for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReassured by his more relaxed posture, I looked at him, thinking his eyes seemed silver in the moonlight. \"You won\u0027t tell?\" I asked, wanting to trust him. I needed to talk to someone, and it wasn\u0027t like I could call up my old friends and vent about being dead-as entertaining as that might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarnabas hesitated. \"No, but I might try to persuade you to tell him yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I could deal with, and I took a slow breath. \"He said that his ending my pathetic life was his ticket into a higher court. He came back to prove he had... culled me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for a reaction, but there was none. Finally I couldn\u0027t take it anymore and I lifted my head to meet his eyes. Barnabas was looking at me as if trying to figure out what it meant. Clearly not having an answer, he slowly said, \"I think you should keep this to yourself for a while. He probably didn\u0027t mean anything by it. Forget it. Spend your time learning how to fit in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said with a sarcastic bark of laughter. \"A new school is tons of fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant fit in with the living.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Okay. I was going to have to learn how to fit in, not at a new school, but with the living. Swell. Remembering the disastrous dinner with my dad, I bit my lip. \"Uh, Barnabas, am I supposed to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. If you want to. I don\u0027t. Not much, anyway,\" he said, sounding almost wistful. \"But if you\u0027re like me, you\u0027ll never be hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tucked my short hair behind my ear. \"How about sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that, he smiled. \"You can try. I can\u0027t manage it unless I am bored out of my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked a bit of tar off the shingles and flicked it at the chimney again. \"How come I don\u0027t have to eat?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarnabas turned to face me. \"That stone of yours is giving off energy, and you\u0027re taking it in. Basking in it. Watch out for psychics. They\u0027ll think you\u0027re possessed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmm,\" I murmured, wondering if I could get any useful information about what was really going on from a church, but they were wrong about grim reapers, so maybe they didn\u0027t know as much as they thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, sitting in the dark on my roof with a white reaper-my guardian angel. Nice going, Madison, I thought, wondering if my life-or death, rather-could get any more screwed up. I slowly fingered the stone that kept me somewhat alive, wondering what I was supposed to do now. Go to school. Do my homework. Be with my dad. Try to make sense of who I was and what I was supposed to do. Nothing much had changed, really, apart from the no-eating-no-sleeping thing. So I had something worse than a black reaper gunning for me. I also had a guardian angel. And life, apparently, goes on, even if you aren\u0027t a participating part of it anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarnabas surprised me when he suddenly stood, and I leaned to look up at his height measured against the stars. \"Let\u0027s go,\" he said, extending his hand. \"I don\u0027t have anything to do tonight, and I\u0027m bored. You\u0027re not a screamer, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first thought was screamer? And then, go where? But what came out of my mouth was a lame, \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027ve been grounded. I can\u0027t set a foot outside the house apart from school until I pay for that costume.\" But I smiled, taking his hand and letting him help me rise. If Ron could make my dad forget I had died, I\u0027d be willing to bet Barnabas could cover for me sneaking out a couple of hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, I can\u0027t do anything about you being grounded,\" he said, \"but where we\u0027re going, you won\u0027t be setting a foot anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" I stammered, then stiffened when he moved behind me, taller because of the roof\u0027s pitch. \"Hey!\" I yelped when his arm went around me. But my protest vanished in shock at the gray shadow suddenly curving around us. It was real, smelling like my mom\u0027s feather pillow, and I gasped when his grip tightened and my feet left the roof in a downward drop of gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy crap!\" I exclaimed as the world spread out beneath us, silver and black in the moonlight. \"You have wings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarnabas laughed, and with my stomach dropping in a tingling surge, we went higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe... maybe this wasn\u0027t going to be so bad after all. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-16.html","bookId":2030,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM"}
