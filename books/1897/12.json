It\u0027s funny because that\u0027s who Becky used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the fuck, Parker?\" She wrenches her arm from my grip and takes one look at my face. \"This better not be about Chris or that stupid cheer, I\u0027m warning you. You\u0027ll be thrilled to know we\u0027re not doing it--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Becky, shut up. Is Evan back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Is he back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddammit, Becky, did you forget to turn your brain on today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk to me like that!\" At least she knows when she\u0027s being insulted. Chris sidles up and snakes his arm around her waist. \"I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s back or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s so useless. I press Chris\u0027s math binder into his free hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I tell him. \"Hey, do you know if Evan\u0027s back or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\" Becky asks Chris. \"Why did Parker have your binder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just math homework, Becky,\" he says vaguely. \"Is who back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ev-an,\" I say slowly, and Chris gets this surprised look on his face--his eyebrow goes up and everything. He didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evan? Haven\u0027t seen him. Have you seen him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lightbulb goes on over Becky\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You let her copy your math homework?!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe totally screeches it. I\u0027ve always had the worst urge to tell her about how we used to make fun of her at the squad sleepovers she couldn\u0027t make. We\u0027d up our voices nine octaves and say the most inanely stupid things because that\u0027s Becky for you. She was the most expendable member of the squad and now she\u0027s, like, Parker Lite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe owes her magical senior year to me and she knows it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not supposed to be enabling Parker like this!\" Becky says. What an ingrate. \"That\u0027s what Grey and Henley called it--enabling! She uses you and you get nothing in return--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, he got something,\" I assure her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker, shut up--\" Chris turns bright red and since he\u0027s one of those people who like to make sure they do everything to the best of their abilities, especially the stupid stuff, he blows it: \"You weren\u0027t supposed to say anything!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky does a quadruple take and figures out what that means to the best of her abilities. She\u0027s probably decided we\u0027ve had sex. Close enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck both of you,\" she spits, and storms off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeez. Chris closes his eyes and brings a hand to his temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So anyway,\" I say, \"I was just walking down Victoria Street yesterday and I think I saw Evan outside of the--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Parker,\" Chris says, strained. \"Just shut up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chases after Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe come downstairs looking like two people who\u0027ve spent the last thirty minutes having sex. Chris insists on it because the basketball team has to know he\u0027s getting laid, so his hair is sticking up all over the place and the buttons on my shirt are strategically undone. Like any of the wasters on the team will notice, never mind the fact it\u0027s going to be the first thing he tells them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house is filling up with people from school. I spot a few girls from the squad, but they won\u0027t look at me because of what happened at practice earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris grabs some of his buddies and gets to work on the tunes. In the minutes before the sounds of the latest popular white rapper start playing, I wind my way through the house and spot Evan in the kitchen, already working on some shots with Jenny Morse, who is not his girlfriend. This wouldn\u0027t matter if they were just doing shots, but after he passes a slice of lime to her they start kissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat and they part fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker,\" Evan says nervously. He runs a hand over his prickly black hair and holds out a bottle of vodka and a shot glass. \"Uh--shot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All students will proceed to the auditorium for a special assembly.\" Henley\u0027s voice crackles over the PA. \"All students to the auditorium for a special assembly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" Jake says, sitting beside me. For a second, I\u0027m reminded of Bailey. \"This is about the missing girl, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was your first clue, the mounted picture onstage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are, in fact, skipping art for an assembly about the missing girl. There\u0027s a mounted picture of her onstage next to the podium, which is waiting for Henley. Rows of hard plastic chairs have been halfheartedly arranged in the center of the room and I\u0027ve chosen a seat near the back and Jake has chosen the seat next to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the second assembly we\u0027ve had for Jessica Wellington since she disappeared. First we pray to Jesus and ask him for her safe return, next Henley says a bunch of nothing platitudes, then Jessica\u0027s friends take the mic and share their favorite memories of her and then we pray again and then we\u0027re dismissed. Student Council hands out white ribbons in Jessica\u0027s honor at the door, so we never forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around the room. The auditorium is filling quickly. Everyone\u0027s talking in quiet voices on their way to their seats. Something about it makes me feel queasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo many people. \"Chris is really pissed at you,\" Jake says. \"He won\u0027t say why. What\u0027d you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inhale. How can the auditorium be only half full and have all the air gone from it like that? I\u0027m not getting any air. As students continue to mill into the auditorium, it gets smaller and smaller and my heart beats this insane rhythm in my chest. I rub my palms on my skirt. They\u0027re sweaty. I really can\u0027t breathe. No, I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just think I can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone\u0027s in. The teachers line up on either side of the walls, ready to shush us should the need arise. The lights overhead dim, but the stage remains bathed in an eerie golden glow. I take a few short breaths in and bring my hand to my chest because I\u0027m afraid my heart is going to pop out of it. The tips of my fingers are tingling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore Jake and exhale. Breathe in. Breathe out. That\u0027s how you take care of these things, isn\u0027t it? In. Out. Again. Slowly. I\u0027ve read it. Deep breaths. But what do you do when there\u0027s no air? When you\u0027re sucking in everyone else\u0027s stale breaths?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if I really can\u0027t breathe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, this is a test, isn\u0027t it? And if I ask if you\u0027re okay, it\u0027s because I have a thing for girls who are all vulnerable because they make me feel like a macho man, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up so fast the back of my chair flies into the knees of the person behind me. They throw whispered insults my way and Jake stares at me, surprised. Henley strides across the stage and I stumble past Jake and down the row of teachers, some mangled explanation about having to go to the bathroom falling off my lips. And then I finally, finally burst through the doors to the hall and when I take that first breath in all I can think is air because I\u0027m dying for it, gasping for it, and I can\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenley\u0027s voice floats into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve called this assembly today to pray for Jessica Wellington\u0027s safe return home. As more time passes, I know--as you all know--the outcome seems grim. But there is something else I know: If we put our hands together and appeal to God, we have a chance. She has a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI end up on the floor, resting my head on my knees and trying to block out Henley\u0027s voice while I wait out my spastic heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI focus on taking even breaths in and out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. You\u0027re actually not okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you quit stalking me? It\u0027s creepy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force myself up and brush off my skirt. In. Out. In. Out. My heart is starting to feel more normal, which means it\u0027s going away. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down if you need to,\" Jake says. \"I won\u0027t hold it against you. And I\u0027m not stalking you. Grey told me to see if you were all right. It wasn\u0027t one of the most subtle exits ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I mutter. \"It\u0027s like some kind of claustrophobia. When I\u0027m in a room with a bunch of stupid people like you, I get a little overwhelmed--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How were you ever popular?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to get Ms. Grey or a teacher or something?\" he asks, awkward. \"Or walk you to the nurse\u0027s? What do you usually do when you have a panic attack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what it was,\" I say quickly, but he\u0027s skeptical. \"Just forget it. I\u0027m going to skip out on the assembly. Tell Grey I have really bad cramps, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake makes a face. \"Gross! I\u0027m not telling her about your feminine problems--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be such a sissy!\" I snap. \"Just do it and your chances of getting into my pants increase tenfold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my back to him and start down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, wait! It\u0027ll be lunch soon! Am I gonna see you in the gym?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of Becky and Chris glaring at me from opposite ends of the court and I don\u0027t have the energy to deal with that right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that night I find myself at Chris\u0027s again, except this time, on my way to the woods, I somehow manage to knock the top off this cement bird fountain and the sound it makes when it hits the driveway is awful. I dart out onto the street and I never look back, but I swear I hear Mr. Ellory open the front door and shout, \"Who\u0027s there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris and Becky are still furious with me. They won\u0027t look at or speak to me and, I won\u0027t lie, I feel pretty accomplished about it. Somebody give me a gold star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWord around the halls is they\u0027re not totally broken up yet, just on a break. And I suspect word around the halls is I had something to do with it, because nothing else explains the dirty looks I\u0027m getting from the cheerleading squad and the basketball team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess that means I\u0027ve almost arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I was looking at the Honor Roll plaques,\" Jake is saying. Art again. He\u0027s making amazing progress on our landscape, and wouldn\u0027t you know it, he\u0027s actually kind of gifted at this drawing thing. I\u0027m still tracing the same rocks. \"And you know what name kept showing up? At least for the last three years?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-12.html","bookId":1897,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM"}
