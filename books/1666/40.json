I wanted to say yes, because that would be the easy and smart thing to do, but that one damn word wouldn’t come out of my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I already knew the truth. I wasn’t going to let her go without me. I never would have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc pursed his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, maybe I read it wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy irritation resurfaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Read what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And?” When he said nothing, I forced myself not to punt-kick him off the bar. “Fuck. What about us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc shrugged again. “I just didn’t think you’d let her go off by herself. That you’d be more, I don’t know, concerned about her well-being.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would you think that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his brows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m an Arum, Luc. I’m not a fucking human, a Luxen, or whatever the hell you are.” I stalked over to where he sat and he just smiled at me. “I’m not—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fooling me,” he cut in with a fucking wink. “You went against the DOD to protect her. You killed two officers, which is a death sentence for you if they ever catch you. Call me crazy, but that means something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Means what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc cocked his head to the side. “You never struck me as the stupid type, Hunter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed. “And you never struck me as the suicidal type, smartass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “All I’m saying is that you know what it means. You just don’t want to acknowledge it yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you enlighten me, you little tool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasting me a sideways look, he hopped down and started back toward the office. “Arum are pretty thick-skulled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a brief moment I entertained the idea of throwing him across the club. “Luc.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spared me a quick grin as he opened the door. Beyond him, Serena jumped up from the couch, her gaze moving from me to Luc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clasped her hands together. “Did everything go…uh, smoothly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s fed like a fat baby,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc replied, and I rolled my eyes. “So you’re heading to Colorado?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena glanced at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you getting there?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifted her weight from one foot to the next; the air around her humming a faint blue. “I really don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc smiled. “Well, flying will be too risky. You can’t do that. But I have a few spare cars you can borrow, plus some money for gas and food. It’s about a twenty-three-hour drive, so you’ll—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait a sec,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI interrupted as I moved between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going to give her a car and money to go there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc blinked innocently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT LITTLE FUCK . “I gave you a piece of opal and a Luxen to nom-nom on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not what I meant,” I growled. “It’s dangerous—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then go with her,” he threw out as he turned back to Serena. “That is, if she even wants you to go with her. I would totally understand if she didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, for the love of fuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s not going to Colorado by—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is standing right here, buddy.” Serena got right up in my face, and it was almost laughable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have a say in this at all, if I remember correctly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared down at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chick was insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes more green than brown, fiery and alive, and her chin stuck out stubbornly. She looked like she wanted to throttle me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFucking hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I’ll let you two talk this out.” Luc began backing up toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena crossed her arms. “There’s nothing to talk about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot Luc a look and he bowed out, much to Serena’s displeasure. She huffed. “There seriously isn’t anything to talk about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning against the desk, I fought to keep a stupid smile off my face… and kiss her, because I really wanted to get my hands all over her right now. Doubted she’d be up for that right this second. “I can’t let you go there by yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This conversation is stupid.” She turned away, tugging a hand through her hair. “You’ve already said your piece last night and so did I. You can’t stop me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not planning on stopping you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena faced me, brows lowered. “Then what are you saying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth dropped open and, yeah, the statement surprised me. Up to three minutes ago, there was no way in hell that I’d go there, but Luc was right about her “well-being” and all that shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head slowly. “You said that going to Colorado was stupid and suicidal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And also pointless,” I added. “But I can’t let you do this alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why? You seemed pretty damn sure about your decision last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really had no idea what to say to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it because Luc was giving me a way to go? Do you actually feel guilty now?” She laughed then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do Arum even feel guilty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Typically? No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes rolled. “Look, I don’t want you going with me because you feel you have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do feel like I have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena’s lips thinned, and then she shook her head again. “This is not your problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are my problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she stared at me like I asked to hump her leg. Perhaps I was saying the wrong things and should shut the fuck up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena blinked rapidly and then she started for the door. “I’m not your problem, Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot anymore. You did your job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s over. Go to your brother. I don’t expect you to risk your life for something that has nothing to do with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait.” I moved so I was in front of Serena and placed my hands on her shoulders. “I’m saying this the wrong way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arched a brow. “You think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a shallow breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to be honest with you. I don’t know what’s going on in my head, Serena. I’ve been thinking things I’ve never thought before, so all of this is new to me. I’m saying the wrong shit, so let me start over?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up at me and then nodded slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t have let you go there by yourself. I thought—fuck—I thought if I said that, you wouldn’t go without me. I wanted you to go to Georgia so you’d be safe, and so that you’d be with me. Not because I thought it was my job. And I didn’t want you to go to Colorado because I don’t want you to get hurt. It is dangerous, and I…I don’t like the thought of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. Next I’ll hold her hand and start talking about butterflies and rainbows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck me. “Look, I get why you need to do this. I don’t agree with it, but I’m going to…be there with you, and afterward we will go to Georgia together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer throat worked. “All of that is…so very human.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft laugh escaped her. “It’s not really a bad thing, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your opinion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena tipped her head back and several moments passed before she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does all of this mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve already risked so much and you’re going to do it again. And you want me to go to Georgia with you.” Two bright pink spots appeared on her cheeks. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say you had feelings for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like a python had wrapped itself around my chest. Even though I didn’t know what it felt like to have “feelings”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor someone that went beyond wanting to fuck them or kill them or get away from them, there was so much truth in her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed at what was most likely a fucked-up expression on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baby steps,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll take baby steps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 28\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to believe that Colorado was in the middle of the United States. I’m not sure why I thought this, but I discovered that Kansas was indeed the middle of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did I know this useless factoid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stopped to fill up on gas in Lebanon. While Hunter did the car thing, I headed in for some snacks. Their signs proudly proclaimed itself as the middle of the United States. Awesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArms full with the kind of food that would add ten pounds to my ass in a heartbeat, I headed across the cracked pavement as a county cruiser rolled in. It slowed down as it passed me, windows up and tinted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shivered in spite of the heat as I hurried to where Hunter was shutting the latch on the gas tank. “See the police car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over his shoulder as he unloaded half of my fattening goodies from my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. What about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I was being paranoid? I shrugged. “I don’t know. Just gave me the creeps. It was like I could feel him…watching me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter opened my car door as he eyeballed the cruiser. With the leather pants and dark sunglasses, he looked pretty badass doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid in as the police car door opened. A portly, older cop hauled himself out and headed into the convenience store without a backward glance in our direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting out the breath I was holding, I smiled up at Hunter. “I guess he was just staring at the junk food I was carrying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked and then closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack on the road, the creeped-out feeling vanished as we dug into the food. I also learned that Hunter only needed one hand to drive. I got real intimately familiar with the other hand. Hunter was…very talented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few times throughout the trip, he picked up on the passing presence of Luxen and Arum, but we didn’t have any problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough his alien senses were going off about a mile outside of Denver. As we traveled further on South Broadway, drawing closer to the post office, acid was chewing a hole through my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter squeezed my knee. “You’re nervous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t help it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then maybe we shouldn’t be doing this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a look. “Too late now. We’re almost there, and who could we seriously trust to do this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to be quick about this.” He coasted into the right lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Implants are everywhere, and with a huge community of Luxen nearby, I won’t be able to sense them until they are right on top of us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart turned over. “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence descended as the post office came into view, and I couldn’t help but ask myself if I was doing the smart thing. I wasn’t, but sometimes the smart thing wasn’t the same thing as the right thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter parked the Porsche behind the post office, near a large delivery truck and loading dock. He looked over at me. “Let’s do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWishing I could sound and look half as ass-kick as he did, I fished the little key off the ring stashed in my purse and then opened the door. No more than a heartbeat later, he was beside me, taking my hand in his. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsession/page-40.html","bookId":1666,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM"}
