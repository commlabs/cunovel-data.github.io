Cneajna was quick in her wolf form, but Ignatius held her off with his bare fists, knocking back her every attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNear the staircase, Laura lay on the marble floor, covered in blood, staring at her arm that lay halfway across the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a howl, Cneajna abandoned her battle with Ignatius, and darted toward me. She transformed as she ran, her long nails attempting to rake me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We cannot kill her!” Ignatius shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ducked under her attack, and brought my elbow back to strike her between her shoulder blades as her speed propelled her past me. She stumbled and nearly fell to her knees. Grabbing her hair, I circled her, wrapping her tresses around her throat, drawing it tight. Planting my foot on her neck, I pinned her to the floor and pulled back her head. My intention was to rip her head from her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do not kill her!” Ignatius shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stared down at the struggling form beneath me, I felt no love for Cneajna. Only hate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She killed Percy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body lost substance as she turned into an icy mist and slid along the floor toward Laura. I screamed in frustration. Ignatius darted across the foyer to stand guard over my fallen fledgling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mist swirled up into a funnel before Ignatius. I could see Cneajna’s form in the swirling wind and snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching out my hand toward Adem, I no longer cared about the treaty with Gavril and Ilinca. He saw the determination in my eyes and tossed the sword to me. I caught it in mid-air and moved to strike down Cneajna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cease!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was startled by the command and turned to see Ilinca standing in the broken doorway. Behind her were the wolf brothers. Clad in a long black cloak, Ilinca strode swiftly into the foyer. The wolf brothers followed, fanning out behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is the one we\u0027ve been following,” one of the brothers said pointing to the woman taking shape out of the whirling mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlinca’s face was a picture of regal authority as she motioned for all to lay down their arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius held Laura against his chest, her amputated arm a mass of ragged flesh and broken bone. Katya struggled to rise to her feet, her complexion almost as white as the snow. Magda extinguished the fire in her hand and trailed behind Adem as he moved to stand beside Ignatius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCneajna fully materialized and the snow drifted to the floor around her. She stood majestically in the ruins of the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly, I lowered the sword and stepped away from Cneajna. My robe was in tatters and my flesh was covered in blood and wounds. I was a sorry, defiant sight, I was certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” Ilinca demanded as she glowered at Cneajna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDipping into a deep curtsey, Cneajna replied, “I am Princess Cneajna, Bride of Count Vlad Dracula of Wallachia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rise, Princess Cneajna of House Dracula,” Ilinca ordered. Her mismatched eyes studied my appearance with interest, but there was no softness to her expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the wolf brothers plucked Laura’s arm from the floor and handed it to Ignatius before returning to his position. The sight of it made me sick with despair. How had I been so foolish not to have realized that Vlad would send Cneajna to return me to the castle? Had not Csilla mentioned a white wolf?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, inform me as to what this conflict is about,” Ilinca said, her tone clipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius and I exchanged glances. Laura was still in his arms as she clutched her severed forearm against her chest. Katya was wise enough to keep her mouth shut and take refuge at Ignatius’s side. Adem and Magda remained silent. I felt every eye upon me waiting for me, yet I knew not what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCneajna resolved the issue. “I came to seek vengeance against the Bride who betrayed Prince Vlad when she slaughtered him for his power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And who is this Bride?” Ilinca asked, her eyes straying toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile curved on Cneajna’s blood red lips as she pointed at me. “Lady Glynis Wright.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then I knew I was doomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 32\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Countess Dracula\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecember 4, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuda\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I despise being imprisoned, I feel strangely safe. I have been locked away in a cell with no windows. The door is made of solid white birch with silver bars. There is apparently a ward upon my jail for I cannot use my powers. I have attempted only once and the pain was so acute I dare not try again. I heard Cneajna’s scream soon after, and I assume she also tried to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter her proclamation, we were both carted off by the wolf brothers. Ilinca’s face had been void of compassion or any other emotion after Cneajna’s accusation. She merely ordered us both to be taken into custody. Magda and Adem attempted to protest, but Ignatius silenced them. I trust that he is the wisest among us and will deal with the situation to the best of his ability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have made a fine mess of it all, yet I do not regret any of my actions. I wanted to live my own life and for a short period of time I was my own mistress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I die, I will only feel pride that I did not capitulate to the unfairness of this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glynis,” Ignatius called out as the cell door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood quickly, gathering my torn, bloodstained robe about me. I had very little dignity left, but I was determined to keep my held head high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the big wolf brothers, whose name I discovered was Ferenc appeared in the doorway. “You have a visitor. My master has been kind enough to allow him to speak to you despite the charges against you. I suggest that you be grateful and do not cause trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t,” I promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, the big vampire stepped away, allowing Ignatius to enter. He carried a bag with him. As the door shut, I pressed a firm kiss to his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen our lips parted, he looked relieved. “I feared you were angry with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Never!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius’s fingers nestled in my hair as he kissed me again with great passion. My lips worshiped his as we indulged in our love for one another. His lips kissed my cheek and brow then he held me tenderly for several precious moments. At last, he set down the items he had brought with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I spoke with Ilinca and she agreed to allow you to freshen up. Gavril has declared that you will face your accuser two nights from now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why so long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, it is terrifyingly quick. I suspect they already believe Cneajna and are only giving us an obligatory time period to collect evidence in your defense.” Ignatius drew out a dress, underclothes, and a single petticoat for me to change into. The blood that had splattered me in my battle had absorbed into my skin leaving it fresh and clean to the eye. “Here, change into these things. Magda says it is your favorite dress.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisrobing, I sighed. “What shall we do? How can I prove that I did not kill Vlad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave that to me,” Ignatius answered as he sat on the cold floor, his back to the wall, his feet planted apart, and his hands on his knees. “I have a plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should have killed her,” I grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you had, you would be dead now. When she attacked Laura first, I knew that Cneajna was attempting to rouse you into a hasty act against her. If you had struck her down, you would die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think her mad enough to sacrifice her very life to take mine?” I pulled on my chemise and fumbled about with my short stay. I despise corsets, but I knew Magda sent it so I would appear like a proper lady. I laced up and reached for my petticoat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius nodded slightly as he watched me dress. His expression was somber, but his eyes did tend to wander over my curves. I enjoyed his attention despite my horrible circumstances. “She is crazed enough to wreak complete vengeance upon you. I spoke with Brice after your arrest. I realized he had been determined to hasten Csilla’s death for a reason. Not just to be free from her, but because Cneajna was compelling him to kill her. Once Csilla died, Cneajna could enter the palace. Servants could not invite Cneajna in. She had attempted to have Brice allow her entry, but Csilla was the only mortal who could claim the palace as her home. Once Cneajna realized this, she compelled Brice to kill her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That traitor!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was under her influence. His mind is muddled. You cannot blame him for his actions. He was like a man trapped within a dream. I also think it is evident that Cneajna killed Percy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name of my beloved friend made me wince. I touched the cameo about my neck. Fighting back tears, I donned my favorite light blue gown. Ignatius rose to help me button it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long has she been in Buda? Do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I do not.” His voice held a hint of a warning and I understood that Ferenc could be listening to our every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What shall we do?” I asked in an agonized voice. “How shall we prove that I did not kill Vlad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking me by the shoulders, Ignatius gaze at me. “Do not fret. I shall find a way. Do not be afraid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I trust you,” I said passionately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, then kissed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius brought me a book and a journal to keep me occupied while I await my fate. The journal is new and quite lovely. The leather is supple to the touch and the pages are edged in gold. I fear I shall not fill many of the pages of this lovely tome. Despite all I have endured, I may be in the final days of my life. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-66.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
