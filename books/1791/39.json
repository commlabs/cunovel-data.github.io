He turned to address Jade. \"And do you promise to tell your husband you love him before this day is out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was radiant. \"I do,\" she promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may kiss the bride,\" the minister announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine happily obliged. When he lifted his head, he said, \"You\u0027re mine now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled her into his arms and hugged her tight. \"I never make the same mistake twice, sweetheart,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand, Caine,\" she replied. She was still on the verge of tears and was desperately trying to maintain her composure. \"Then why didn\u0027t you have the minister make me promise not to leave you? Don\u0027t you believe I\u0027d honor my vows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once you give your word, I know you won\u0027t break it,\" he answered her. \"But you have to give it freely. When you\u0027re ready, you\u0027ll tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t given any more time to talk to her, for the crowd of well-wishers moved in on them to offer their congratulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry stood in the corner with his men, dabbing at his eyes with the edge of his sash. Caine\u0027s mother seemed genuinely happy to have Jade in the family. Of course she didn\u0027t know her new daughter-in-law was a common thief, Jade reminded herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will your uncle be visiting you often?\" Gweneth asked after giving Harry a quick glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He lives a fair distance from England,\" Jade explained. \"He\u0027ll probably come just once a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine heard the last of Jade\u0027s explanation, saw his mother\u0027s quick relief, and started to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother\u0027s a little nervous around your uncle,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you shouldn\u0027t be,\" Jade countered. \"Harry is really a very kind man. Perhaps if you got to know him better . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine\u0027s mother looked absolutely appalled by that suggestion. Jade didn\u0027t know what to make of that. \"That was Harry\u0027s idea a while back,\" Caine explained. \"He wanted to get to know my mother a whole lot better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Jade hadn\u0027t witnessed Harry trying to drag the Duchess out the front door, she didn\u0027t understand why his mother was looking so horrified. She didn\u0027t understand Caine\u0027s amusement, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, son, this isn\u0027t the time . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You called him son,\" Jade blurted out. \"And you called her mother, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is my son,\" Gweneth announced. \"What else would I call him, dear? I have his permission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was so pleased, she couldn\u0027t quit smiling. \"Oh, I misunderstood,\" she whispered. \"I thought he only called you madam, and that you never, ever called him son. I wanted him to belong . . . yes, I was mistaken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Caine nor his mother set her straight. They smiled at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Henry?\" Gweneth suddenly asked. \"Harry\u0027s coming over here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duchess picked up her skirts and went running toward her husband before Caine or Jade could stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were worried I didn\u0027t belong?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked embarrassed. \"Everyone should belong to someone, Caine, even you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry shoved the bouquet of roses in her hands. \"These will be the last roses Jimbo\u0027s going to fetch for you, girl, so you might as well enjoy them.\" He thought his announcement might have sounded surly, so he gave her a kiss on her forehead. Then he turned to Caine. \"I need to give you the telling about the fire we got planned for the ship,\" he said. \"The painting should be done by tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027ll excuse me, I want to talk to Nathan,\" Jade said. She noticed her brother standing all alone on the terrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine listened to Harry as he outlined his plans, but he kept his gaze directed on his bride all the while. Jade faced her brother and spoke to him a long time. Nathan nodded several times. His expression was serious. He looked startled, too, when Jade pulled one of the roses from her cluster and held it out to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. She nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he smiled at his sister, accepted the rose, and pulled her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time since Caine had met Nathan, he was seeing the real man. He was completely unguarded now. The look on his face as he held his sister close was filled with love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine didn\u0027t intrude. He waited until Jade moved away from Nathan and walked back to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry and his men were all watching Nathan now. When Jade\u0027s brother lifted the rose in the air, a resounding cheer went up. The men immediately went to Nathan. Both Jimbo and Matthew pounded him on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that all about?\" Caine asked Jade. He put his arm around her and pulled her into his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave Nathan a wedding present,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes sparkled with merriment. He was sidetracked by the sudden desire to kiss her. \"Well?\" she asked when he just stared down at her so intently. \"Don\u0027t you want to know what I gave him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A rose,\" he whispered. He leaned down and kissed her brow. \"Love, let\u0027s go upstairs for a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe urgency in his voice, added to the look on his face, left her breathless. \"We can\u0027t,\" she whispered. \"We have guests. And we have to go to London,\" she added with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine let out a long sigh. \"Then quit looking at me like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you want to go upstairs, too,\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"But I do want to go upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her then, just the way he wanted to, using his tongue in erotic love play, pretending for just a moment that they were really all alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was as limp as lettuce when he lifted his head back. Lord, how he loved the way she responded to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered the promise she\u0027d given the minister then. \"Jade, wasn\u0027t there something you wanted to say to me?\" he gently prodded when her glazed expression began to fade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she whispered. \"I wanted to tell you I gave Nathan a white rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked so sincere, he knew she wasn\u0027t jesting with him. He decided then he\u0027d have to wait until they were alone before nagging her into admitting she loved him. Damn, he needed to hear her say the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you understand the significance, Caine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"1 gave him my name,\" she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still didn\u0027t understand. \"He\u0027s going to look damned silly answering to your name, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pagan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded when he looked as if he wanted to argue with her. \"Nathan\u0027s going to be Pagan now. It was my gift to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked so pleased with herself, he felt guilty for arguing. \"Jade, Pagan has to die, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just for a little while,\" she replied. \"The men have a new leader, Caine, Nathan wants the Emerald. He has business to take care of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What business?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has to fetch his bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat statement did get a reaction. Caine was stunned. \"Nathan\u0027s married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since he was fourteen,\" she returned. \"By the King\u0027s command.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s his wife?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, delighted by his astonishment. \"That\u0027s the business he has to attend to, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to laugh. \"Do you mean to tell me Nathan lost his wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly,\" she answered. \"She ran away from him. Now can you understand why he\u0027s so cranky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine nodded. \"Sweetheart, how many other secrets have you still to share with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t given time to mull that question over. Sir Richards interrupted with the reminder that it was time they left for London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade, you\u0027d better change into your riding garments,\" Caine instructed. \"We won\u0027t be taking the carriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, quickly said her farewells, and went upstairs to change. Sterns carried her satchel downstairs to give to the stablemaster so he could secure it on the back of her horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine was just putting his jacket on when she walked into his room. He\u0027d already changed into snug-fitting fawn-colored britches and dark brown Hessian boots. He wore the same white shirt but had removed the cravat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ready,\" she called out from the doorway to get his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a hell of a way to begin our marriage,\" Caine muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could have waited,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No, we couldn\u0027t have waited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine? Why couldn\u0027t we have taken the carriage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re taking the back way, through the woods, starting out in the opposite direction, of course, and then circling. We\u0027re going to sneak up on London, sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Just like McKindry,\" she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine slipped the long knife into one boot, his attention turned to his task, and asked, \"Who\u0027s McKindry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man who used the whip on me,\" Jade answered. \"Don\u0027t forget your pistol, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" he answered. He turned to look at her. \"McKindry\u0027s the bastard who marked you?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look so angry, Caine, it was a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I was eight, perhaps nine years old at the time. Harry took care of McKindry. And it was a very good lesson for me,\" she added when his expression turned murderous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What lesson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"McKindry sneaked up behind me,\" she explained. \"After that, every time Harry left me, his very last words were, always, remember McKindry. It was a reminder, you see, that I must always be on my guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell kind of a childhood was that? he asked himself. Caine kept his anger hidden. \"And how often did Harry leave you?\" he asked, his tone mild. He even turned toward the wardrobe so she wouldn\u0027t see his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, all the time,\" she answered. \"Until I was old enough to help, of course. Then I went with him. Caine, you\u0027d really better hurry. Sir Richards will be pacing. I\u0027ll go downstairs .. .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here, Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was a hoarse whisper, his expression solemn. Jade was thoroughly confused by his behavior. She walked over to stand in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Caine?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to remember something else besides McKindry,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could never forget you love me.\" She reached up and gently brushed her fingertips down his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to kiss him then, but he shook his head. \"I also want you to remember something else,\" he whispered. \"Remember your promise to me that you\u0027re never, ever going on the ocean again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened. \"But I didn\u0027t promise you . ..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise me now, then,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was looking quite stunned. Caine was satisfied by that reaction. \"I\u0027ll tell Harry he\u0027ll have to come to England if he wants to see you. We won\u0027t be going to him. I\u0027ll also tell him I made you promise me. He won\u0027t argue over that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you known, Caine?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you\u0027re afraid of the water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe timidly nodded. \"Since the first nightmare,\" he explained. He took her back into his arms. \"You\u0027ve been worried, haven\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little,\" she whispered. Then she shook her head. \"No, Caine, I wasn\u0027t just a little worried. I was terrified. Harry wouldn\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long ponderous moment passed before she whispered, \"Caine, do you think me a coward for being afraid of the water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have to ask me that question?\" he replied. \"Don\u0027t you already know the answer, Jade?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled then. \"No, you don\u0027t believe I\u0027m a coward. I\u0027m sorry for insulting you by asking. I\u0027m just not use to admitting. ..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart, Poseidon wouldn\u0027t go back in the water if he\u0027d been through your terror.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to laugh and cry at the same time. She was so relieved he\u0027d just taken her burden away, she felt positively light-headed. \"Nathan\u0027s stronger than 1 am,\" she said then. \"He\u0027s going on the waters again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan isn\u0027t human, love, so he doesn\u0027t count,\" Caine replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, he\u0027s human, all right. If I tell you a secret, will you keep it? You won\u0027t torment my brother with . ..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan gets seasick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine laughed. \"He\u0027s going to make a hell of a pirate then,\" he drawled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d blurted out her confession, her face hidden in the lapels of his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quit laughing. \"Did you say something?\" he asked, pretending he hadn\u0027t heard her. He nudged her chin up and stared down into her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took her a long time to get the words out again, and every ounce of courage she possessed. Her throat tightened up, her heart hammered a wild beat, and her stomach felt like it was tying itself in knots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t have been able to tell him if he hadn\u0027t helped. The look on his face was so filled with love, it made some of the panic ebb away. The dimple did the rest. \"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt relieved, until she burst into tears again. \"Was that so difficult? To tell me you loved me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was,\" she whispered while he kissed her tears away. \"I\u0027m not at all used to telling what\u0027s in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t believe I like it at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have laughed if she hadn\u0027t sounded so damned vulnerable. He kissed her instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t like making love the first time, either,\" he reminded her before kissing her sweet mouth once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them were shaking when they drew apart. He would have dragged her over to the bed if Sir Richards\u0027 bellow hadn\u0027t interrupted them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sighed in unison. \"Come along, sweetheart. It\u0027s time to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started out the doorway, tugging her by her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyons and Richards were waiting for them in the foyer. The time for gaiety was quickly put aside. They walked in silence through the backwoods where Matthew and Jimbo waited with their horses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine took the lead. Jade was next in line, with Lyon responsible for protecting her back. Sir Richards trailed last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine was cautious to the point of fanaticism. The only time they stopped to rest was when he backtracked on his own to make certain they weren\u0027t being followed. Still, Jade didn\u0027t mind the inconvenience.
