How was I to know? When he brought our pizza for dinner, I gave him one of the American silver coins that we received from the airport sweet shop called Cinnabon. He scoffed at me - scoffed - then, thinking better of it, he said, \"Se\u0026amp;ntilde;or, I know you are foreign, so you do not know, but this is a very insulting tip. Better you just sign the room service slip so I get the fee that is added automatically. I tell you this because you have been very kind, and I know you do not mean to offend, but another of the waiters would spit in your food if you should offer him this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at the angel, who, as usual, was lying on the bed watching television, and for the first time I realized that he did not understand Jesus\u0027 language. He did not possess the gift of tongues he had bestowed on me. He spoke Aramaic to me, and he seemed to know Hebrew and enough English to understand television, but of Spanish he understood not a word. I apologized to Jesus and sent him on his way with a promise that I would make it up to him, then I wheeled on the angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fool, these coins, these dimes, are nearly worthless in this country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, they look like the silver dinars we dug up in Jerusalem, they are worth a fortune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right, in a way. After he called me up from the dead I led him to a cemetery in the valley of Ben Hiddon, and there, hidden behind a stone where Judas had put it two thousand years ago, was the blood money - thirty silver dinars. But for a little tarnish, they looked just as they did on the day I had taken them, and they were almost identical to the coin this country calls the dime (except for the image of Tiberius on the dinars, and some other Caesar on the dime). We had taken the dinars to an antiquities dealer in the old city (which looked nearly the same as it did when I\u0027d last walked there, except that the Temple was gone and in its place two great mosques). The merchant gave us twenty thousand dollars in American money for them. It was this money that we had traveled on, and deposited at the hotel desk for our expenses. The angel told me the dimes must have the same worth as the dinars, and I, like a fool, believed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have told me,\" I said to the angel. \"If I could leave this room I would know myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have work to do,\" the angel said. Then he leapt to his feet and shouted at the television, \"The wrath of the Lord shall fall upon ye, Stephanos!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in the hell are you shouting at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe angel wagged a finger at the screen, \"He has exchanged Catherine\u0027s baby for its evil twin, which he fathered with her sister while she was in a coma, yet Catherine does not realize his evil deed, as he has had his face changed to impersonate the bank manager who is foreclosing on Catherine\u0027s husband\u0027s business. If I was not trapped here I would personally drag the fiend straight to hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor days now the angel had been watching serial dramas on television, alternately shouting at the screen or bursting into tears. He had stopped reading over my shoulder, so I had just tried to ignore him, but now I realized what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not real, Raziel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s drama, like the Greeks used to do. They are actors in a play.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no one could pretend to such evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not all. Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus? Not real. Characters in a play.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lying dog!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027d ever leave the room and look at how real people talk you\u0027d know that, you yellow-haired cretin. But no, you stay here perched on my shoulder like a trained bird. I am dead two thousand years and even I know better.\" (I still need to get a look at that book in the dresser. I thought maybe, just maybe, I could goad the angel into giving me five minutes privacy.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know nothing,\" said Raziel. \"I have destroyed whole cities in my time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of makes me wonder if you destroyed the right ones. That\u0027d be embarrassing, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen an advertisement came on the screen for a magazine that promised to \"fill in all the blanks\" and give the real inside story to all of soap operas: Soap Opera Digest. I watched the angel\u0027s eyes widen. He grabbed the phone and rang the front desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need that book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have them send up Jesus,\" I said. \"He\u0027ll help you get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn our first day of work, Joshua and I were up before dawn. We met near the well and filled the waterskins our fathers had given us, then ate our breakfasts, flatbread and cheese, as we walked together to Sepphoris. The road, although packed dirt most of the way, was smooth and easy to walk. (If Rome saw to anything in its territories, it was the lifelines of its army.) As we walked we watched the rock-strewn hills turn pink under the rising sun, and I saw Joshua shudder as if a chill wind had danced up his spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The glory of God is in everything we see,\" he said. \"We must never forget that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just stepped in camel dung. Tomorrow let\u0027s leave after it\u0027s light out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just realized it, that is why the old woman wouldn\u0027t live again. I forgot that it wasn\u0027t my power that made her arise, it was the Lord\u0027s. I brought her back for the wrong reason, out of arrogance, so she died a second time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It squished over the side of my sandal. Well, that\u0027s going to smell all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But perhaps it was because I did not touch her. When I\u0027ve brought other creatures back to life, I\u0027ve always touched them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there something in the Law about taking your camel off the road to do his business? There should be. If not the Law of Moses, then the Romans should have one. I mean, they won\u0027t hesitate to crucify a Jew who rebels, there should be some punishment for messing up their roads. Don\u0027t you think? I\u0027m not saying crucifixion, but a good smiting in the mouth or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how could I have touched the corpse when it is forbidden by the Law? The mourners would have stopped me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we stop for a second so I can scrape off my sandal? Help me find a stick. That pile was as big as my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not listening to me, Biff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am listening. Look, Joshua, I don\u0027t think the Law applies to you. I mean, you\u0027re the Messiah, God is supposed to tell you what he wants, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ask, but I receive no answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, you\u0027re doing fine. Maybe that woman didn\u0027t live again because she was stubborn. Old people are that way. You have to throw water on my grandfather to get him up from his nap. Try a young dead person next time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I am not really the Messiah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you\u0027re not sure? The angel didn\u0027t give it away? You think that God might be playing a joke on you? I don\u0027t think so. I don\u0027t know the Torah as well as you, Joshua, but I don\u0027t remember God having a sense of humor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, a grin. \"He gave me you as a best friend, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me find a stick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think I\u0027ll make a good stonemason?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just don\u0027t be better at it than I am. That\u0027s all I ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have I been saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really think Maggie likes me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to be like this every morning? Because if you are, you can walk to work alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gates of Sepphoris were like a funnel of humanity. Farmers poured out into their fields and groves, craftsmen and builders crowded in, while merchants hawked their wares and beggars moaned at the roadside. Joshua and I stopped outside the gates to marvel and were nearly run down by a man leading a string of donkeys laden with baskets of stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t that we had never seen a city before. Jerusalem was fifty times larger than Sepphoris, and we had been there many times for feast days, but Jerusalem was a Jewish city - it was the Jewish city. Sepphoris was the Roman fortress city of Galilee, and as soon as we saw the statue of Venus at the gates we knew that this was something different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI elbowed Joshua in the ribs. \"Graven image.\" I had never seen the human form depicted before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sinful,\" Joshua said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s naked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s completely naked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is forbidden. We should go away from here, find your father.\" He caught me by my sleeve and dragged me through the gates into the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can they allow that?\" I asked. \"You\u0027d think that our people would tear it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did, a band of Zealots. Joseph told me. The Romans caught them and crucified them by this road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never told me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joseph told me not to speak of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could see her breasts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I not think about it? I\u0027ve never seen a breast without a baby attached to it. They\u0027re more - more friendly in pairs like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which way to where we are supposed to work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father said to come to the western corner of the city and we would see where the work was being done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then come along.\" He was still dragging me, his head down, stomping along like an angry mule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think Maggie\u0027s breasts will look like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father had been commissioned to build a house for a wealthy Greek on the western side of the city. When Joshua and I arrived my father was already there, directing the slaves who were hoisting a cut stone into place on the wall. I suppose I expected something different. I suppose I was surprised that anyone, even a slave, would do as my father instructed. The slaves were Nubians, Egyptians, Phoenicians, criminals, debtors, spoils of war, accidents of birth; they were wiry, filthy men, many wearing nothing more than sandals and a loincloth. In another life they might have commanded an army or lived in a palace, but now they sweated in the morning chill, moving stones heavy enough to break a donkey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are these your slaves?\" Joshua asked my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I a rich man, Joshua? No, these slaves belong to the Romans. The Greek who is building this house has hired them for the construction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do they do as you ask? There are so many of them. You are only one man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father hung his head. \"I hope that you never see what the lead tips of a Roman whip do to a man\u0027s body. All of these men have, and even seeing it has broken their spirit as men. I pray for them every night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate the Romans,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you, little one, do you?\" A man\u0027s voice from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hail, Centurion,\" my father said, his eyes going wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua and I turned to see Justus Gallicus, the centurion from the funeral at Japhia, standing among the slaves. \"Alphaeus, it seems you are raising a litter of Zealots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father put his hands on my and Joshua\u0027s shoulders. \"This is my son, Levi, and his friend Joshua. They begin their apprenticeship today. Just boys,\" he said, by way of apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustus approached, looked quickly at me, then stared at Joshua for a long time. \"I know you, boy. I\u0027ve seen you before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The funeral at Japhia,\" I said quickly. I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off of the wasp-waisted short sword that hung from the centurion\u0027s belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" the Roman seemed to be searching his memory. \"Not Japhia. I\u0027ve seen this face in a picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That can\u0027t be,\" my father said. \"We are forbidden by our faith from depicting the human form.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustus glared at him. \"I am not a stranger to your people\u0027s primitive beliefs, Alphaeus. Still, this boy is familiar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua stared up at the centurion with a completely blank expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel for these slaves, boy? You would free them if you could?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua nodded. \"I would. A man\u0027s spirit should be his own to give to God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, there was a slave about eighty years ago who talked like you. He raised an army of slaves against Rome, beat back two of our armies, took over all the territories south of Rome. It\u0027s a story every Roman soldier must learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, what happened?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We crucified him,\" Justus said. \"By the side of the road, and his body was eaten by ravens. The lesson we all learn is that nothing can stand against Rome. A lesson you need to learn, boy, along with your stonecutting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then another Roman soldier approached, a legionnaire, not wearing the cape or the helmet crest of the centurion. He said something to Justus in Latin, then looked at Joshua and paused. In rough Aramaic he said, \"Hey, didn\u0027t I see that kid on some bread once?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t him,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Sure looks like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope, that was another kid on the bread.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was me,\" said Joshua.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backhanded him across the forehead, knocking him to the ground. \"No it wasn\u0027t. He\u0027s insane. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier shook his head and hurried off after Justus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offered a hand to help Joshua up. \"You\u0027re going to have to learn to lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am? But I feel like I\u0027m here to tell the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, sure, but not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t exactly know what I expected it would be like working as a stonemason, but I know that in less than a week Joshua was having second thoughts about not becoming a carpenter. Cutting great stones with small iron chisels was very hard work. Who knew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look around, do you see any trees?\" Joshua mocked. \"Rocks, Josh, rocks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only hard because we don\u0027t know what we\u0027re doing. It will get easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua looked at my father, who was stripped to the waist, chiseling away on a stone the size of a donkey, while a dozen slaves waited to hoist it into place. He was covered with gray dust and streams of sweat drew dark lines between cords of muscle straining in his back and arms. \"Alphaeus,\" Joshua called, \"does the work get easier once you know what you are doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your lungs grow thick with stone dust and your eyes bleary from the sun and fragments thrown up by the chisel. You pour your lifeblood out into works of stone for Romans who will take your money in taxes to feed soldiers who will nail your people to crosses for wanting to be free. Your back breaks, your bones creak, your wife screeches at you, and your children torment you with open, begging mouths, like greedy baby birds in the nest. You go to bed every night so tired and beaten that you pray to the Lord to send the angel of death to take you in your sleep so you don\u0027t have to face another morning. It also has its downside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Joshua said. He looked at me, one eyebrow raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I for one, am excited,\" I said. \"I\u0027m ready to cut some stone. Stand back, Josh, my chisel is on fire. Life is stretched out before us like a great bazaar, and I can\u0027t wait to taste the sweets to be found there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh tilted his head like a bewildered dog. \"I didn\u0027t get that from your father\u0027s answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s sarcasm, Josh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarcasm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s from the Greek, sarkasmos. To bite the lips. It means that you aren\u0027t really saying what you mean, but people will get your point. I invented it, Bartholomew named it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if the village idiot named it, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go, you got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarcasm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I meant it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that sarcasm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Irony, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t the slightest idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re being ironic now, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I really don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should ask the idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027ve got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarcasm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Biff, are you sure you weren\u0027t sent here by the Devil to vex me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could be. How am I doing so far? You feel vexed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. And my hands hurt from holding the chisel and mallet.\" He struck the chisel with his wooden mallet and sprayed us both with stone fragments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe God sent me to talk you into being a stonemason so you would hurry up and go be the Messiah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struck the chisel again, then spit and sputtered through the fragments that flew. \"I don\u0027t know how to be the Messiah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what, a week ago we didn\u0027t know how to be stonemasons and look at us now. It gets easier once you know what you\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you being ironic again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, I hope not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was two months before we actually saw the Greek who had commissioned my father to build the house. He was a short, soft-looking little man, who wore a robe that was as white as any worn by the Levite priests, with a border of interlocking rectangles woven around the hem in gold. He arrived in a pair of chariots, followed on foot by two body slaves and a half-dozen bodyguards who looked like Phoenicians. I say a pair of chariots because he rode with a driver in the lead chariot, but behind them they pulled a second chariot in which stood the ten-foot-tall marble statue of a naked man. The Greek climbed down from his chariot and went directly to my father. Joshua and I were mixing a batch of mortar at the time and we paused to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Graven image,\" Joshua said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saw it,\" I said. \"As graven images go, I like Venus over by the gate better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That statue is not Jewish,\" Joshua said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely not Jewish,\" I said. The statue\u0027s manhood, although abundant, was not circumcised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alphaeus,\" the Greek said, \"why haven\u0027t you set the floor of the gymnasium yet? I\u0027ve brought this statue to display in the gymnasium, and there\u0027s just a hole in the ground instead of a gymnasium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, this ground is not suitable for building. I can\u0027t build on sand. I\u0027ve had the slaves dig down in the sand until they hit bedrock. Now it has to be back-filled in with stone, then pounded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I want to place my statue,\" the Greek whined. \"It\u0027s come all the way from Athens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you rather your house fall down around your precious statue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk to me that way, Jew, I am paying you well to build this house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I am building this house well, which means not on the sand. So store your statue and let me do my work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, unload it. You, slaves, help unload my statue.\" The Greek was talking to Joshua and me. \"All of you, help unload my statue.\" He pointed to the slaves who had been pretending to work since the Greek arrived, but who weren\u0027t sure that it was in their best interest to look like a part of a project about which the master seemed displeased. They all looked up with a surprised \"Who, me?\" expression on their faces, which I noticed was the same in any language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slaves moved to the chariot and began untying the ropes that held the statue in place. The Greek looked to us. \"Are you deaf, slaves? Help them!\" He stormed back to his chariot and grabbed a whip out of the driver\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are not slaves,\" my father said. \"Those are my apprentices.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Greek wheeled on him. \"And I should care about that? Move, boys! Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Joshua said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought the Greek would explode. He raised the whip as if to strike. \"What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said, no.\" I stepped up to Joshua\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My people believe that graven images, statues, are sinful,\" my father said, his voice on the edge of panic. \"The boys are only being true to our God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that is a statue of Apollo, a real god, so they will help unload it, as will you, or I\u0027ll find another mason to build my house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Joshua repeated. \"We will not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, you leprous jar of camel snot,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua looked at me, sort of disgusted. \"Jeez, Biff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Greek screeched and started to swing the whip. The last thing I saw as I covered my face was my father diving toward the Greek. I would take a lash for Joshua, but I didn\u0027t want to lose an eye. I braced for the sting that never came. There was a thump, then a twanging sound, and when I uncovered my face, the Greek was lying on his back in the dirt, his white robe covered with dust, his face red with rage. The whip was extended out behind him, and on its tip stood the armored hobnail boot of Gaius Justus Gallicus, the centurion. The Greek rolled in the dirt, ready to vent his ire on whoever had stayed his hand, but when he saw who it was, he went limp and pretended to cough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the Greek\u0027s bodyguards started to step forward. Justus pointed a finger at the guard. \"Will you stand down, or would you rather feel the foot of the Roman Empire on your neck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard stepped back into line with his companions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Roman was grinning like a mule eating an apple, not in the least concerned with allowing the Greek to save face. \"So, Castor, am I to gather that you need to conscript more Roman slaves to help build your house? Or is it true what I hear about you Greeks, that whipping young boys is an entertainment for you, not a disciplinary action?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Greek spit out a mouthful of dust as he climbed to his feet. \"The slaves I have will be sufficient for the task, won\u0027t they, Alphaeus?\" He turned to my father, his eyes pleading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father seemed to be caught between two evils, and unable to decide which was the lesser of them. \"Probably,\" he said, finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, good, then,\" Justus said. \"I will expect a bonus payment for the extra work they are doing. Carry on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustus walked through the construction site, acting as if every eye was not on him, or not caring, and paused as he passed Joshua and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leprous jar of camel snot?\" he said under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old Hebrew blessing?\" I ventured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two should be in the hills with the other Hebrew rebels.\" The Roman laughed, tousled our hair, then walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunset was turning the hillsides pink as we walked home to Nazareth that evening. In addition to being almost exhausted from the work, Joshua seemed vexed by the events of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know that - about not being able to build on sand?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, my father\u0027s been talking about it for a long time. You can build on sand, but what you build will fall down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua nodded thoughtfully. \"What about soil? Dirt? Is it okay to build on that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rock is best, but I suppose hard dirt is good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to remember that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe seldom saw Maggie in those days after we began working with my father. I found myself looking forward to the Sabbath, when we would go to the synagogue and I would mill around outside, among the women, while the men were inside listening to the reading of the Torah or the arguments of the Pharisees. It was one of the few times I could talk to Maggie without Joshua around, for though he resented the Pharisees even then, he knew he could learn from them, so he spent the Sabbath listening to their teachings. I still wonder if this time I stole with Maggie somehow represented a disloyalty to Joshua, but later, when I asked him about it, he said, \"God is willing to forgive you the sin that you carry for being a child of man, but you must forgive yourself for having once been a child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose that\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it\u0027s right, I\u0027m the Son of God, you dolt. Besides, Maggie always wanted to talk about me anyway, didn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not always,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the Sabbath before the murder, I found Maggie outside the synagogue, sitting by herself under a date palm tree. I shuffled up to her to talk, but kept looking at my feet. I knew that if I looked into her eyes I would forget what I was talking about, so I only looked at her in brief takes, the way a man will glance up at the sun on a sweltering day to confirm the source of the heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Joshua?\" were the first words out of her mouth, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Studying with the men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed disappointed for a moment, but then brightened. \"How is your work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard, I like playing better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is Sepphoris like? Is it like Jerusalem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s smaller. But there are a lot of Romans there.\" She\u0027d seen Romans. I needed something to impress her. \"And there are graven images - statues of people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie covered her mouth to stifle a giggle. \"Statues, really? I would love to see them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then come with us, we are leaving tomorrow very early, before anyone is awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t. Where would I tell my mother I was going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her that you are going to Sepphoris with the Messiah and his pal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes went wide and I looked away quickly, before I was caught in their spell. \"You shouldn\u0027t talk that way, Biff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the angel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said yourself that we shouldn\u0027t say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was only joking. Tell your mother that I told you about a beehive that I found and that you want to go find some honey while the bees are still groggy from the morning cold. It\u0027s a full moon tonight, so you\u0027ll be able to see. She just might believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She might, but she\u0027ll know I was lying when I don\u0027t bring home any honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her it was a hornets\u0027 nest. She thinks Josh and I are stupid anyway, doesn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She thinks that Joshua is touched in the head, but you, yes, she thinks you\u0027re stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see, my plan is working. For it is written that \u0027if the wise man always appears stupid, his failures do not disappoint, and his success gives pleasant surprise.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie smacked me on the leg. \"That is not written.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure it is, Imbeciles three, verse seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no book of Imbeciles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drudges five-four?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re making that up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with us, you can be back to Nazareth before it\u0027s time to fetch the morning water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why so early? What are you two up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to circumcise Apollo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t say anything, she just looked at me, as if she would see \"Liar\" written across my forehead in fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t my idea,\" I said. \"It was Joshua\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go then,\" she said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lamb-the-gospel-according-to-biff-christ-s-childhood-pal/page-4.html","bookId":2643,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:20 PM"}
