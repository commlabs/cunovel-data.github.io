Facing the boy at the head of the table, Alexander sang, \"He\u0027s green, he\u0027s lean, snot he\u0027s never seen, his name is Shancus - happy birthday!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody cheered. Thirty performers and helpers from the Cirque Du Freak were seated around a huge oval table, celebrating Shancus Von\u0027s eighth birthday. It was a chilly April day, and most people were wrapped up warmly. The table was overflowing with cakes, sweets and drinks, and we were digging in happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alexander Ribs sat down, Truska - a woman who could grow her beard at will - stood and sung another birthday greeting. \"The only things he fears is his mother\u0027s flying ears, his name is Shancus - happy birthday!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerla snapped one of her ears off when she heard that and flicked it at her son. He ducked and it flew high over his head, then circled back to Merla, who caught and reattached it to the side of her head. Everyone laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Shancus had been named in my honour, I guessed I\u0027d better chip in with a verse of my own. Thinking quickly, I stood, cleared my throat, and chanted, \"He\u0027s scaly and he\u0027s great, today he has turned eight, his name is Shancus - happy birthday!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, godfather,\" Shancus smirked. I wasn\u0027t really his godfather, but he liked to pretend I was - especially when it was his birthday and he was looking for a cool present!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few others took turns singing birthday greetings to the snake-boy, then Evra stood and wrapped up the song with, \"Despite the pranks you pull, your mum and I love you, pesky Shancus - happy birthday!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was lots of applause, then the women at the table shuffled over to hug and kiss Shancus. He pulled a mortified expression, but I could see he was delighted by the attention. His younger brother, Urcha, was jealous and sat a little way back from the table, sulking. Their sister, Lilia, was rooting through the piles of presents Shancus had received, seeing if there was anything of interest to a five-year-old girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra went to try and cheer up Urcha. Unlike Shancus and Lilia, the middle Von child was an ordinary human and he felt he was the odd one out. Evra and Merla had a tough time making him feel special. I saw Evra slip a small present to Urcha, and heard him whisper, \"Don\u0027t tell the others!\" Urcha looked much happier after that. He joined Shancus at the table and tucked into a pile of small cakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made my way over to where Evra was beaming at his family. \"Eight years,\" I remarked, clapping Evra on his left shoulder (some of his scales had been sliced away from his right shoulder a long time ago, and he didn\u0027t like people touching him there). \"I bet it feels like eight weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know how right you are,\" Evra smiled. \"Time flies when you have kids. You\u0027ll find out yourself one?\" He stopped and grimaced. \"Sorry. I forgot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" I said. As a half-vampire, I was sterile. I could never have children. It was one of the drawbacks to being part of the clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you going to show the snake to Shancus?\" Evra asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later,\" I grinned. \"I gave him a book earlier. He thinks that\u0027s his real present - he looked disgusted! I\u0027ll let him enjoy the rest of the party, then hit him with the snake when he thinks the fun is over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShancus already owned a snake, but I\u0027d bought a new one for him, larger and more colourful. Evra helped me choose it. His old snake would be passed on to Urcha, so both boys would have cause to celebrate tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerla called Evra back to the party - Lilia had got stuck in wrapping paper and needed to be rescued. I watched my friends for a minute or two, then turned my back on the festivities and walked away. I wandered through the maze of vans and tents of the Cirque Du Freak, coming to a halt near the Wolf Man\u0027s cage. The savage man-beast was snoring. I took a small jar of pickled onions out of my pocket and ate one, smiling sadly as I remembered where my taste for pickled onions had come from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat memory led to others, and I found myself looking back over the years, recalling major events, remarkable triumphs, and sickening losses. The night of my blooding, when Mr Crepsley pumped his vampiric blood into me. Slowly coming to terms with my appetite and powers. Sam Grest - the original pickled onion connoisseur. My first girlfriend, Debbie Hemlock. Learning about the vampaneze. The trek to Vampire Mountain. My Trials, where I\u0027d had to prove myself worthy of being a child of the night. Failing and running away. The revelation that a Vampire General - Kurda Smahlt - was a traitor, in league with the vampaneze. Exposing Kurda. Becoming a Prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wolf Man stirred and I walked on, not wanting to wake him. My mind continued to turn over old memories. Kurda telling us why he\u0027d betrayed the clan - the Lord of the Vampaneze had arisen and stood poised to lead his people into war against the vampires. The early years of the War of the Scars, when I\u0027d lived in Vampire Mountain. Leaving the safety of the fortress to hunt for the Vampaneze Lord, accompanied by Mr Crepsley and Harkat. Meeting Vancha March, the third hunter - only he, Mr Crepsley or I could kill the Vampaneze Lord. Travelling with a witch called Evanna. Clashing with the Lord of the Vampaneze, unaware of his identity until afterwards, when he\u0027d escaped with his protector, Gannen Harst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to stop there - the next set of memories was the most painful - but my thoughts raced on. Returning to the city of Mr Crepsley\u0027s youth. Running into Debbie again - an adult now, a teacher. Other faces from the past - R.V. and Steve Leopard. The former used to be an eco-warrior, a man who blamed me for the loss of his hands. He\u0027d become a vampaneze and was part of a plot to lure my allies and me underground, where the Lord of the Vampaneze could kill us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve was part of that plot too, though at first I thought he was on our side. Steve was my best friend when we were kids. We went to the Cirque Du Freak together. He recognized Mr Crepsley and asked to be his assistant. Mr Crepsley refused - he said Steve had evil blood. Later, Steve was bitten by Mr Crepsley\u0027s poisonous tarantula. Only Mr Crepsley could cure him. I became a half-vampire to save Steve\u0027s life, but Steve didn\u0027t see it that way. He thought I\u0027d betrayed him and taken his place among the vampires. He became hell-bent on revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderground in Mr Crepsley\u0027s city. Facing the vampaneze in a chamber Steve had named the Cavern of Retribution. Me, Mr Crepsley, Vancha, Harkat, Debbie and a police officer called Alice Burgess. A huge fight. Mr Crepsley faced the man we thought was the Lord of the Vampaneze. He killed him. But then Steve killed Mr Crepsley by knocking him into a pit of stakes. A gut-churning blow, made all the worse when Steve revealed the shocking truth ?he was the real Lord of the Vampaneze!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached the last of the tents and stopped, gazing around, half-dazed. We\u0027d set up camp in an abandoned football stadium. It used to be the home ground of the local football team, but they\u0027d moved to a new, purpose-built stadium some years ago. The old stadium was due to be demolished - apartment blocks were to be built over the ruins - but not for several months yet. It was an eerie feeling, staring around at thousands of empty seats in the ghost stadium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhosts? That put me in mind of my next, bizarre quest with Harkat, in what we now knew was a shade of the future. Once again I began to wonder if that ruined future world was unavoidable. Could I prevent it by killing Steve, or was it destined to come no matter who won the War of the Scars?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I got too worked up about it, someone stepped up beside me and said, \"Is the party over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around and saw the scarred, stitched-together, grey-skinned face of Harkat Mulds. \"No,\" I smiled. \"It\u0027s winding down, but it hasn\u0027t finished yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I was afraid I\u0027d miss it.\" Harkat had been out on the streets most of the day, handing out fliers for the Cirque Du Freak - that was one of his regular jobs every time we arrived at a new venue. He stared at me with his round, green, lidless eyes. \"How do you feel?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strange. Worried. Unsure of myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been out there yet?\" Harkat waved a hand at the town beyond the walls of the stadium. I shook my head. \"Are you going to go, or do you plan? to hide here until we leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go,\" I said. \"But it\u0027s hard. So many years. So many memories.\" This was the real reason I was so fixed on the past. After all these years of travel, I\u0027d returned home to the town where I was born and had lived all my human life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if my family\u0027s still here?\" I asked Harkat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your parents?\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Annie, my sister. They think I\u0027m dead. What if they see me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would they recognize you?\" Harkat asked. \"It\u0027s been a long time. People change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humans do,\" I snorted. \"But I\u0027ve only aged four or five years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it wouldn\u0027t be a bad thing to? see them again,\" Harkat said. \"Imagine their joy if they learnt that? you were still alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said forcefully. \"I\u0027ve been thinking about that ever since Mr Tall told me we were coming here. Iwant to track them down. It would be wonderful for me - but terrible for them. They buried me. They\u0027ve done their grieving and have hopefully moved on with their lives. It wouldn\u0027t be fair to bring back all those old pains and torments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I agree with that,\" Harkat said, \"but it\u0027s? your decision. So stay here with the Cirque. Lay low. Hide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" I sighed. \"This is my home town. I\u0027ve got an itch to walk the streets again, see how much has changed, look for old faces that I used to know. I want to find out what happened to my friends. The wise thing would be to keep my head down - but when didI ever do the wise thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And maybe trouble would find you? even if you did,\" Harkat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" I frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarkat glanced around uneasily. \"I have a strange feeling about? this place,\" he croaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What sort of a feeling?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard to explain. Just a feeling that this is? a dangerous place, but also the place where? we\u0027re meant to be. Something\u0027s going to happen here. Don\u0027t you sense it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No - but my thoughts are all overthe place right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve often discussed your decision to? stay with the Cirque,\" Harkat reminded me, making little of the many arguments we\u0027d had about whether or not I should leave and seek out the Vampire Generals. He believed I was hiding from my duty, that we should seek out the vampires and resume the hunt for the Vampaneze Lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not starting that again, are you?\" I groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"The opposite. I now think you were right. If we hadn\u0027t stuck with the Cirque? we wouldn\u0027t be here now. And, as I said, I think we\u0027re? meant to be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied Harkat silently. \"What do you think will happen?\" I asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The feeling isn\u0027t that specific,\" Harkat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you had to guess?\" I pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarkat shrugged awkwardly. \"I think we might run into? Steve Leonard, or find a clue which? points towards him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy insides tightened at the thought of facing Steve again. I hated him for what he\u0027d done to us, especially killing Mr Crepsley. But just before he died, Mr Crepsley warned me not to devote my life to hatred. He said it would twist me like Steve. So although I hungered for the chance to get even, I worried about it too. I didn\u0027t know how I\u0027d react when I saw him again, whether I\u0027d be able to control my emotions or give in to blind, hateful rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re frightened,\" Harkat noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But not of Steve. I\u0027m frightened of whatI might do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Harkat smiled. \"You\u0027ll be OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if?\" I hesitated, afraid I\u0027d jinx myself. But that was silly, so I came out with it. \"Whatif Steve tries to use my family against me? What if he threatens my parents or Annie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarkat nodded slowly. \"I thought of that already. It\u0027s the sort of sick stunt I can? imagine him pulling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will I do if he does?\" I asked. \"He already sucked Debbie into his insane plot to destroy me - not to mention R.V. What if?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy,\" Harkat soothed me. \"The first thing is to find out if? they still live here. If they do, we can arrange protection? for them. We\u0027ll establish a watch around their house? and guard them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The two of us can\u0027t protect them by ourselves,\" I grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027re not by ourselves,\" Harkat said. \"We have many friends in? the Cirque. They\u0027ll help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think it\u0027s fair to involve them?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They may already be involved,\" Harkat said. \"Their destinies are tied to ours, I think. That may be another reason why you felt? you had to stay here.\" Then he smiled. \"Come on - I want to get to the party before? Rhamus scoffs all the cakes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, I put my fears behind me for a while and walked back through the campsite with Harkat. But if I\u0027d known just how closely the destinies of my freakish friends were connected with mine, and the anguish I was steering them towards, I\u0027d have about-faced and immediately fled to the other end of the world. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-of-the-shadows-the-saga-of-darren-shan-11/page-3.html","bookId":2447,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:20:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:20:12 PM"}
