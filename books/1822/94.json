You’ve come just at the right time. May I introduce you to my family?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You may,’ Mr Ambrose granted with infinite generosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raven-haired beauty stepped up beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo… not raven-haired. Crow-haired! She’s a crow! She’s just the sort to pick at rotting carcasses. She’s probably just waiting to sink her beak into Mr Ambrose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. And it was an artificial smile that didn’t reach her eyes. I knew it! I knew she couldn’t be trusted. You could never trust females - they were so bloody conniving! Apart from unfortunate young secretaries and other kinds of feminists, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe directed her smile at him, and he, although he didn’t smile, nodded graciously. More graciously than he had ever nodded at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thousand questions buzzed through my head. Who was she? Why was she here? Why had he brought her? Was she rich? Was he in love with her? Were they engaged? And most important of all, why the blazes were all of my questions about her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced my eyes back to Mr Ambrose. It was him I should be concerned about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was concerned about her. Or, more specifically, her and him in combination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes snapped back to her. Heat welled up inside me. The heat of some dark unnamed emotion. Was it possible to want to claw a stranger’s eyes out? Well, people said there was such a thing as love at first sight. Why not hate at first sight, then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Um, Miss Linton? My hand, if you please?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking in surprise, so suddenly ripped from my thoughts, I looked up at Lord Dalgliesh, then down at his hand, which I was clenching so tightly that it was white from lack of blood. I let go as if I had burned myself. ‘Oh, excuse me!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No matter,’ he said, took his other hand off my arm and stepped back from me. His attention seemed to be on something else. He was looking towards the two newcomers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, if he wasn’t interested in me any longer, all the better. Quickly, I stepped back and ducked into the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust in time: Mr Ambrose had spotted Lord Dalgliesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment suspended in time. The two men’s eyes met, and it was as if they were two lions meeting at a Sahara watering hole. They were the kings, the rest of us were just so many zebras and antelopes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Ambrose prowled forward. Lord Dalgliesh, ignoring Lady Metcalf, who was still trying to engage the newcomers’ attention, shook out his mane of golden hair and started to advance as well. People in their way stood aside hastily, as if they felt the tension in the air. I certainly did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, they stood facing each other. I watched from behind the shoulder of a bulky military gentleman who didn’t realise he was being used as cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them stared at one another, waiting for the other to bow first. After seemingly endless seconds, they both inclined their heads about half an inch, at the same instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Lord Dalgliesh,’ Mr Ambrose said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Lord Ambrose,’ Lord Dalgliesh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver went down my back? Lord Ambrose? What the…!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mister Ambrose, your Lordship.’ Mr Ambrose’s tone was arctic, but Lord Dalgliesh didn’t flinch. He just smiled a friendly smile. A fake friendly smile. ‘Of course. My mistake.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a spell of silence so intense it pressed against my eardrums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It has been long,’ Mr Ambrose said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, it has,’ Lord Dalgliesh said. ‘Quite some time since last we met.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air between them seemed to crackle. Lord Dalgliesh started to say something else, but I didn’t catch it because at that very moment the evil crow descended on Mr Ambrose, grabbing his arm again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Come, my dear Rikkard,’ she said with the broadest of smiles. ‘I wish to dance a reel or two.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRikkard? Rikkard? She was allowed to call him by his first name? Who was this creature? The writer of the pink letters?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, if so, he seemed to pay a lot more attention to her in person than he did to her correspondence. With a last dark look at Lord Dalgliesh, he took her by the hand and led her onto the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What was that?’ I heard some lady whisper beside me. ‘Between Mr Ambrose and His Lordship, I mean. I’ve seen a lot of important people taking the measure of each other, but that…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That was eerie,’ agreed another in whispered tones. I was inclined to agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Dalgliesh still followed Mr Ambrose with his eyes. He had his back turned to me, so I couldn’t see his expression. But I didn’t really want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen suddenly he turned, again with his charming smile on his face. ‘Miss Linton,’ he began. ‘I apologize for the interruption. Shall we finish our…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile flickered and went out when he saw that I was no longer there beside him. I didn’t wait to see what he would do next. By the time the music had started up again, I was already halfway across the room, trying to locate my little sister Ella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to find Ella! It was essential that I found her again and helped her through the evening as well as I could. It was also essential that I occupied myself with something, anything which could keep my mind off the fact that Mr Rikkard bloody Ambrose was dancing in this bloody ballroom, probably only a few yards away from me, with some bloody female I had never seen in my life!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like hitting something. Preferably Mr Ambrose. Or her. Oh yes, he could snap at me and even continue to deny the fact that I was a girl, but present him with a girl with long lashes, a demure smile and a pretty dress, and he was suddenly dancing and going to balls and whatnot. Typical man!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr is he? whispered that tiny voice inside me. You heard Dalgliesh call him Lord. It’s not every man who has a noble ancestry but chooses to deny the fact. Why do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter. Nobleman or common man, he was still a man! Self-centred, arrogant, infuriating!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should just ignore his antics the way I had learned to ignore most men’s chauvinist behaviour over the years. But… but… there was this possessive way in which the black-haired girl had linked arms with him. For some reason I could not ignore that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spotted them in the distance, twirling over the dance floor, and a stab of envy shot through me. No, I could not ignore that at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuming, I whirled around and left in search of Ella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloody hell, why? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-94.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM"}
