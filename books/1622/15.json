I don\u0027t mind about the pike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can\u0027t do that,” said Amschat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was that a lie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! There is wild country around us, robbers and - things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk nodded brightly. “That\u0027s settled, then,” she said. “I don\u0027t mind sleeping in the fleeces. And I can pay my way. I can do -” She hesitated; her unfinished sentence hung like a little curl of crystal in the air while discretion made a successful bid for control of her tongue. “- helpful things,” she finished lamely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was aware that Amschat was looking slightly sideways at his senior wife, who was sewing by the stove. By Zoon tradition she wore nothing but black. Granny would have thoroughly approved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What sort of helpful things?” he asked. “Washing and sweeping, yesno?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you like,” said Esk, “or distillation using the bifold or triple alembic, the making of varnishes, glazes, creams, zuumchats and punes, the rendering of waxes, the manufacture of candles, the proper selection of seeds, roots and cuttings, and most preparations from the Eighty Marvellous Herbs; I can spin, card, rett, Hallow and weave on the hand, frame, harp and Noble looms and I can knit if people start the wool on for me, I can read soil and rock, do carpentry up to the three-way mortise and tenon, predict weather by means of beastsign and skyreck, make increase in bees, brew five types of mead, make dyes and mordants and pigments, including a fast blue, I can do most types of whitesmithing, mend boots, cure and fashion most leathers, and if you have any goats I can look after them. I like goats.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmschat looked at her thoughtfully. She felt she was expected to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Granny never likes to see people sitting around doing nothing,” she offered. “She always says a girl who is good with her hands will never want for a living,” she added, by way of further explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or a husband, I expect,” nodded Amschat, weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, Granny had a lot to say about that -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I bet she did,” said Amschat. He looked at the senior wife, who nodded almost imperceptibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well,” he said. “If you can make yourself useful you can stay. And can you play a musical instrument?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk returned his steady gaze, not batting an eyelid. “Probably.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so Esk, with the minimum of difficulty and only a little regret, left the Ramtops and their weather and joined the Zoons on their great trading journey down the Ankh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were at least thirty barges with at least one sprawling Zoon family on each, and no two vessels appeared to be carrying the same cargo; most of them were strung together, and the Zoons simply hauled on the cable and stepped on to the next deck if they fancied a bit of socialising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk set up home in the fleeces. It was warm, smelled slightly of Granny\u0027s cottage and, much more important, meant that she was undisturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was getting a bit worried about magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was definitely getting out of control. She wasn\u0027t doing magic, it was just happening around her. And she sensed that people probably wouldn\u0027t be too happy if they knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt meant that if she washed up she had to clatter and splash at length to conceal the fact that the dishes were cleaning themselves. If she did some darning she had to do it on some private part of the deck to conceal the fact that the edges of the hole ravelled themselves together as if . . . as if by magic. Then she woke up on the second day of her voyage to find that several of the fleeces around the spot where she had hidden the staff had combed, carded and spun themselves into neat skeins during the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put all thoughts of lighting fires out of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were compensations, though. Every sluggish turn of the great brown river brought new scenes. There were dark stretches hemmed in with deep forest, through which the barges traveled in the dead centre of the river with the men armed and the women below - except for Esk, who sat listening with interest to the snortings and sneezings that followed them through the bushes on the banks. There were stretches of farmland. There were several towns much larger than Ohulan. There were even some mountains, although they were old and flat and not young and frisky like her mountains. Not that she was homesick, exactly, but sometimes she felt like a boat herself, drifting on the edge of an infinite rope but always attached to an anchor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barges stopped at some of the towns. By tradition only the men went ashore, and only Amschat, wearing his ceremonial Lying hat, spoke to non-Zoons. Esk usually went with him. He tried hinting that she should obey the unwritten rules of Zoon life and stay afloat, but a hint was to Esk what a mosquito bite was to the average rhino because she was already learning that if you ignore the rules people will, half the time, quietly rewrite them so that they don\u0027t apply to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, it seemed to Amschat that when Esk was with him he always got a very good price. There was something about a small child squinting determinedly at them from behind his legs that made even market-hardened merchants hastily conclude their business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, it began to worry him. When a market broker in the walled town of Zemphis offered him a bag of ultramarines in exchange for a hundred fleeces a voice from the level of his pockets said: “They\u0027re not ultramarines.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen to the child!” said the broker, grinning. Amschat solemnly held one of the stones to his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am listening,” he said, “and they do indeed look like ultramarines. They have the glit and shimmy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk shook her head. “They\u0027re just spircles,” she said. She said it without thinking, and regretted it immediately as both men turned to stare at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmschat turned the stone over in his palm. Putting the chameleon spircle stones into a box with some real gems so that they appeared to change their hue was a traditional trick, but these had the true inner blue fire. He looked up sharply at the broker. Amschat had been finely trained in the art of the Lie. He recognised the subtle signs, now that he came to think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There seems to be a doubt,” he said, “but \u0027tis easily resolved, we need only take them to the assayer in Pine Street because the world knows that spircles will dissolve in hypactic fluid, yesno?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe broker hesitated. Amschat had changed position slightly, and the set of his muscles suggested that any sudden movement on the broker\u0027s part would see him flat in the dust. And that damn child was squinting at him as though she could see through to the back of his mind. His nerve broke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I regret this unfortunate dispute,” he said. “I had accepted the stones as ultramarines in good faith but rather than cause disharmony between us I will ask you to accept them as - as a gift, and for the fleeces may I offer this roseatte of the first sorting?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a small red stone from a tiny velvet pouch. Amschat hardly looked at it but, without taking his eyes off the man, passed it down to Esk. She nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the merchant had hurried off Amschat took Esk\u0027s hand and half-dragged her to the assayer\u0027s stall, which was little more than a niche in the wall. The old man took the smallest of the blue stones, listened to Amschat\u0027s hurried explanation, poured out a saucerful of hypactic fluid and dropped the stone in. It frothed into nothingness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very interesting,” he said. He took another stone in a tweezer and examined it under a glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are indeed spircles, but remarkably fine specimens in their own right,” he concluded. “They are by no means worthless, and I for example would be prepared to offer you - is there something wrong with the little girl\u0027s eyes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmschat nudged Esk, who stopped trying out another Look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“- I would offer you, shall we say, two zats of silver?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shall we say five?” said Amschat pleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I would like to keep one of the stones,” said Esk. The old man threw up his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But they are mere curios!” he said. “Of value only to a collector!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A collector may yet sell them to an unsuspecting purchaser as finest roseattes or ultramarines,” said Amschat, “especially if he was the only assayer in town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assayer grumbled a bit at this, but at last they settled on three zats and one of the spircles on a thin silver chain for Esk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were out of earshot Amschat handed her the tiny silver coins and said: “These are yours. You have earned them. But -” he hunkered down so that his eyes were on a level with hers, “- you must tell me how you knew the stones were false.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked worried, but Esk sensed that he wouldn\u0027t really like the truth. Magic made people uncomfortable. He wouldn\u0027t like it if she said simply: spircles are spircles and ultramarines are ultramarines, and though you may think they look the same that is because most people don\u0027t use their eyes in the right way. Nothing can entirely disguise its true nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead she said: “The dwarves mine spircles near the village where I was born, and you soon learn to see how they bend light in a funny way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmschat looked into her eyes for some time. Then he shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he said. “Fine. Well, I have some further business here. Why don\u0027t you buy yourself some new clothes, or something? I\u0027d warn you against unscrupulous traders but, somehow, I don\u0027t know, I don\u0027t think you will have any trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk nodded. Amschat strode off through the market place. At the first corner he turned, looked at her thoughtfully, and then disappeared among the crowds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that\u0027s the end of sailing, Esk told herself. He\u0027s not quite sure but he\u0027s going to be watching me now and before I know what\u0027s happening the staff will be taken away and there\u0027ll be all sorts of trouble. Why does everyone get so upset about magic?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a philosophical sigh and set about exploring the possibilities of the town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the question of the staff, though. Esk had rammed it deep among the fleeces, which were not going to be unloaded yet. If she went back for it people would start asking questions, and she didn\u0027t know the answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found a convenient alleyway and scuttled down it until a deep doorway gave her the privacy she required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf going back was out of the question then only one thing remained. She held out a hand and closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew exactly what she wanted to do-it lay in front of her eyes. The staff mustn\u0027t come flying through the air, wrecking the barge and drawing attention to itself. All she wanted, she told herself, was for there to be a slight change in the way the world was organised. It shouldn\u0027t be a world where the staff was in the fleeces, it should be a world where it was in her hand. A tiny change, an infinitesimal alteration to the Way Things Were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Esk had been properly trained in wizardry she would have known that this was impossible. All wizards knew how to move things about, starting with protons and working upwards, but the important thing about moving something from A to Z, according to basic physics, was that at some point it should pass through the rest of the alphabet. The only way one could cause something to vanish at A and appear at Z would be to shuffle the whole of Reality sideways. The problems this would cause didn\u0027t bear thinking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk, of course, had not been trained, and it is well known that a vital ingredient of success is not knowing that what you\u0027re attempting can\u0027t be done. A person ignorant of the possibility of failure can be a halfbrick in the path of the bicycle of history. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/equal-rites-discworld-3/page-15.html","bookId":1622,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:15 PM"}
