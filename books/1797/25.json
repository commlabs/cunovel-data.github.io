But this incredible, painful tightness was too much. Verity pushed at Jonas\u0027s broad shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough,\" she gasped. \"Stop it, Jonas. Now.\" She was accustomed to giving him orders and she expected to be obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jonas didn\u0027t move. His face was a mask of iron control, but he didn\u0027t move. \"Honey, I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t know. I didn\u0027t realize. Dammit, it\u0027s too late now. Just relax. Take it easy. You\u0027re too tense. You\u0027re hurting yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not hurting myself,\" she said between set teeth as she continued to shove at him. \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s hurting me. Get off. I told you you were going too fast, but you wouldn\u0027t listen. Men. You\u0027re all so sure you know what you\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t tell me why you wanted me to slow down,\" he defended himself. He was vibrating with tension as he fought to hold himself unmoving within her and at the same time keep her pinned carefully beneath him. The muscles of his back and thighs were as contoured steel. His forehead was damp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know a simple request for gentlemanly restraint required a detailed explanation!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Verity, calm down. It\u0027s too late. I made a mess of things. I\u0027ll apologize later, I swear. But it\u0027s too late to stop now. You\u0027re okay, sweetheart. Just stop fighting yourself and me, too. Let yourself relax. It\u0027s going to be all right. It\u0027s going to be so damn good. You\u0027ll see. You\u0027re going to want me as much as I want you. I know there\u0027s passion in you.\" His lips were warm and soothing on her throat. Then he kissed the curve of her shoulder. \"Please, honey. Let yourself relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desperation in his words got through to her. Verity breathed deeply, trying to rally her scattered senses. There was nothing really wrong with her, she decided objectively. It was infuriating to hear him say it, but logically she knew Jonas was right. She would undoubtedly be much more comfortable if she let herself relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was happening wasn\u0027t Jonas\u0027s fault, she reminded herself grimly as she slowly retracted her nails from his shoulder. She always took responsibility for her own actions and there was no denying she had wanted this lovemaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been longing to throw herself into bed with Jonas since he had kissed her in the spa; perhaps even before that. Maybe from the first time she\u0027d seen him. She couldn\u0027t blame him if she stumbled her first time out of the gate. Deliberately she tried to unclench her strained muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it. You\u0027re doing great. You\u0027re going to be doing a whole lot better in a few minutes, believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas muttered encouragement as she stopped trying to shove him off of her. His hands were clamped around her arms, his body still taut as he dropped more reassuring kisses across her br**sts and into the hollow of her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity licked her dry lips. \"Maybe... maybe we\u0027re not physically compatible. You feel much too large and I don\u0027t seem to be feeling whatever it is I\u0027m supposed to be feeling. Maybe we both made a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a small, husky sound that was part laugh and part groan. \"No mistake. You\u0027re perfect for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrust me. Just hang on and trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid his hand down her side to her hip and then he wedged one tapered finger between their bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity twisted slightly as he found the tiny nubbin of desire. When he began to tease it gently, she sighed and twisted again, arching upward against his hand. Pleasure began to replace the too-tight, too-stretched, too-invaded feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better?\" he whispered as she moved beneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may survive after all.\" She flexed her fingers on his shoulders but this time she didn\u0027t dig her nails into him. Experimentally she lifted her hips and felt him move an inch or so within her. The sensation was interesting, she decided. She tried it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas sucked in his breath. \"I\u0027m glad you think you\u0027ll survive. I\u0027m not sure I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to move carefully within her as her body unclenched and began to turn soft around him. Slowly, with exquisite care, he measured the length of her feminine sheath, filling her to the kilt and then withdrawing slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Christ, Verity. You\u0027re so warm and tight,\" he grated. \"I\u0027ve never felt anything like this. So perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas?\" She sighed his name in a half-spoken question as a tingling, liquid heat began deep inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, I\u0027m trying to take this slow and easy but I don\u0027t think I can last much longer. I\u0027m going out of my mind.\" He drew a savage breath and removed his hand from between their bodies. Then he gripped her with sudden fierceness, driving himself into her with increasing urgency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tingling feeling increased. Verity tightened herself around Jonas, seeking more of the delightful sensation. Instinctively she wrapped her legs around his hard hips and her lower body strained to hold him within her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Verity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt Jonas lose what was left of his self-control. With one last agonized groan, he surged deeply into her and went rigid. His muffled shout of satisfaction filled the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime hung suspended for a few moments before Jonas sagged heavily on top of Verity, his head on her br**sts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long time Verity lay trapped beneath his weight, her hands moving on his back, unconsciously stroking him as she would a cat. She looked up at the ceiling and smiled vaguely to herself. She knew enough to realize that things hadn\u0027t gone perfectly. She had missed out on something important, but she felt strangely contented nonetheless. There was a sweet satisfaction and pleasure in knowing that Jonas had been satisfied. And common sense warned her that first times for anything seldom went exactly right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractice made perfect, and she was determined to practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas was silent for a long moment, apparently enjoying the soothing feel of her hand. Then, with a low, lazy sigh, he eased himself out of her and rolled to one side. He gathered her against him and kissed her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have told me this was going to be new for you,\" he chided gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The subject never arose. I didn\u0027t expect everything to happen so quickly. I thought I\u0027d have weeks, maybe months to get to know you and be sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Do you think I could have waited even a few more days, let alone weeks or months?\" He squeezed her rounded buttock. \"Don\u0027t you know what you\u0027ve been doing to me ever since I first saw you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity smiled dreamily against his chest. \"What have I been doing to you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-25.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
