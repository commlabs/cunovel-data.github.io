Of course I have a room free for two weeks. We don’t have another booking coming until next week, and that’s the Perry’s who stay every year for their anniversary. I just needed a reprieve before I do something stupid, like hit on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I want to hit on her. So bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClear your head, Matthews. No hitting on the hot tourist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. I’ll put her in Lakeview. It’s the most expensive room we have. And the nicest. The kind of room a girl like her should stay in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd judging from the flashy Mercedes I can see parked outside, I’m guessing she can more than afford it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, it’s the one room I haven’t had sex in. Not that it matters in regards to her, but Mom and Dad spent their first night as a married couple in Lakeview. That’s why I steer clear of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We do,” I say. “It’s one hundred and seventy five a night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s fine,” she replies. She doesn’t even blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike I thought. Loaded. I wonder if it’s Daddy’s money, or maybe she has a husband?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t look old enough to be married, but who knows the ages of women nowadays. Earlier this year, I banged a chick who looked twenty, but she was thirty. The marvels of plastic surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give a quick check to her ring finger. Empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicking up a pen, I mark out the week. I pull out a booking form from the drawer for her to fill out her details, then slide it across the counter to her, putting the pen I was just using beside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fill this out with your name and home address.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picks the pen up. I notice her hand is trembling. Odd. Is she nervous, or afraid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a damn reason she would have to be afraid, so I’m betting on nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow why would a hot girl like her be nervous around me? Only one reason. She wants a piece. They always do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, I’m not an arrogant ass. I’m just aware of how I look. And most women like how I look. Okay, all women like how I look. It’s the hair and tattoos. They like the bad boys, and I’m bad. What can I say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this girl is not worldly. I can tell. This one is inexperienced, hence the nerves. Maybe she’s a virgin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNah, she can’t be a virgin looking like she does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finishes filling out her details and hands the paper back to me. Her fingers brush mine in the exchange. She snatches her hand back like touching me is a big no-no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdd. Women usually can’t wait to get their hands on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance down at her name on the paper in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia Monroe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh. Like Marilyn Monroe, but not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t just say that out loud, did I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cast a glance at her. She’s staring off toward the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, don’t think I did. Thank fuck for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just need your card details and we’re done. Your card won’t be charged until you check out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” She bends down to her bag. I take the opportunity to lean over the counter and check her ass out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice. Real nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn’t have looked because I’m getting hard again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe comes back up with her card in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI key the amount in and hand the card device to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put your card in … and now your PIN.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the device back and wait for it to ring through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it’s done, I pull her card from the machine and hand it back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI notice she takes care not to touch me this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoves the card in her back jean pocket. For a moment, I actually wish I was that card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab the key for Lakeview and step out from behind the counter. “This way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reaches down for her bags and sluggishly lifts them to her shoulder. That’s when I realize how tired she looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere I am checking her out like a total douche, and the girl is exhausted. I feel like a complete tool. My mom raised me better than this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here let me get those for you.” I hold my hand out to take her bags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitates. Her fingers curl around the handles, gripping them tight to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does she think I’m going to do, run off with her stuff?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetracting my hand, I scratch my head. “It’s my job to carry your bags. We’re not the kind of establishment that has a bellboy.” I grin so not come off as an asshole. She is a paying guest after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer death grip relaxes and she lifts the bags from her shoulder, placing them in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she says in that sweet voice of hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t talk much, but when she does … it’s effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called her stunning before. I take it back. With that smile, she’s nothing short of beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t think I’ve ever referred to a woman as beautiful before. Now, there’s a first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she can look this beautiful with those huge hideous sunglasses covering what I imagine is the best part of her face, then I can only imagine how she looks without them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how she would look under me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sling her bags over my shoulder and stride off in the direction of Lakeview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can’t have sex with her, Matthews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dick, of course, disagrees. Yeah, my dick is absolutely positive that I could screw this chick for two weeks straight and not get bored once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho am I kidding? I’d get bored after a week. I lasted that long with Shawna, and she had a huge rack and legs that went on forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even with those assets, she was nowhere near as hot as Mia Monroe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHot or not. I don’t have the staying power. And right now, money is more important. And proving a point to Beth, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI come to a stop outside Lakeview. I unlock the door, turn the light on and go inside, setting her bags on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turn back, I see she’s still standing out in the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything about her body language screams tense. My eyes flicker to her hands. They’re trembling again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is wrong with this girl? I thought it was because she was hot for me, but no, it’s not that. It’s something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wraps her arms around her chest and straightens her back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith care, I walk toward her. She steps back to let me pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your key.” I hold it out to her, leaving a distance between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreeing a hand, she takes it from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now it’s me making sure not to touch her in this exchange. Even though I want to, something tells me that right now I shouldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Breakfast is served between seven and eight-thirty.” It’s on me to make breakfast tomorrow as it’s Paula’s day off. Paula is both our cleaner and our cook. She’s worked here ever since I can remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we don’t do evening meals, but there are plenty of restaurants nearby,” I add, remembering the remainder of my spiel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are there any other guests staying here?” Her voice sounds small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn back to her. “No. Not until next week. Until then, it’s just you and me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on her face throws me for a loop. She looks terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell? Jeez, it’s not like we’re the Overlook Hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry. It’s totally safe out here,” I feel compelled to say. “We have a great alarm system, and I have a shotgun. You know, just in case.” I wink as I laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the mention of a shotgun, her body stiffens and she looks like she’s about to bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr puke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I’m guessing that was the wrong thing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m totally kidding, I don’t have a gun here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a bit of a lie. We do have guns. My dad used to be a cop, so he still has shotguns, and rifles for hunting. I know how to shoot. I’m pretty good. Dad taught me when I was a kid, but I think it’s best if she doesn’t know that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my empty hands, palms facing, placating. “No guns. I promise. No need for them. Like I said, it’s a safe place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls on her lip again. Then runs her fingers around her ear, tucking her short hair behind it. I see that her hand is trembling again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” I take a small step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t sound it, but I don’t press it. It’s none of my business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, well if you need anything, just press reception on the phone in your room, and it’ll bring you straight through to me. Goodnight, Mia.” I step back, ready to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brows knit together. “How do you know my name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, I should have called her Ms. Monroe, but something about her feels familiar like I should always be calling her Mia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I sound like a stage five clinger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got it from your details when you filled the form in.” I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, right. Yes.” She laughs a little sound, and it hits me straight in the chest, leaving a tingling fullness there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What should I call you?” she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a million different ways I could answer this, none of them clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean my shoulder against the wall and push my hand into my pocket. “Jordan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns and mirrors me, wrapping her arms around herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this your hotel, Jordan?” My name sounds amazing on her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a laugh. “No. My dad’s. He’s away taking care of my Grandpa at the moment, so I’m holding the fort.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, nothing serious I hope?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, just a minor op, but he’s off his feet for a few weeks, so Dad’s gone to take care of him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods her pretty head. “Well, thank you. Again.” She smiles once more before disappearing into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door shuts. I hear the lock click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean back against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I have a very hot, nervous one minute, friendly the next, chick on my hands who I cannot have sex with under any circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould be interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling unsatisfied … but satisfied that my only paying guest is settled for the night, I push off the wall and head downstairs to feed my other guest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s actually more of a resident than a guest. Guests usually leave, but he’s been a permanent fixture here for over a year now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe makes for a great alarm system, but he’s slobbery and hairy, and the only one I’ve ever let sleep in my bed. He’s a mouth we could do without feeding, but when he turned up at our door a starving puppy just over a year ago, I couldn’t turn him away. So we kept him, and now we have a dog. A huge fucking dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go to the kitchen and get his clean bowl off the drainer. I grab a can of his favorite food from the pantry and empty it into the bowl. Jesus, this stuff stinks. I mix in his biscuits just as he likes and call for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dozer, dinner’s up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear his huge paws pound against the floor as he makes his way from our private living room down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe comes barreling through the open kitchen door and straight into my legs, nearly knocking me off my feet. “Jesus Christ, Dozer!” I growl, steadying myself on the counter. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trouble/page-10.html","bookId":2000,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM"}
