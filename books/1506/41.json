behind now. \u0026nbsp;Since her feelings were so transparent, it was a bit amusing to see it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eArtpe smirked as he turned

style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs if she had been waiting for this question, she let out a bright smile as she gave her answer. \u0026nbsp;Artpe had asked the question, but he was taken aback by her embarrassingly frank answer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“······your whole life depends on this decision. \u0026nbsp;Are you sure you ok making such a

able to recover her younger sister, yet she was now worried that Sienna would go to a distant place. \u0026nbsp;However, Sienna had anticipated her unni’s objection, so she spoke with a bright smile on her face.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Unni, don’t worry too much about it. \u0026nbsp;I’m all right. \u0026nbsp;As time passes, I’ll feel much

ended, a white magical energy was emitted at the tip of Siennna’s fingers. \u0026nbsp;Artpe could clearly see a light that was similar to holy power. \u0026nbsp;Moreover, the amount of magical energy possessed by her was disparate from her status as a level 1.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan

that could be seen in her bright smile. \u0026nbsp;Aena realized Sienna wasn’t trying to convince her of anything. \u0026nbsp;She was just notifying Aena of what would be happening.
