Every Christian should have his Olivet. Most of us, especially in the cities and towns, live at high pressure. From early morning until bedtime we are exposed to the whirl. Amid all this maelstrom how little chance for quiet thought, for God\u0027s Word, for prayer and heart fellowship! \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDaniel needed to have an Olivet in his chamber amid Babylon\u0027s roar and idolatries. Peter found his on a housetop in Joppa; and Martin Luther found his in the“upper room” at Wittenberg, which is still held sacred. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDr. Joseph Parker once said: \"If we do not get back to visions, peeps into heaven, consciousness of the higher glory and the larger life, we shall lose our religion; our altar will become a bare stone, unblessed by visitant from Heaven.\" Here is the world\u0027s need today━men who have seen their Lord. ━The Lost Art of Meditation \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCome close to Him! He may take you today up into the mountain top, for where He took Peter with his blundering, and James and John, those sons of thunder who again and again so utterly misunderstood their Master and His mission, there is no reason why He should not take you. So don\u0027t shut yourself out of it and say, “Ah, these wonderful visions and revelations of the Lord are for choice spirits!” They may be for you! ━John McNeill \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e十一月八日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「耶稣带着彼得、约翰、雅各布，上山去祷告。正祷告的时候，祂的面貌就改变了，衣服洁白放光…他们看见耶稣的荣光。」（路九28~29，32，直译）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「我如今若在祢眼前蒙恩，求祢将祢的道指示我。（出卅三:13）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e耶稣带着这三个门徒，暗暗的上了高山，和他们在那里有一个极亲密的交通。他们不见一人，只见耶稣在那里；啊！他们在那里眞好！\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e凡与主同在山上的人，天离他们不远了。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e有多少人，在默想祷告的时候，看见天开了。有多少人，在密室里与神交通的时候，感觉一阵汹涌的波涛突然冲进来。这些都是预尝天上的快乐。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e主耶稣在世的时候，常和祂的门徒到安静的山上去谈话。今天我们呢？我们的生活多么急促━从早到晚过着极其纷乱的生活。在这恶势力之下，安静默想、读经祈祷，与主交通的机会多么少啊！\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e但以理在巴比伦的吼怒、迷信之下，仍不忽略他的密室生活。彼得的密室在约帕的一个房顶上；马丁路得的密室在韦伯登的一间上房里。━译自已失去的默想的艺术\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e信徒阿，来亲近主！也许主今天要带你上山顶去；不要想只有彼得、约翰、雅各布是配去的；彼得是一个最会闯祸的人，雅各布和约翰是火气最大的人，他们曾一再误会他们的主和主的使命；所以没有理由可以叫主不带你去。你不要自暴自弃地说：「啊，这些奇异的经历是只有最少数的属灵人能得到的！」也许你今天就能得到呢！━马克乃尔\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5547.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:51:02 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:51:02 AM"}
