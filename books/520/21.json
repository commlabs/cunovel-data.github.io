I\u0027ve just finished my last examination Physiology. \n\u003cbr\u003e And now:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Three months on a farm!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t know what kind of a thing a farm is. I\u0027ve never been on\n\u003cbr\u003e one in my life. I\u0027ve never even looked at one (except from the car\n\u003cbr\u003e window), but I know I\u0027m going to love it, and I\u0027m going to love\n\u003cbr\u003e being FREE.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I am not used even yet to being outside the John Grier Home. \n\u003cbr\u003e Whenever I think of it excited little thrills chase up and down\n\u003cbr\u003e my back. I feel as though I must run faster and faster and keep\n\u003cbr\u003e looking over my shoulder to make sure that Mrs. Lippett isn\u0027t after\n\u003cbr\u003e me with her arm stretched out to grab me back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t have to mind any one this summer, do I?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Your nominal authority doesn\u0027t annoy me in the least; you are too\n\u003cbr\u003e far away to do any harm. Mrs. Lippett is dead for ever, so far as I\n\u003cbr\u003e am concerned, and the Semples aren\u0027t expected to overlook my moral\n\u003cbr\u003e welfare, are they? No, I am sure not. I am entirely grown up. Hooray!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I leave you now to pack a trunk, and three boxes of teakettles\n\u003cbr\u003e and dishes and sofa cushions and books.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours ever,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. Here is my physiology exam.
