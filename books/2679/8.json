Radio.\" It was the R/T operator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin walked back and took the handset from him. \"Sergeant Parkin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Major Roberts. You\u0027re discharged from active duty as of now, Sergeant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Parkin\u0027s first thought was that they had discovered his true age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The brass want you in London. Don\u0027t ask me why because I don\u0027t know. Leave your corporal in charge, and make your way back to base. A car will meet you on the road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The orders also say that on no account are you to risk your life. Got that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin grinned, thinking of the clock tower and the dynamite. \"Got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. On your way. You lucky sod.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone had called him a boy, but they had known him before he joined the Army, Bloggs thought. There was no doubt he was a man now. He walked with confidence and grace, looked about him sharply, and was respectful without being ill at ease in the company of superior officers. Bloggs knew that he was lying about his age, not because of his looks or manner, but because of the small signs that appeared whenever age was mentioned-signs that Bloggs, an experienced interrogator, picked up out of habit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been amused when they told him they wanted him to look at pictures. Now, on his third day in Mr Middleton\u0027s dusty Kensington vault, the amusement had gone and tedium had set in. What irritated him most was the no-smoking rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was even more boring for Bloggs, who had to sit and watch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point Parkin said, \"You wouldn\u0027t call me back from Italy to help in a four-year-old murder case that could wait until after the war. Also, these pictures are mostly of German officers. If this case is something I should keep quiet about, you\u0027d better tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s something you should keep quiet about,\" said Bloggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin went back to his pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all old, mostly browned and fading. Many were out of books, magazines, and newspapers. Sometimes Parkin picked up a magnifying glass Mr Middleton had thoughtfully provided, to peer more closely at a tiny face in a group: and each time this happened Bloggs\u0027 heart raced, only to slow down when Parkin put the glass to one side and picked up the next photograph. They went to a nearby pub for lunch. The ale was weak, like most wartime beer, but Bloggs still thought it wise to restrict young Parkin to two pints. On his own he would have sunk a gallon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr Faber was the quiet sort,\" Parkin said. \"You wouldn\u0027t think he had it in him. Mind you, the landlady wasn\u0027t bad looking. And she wanted it. Looking back, I think I could have had her myself if I\u0027d known how to go about it. There, I was only eighteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate bread and cheese, and Parkin swallowed a dozen pickled onions. When they went back they stopped outside the house while Parkin smoked another cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mind you,\" he said, \"he was a biggish chap, good-looking, well-spoken. We all thought he was nothing much because his clothes were poor and he rode a bike and he\u0027d no money. I suppose it could have been a subtle kind of disguise.\" His eyebrows were raised in a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could have been,\" Bloggs said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat afternoon Parkin found not one but three pictures of Faber. One of them was only nine years old. And Mr Middleton had the negative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeinrich Rudolph Hans von Muller-Guder (also known as Faber) was born on May 26, 1900, at a village called Oln in West Prussia. His father\u0027s family had been substantial landowners in the area for generations. His father was the second son; so was Heinrich. All the second sons were Army officers. His mother, the daughter of a senior official of the Second Reich, was born and raised to be an aristocrat\u0027s wife, and that was what she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the age of thirteen Heinrich went to the Karlsruhe cadet school in Baden; two years later he was transferred to the more prestigious Gross-Lichterfelde, near Berlin. Both places were hard disciplinarian institutions where the minds of the pupils were improved with canes and cold baths and bad food. However, Heinrich learned to speak English and French and studied history, and passed the final examinations with the highest mark recorded since the turn of the century. There were only three other points of note in his school career: one bitter winter he rebelled against authority to the extent of sneaking out of the school at night and walking 150 miles to his aunt\u0027s house; he broke the arm of his wrestling instructor during a practice bout; and he was flogged for insubordination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe served briefly as an ensign-cadet in the neutral zone of Friedrichsfeld, near Wesel, in 1920: did token officer training at the War School at Metz in 1921, and was commissioned Second Lieutenant in 1922.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(\"What was the phrase you used?\" Godliman asked Bloggs, \"German equivalent of Eton and Sandhurst?\")\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next few years he did short tours of duty in half a dozen places, in the manner of one who is being groomed for the general staff. He continued to distinguish himself as an athlete, specialising in long-distance running. He made no close friendships, never married, and refused to join the National Socialist party. His promotion to lieutenant was somewhat delayed by a vague incident involving the pregnancy of the daughter of a lieutenant colonel in the Defence Ministry, but eventually came about in 1928. His habit of talking to superior officers as if they were equals came to be accepted as pardonable in one who was both a rising young officer and a Prussian aristocrat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the late \u002720s Admiral Wilhelm Canaris became friendly with Heinrich\u0027s Uncle Otto, his father\u0027s elder brother, and spent several holidays at the family estate at Oln. In 1931 Adolf Hitler, not yet Chancellor of Germany, was a guest there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1933 Heinrich was promoted to captain, and went to Berlin for unspecified duties. This is the date of the last photograph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout then, according to published information, he seems to have ceased to exist...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can conjecture the rest,\" said Percival Godliman. \"The Abwehr trains him in wireless transmission, codes, map-making, burglary, blackmail, sabotage, and silent killing. He comes to London in about 1937 with plenty of time to set himself up with a solid cover, perhaps two. His loner instincts are honed sharp by the spying game. When war breaks out, he considers himself licenced to kill.\" He looked at the photograph on his desk. \"He\u0027s a handsome fellow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a picture of the 5,000 metres running team of the 10th Hanoverian Jaeger Battalion. Faber was in the middle, holding a cup. He had a high forehead, with cropped hair, a long chin, and a small mouth decorated with a narrow moustache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman passed the picture to Billy Parkin. \"Has he changed much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He looked a lot older, but that might have been his... bearing.\" He studied the photograph thoughtfully \"His hair was longer, and the moustache was gone.\" He passed dhe picture back across the desk. \"But it\u0027s him all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are two more items in the file, both of them conjectural,\" Godliman said. \"First, they say he may have gone into Intelligence in 1933-that\u0027s the routine assumption when an officer\u0027s record just stops for no apparent reason. The second item is a rumour, unconfirmed by any reliable source, that he spent some years as a confidential advisor to Stalin, using the name Vasily Zankov.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s incredible,\" Bloggs said. \"I don\u0027t believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman shrugged. \"Somebody persuaded Stalin to execute the cream of his officer corps during the years Hitler rose to power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs shook his head, and changed the subject. \"Where do we go from here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman considered. \"Let\u0027s have Sergeant Parkin transferred to us. He\u0027s the only man we know who has actually seen Die Nadel. Besides, he knows too much for us to risk him in the front line; he could get captured and interrogated. Next, make a first-class print of this photo, and have the hair thickened and the moustache obliterated by a retouch artist. Then we can distribute copies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we want to start a hue and cry?\" Bloggs said doubtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. For now, let\u0027s tread softly. If we put the thing in the newspapers he\u0027ll get to hear of it and vanish. Just send the photo to police forces for the time being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so. Unless you\u0027ve got other ideas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin cleared his throat. \"Sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really would prefer to go back to my unit. I\u0027m not really the administrative type, if you see what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not being offered a choice, Sergeant. At this stage, one Italian village more or less makes relatively little difference but this man Faber could lose us the war. Truly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber had gone fishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was stretched out on the deck of a thirty-foot boat, enjoying the spring sunshine, moving along the canal at about three knots. One lazy hand held the tiller, the other rested on a rod that trailed its line in the water behind the boat. He hadn\u0027t caught a thing all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as fishing, he was bird-watching, both out of interest (he was actually getting to know quite a lot about the damn birds) and as an excuse for carrying binoculars. Earlier today he had seen a kingfisher\u0027s nest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people at the boatyard in Norwich had been delighted to rent him the vessel for a fortnight. Business was bad they had only two boats nowadays, and one of them had not been used since Dunkirk. Faber had haggled over the price, just for the sake of form. In the end they had thrown in a locker full of tinned food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had bought bait in a shop nearby; the fishing tackle he had brought from London. They had observed that he had nice weather for it, and wished him good fishing. Nobody asked to see his identity card. So far, so good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe difficult bit was to come. For assessing the strength of an army was difficult. First, for example, you had to find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn peacetime the Army would put up its own road signs to help you. Now they had been taken down, not only the Army\u0027s but everyone else\u0027s road signs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe simple solution would be to get in a car and follow the first military vehicle you saw until it stopped. However, Faber had no car; it was close to impossible for a civilian to hire one, and even if you got one you couldn\u0027t get petrol for it. Besides, a civilian driving around the countryside following Army vehicles and looking at Army camps was likely to be arrested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHence the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome years ago, before it had become illegal to sell maps, Faber had discovered that Britain had thousands of miles of inland waterways. The original network of rivers had been augmented during the nineteenth century by a spider web of canals. In some areas there was almost as much waterway as there was road. Norfolk was one of these areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat had many advantages. On a road, a man was going somewhere; on a river he was just sailing. Sleeping in a parked car was conspicuous; sleeping in a moored boat was natural. The waterway was lonely. And who ever heard of a canal-block?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were disadvantages. Airfields and barracks had to be near roads, but they were located without reference to access by water. Faber had to explore the countryside at night, leaving his moored boat and tramping the hillsides by moonlight, exhausting forty-mile round trips during which he could easily miss what he was looking for because of the darkness or because he simply did not have enough time to check every square mile of land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he returned, a couple of hours after dawn, he would sleep until midday, then move on, stopping occasionally to climb a nearby hill and check the outlook. At locks, isolated farmhouses, and riverside pubs he would talk to people, hoping for hints of a military presence. So far there had been none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was beginning to wonder whether he was in the right area. He had tried to put himself in General Patton\u0027s place, thinking: If I were planning to invade France east of the Seine from a base in eastern England, where would I locate that base?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorfolk was obvious: a vast expanse of lonely countryside, plenty of flat ground for aircraft, close to the sea for rapid departure. And the Wash was a natural place to gather a fleet of ships. However, his guesswork might be wrong for reasons unknown to him. Soon he would have to consider a rapid move across country to a new area-perhaps the Fens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lock appeared ahead of him, and he trimmed his sails to slow his pace. He glided gently into the lock and bumped softly against the gates. The lock-keeper\u0027s house was on the bank. Faber cupped hands around his mouth and helloed. Then he settled down to wait. He had learned that lock-keepers were a breed that could not be hurried. Moreover, it was tea time, and at tea time they could hardly be moved at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman came to the door of the house and beckoned. Faber waved back, then jumped onto the bank, tied up the boat and went into the house. The lock-keeper was in his shirtsleeves at the kitchen table. He said, \"Not in a hurry, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber smiled. \"Not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pour him a cup of tea, Mavis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really,\" Faber said politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right, we\u0027ve just made a pot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Faber sat down. The little kitchen was airy and clean, and his tea came in a pretty china cup. \"Fishing holiday?\" the lock-keeper asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fishing and bird-watching.\" Faber answered. \"I\u0027m thinking of tying up quite soon and spending a couple of days on land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, aye. Well, best keep to the far side of the canal, then. Restricted area this side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? I didn\u0027t know there was Army land hereabouts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, it starts about half a mile from here. As to whether it\u0027s Army, I wouldn\u0027t know. They don\u0027t tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I suppose we don\u0027t need to know,\" Faber said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye. Drink up, then, and I\u0027ll see you through the lock. Thanks for letting me finish my tea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the house, and Faber got into the boat and untied it. The gates behind him closed slowly, and then the keeper opened the sluices. The boat gradually sank with the level of the water in the lock, then the keeper opened the front gates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber made sail and moved out. The lock-keeper waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped again about four miles away and moored the boat to a stout tree on the bank. While he waited for night to fall he made a meal of tinned sausage meat, dry biscuits, and bottled water. He dressed in his black clothes, put into a shoulder bag his binoculars, camera, and copy of Rare Birds of East Anglia, pocketed his compass, and picked up his flashlight. He was ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doused the hurricane lamp, locked the cabin door and jumped onto the bank. Consulting his compass by flashlight, he entered the belt of woodland along the canal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked due south from his boat for about half a mile until he came to the fence. It was six feet high, chicken wire, with coiled barbed wire on top. He backtracked into the wood and climbed a tall tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was scattered cloud above. The moon showed through fitfully. Beyond the fence was open land, a gentle rise. Faber had done this sort of thing before, at Biggin Hill, Aldershot, and a host of military areas all over southern England. There were two levels of security: a mobile patrol around the perimeter fence, and stationary sentries at the installations. Both, he felt, could be evaded by patience and caution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber came down the tree and returned to the fence. He concealed himself behind a bush and settled down to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to know when the mobile patrol passed this point. If they did not come until dawn he would simply return the following night. If he was lucky they would pass shortly. From the apparent size of the area under guard he guessed they would only make one complete tour of the fence each night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was lucky. Soon after ten o\u0027clock he heard the tramp of feet, and three men marched by on the inside of the fence. Five minutes later Faber crossed the fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked due south; when all directions are equal, a straight line is best. He did not use his flashlight. He kept close to hedges and trees when he could, and avoided high ground where he might be silhouetted against a sudden flash of moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sparse countryside was an abstract in black, grey, and silver. The ground underfoot was a little soggy, as if there might be marshes nearby. A fox ran across a field in front of him, as fast as a greyhound, as graceful as a cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was 11:30 P.M. when he came across the first indications of military activity and very odd indications they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon came out and he saw, perhaps a quarter of a mile ahead, several rows of one-story buildings laid out with the unmistakable precision of an Army barracks. He dropped to the ground immediately, but he was already doubting the reality of what he apparently saw; for there were no lights and no noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lay still for ten minutes, to give explanations a chance to emerge, but nothing happened except that a badger lumbered into view, saw him, and made off. Faber crawled forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he got closer he realised that the barracks were not just unoccupied, but unfinished. Most of them were little more than a roof supported by cornerposts. Some had one wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden sound stopped him: a man\u0027s laugh. He lay still and watched. A match flared briefly and died, leaving two glowing red spots in one of the unfinished huts. Guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber touched the stiletto in his sleeve, then began to crawl again, making for the side of the camp away from the sentries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe half-built huts had no floors and no foundations. There were no construction vehicles around, no wheel-barrows, concrete mixers, shovels or piles of bricks. A mud track led away from the camp across the fields, but spring grass was growing in the ruts; it had not been used much lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if someone had decided to billet 10,000 men here, then changed his mind a few weeks after building started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet there was something about the place that did not quite fit that explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber walked around softly, alert lest the sentries should take it into their heads to make a patrol. There was a group of military vehicles in the centre of the camp. They were old and rusting, and had been degutted: none had an engine or any interior components. But if one was going to cannibalise obsolete vehicles, why not take the shells for scrap? Those huts which did have a wall were on the outermost rows, and their walls faced out. It was like a film set, not a building site. Faber decided he had learned all he could from this place. He walked to the east edge of the camp, then dropped to his hands and knees and crawled away until he was out of sight behind a hedge. Half a mile further on, near the top of a rise, he looked back. Now it looked exactly like a barracks again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glimmer of an idea formed in his mind. He gave it time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe land was still relatively flat, relieved only by gentle folds. There were patches of woodland and marshy scrub that Faber took advantage of. Once he had to detour around a lake, its surface a silver mirror under the moon. He heard the hoot of an owl, and looked in that direction to see a tumbledown barn in the distance. Five miles on he saw the airfield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were more planes here than he thought were possessed by the entire Royal Air Force. There were Pathfinders to drop flares, Lancasters and American B-17s for softening-up bombing, Hurricanes and Spitfires and Mosquitoes for reconnaissance and strafing; enough planes for an invasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout exception their undercarriages had sunk into the soft earth and they were up to their bellies in mud. Once again there were no lights and no noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber followed the same procedure, crawling flat toward the planes until he located the guards. In the middle of the airfield was a small tent. The faint glow of a lamp shone through the canvas. Two men, perhaps three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Faber approached the planes they seemed to become flatter, as if they had all been squashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the nearest and touched it in amazement. It was a piece of half-inch plywood, cut out in the outline of a Spitfire, painted with camouflage, and roped to the ground. Every other plane was the same. There were more than a thousand of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber got to his feet, watching the tent from the corner of his eye, ready to drop to the ground at the slightest sign of movement. He walked all around the phony airfield, looking at the phony fighters and bombers, connecting them with the movie-set barracks, reeling at the implications of what he had found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that if he continued to explore he would find more airfields like this, more half-built barracks. If he went to the Wash he would find a fleet of plywood destroyers and troop ships. It was a vast, meticulous, costly, outrageous trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it could not possibly fool an onlooker for very long. But it was not designed to deceive observers on the ground. It was meant to be seen from the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven a low-flying reconnaissance plane equipped with the latest cameras and fast film would come back with pictures that indisputably showed an enormous concentration of men and machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder the general staff was anticipating an invasion east of the Seine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be other elements to the deception, he guessed. The British would refer to FUSAG in signals, using codes they knew to be broken. There would be phony espionage reports channelled through the Spanish diplomatic bag to Hamburg. The possibilities were endless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe British had had four years to arm themselves for this invasion. Most of the German army was fighting Russia. Once the Allies got a toehold on French soil they would be unstoppable. The Germans\u0027 only chance was to catch them on the beaches and annihilate them as they came off the troop ships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they were waiting in the wrong place, they would lose that one chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole strategy was immediately clear. It was simple, and it was devastating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber had to tell Hamburg. He wondered whether they would believe him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWar strategy was rarely altered on the word of one man. His own standing was high, but was it that high?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat idiot Von Braun would never believe him. He\u0027d hated Faber for years and would grab at the opportunity to discredit him. Canaris, Von Roenne... he had no faith in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was another thing: the radio. He didn\u0027t want to trust this to the radio... he\u0027d had the feeling for weeks now that the radio code wasn\u0027t safe anymore. If the British found out that their secret was blown...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one thing to do: he had to get proof, and he had to take it himself to Berlin. He needed photographs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would take photographs of this gigantic dummy army, then he would go to Scotland and meet the U-boat, and he would deliver the pictures personally to the Fuehrer. He could do no more. No less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor photography he needed light. He would have to wait until dawn. There had been a ruined barn a little way back; he could spend the rest of the night there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked his compass and set off. The barn was further than he thought, and the walk took him an hour. It was an old wooden building with holes in the roof. The rats had long ago deserted it for lack of food, but there were bats in the hayloft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber lay down on some planks but he could not sleep. Not with the knowledge that he was now personally capable of altering the course of the war. Dawn was due at 05:21. At 04:20 Faber left the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he had not slept, the two hours had rested his body and calmed his mind, and he was now in fine spirits. The cloud was clearing with a west wind, so although the moon had set there was starlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis timing was good. The sky was growing perceptibly brighter as he came in sight of the \"airfield.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sentries were still in their tent. With luck, they would be sleeping. Faber knew from his own experience of such duties that it was hardest to stay awake during the last few hours. But if they did come out, he would have to kill them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe selected his position and loaded the Leica with a 36-frame roll of 35mm fast Agfa film. He hoped the film\u0027s light-sensitive chemicals had not spoiled; it had been stored in his suitcase since before the war, and you couldn\u0027t buy film in Britain nowadays. It should be all right; he had kept it in a lightproof bag away from any heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the red rim of the sun edged over the horizon he began shooting. He took a series of shots from different vantage points and various distances, finishing with a close-up of one dummy plane; the pictures would show both the illusion and the reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he took the last, he saw movement from the corner of his eye. He dropped flat and crawled under a plywood Mosquito. A soldier emerged from the tent, walked a few paces, and urinated on the ground. The man stretched and yawned, then lit a cigarette. He looked around the airfield, shivered, and returned to the tent. Faber got up and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quarter of a mile away he looked back. The airfield was out of sight. He headed west, toward the barracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would be more than an ordinary espionage coup. Hitler had had a life of being the only one in step. The man who brought the proof that, yet again, the Fuehrer was right and all the experts were wrong, could look for more than a pat on the back. Faber knew that already Hitler rated him the Abwehr\u0027s best agent. This triumph might well get him Canaris\u0027 job. If he made it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe increased his pace, jogging twenty yards, walking the next twenty, and jogging again, so that he reached the barracks by 06:30. It was bright daylight now, and he could not approach close because these sentries were not in a tent but in one of the wall-less huts with a clear view all around them. He lay down by the hedge and took his pictures from a distance. Ordinary prints would just show a barracks, but big enlargements ought to reveal the details of the deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he headed back toward the boat he had exposed thirty frames. Again he hurried, because he was now terribly conspicuous, a black-clad man in the open fields of a restricted area. He reached the fence an hour later, having seen nothing but wild geese. As he climbed over the wire, he felt a great release of tension. Inside the fence the balance of suspicion had been against him; outside it was in his favour. He could revert to his bird-watching, fishing, sailing role. The period of greatest risk was over. He strolled through the belt of woodland, catching his breath and letting the strain of the night\u0027s work seep away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would sail a few miles on, he decided, before mooring again to catch a few hours\u0027 sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the canal. It was over. The boat looked pretty in the morning sunshine. As soon as he was under way he would make some tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man in uniform stepped out of the cabin of the boat and said: \"Well, well. And who might you be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber stood still, letting the icy calm and the old instincts come into play. The intruder wore the uniform of a captain in the Home Guard. He had some kind of handgun in a holster with a buttoned flap. He was tall and rangy, but he looked to be in his late fifties. White hair showed under his cap. He made no move to draw his gun. Faber took all this in as he said, \"You are on my boat, so I think it is I who should ask who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain Stephen Langham, Home Guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"James Baker.\" Faber stayed on the bank. A captain did not patrol alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on holiday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bird-watching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since before dawn? Cover him, Watson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA youngish man in denim uniform appeared on Faber\u0027s left, carrying a shotgun. Faber looked around. There was another man to his right and a fourth behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain called, \"Which direction did he come from, corporal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reply came from the top of an oak tree. \"From the restricted area, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber was calculating odds. Four to one until the corporal came down from the tree. They had only two guns: the shotgun and the captain\u0027s pistol. And they were basically amateurs. The boat would help too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Restricted area? All I saw was a bit of fence. Look, do you mind pointing that blunderbuss away? It might go off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody goes bird-watching in the dark,\" the captain said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you set up your hide under cover of darkness, you\u0027re concealed by the time the birds wake up. It\u0027s the accepted way to do it. Now look, the Home Guard is jolly patriotic and keen and all that, but let\u0027s not take it too far. Don\u0027t you just have to check my papers and file a report?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain was looking a shade doubtful. \"What\u0027s in that canvas bag?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eye-of-the-needle/page-8.html","bookId":2679,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:56 AM"}
