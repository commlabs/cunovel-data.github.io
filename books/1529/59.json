It makes me wonder if this crab had been rewired to march itself straight over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter stared at the screen, picturing Gray Pierce, reminded of the deadly bluff being played out there. \"If you\u0027re right, then Marco\u0027s trail might not be such a dead end after all. Something must be there.\" Jennings nodded, hands on his hips. \"But what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:32 A.M. Siem Reap\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor reminded himself never to play poker with Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander sat in a rattan lounge chair in the hotel\u0027s bar. The facility was closed at this hour, but Nasser had rented the space out for privacy. The Elephant Bar gained its name from the pair of large curved tusks near the entrance. Continuing the motif, the lounge was appointed with bamboo furniture upholstered in zebra and tiger prints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray sat across a glass coffee table from Nasser, playing a cautious game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan had sprawled herself across a sofa, ankles crossed. Kowalski sat at the long bar, staring at the gemlike spread of bottles. But Vigor also noted how the large man continued to spy upon Gray and Nasser in the bar\u0027s mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that there was much any of them could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser\u0027s men stationed themselves at all the exits and lined both walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a clank of metal on glass, Nasser returned one of the gold paitzus to the tabletop. Before he even entertained any discussion about cures, Nasser wanted to verify that the ruins of Angkor were indeed where Marco Polo had first encountered the Judas Strain. Gray had laid it all out, decoding the entire story as he had aboard the seaplane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stood over the table, studying the angelic script, the star chart, the map of the ruins. He had again listened to the complete decipher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser finally accepted the truth. He leaned back. \"And this cure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor fought against flinching. On the flight here, Gray had explained his take on the last story of Marco Polo: his theory of vaccination through cannibalism. It was intriguing, but in the end, it offered no real cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the risk of this bluff, Gray had attempted to shuffle Vigor onto a different flight when they changed planes in Bangkok.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too dangerous,\" Gray had warned. \"Go back to Italy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Vigor had refused. Besides the fact that Nasser had ordered all of them to Cambodia, Vigor had his own reasons for continuing. Somewhere among these ruins, Friar Agreer had vanished, a fellow brother of the cloth, sacrificing himself to save Marco and the others. Vigor could not turn his back on such selfless bravery. But he also had a more important argument to offer Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The natives who had offered the cure recognized something in Friar Agreer, some commonality,\" Vigor had explained. \"Why did they seek him out? If there is some answer beyond where Marco left off, it might take another brother of the cloth to find it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had reluctantly agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Vigor had one last reason for continuing, one he left unvoiced. Something he had noted in the young man\u0027s eyes. Desperation. As these last cards were being played out, Gray was getting reckless. Like this risky bluff, walking into a trap with no secondary strategy. All Gray\u0027s hopes lay with Director Crowe, trusting that his boss would find some way to secure his parents in time, freeing Gray to act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut was Gray up to the game being played here, especially plagued by the worry for his parents? Plainly some of the sharp edge of his mind had been dulled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stared down at the spread of maps and angelic scripts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, how had Gray missed seeing this earlier?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cure,\" Nasser persisted, pulling Vigor\u0027s attention up. \"Tell me what you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the table, Gray remained cool and calm, not a bead of sweat on his brow. \"I will give you an airport locker number. Back in Bangkok. Tell you where to find the key to confirm what I\u0027m about to say. We stashed the third and final scroll in that locker. In that last document, Marco describes the cure. It is in two parts. I will tell you the first part, free of charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser shifted, one eye narrowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once I\u0027m done, as a mark of good faith, you\u0027ll release one of my parents. And I will expect satisfactory confirmation. With that, I will tell you the locker number and location of the key. You can verify my claim. Is that satisfactory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It depends on what I hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray merely stared, not blinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor knew it was all a stalling tactic, stretching out the reveal for as long as possible. The scroll had indeed been secured in an airport locker in Bangkok, but it was a wild-goose chase. There was no second half of the cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray sighed, as if relenting. \"Here then is the story found within the third scroll. According to Marco .. .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Gray related what the embroidered scroll revealed, Vigor studied the documents on the table, only half listening. The commander kept to the truth, knowing that more time would be bought with the facts than lies. After Gray was finished, Nasser would make the necessary calls, arrange to have the scroll recovered from the locker, then translated. All of it would take time. The discovered scroll would verify Gray\u0027s story and make it more likely Nasser would buy any fabrication to follow. And even if Gray\u0027s lies failed to convince, at least one of his parents would be saved by then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray finally finished his narration, laying out the science. \"So clearly the cannibalism served some means of vaccinating against the disease. But exactly how that was achieved will wait until I know one of my parents is safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray folded his hands in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser sat silent for a moment, then spoke slowly. \"So we really just need someone who is cured of the Judas Strain, someone who survived. Then we can construct the vaccine from their white blood cells and antibodies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray remained silent, offering only a slight shrug of his shoulders, quietly stating that any further answers would wait until one of his parents was free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser sighed, reached to a pocket, flipped open the phone, and pressed a button. \"Annishen,\" he said. \"Pick one of the hostages. Your choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s fine ... go ahead and kill them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:45 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray lunged across the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no plan, reacting on pure instinct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Nasser must have signaled one of the men. Gray\u0027s head exploded with pain, clubbed from behind, his vision blew away into brightness, then collapsed into momentary darkness. His body struck the cocktail table and rolled with a thump to the floor, jarring back his sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive guns now pointed at Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore at Seichan and Kowalski.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stood with his arms crossed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser had not moved, his phone still lifted to his ear. \"Hold, Annishen. For the moment.\" He lowered the phone, half covering the receiver with a hand. \"It seems this is the end, Commander Pierce. Of many trails. Polo\u0027s last scroll only confirms what I\u0027ve heard from the Guild contingent in Indonesia. The scientific team has come to the same conclusion. A potential cure does reside within the body of a survivor. One who happens to glow, like revealed in Polo\u0027s story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray shook his head. Not in denial, he just had difficulty comprehending what Nasser was saying. Blood pounded in his ears, deafening him. His plan had failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser lifted his phone again. \"So it seems our historical trail has run full circle back to the scientific trail. This is the end of the proverbial road. For you. For your mother and father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray sensed the world closing in on him. Even his vision narrowed, voices sounded more hollow. Until Vigor stepped closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough,\" the monsignor snapped out with the command of a professor in an auditorium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes turned to him. Even Nasser paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stared at their captor. \"You make many assumptions, young man. Assumptions that will not serve you, or your associates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How so, Monsignor?\" Nasser kept his tone civil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This cure. Have your scientists tested it yet?\" Vigor stared at Nasser, then a small snort escaped him. \"I wager not. All you\u0027ve come up with are theoretical conjectures, supported perhaps by Marco\u0027s story. But that is a far cry from certainty. And I\u0027m sorry to discount your statement that the historical trail has ended. It may indeed have run into the scientific trail, but rather than ending, I believe the more accurate description is that the two trails have merged here. Do not be too quick to ignore history. Not yet, young man. The historical trail continues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray\u0027s mind sought to work through what the monsignor was saying. Was he lying, bluffing, or telling the truth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser sighed, apparently weighing the same. \"1 appreciate your attempt, Monsignor. But I see nothing here to warrant further investigation. The scientists can handle it from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Seichan snorted. \"That is why you will never rise higher in the Guild hierarchy, Amen. Pawning off your responsibility to others. I suggest you listen to the monsignor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser glared, but he did glance back to Vigor. \"Marco\u0027s map points here to the ruins. It ends here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor bent down and lifted the map of Angkor\u0027s extensive complex of ruins. \"This covers over one hundred square miles. That\u0027s a lot of territory. Does this strike you as an end?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Do you propose we search all one hundred square miles? To what end? We have the cure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor shook his head. \"There is no need to search the entire complex. Marco pinpointed the most significant site for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser turned to Gray, ready to threaten, his eyes dark on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stepped between them. \"Commander Pierce has not held anything back. He does not have this answer. This 1 swear on my soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser frowned. \"Yet, you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor bowed his head. \"I do. And I will tell you. But only upon your sworn word that you\u0027ll allow Commander Pierce\u0027s parents to live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser\u0027s features hardened, suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor lifted a hand. \"I\u0027m not asking for you to release them. Only to hear me out, and 1 think you\u0027ll understand the need to follow the trail to its end.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-59.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
