One tall, narrow window looked out to the south Rim.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie found it difficult to realize that he\u0027d come across that Rim just six days previously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClouds had begun to gather over the Rim\u0027s terraced escarpments, a sure sign of a dramatic change in the weather.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He knew that much, at least, from his Tandaloor briefings.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Dosadi had no such thing as weather control.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Awareness of this left him feeling oddly vulnerable.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Nature could be so damnably capricious and dangerous when you had no grip on her vagaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie blinked, held his breath for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVagaries of nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vagaries of sentient nature had moved the Gowachin to set up this experiment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Did they really hope to control that vast, seething conglomerate of motives?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Or had they some other reason for Dosadi, a reason which he had not yet penetrated?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Was this, after all, a test of Caleban mysteries?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He thought not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew the way Aritch and aides said they\u0027d set up this experiment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Observations here bore out their explanations.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;None of that data was consistent with an attempt to understand the Calebans.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Only that brief encounter with Pcharky, a thing which Jedrik no longer was willing to discuss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how he tried, McKie couldn\u0027t evade the feeling that something essential lay hidden in the way this planet had been set upon its experimental course; something the Gowachin hadn\u0027t revealed, something they perhaps didn\u0027t even understand themselves.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What\u0027d they done at the beginning?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They had this place, Dosadi, the subjects, the Primary . . . yes, the Primary.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The inherent inequality of individuals dominated Gowachin minds.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And there was that damnable DemoPol.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;How had they mandated it?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Better yet:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;how did they maintain that mandate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch\u0027s people had hoped to expose the inner workings of sentient social systems.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;So they said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But McKie was beginning to look at that explanation with Dosadi eyes, with Dosadi skepticism.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What had Fannie Mae meant about not being able to leave here in his own body/node?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;How could he be Jedrik\u0027s key to the God Wall?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie knew he needed more information than he could hope to get from Jedrik.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Did Broey have this information?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie wondered if he might in the end have to climb the heights to the Council Hills for his answers.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Was that even possible now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d asked for it, Jedrik had given him almost the run of this building, warning:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t interfere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterfere with what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d asked, she\u0027d just stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had, however, taken him around to familiarize everyone with his status.

They penetrated the cage top without touching it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The hammock itself appeared to be fabric.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was faintly blue.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He returned to his

moving the focus of questions from Pcharky to the planetary society itself.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ardir\u0027s answers, especially on matters of religion and history, were banal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, as he stood in the room off the command post reviewing the experience, McKie found his thoughts touching on a matter which had not even come into question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik and her people had known for a long time that Dosadi was a Gowachin creation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They\u0027d known it long before McKie had appeared on the scene.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was apparent in the way they focused on Pcharky, in the way they reacted to Broey.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie had added one significant datum:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that Dosadi was a Gowachin experiment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But Jedrik\u0027s people were not using him in the ways he might expect.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She said he was the key to the God Wall, but how was he that key?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was not to be found in Ardir.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That one had not tried to evade McKie\u0027s questions, but the answers betrayed a severely limited scope to Ardir\u0027s knowledge and imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie felt deeply disturbed by this insight.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was not so much what the man said as what he did not say when the reasons for speaking openly in detail were most demanding.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ardir was no dolt.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This was a Human who\u0027d risen high in Jedrik\u0027s hierarchy.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Many speculations would\u0027ve crossed his mind.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yet he made no mention of even the more obvious speculations.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He raised no questions about the way Dosadi history ran to a single cutoff point in the past without any trace of evolutionary beginnings.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He did not appear to be a religious person and even if he were, Dosadi would not permit the more blatant religious inhibitions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yet Ardir refused to explore the most obvious discrepancies in those overt religious attitudes McKie had been told to expect.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ardir played out the right attitudes, but there was no basis for them underneath.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was all surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie suddenly despaired of ever getting a deep answer from any of these people - even from Jedrik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn increase in the noise level out in the command post caught McKie\u0027s attention.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He opened the door, stood in the doorway to study the other room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new map had been posted on the far wall.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was a position board, transparent and covered with yellow, red, and blue dots, over the map.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Five women and a man - all wearing earphones - worked the board, moving the colored markers.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Jedrik stood with her back to McKie, talking to several commanders who\u0027d just come in from the streets.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They still carried their weapons and packs.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was their conversation which had attracted McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He scanned the room, noted two communications screens at the left wall, both inactive.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were new since his last view of the room and he wondered at their purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn aide leaned in from the hallway, called out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gate Twenty-One just reported.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Everything has quieted there.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They want to know if they should keep their reserves on the alert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have them stand down,\" Jedrik said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The two prisoners are being brought here,\" the aide added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see it,\" Jedrik said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded toward the position board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie, following the direction of her gaze, saw two yellow markers being moved with eight blue companions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Without knowing how he understood this, he saw that this must be the prisoners and their escort.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There were tensions in the command post which told him this was an important event.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Who were those prisoners?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Jedrik\u0027s commanders spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the monitor at . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not listening to him and he broke off.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Two people on the position board exchanged places, trading earphones.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The messenger who\u0027d called out the information about the gate and the prisoners had gone.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Another messenger came in presently, conferred in a soft voice with people near the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few moments, eight young Human males entered carrying Gar and Tria securely trussed with what appeared to be shining wire.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie recognized the pair from Aritch\u0027s briefings.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The escort carried their prisoners like so much meat, one at each leg and each arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over here,\" Jedrik said, indicating two chairs facing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie found himself suddenly aware, in an extremely Dosadi way, of many of the nuances here.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It filled him with elation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe escort crossed the room, not bothering to steer clear of all the furniture.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The messenger from the hallway delayed his departure, reluctant to leave.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He\u0027d recognized the prisoners and knew something important was about to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGar and Tria were dumped into the two chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Release their bindings,\" Jedrik said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe escort obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik waited, staring across at the position board.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The two yellow and eight blue markers had been removed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She continued to stare at the board, though.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Something there was more important than these two prisoners.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She pointed to a cluster of red markers in an upper corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of her commanders left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie took a deep breath.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He\u0027d spotted the flicker of her movement toward the commander who\u0027d obeyed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;So that was how she did it!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie moved farther into the room to put Jedrik in profile to him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She made no response to his movement, but he knew she was aware of him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He stepped closer to what he saw as the limit of her tolerance, noted a faint smile as she turned toward the prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an abrupt silence, one of those uncomfortable moments when people realize there are things they must do, but everyone is reluctant to start.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The messenger still stood by the door to the hall, obviously wanting to see what would happen here.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The escort who\u0027d brought the prisoners remained standing in a group at one side.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were almost huddled, as though seeking protection in their own numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik glanced across at the messenger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded to the

would be allowed to stay, but that he was expected to use his wits, his off-world knowledge.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Jedrik had read things in his presence:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a normal distrust, caution, patience.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And the fears, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik took her time with the prisoners.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She leaned forward, examined first Tria, then Gar.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;From the way she looked at them, it was clear to McKie she weighed many possibilities on how to deal with this pair.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She was also building the tensions and this had its effect.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gar broke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Broey has a way of describing people such as you.\" Gar said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"He calls you

understood.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gar was not managing his emotions very well.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was a weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many rockets in this universe must die unseen,\" Jedrik said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGar glared at her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He didn\u0027t like this response, glanced at Tria, saw from her expression that he had
