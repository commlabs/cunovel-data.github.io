I would go anywhere. “Yes,” I told him. It felt like nothing else existed outside of that word, that moment. There was just us. Everything that had happened that summer, and every summer before it, had all led up to this. To now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting next to him in the passenger seat felt like an impossible gift. It felt like the best Christmas gift of my life. Because he was smiling at me, and he wasn’t somber, or solemn, or sad, or any of the other s -words I had come to associate with Conrad. He was light, he was ebullient, he was all the best parts of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I’m going to be a doctor,” he told me, looking at me sideways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? Wow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Medicine is pretty amazing. For a while, I thought I would want to go into the research end of it, but now I think I’d rather be working with actual people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, and then said, “Because of your mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “She’s getting better, you know. Medicine is making that possible. She’s responding really well to her new treatment. Did your mom tell you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, she did,” I said. Even though she had done no such thing. She probably just didn’t want to get my hopes up. She probably didn’t want to get her own hopes up. My mother was like that. She didn’t allow herself to get excited until she knew it was a sure thing. Not me. Already I felt lighter, happier. Susannah was getting better. I was with Conrad. Everything was happening the way it was supposed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned over and squeezed his arm. “It’s the best news ever,” I said, and I meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at me, and it was written all over his face: hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got to the house, it was freezing cold. We cranked the heat up and Conrad started a fire. I watched him squat and tear up pieces of paper and poke at the log gently. I bet he’d been gentle with his dog, Boogie. I bet he used to let Boogie sleep in the bed with him. The thought of beds and sleep suddenly made me nervous. But I shouldn’t have been, because after he lit the fire, Conrad sat on the La-Z-Boy and not on the couch next to me. The thought suddenly occurred to me: He was nervous too. Conrad, who was never nervous. Never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you sitting all the way over there?” I asked him, and I could hear my heart pounding behind my ears. I couldn’t believe I’d been brave enough to actually say what I was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad looked surprised too, and he came over and sat next to me. I inched closer to him. I wanted him to put his arms around me. I wanted to do all the things I’d only seen on TV and heard Taylor talk about. Well, maybe not all, but some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a low voice, Conrad said, “I don’t want you to be scared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whispered, “I’m not,” even though I was. Not scared of him, but scared of everything I felt. Sometimes it was too much. What I felt for him was bigger than the world, than anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” he breathed, and then he was kissing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me long and slow and even though we’d kissed once before, I never thought it could be like this. He took his time; he ran his hand along the bottom of my hair, the way you do when you walk past hanging wind chimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKissing him, being with him like that . . . it was cool lemonade with a long straw, sweet and measured and pleasurable in a way that felt infinite. The thought crossed my mind that I never wanted him to stop kissing me. I could do this forever , I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kissed on the couch like that for what could have been hours or minutes. All we did that night was kiss. He was careful, the way he touched me, like I was a Christmas ornament he was afraid of breaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, he whispered, “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, I put my hand up to his chest and I could feel his heart beating as fast as mine. I snuck a peek at him, and for some reason, it delighted me to see his eyes closed. His lashes were longer than mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fell asleep first. I’d heard something about how you weren’t supposed to sleep with a fire still burning, so I waited for it to die down. I watched Conrad sleep for a while. He looked like a little boy, the way his hair fell on his forehead and his eyelashes hit his cheek. I didn’t remember him ever looking that young. When I was sure he was asleep, I leaned in, I whispered, “Conrad. There’s only you. For me, there’s only ever been you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother freaked out when I wasn’t home that morning. I missed two calls from her because I was asleep. When she called the third time, furious, I said, “Didn’t you get my note?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I remembered I hadn’t left one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe practically growled. “No, I did not see any note. Don’t you ever leave in the middle of the night without telling me again, Belly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even if I’m just going for a midnight stroll?” I joked. Me making my mother laugh was a sure thing. I would tell a joke and her anger would evaporate away. I started to sing her favorite Patsy Cline song. “I go out walkin’, after midnight, out in the moonlight—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not funny. Where are you?” Her voice was tight, clipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. There was nothing my mother hated worse than a liar. She’d find out anyway. She was like a psychic. “Um. Cousins?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard her take a breath. “With who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over at him. He was listening intently. I wished he wasn’t. “Conrad,” I said, lowering my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer reaction surprised me. I heard her breathe again, but this time it was a little sigh, like a sigh of relief. “You’re with Conrad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is he?” It was a strange question, what with her in the middle of being mad at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at him and fanned my face like I was relieved. He winked at me. “Great,” I said, relaxing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Good,” she said, but it was like she was talking to herself. “Belly, I want you home tonight. Are we clear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I said. I was grateful. I thought she’d demand that we leave right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell Conrad to drive carefully.” She paused. “And Belly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Laurel?” She always smiled when I called her by her first name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have fun. This will be your last fun day for a long, long time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned. “Am I grounded?” Being grounded was a novelty; my mother had never grounded me before, but I guess I had never given her a reason to. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-not-summer-without-you-summer-2/page-20.html","bookId":2724,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM"}
