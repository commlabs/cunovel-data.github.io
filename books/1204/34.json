{"id":29416,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. THE DEMONIAC IN THE GARRET.","content":"As all may understand, it was with bowed head and crushed heart that I bent my steps towards the grey tower, sitting so stilly among the leafage of the wood above the water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Duty is doubtless noble, and virtue its own reward. But when there is a lass in the case—why, it is somewhat harder to go against her will than to counter all the law and the prophets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I went up the bank towards the tower of Earlstoun, and as I came near methought there was a strange and impressive silence over everything—like a Sabbath-day that was yet no common or canny Sabbath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the angle of the outer wall one Hugh Halliday, an old servant of the Gordons, came running toward me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Minister, minister,” he cried, “ye mauna come here. The maister has gotten the possession{305} by evil spirits. He swears that if ever a minister come near him he will brain him, and he has taken his sword and pistols up into the garret under the roof, and he cries out constantly that if any man stirs him, he shall surely die the death.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But,” I answered, “he will not kill me, who have had no hand in the matter—me who have also been persecuted by the Presbytery and by them deposed.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ah, laddie,” said the old man, shaking his palsied hand warningly at me, “ye little ken the laird, if ye think that when the power o’ evil comes ower him, he bides to think. He lets drive richt and left, and a’ that remains to be done is but to sinder the dead frae the leevin’, or to gather up the fragments that remain in baskets and corn-bags and sic-like.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “For instance, in the auld persecutin’ days there was Gleg Toshie, the carrier, that was counted a great man o’ his hands, and at the Carlin’s Cairn Sandy—the laird I mean—cam’ on Toshie spyin’ on him, or so he thocht. And oor Maister near ended him when he laid hand on him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “‘Haud aff,’ cried Peter Pearson the curate, ‘Wad ye kill the man, Earlstoun?’{306}\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “‘I would kill him and eat him too!’ cries the laird, as he gied him aye the ither drive wi’ his neive. O he’s far frae canny when he’s raised.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nevertheless I will see him,” said I; “I have a message to deliver.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then I hope and trust ye hae made your peace wi’ your Maker, for ye will come doon frae that laft a dead stiff corp and that ye’ll leeve to see.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By the gate the Lady of Earlstoun was walking to and fro, wringing her hands and praying aloud.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Wrath, wrath, and dismay hath fallen on this house!” she cried. “The five vials are poured out. And there yet remains the sixth vial. O Sandy, my ain man, that it should come to this! That ye should tak’ the roofs like a pelican in the desert and six charges o’ pooder in yon flask, forbye swords and pistols. And then the swearin’—nae minced oaths, but as braid as the back o’ Cairnsmuir. Waes me for Sandy, the man o’ my choice! A carnal man was Sandy a’ the days o’ him, a man no to be ruled nor yet spoken to, but rather like a lion to be withstood face to face. But then a little while and his spirit would{307} come to him like the spirit of a little child.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We could hear as we walked and communed a growling somewhere far above like the baffled raging of a caged wild beast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is the spirit of the demoniac that is come to rend him,” she said. “Hear to him, there he is; he is hard at it, cursing the Presbytery and a’ ministers. He is sorest upon them that he has liked best, as, indeed, the possessed ever are. He says that he knows not why he is restrained from braining me—me that have been his wife these many sorrowful years. But thus far he hath been kept from doing any great injury. Even the servant man that brought the message from his master, William Boyd, summoning Alexander to appear before the Presbytery, he cast by main force into the well, and if the man had not caught at the rope, and so gone more slowly to the bottom, he would surely have been dashed to pieces.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But how long has he been thus?” I said. For as we listened, quaking, the noise waxed and grew louder. Then anon it would diminish almost like the howling or whimpering of a beaten dog, most horrid and uncanny to hear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ever since yesterday at the hour when he{308} gat the summons from the Presbytery,” said the lady of Earlstoun.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And have none been near him since that time?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Only Mary,” she said; “she took up to him a bowl of broth. For he never lifted his hand to her in his life. He bade her begone quickly, because he was no fit company for human kind any more. She asked him very gently to come to his own chamber and lie down in peace. But he cried out that the ministers were coming, and that she must not stand in the way. For he was about to shoot them all dead, like the black hoodie-craws that pyke the young lambs’ e’en!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “‘And a bonny bit lamb ye are, faither,’ said Mary, trying to jest with him to divert his mind; ‘a bonny lamb, indeed, with that great muckle heather besom of a beard,’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But instead of laughing, as was his wont, he cursed her for an impudent wench, and told her to begone, that she was no daughter of his.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Has he been oftentimes taken with this seizure?” I asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It has come to him once or twice since he was threatened with torture before the lords of the Privy Council, and brake out upon them{309} all as has often been told—but never before like this.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will go to him,” I said, “and adjure him to return to himself. And I will exorcise the demon, if power be granted me of the Lord.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I pray you do not!” she cried, catching me and looking at me even more earnestly than her daughter had done, though, perhaps, somewhat less movingly. “Let not your blood also be upon this doomed house of Earlstoun.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1651/48774.html","bookId":1204,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:32:32 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:32:32 AM"}
