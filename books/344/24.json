I can assure you, however, that there is no mistake about it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t believe much in hunting for treasures, especially at the other end of the world. To my mind there is not one chance in ten of finding what is sought after.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let me call your attention to this fact, Mr.{193} Gray, that your compensation will not depend upon the finding of the treasure. Mr. Saunders, the boy’s employer, is a man of vast wealth, and he backs the enterprise. No matter if it is a failure, he will pay you what he agrees to.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To be sure, to be sure, that is important. If we are protected, of course, we need not trouble ourselves as to the result of the quest.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Exactly so.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The next question is, will Mr. Saunders be willing to pay enough to make up to us for the increased length of the voyage?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is a matter for the boy to decide. Mr. Saunders has given him full power to act for him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How much time do you think you will need, Mr. Fenwick?” asked the merchant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have talked the matter over with Captain Grover, and have decided that I had better contract for two months.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And should the time be prolonged?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will, of course, pay an additional sum.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is satisfactory.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I ought to mention, also,” said Guy, “that I intend to have two men with me to assist me in taking possession of the treasure, if I find it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then, in addition to paying for the vessel, there will be three passengers, including yourself?”{194}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you will call to-morrow, we will be prepared to submit our terms. We shall need to talk matters over, and estimate what sum we must ask to make ourselves good.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, Mr. Gray. Then I will come into New Bedford again to-morrow.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, Guy, you must stay at my house for the night,” interposed the captain. “It is long since you have been my guest, and my wife and daughter will be very glad to see you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, captain. I shall be glad to accept your invitation.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next day, Guy, accompanied by the captain, called again at the office of the brothers Gray.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They submitted a proposal which, after consulting with Captain Grover, Guy pronounced satisfactory.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now that all is settled about the voyage, I will write to my brother-in-law.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall be glad to have him come to New Bedford at once,” said Guy, “and his friend, too. You may say in your letter that his wages will commence as soon as he reports for duty.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That will remove every obstacle. My brother-in-law is a poor man, and he would not be able to remain here any length of time on expense.”{195}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Captain Grover dispatched a letter at once.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Abner Titcomb answered it in person. He brought with him a man as tall and muscular as himself, but probably about ten years younger.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Luke Clark was thirty years of age, and Abner Titcomb forty-one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Guy was pleased with his companions. They looked honest and reliable, and in case he got into any trouble they were abundantly able to protect him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Titcomb’s arms were hard and muscular, and Luke Clark, who was a farmer, was a good match for him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Guy advanced the two men money to buy an outfit, and when the time came to sail all were in readiness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was not till the day of sailing that Guy saw Captain John Richmond, the new commander of the Osprey.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2979/82139.html","bookId":344,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:03:47 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:03:47 AM"}
