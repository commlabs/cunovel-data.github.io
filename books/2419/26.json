Must be hard to swallow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunglasses told me nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doebler\u0027s money can\u0027t make up for the demotion,\" I said. \"What was it—you do something out of line? Fail the psych profiling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got to the elevator, Engels pressed the button. He watched the elevator numbers creep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much can he buy, Engels? Who else besides you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator doors dinged, then opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now,\" Engels said, \"while we\u0027ve been talking, I could\u0027ve killed you five, maybe six times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped inside the elevator, smiled at Engels. \"Missed opportunities. They suck, don\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose chrome lenses gave back my reflection as the doors slid shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight Hayes was a natural.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only had he found my truck in the Met garage, he had discreetly parked right next to it. I walked around behind his Honda and came up on the open passenger\u0027sside window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight was occupied looking at the F150, craning his neck, trying to see through the tinted glass of the back window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are those?\" he muttered. \"Swords?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess he wasn\u0027t expecting an answer. He jumped so hard he bumped his head on the Honda\u0027s ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut his eyes to either side, seemed to come to the conclusion he was cornered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I followed you here,\" he blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? You did that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blushed. \"When did you spot me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the time we left the entrance of the Techsan parking lot. Until then you were tailing me flawlessly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his elbow on the window of the Honda, rubbed his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face had the same slightly nauseated expression as yesterday. The colourfulness of his blue and yellow Hawaiian shirt didn\u0027t do anything to offset the morose poodleeyes, the chevrons of Band Aids patching cuts on his neck and forearms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis floorboard was littered with cassette tapes—Lightnin\u0027 Hopkins, B.B. King, Fabulous Thunderbirds. Points for Dwight on the tasteometer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the passenger\u0027s seat was a yellow legal pad, a pen, half a pack of Hostess Snoballs. From the rearview mirror hung a small plastic Jesus, its arms spread like the Rio de Janeiro model. It seemed to be making some kind of pathetic promise—Some day, Dwight, you\u0027ll catch a fish this big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" I told him. \"Any fired employee of Pena\u0027s is a friend of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight scowled. He gave his rearview mirror Jesus a tentative nudge. \"I shouldn\u0027t have called Maia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pena was so true to you. So loyal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight\u0027s scalp glistened under his fuzzcap of brown hair. Sweat was trickling down my back. The summer midday parking garage was getting about as comfortable as the mouth of a Labrador retriever, but I waited while Dwight did his internal wrestling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was my roommate at UT,\" Dwight said. \"That\u0027s how far we go back. Freshman year. He kept track of me when he went out to California. When I was looking for work he sort of—adopted me. I owe Matthew a lot. Not just my job. I never expected to be as successful as him, but I\u0027ve watched him. I\u0027ve tried to learn some things about business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost verbatim what Dwight\u0027s mother had said. I decided not to point that out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pena fired you, Dwight. You\u0027d had enough, you argued with him, and he fired you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shouldn\u0027t have pushed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He used you like a dowsing rod for new victims. You saw the results.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight thought about that. \"I followed you—I don\u0027t know, I guess after I talked to Miss Lee this morning, I started thinking about all the things I\u0027d left out, things I should\u0027ve told her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can take a message.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I tell you something about Techsan\u0027s software, what can you promise me? I mean, about confidentiality. Protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can promise that if you\u0027re desperate enough to talk to me, Dwight, it\u0027s going to come out anyway. You might as well tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked, then gave me that wobbly smile again, that same illfed sense of humour I\u0027d seen at Windy Point when I\u0027d borrowed his wet suit. \"You always make your informants feel this good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait until I get rolling. You got airconditioning in this thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed inside and shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight turned on his engine, let it idle. I slanted one of the little air vents my way, got a blast of cool that smelled like old Silly Putty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight said, \"Jimmy Doebler called me about the software, about a week before he died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight was staring out the window, watching the concrete columns of the parking garage as if he expected them to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why you?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jimmy and I met when Matthew first approached Techsan about a deal. We spent an afternoon going over the code so Jimmy could show me it was solid. He treated me really nice. Even after Techsan rejected Matthew\u0027s offer, Jimmy stayed cordial, told me I could come out to his place sometime for barbecue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he called you two weeks ago, what did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thought Matthew was sabotaging their program. And he thought he knew how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like a hunter who\u0027d just had a sixteenpoint buck sit down next to him. I wanted to shoot the thing pretty bad, but I didn\u0027t dare move. I let Dwight take his time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jimmy needed someone with access to Matthew\u0027s computer,\" he told me. \"He wanted me to confirm his suspicions. He thought Matthew was using a back door in the program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A back door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Programmers call it that. It\u0027s a command that\u0027s not advertised— something that lets you inside the program. You hit your special access sequence, and you can get behind the program, go into God mode. The back door can give you unlimited access, let you change data at will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or steal confidential files from betatesters,\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This back door,\" I said. \"Where\u0027d it come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jimmy didn\u0027t tell me. Probably one of the original programmers—Jimmy, Ruby, or Garrett. Maybe they forgot about it, or\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought it so well hidden there was no reason to take it out. One of them could\u0027ve even snuck it into the program maliciously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwight, we\u0027re only talking about three people, here—how would the others not know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to trust your partners in a startup—there\u0027s no time to check each other\u0027s work. A highlevel encryption program has millions of lines of code—millions of places to stash a back door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If one of the principals, a malicious one, gave Pena access to that back door ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matthew could destroy the betatesting,\" Dwight finished. \"The other principals might never know what hit them. Once Matthew bought Techsan, he could fix the back door quickly, document the problem, blame it on the original programmers, then turn around and make a huge profit. He could afford to bribe his informant several million and still come out ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that. There were only three principals at Techsan. One was now dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told Jimmy you couldn\u0027t help him,\" I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight nodded slowly. \"I couldn\u0027t go behind Matthew\u0027s back. Jimmy couldn\u0027t give me any more specifics. The conversation came to an impasse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now you think Jimmy was right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight stared at his little Jesus on the rearview mirror. \"The way Matthew was talking yesterday, about how quickly he would fix the software, yes. I think Jimmy was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that\u0027s not what bothers me most, Tres—not how Matthew hurt your brother\u0027s company, but why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen Matthew do bad things,\" Dwight said. \"Scary things. But this acquisition seems . . . special to him. I gave him a list of four or five possibilities in Austin. Not just Techsan. But he looked at the names of the principals and zeroed in on Techsan immediately. He\u0027s spent a lot of time on this project, more than anything else he\u0027s done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The money potential,\" I said. \"You indicated it was huge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just it. He\u0027s making it huge. He could\u0027ve made the same size IPO with any other company I showed him, probably with less work. But Matthew is pulling in all his markers with venture capitalists to make Techsan his biggest play. It\u0027s like he intentionally wants\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto hurt these principals, make them know they\u0027ve been crushed. He\u0027s being worse about this than I\u0027ve ever seen him. Almost like—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s personal,\" I supplied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would it be?\" I said. \"Pena ever meet Jimmy before?\" \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ruby or Garrett?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that I know of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"UT,\" I said. \"That\u0027s where you and Pena met. That\u0027s where Jimmy and Garrett and Ruby met. No crossing of paths?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must\u0027ve graduated at least ten years after the Techsan folks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. There really wasn\u0027t much coincidence—a school with fifty thousand students. It was hard to find five people in Austin who hadn\u0027t gone there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about before college—you know anything about Matthew\u0027s past?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight hesitated. \"I know he was from a welloff family. I know he hated his parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said— I don\u0027t know why this would help you. His parents were doctors, lived in Marble Falls, did a lot of charity work in orphanages, homeless shelters, places like that. According to Matthew, he was like their trophy child. They gave him everything but never paid attention to him. When he turned eighteen, he pretty much severed all communication with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parents still alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They died while we were in college. Car accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared into the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered whether my urge to dig up Pena\u0027s past was really my investigative instinct, or just the desire to find a weak chink in Pena\u0027s armour, a place he could be hurt. I didn\u0027t trust myself to stop if I found the latter to be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"W.B. Doebler,\" I said. \"How tight were he and Pena?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight shook his head. \"An occasional meeting. I wouldn\u0027t describe them as tight. The only person Matthew spent any real time with in Austin besides me—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his knuckle along the windshield. \"I was going to say, Ruby McBride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d looked through Pena\u0027s appointment book and seen only one meeting scheduled with Ruby—the one Dwight had already mentioned in the spring, when Pena had first approached Techsan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided against asking Dwight about this discrepancy. For one thing, I didn\u0027t want to admit having the datebook. For another, Pena might not have written down every meeting for his secretary to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight apparently took my silence for disapproval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t implying anything,\" he assured me. \"Miss McBride . . . I mean, I never saw them talking business. Matthew just got along well with her socially. She was a lot like Miss Selak—same personality, same interests. It probably just made Matthew feel better, being with her.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-26.html","bookId":2419,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM"}
