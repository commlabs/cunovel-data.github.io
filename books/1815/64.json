He could take me, use me. I was his. I’d made him wait and he’d allowed me to for reasons I wasn’t sure I knew. But he was reminding me now that I could walk far and try to keep my distance at times, but his hand would always hold the chains that bound us together. And he would pull me back when it suited him, because I belonged to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t wait.” My hands went into his hair. “Fuck me. I need your cock inside me—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun me and bent me over the bed, pinning me down with a hand between my shoulder blades, reaching for the back zipper of my capris. He yanked on the pull, ripping it open and rending the cotton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you with me?” he growled, shoving his hand into the opening to cup the cheek of my buttock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes! God, yes …” And he knew it, but he asked. Always making sure to remind me that I had the control, that I gave him permission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe destroyed my pants getting them down to my knees, using just one hand while the other fisted my hair. He was rough, impatient. He gripped the band of my thong and tugged, the material digging into my skin before breaking with a snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed his hand between my bound legs, cupping my sex. My back arched, my body trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Christ, you’re wet.” He pushed a finger inside me. Pulled out. Pushed in with two. “I’m so fucking hard for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tender tissues grasped at his plunging fingers. He withdrew, circling my clit, rubbing it. I pressed into his fingertips, seeking the pressure I needed, soft pleading sounds pouring from my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t come until I’m inside you,” he growled. He grabbed my hips with both hands, pulling me back as he notched the broad head of his cock into my slit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused a moment, breathing hard and loud. Then he shoved inside me. I screamed into the mattress, stretched wide and too full, writhing to accommodate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held me aloft, my feet leaving the floor. He rolled his hips and claimed that last little space inside me, his penis tunneling deep. I squeezed every inch of him, pulsing around him in frantic pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay?” he bit out, his fingers kneading restlessly into my flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed back with my arms, so close to coming it hurt. “More.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the roaring of blood in my ears I heard him groan my name. His cock swelled and lengthened, jerking as he orgasmed in hard spurts. It felt endless and maybe it was, because he started fucking through his climax, pumping me full of hot, creamy semen. The feel of him coming sparked my orgasm. It rushed over me in powerful spasms, racking my body with violent shudders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy nails clawed at the comforter, trying to find purchase as Gideon pounded his cock into me, lost in a hot furious rut. The slickness of his semen wet the lips of my sex, then rolled down my legs. He groaned and thrust deep, rolling his hips, screwing into me. He shuddered, coming again, only moments after his first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFolding over me, Gideon kissed my shoulder, his breath gusting hot and fast over the sweat-slick curve of my back. His chest heaved against my spine, his bruising grip on my hips easing. His hands began to stroke, to soothe. His fingers found my clit and massaged, stirring me, rubbing me into another trembling climax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips moved against my skin. Angel … Over and over he said the word. Brokenly. Desperately. Breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForever yours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile deep inside me, he remained hard and ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was lying on the bed, tucked against Gideon’s side. My pants were gone and he was nude, his magnificent body still damp with sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy husband lay sprawled on his back, one thickly muscled arm arched over his head, while the other curled beneath and around me, his fingers running absently up and down the length of my torso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe lay naked atop the sheets, his legs spread, his cock semierect and curving up to his navel. It glistened in the light of the bedside lamps, wet from me and him. His breathing was just beginning to slow, his heartbeat calming beneath my ear. He smelled delicious, like sin and sex and Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t remember how we got on the bed,” I murmured, my voice throaty and near hoarse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon’s chest rumbled with a laugh. Turning his head, he pressed his lips to my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI curled tighter into him, my arm draping across his waist and holding on tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You good?” he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTipping my head back, I looked at him. He was flushed and sweaty, his hair clinging to his temples and neck. His body was a well-oiled machine, used to the strenuous mixed martial arts he used to condition it. He wasn’t wiped from fucking; he could do that all night, tirelessly. It was the effort of holding back as long as he could, reining himself in until I was as wild for him as he was for me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-64.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
