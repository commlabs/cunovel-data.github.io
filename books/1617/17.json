She carefully tugged at the thong tying it and removed a palm- sized bundle wrapped in dark velvet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is that?” Campbell asked sharply. He shoved his chair back from the table and strode to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis patience wore thin. She spoke of fates and portents, and yet her magic had wrought nothing but uncertainty. Though her tricks roused his curiosity, he\u0027d soon pursue ventures bearing more empirical evidence of success. Swords, not scrying stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSucking at her teeth, Finola slowly unfolded the fabric. “\u0027Tis a keek-stane” she told him, her voice distant. She smoothed the velvet into a square, gently cradling the ball-shaped object into its folds. “For the scrying of visions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell leaned in to see more clearly. The ambient candlelight seemed dimmer somehow, insufficient to light this object. Squinting, he realized it was glass, the back of it painted black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t completely rounded, as he\u0027d thought at first. The front of the keek-stane was concave, and marred by a deep crack. The flaw was a black so dark, it seemed to deny the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinola stroked the face of it, traced her fingers around its edge. She panted a few short breaths, and then a keening so high and so sharp screeched from her, the men clapped their hands to their ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shriek stopped suddenly. Rolling her eyes back into her head, the witch began to chant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo sights that I might see, Alasdair MacColla, come to me. An da shealladh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I might see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlasdair MacColla Ciotach MacDomhnaill, Come to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn da shealladh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo sights soar free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlasdair MacColla mhic Gilleasbuig MacDomhnaill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAppear to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening her eyes, Finola exhaled an impossibly long breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned close to her keek-stane, clutched it between her palms. She gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Campbell cried. He saw nothing but black on the face of her scrying stone. “What do you see, witch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinola eased her eyes shut once more, slowly removing her hands from the glass. Tenderly, she kissed each palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beware, Campbell.” She looked up at the men standing agitated beside her. “The tides have turned. I can no longer see if the woman brings MacColla\u0027s downfall - or your own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recoiled. Long had he suspected her witchery to be folly. But this was too much. He\u0027d seen naught but blackness in her fool stone, and he knew now he\u0027d been right to withhold his complete trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does that mean?” Campbell shouted, and swung his arm back to dash his cup against the hearth. “How could this foreigner, this woman, be a danger to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring Campbell, she turned a hard eye to Purdon, who was visibly taken aback. “You too have much to fear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell fought to keep his hands from the witch\u0027s neck. How was he to know if she played him false? “How dare you address my man and not me? You are both in my employ. You will speak straight, woman, and speak straight to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know not what the vision says about you, Campbell.” Finola was maddeningly placid. It smoothed the lines from her face and made her pale skin seem waxen in the candlelight. “Simply that your course is no longer a wise one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I am done with you. Done with your… black magics,” he sputtered. “I see no use in it. Your talents are merely attempts to harness smoke. You speak the truth of reflections cast in muddy waters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell stormed away from her. He paused at the foot of the stairs and spun back to her. “You\u0027ve been paid. Leave now. Your work is done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You neglect me at your peril.” Finola\u0027s tone was like black ice on a darkened lake, its glassy surface giving lie to the roiling waters beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So be it, witch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twelve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t understand it. MacColla slammed the cup onto the table, sending the amber liquid sloshing. Jean\u0027s cheeks reddened and she stared, stricken, down at her stew bowl, visibly forcing herself to chew and swallow her meal. He felt bad to have upset the lass, but he couldn\u0027t stop himself. “And you\u0027re certain he said disband?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye,” Scrymgeour replied warily, “the king\u0027s letter asked that all Royalist battalions disband at once. He specifically mentioned you, Alasdair. Asking you to disband.” he added gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Disband… ” MacColla growled. All this talk of kings and letters. It meant nothing. The king knew nothing of Campbell. Knew nothing of MacColla\u0027s fight, of the wrongs that needed avenging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a surge of anger and frustration. The world of politics churned on and here he sat with a glass of whisky and two lasses by his side, when what he really required was to face his enemy across a battlefield with naught but the sword at his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye,” Scrymgeour said gravely. “If you continue this feuding with the Campbell, you \u0027ll be in defiance of the king\u0027s orders.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever my fight with Campbell, disbanding Royalist forces won\u0027t stop the king\u0027s enemies on the battlefield.” He stared at Scrymgeour across the table, the weight of his glare something most men would turn from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I fight for Clan MacDonald” MacColla continued. “For land, for honor. These are things more ancient than the king, more ancient than Parliament, or the Covenanters, or any of the many enemies set on bringing down Charles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla was breathing hard, trying to make sense of this turn of events. He would make Campbell pay for his wrongs, and fighting was the only way. If it meant he were in opposition to the king, then so be it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d sacrificed much for King Charles. Fought with James Graham against Campbell and the Covenanters, in defense of the king\u0027s own standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips twitched, face souring in anger, thinking of the countless men he\u0027d lost. So many MacDonald clansmen, fallen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll not back down,” MacColla said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tilted his glass once more to his lips. There\u0027d been a day when he thought his service to Charles would be rewarded. He\u0027d thought perhaps the king would grant him lands. A title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut to request MacColla\u0027s submission instead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll not know what he thinks,” Scrymgeour said carefully,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“asking his supporters ”-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What he thinks?” MacColla interrupted, raising his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s a madman. What he thinks… ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrymgeour stiffened at such treacherous words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley ventured quietly, “King Charles… ” All heads whirled to look at her. She cleared her throat, and tried again. “King Charles thinks that if he can get you to disband, it would demonstrate to all his enemies that he\u0027s sincere in his attempts at brokering a peace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla stared at her, his eyes flat. Finally he gave her a slow nod. “\u0027Tis too late for a peace.” And though his voice was hushed, it was cold steel. “I\u0027ll not disarm. I\u0027ll remain in arms. And if it\u0027s in defiance of king and Covenanter both, then so be it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla drank deeply then, a great swig from his glass that he swallowed back with gritted teeth. He\u0027d thought himself isolated before. But he\u0027d never back down from his fight with Campbell. If that made him nobody\u0027s ally, well, he wasn\u0027t in search of friends. He was hunting for enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared around the table, challenging any who would question such a traitorous move. Scrymgeour sat at the end opposite him, nervously eyeing MacColla over the lip of his crystal tumbler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strange lass sat across from his sister. She was the only one at the table who returned his gaze evenly. He looked at her and met a frank stare, open but unreadable. “And you.” he barked at her. “How do you know of such things? How can I be assured you\u0027re not Campbell\u0027s spy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth to speak, and he interrupted. “Tell me about this strange name of yours.” MacColla picked the cup back up and poured himself another healthy two fingers of whisky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haley.” Her voice was even. “Haley Fitzpatrick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fitzpatrick… ” he mused. “An Irish lass, is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From Donegal,” she announced, sittin g a little straighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly, now? I\u0027ve known Fitzpatricks, but I\u0027ve not ever heard such a strange name as Haley.” Eyes not budging from hers, he took a big swig from his glass. “I\u0027d know how you ended up so far from home. Mistress Haley. Or is it you were kidnapped just as my Jean was?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-oh. She hadn\u0027t thought that far into her backstory. She quickly decided a change of topic was in order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now that\u0027s a funny story. My name, that is.” She didn\u0027t actually know where her parents had gotten the name. Haley imagined her mom had heard it somewhere, liked the sound of it and that was that. She knew she couldn\u0027t speak the truth, though, so she decided to freestyle a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mother thought me a noisy… bairn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew the Scottish slang terms, and she drew on them now to embellish her story. “Strong lungs. Hale and hearty… aye?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Scottish tic had a pleasant feel as it rolled off her tongue, and her face loosened into a smile. “And so they called me Haley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla stared silent, and just when she felt the smile begin to fade from her face, he erupted into a great laugh. He slammed his hand on the table, clinked his glass against hers. He saw that it was empty, and he quickly refilled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the cool, heavy cup. Waved it under her nose. Her eyes immediately teared. The stuff was one step above rotgut. She held it up to the candlelight, wondering if it would make her blind. Great. I\u0027ll drink myself blind then I can beg for alms in front of Holy rood Palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking her eyes shut tight, she put the cool glass to her forehead. Shit. Old Scotland. How the fuck… ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening them again, she glanced around the table. Jean, nervous as ever. God forbid she make a peep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrym… whatever his name was. Staring at MacColla. Probably terrified MacColla would decide he didn\u0027t like him or his news, and tear off his head and eat it for dessert. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-17.html","bookId":1617,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM"}
