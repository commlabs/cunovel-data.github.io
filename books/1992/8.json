He had called me four times today already to check on me. It had been this way all week. Since Angelina had attacked me he had been afraid to leave me. He had a country club to run but he kept calling me. I mentioned getting a job again and he panicked and begged me not to. He said he couldn\u0027t focus on work if he was worrying about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were at a standstill. This wasn\u0027t healthy. He needed to be able to live without worrying over me. I needed to be able to live. His protective nature was starting to smother me and I loved him too much to hurt him by saying something about it. I was going to have bad moments. I was going to slip into my head sometimes and he couldn\u0027t always be there for me. I just didn\u0027t know how to get him to understand this and accept it. How could we make this work? This couldn\u0027t be forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted this forever but Woods deserved so much more. I was holding him back. This relationship would destroy him. I would destroy him. I felt sick to my stomach. I did this. I let this happen. I let myself fall so helplessly in love with him. I let myself believe he could fix me. That we could fix me. But it isn\u0027t happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone rang and I looked down to see Tripp\u0027s number. He hadn\u0027t called in two weeks. I thought about telling Woods that Tripp checked in with me a couple times a month, but I hadn\u0027t found the right words to explain that. Woods seemed jealous of Tripp. He had no reason to be, but he was. I didn\u0027t want to give him something else to worry over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" I said as I stretched my legs in front of me on the sandy beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, I guess,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guess? That don\u0027t sound good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angelina beat me up and Blaire Finlay pulled a gun on her and scared her off. Woods is now more overprotective than ever and he\u0027s always worried about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp was quiet for a moment. I let him digest my words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit. Blaire has a gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. That was his response to what I\u0027d just told him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. I don\u0027t think that was the point. But damn, I can\u0027t picture that hot little blonde with a gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it was a shock,\" I replied, smiling out at the water crashing against the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jace said she was from Alabama. Maybe I\u0027ve been looking for a woman in the wrong states. I need to try out good ole Alabama next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp always managed to make me laugh, and he made me forget for a moment that my chest was about to explode from pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Making me laugh,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat there again for a few moments in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you at now?\" I asked, knowing he was on a road trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in South Carolina at a place called Myrtle Beach. I like it here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like those beaches, don\u0027t you?\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makes me feel like I\u0027m home, in a way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you ever come back here to stay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t respond right away. It made me wonder what kept him away. There were secrets that he wouldn\u0027t share with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doubt it,\" he finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I can stay,\" I said aloud for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because this isn\u0027t working. I\u0027m holding him back. I\u0027m not getting better. This isn\u0027t going away and he deserves more. He needs more. Someone strong to stand beside him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants you, Della.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes what we want isn\u0027t what\u0027s best for us,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah . . . I know that,\" he said quietly. \"But if you leave him it will break him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would shatter me. But I loved him too much to ruin his future. \"He will heal and then the woman who can be all he needs will walk into his life one day and he\u0027ll be glad he didn\u0027t make the mistake of staying with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say that. You aren\u0027t a mistake. You underestimate your worth. You make him happy. Woods is happy with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now he is,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp sighed. I was frustrating him, but he knew deep down that I was right. \"When the time comes and you think you need to leave, just call me. Don\u0027t go by yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I replied. I would call him when I needed to. He wasn\u0027t tied to me. I didn\u0027t control his actions and thoughts. I could travel with Tripp and not destroy his future. At least until I was stable enough to live alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you need to talk to Woods about this first. Don\u0027t blindside him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure that was possible. He would never listen to me. \"Okay,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped out of my car and waved at Bethy as she drove by in a golf cart toward the fifteenth hole. She was a cart girl at the Kerrington Club. It was how she had met Jace. He was a member here and I had heard them arguing over her quitting more than once. He hated seeing the men on the course flirt with her. That had been him once. She refused to change just because she was dating him. I think, deep down, he respected her for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter hanging up the phone with Tripp, I\u0027d sat and thought a long time. Woods needed help and all I seemed to be doing was whining over not having a job and being a burden on him. I was stronger than that. Why couldn\u0027t I help him? I could. He would have me close by and I would have a purpose. So, I\u0027d gone back to the house and dressed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to go apply for a job as his assistant. I could do the tasks that caused him extra headaches. I could handle the staff. I might have been dealing with some mental issues, but I wasn\u0027t helpless. If I could prove to myself that I could do this, then I could prove to Woods and the rest of the world that I was healing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince glanced up at me and smiled. \"Go on in, Miss Sloane,\" he said before going back to his work. Woods had informed him that I never needed permission to enter. I was free to come and go as I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knocked, then opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize that, but make it happen. I need the order here tomorrow, not Monday. I\u0027ll switch suppliers if it doesn\u0027t happen,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir, Mr. Kerrington, we will make it work,\" the voice said from his speakerphone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" he replied, then ended the call before standing up and walking toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I needed to see you,\" he said, smiling as he pulled me into his arms. I put both my hands up to stop him before he could kiss me. If I let him kiss me I would end up forgetting my purpose here, and there was a good chance that we would be naked in minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here to apply for a position as your assistant,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped him. He gazed down at me, confused, and I used the opportunity to sell my idea. \"You need someone to handle the staff and place orders. You have bigger things to deal with. I can handle the staff. I can put out the small fires and leave the big ones to you. I can place orders and I can help you. I can\u0027t sit home alone and lost. I can be here near you and helping you every day.\" I stopped and took a breath. He hadn\u0027t moved, but I had his complete attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he stepped back enough so that he could see the pencil skirt and pair of heels I\u0027d put on. I was even wearing a nice blouse and had pulled my hair up in a bun with chopsticks pushed through it. It was as professional as I could get with what I had to work with. A small smile tugged on his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this your interview outfit?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and continued to watch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to be my assistant. To help me. Looking like that,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I just nodded. Then he chuckled and shook his head. \"Baby, I don\u0027t doubt that you would be able to help me, but if you intend to strut around here dressed like that, I\u0027m going to end up fucking you every damn hour, or thinking about fucking you every damn minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach fluttered hearing him say he was going to fuck me. I had to stay focused. \"I can wear something else,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods studied me a moment. \"You sure you want to do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t going to tell me no. I tamped down my excitement. \"Yes. Please. I want to do something. You know I want a job, but more than that I want to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to file a sexual harassment suit against me when I decide what I need is to touch you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and grinned this time. \"No. But that\u0027s not what I\u0027m here for. I want to take some stress off you,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that would take stress off me,\" he said, putting his hand on my hip and pulling me against him. \"You\u0027re hired. But the minute you feel like it\u0027s too much, you tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squealed and reached up to grab his head and kiss him hard on the mouth. \"Thank you, boss. I swear I\u0027ll do a good job. You just have to swear to give me stuff to do. I want to take stuff off your plate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can take off my clothes,\" he said against my mouth before tracing kisses down my neck. I arched into him. His tongue flicked over my skin, causing me to shiver. \"You can start working for me after I\u0027ve had you in this sexy little outfit. Then you need to change. Because I won\u0027t be able to concentrate with you dressed like this. All I can think about is the way I want to be buried deep inside my new assistant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand slid up my skirt and slipped inside the crotch of my panties. \"All wet,\" he replied before sliding his finger inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I cried out, and his mouth got hungrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unbutton this shirt,\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did as he asked and his mouth worshipped the tops of my breasts as his finger continued to fuck me. \"On my desk,\" he said, picking me up and putting me on his desk, then shoving my skirt up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him pull my panties down. Then he fell to his knees and spread my legs, putting my feet up on the edge of his desk. \"Fuck, you smell good,\" he swore before his tongue began tracing circles around my clit, then dipping inside of me. All I could do was squirm and beg. He kept up the torture until I was chanting, \"Please, Woods, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, his tongue flicked over my clit, sending me rocketing toward my release. Before I could see clearly again, Woods was over me and stretching me as he entered me. I loved it when he filled me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heaven. This is my heaven. All I fucking need to breathe,\" he said as he shifted his hips, moving in and out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed papers out of the way and leaned back on my arms to brace myself. Woods\u0027s shirt was still on and I wished it wasn\u0027t. I loved seeing the muscles in his arms flex when he hovered over me. \"You didn\u0027t unbutton your shirt,\" I said as a moan of pleasure escaped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked. \"You wanted my shirt off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and lifted my legs to wrap them around his waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time, baby. I can\u0027t stop now,\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid my legs up his back higher and he groaned, then threw his head back. I felt him grow inside me and I came apart underneath him as his hot seed poured into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell back on my elbows and gasped for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods\u0027s head dropped onto my chest and he took several deep breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best interview ever,\" he panted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a giggle that only caused him to laugh against my skin. I was going to make myself worthy of this man. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-8.html","bookId":1992,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
