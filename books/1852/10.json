If you\u0027re loyal to Scotland, you\u0027re loyal to me. You\u0027l see the rightness of it once you\u0027ve settled in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once I\u0027ve what?\" Her voice was suspiciously soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once you\u0027ve settled in,\" Alec repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer throat started aching with the need to shout at this arrogant man. Then she remembered Beak\u0027s suggestion not to nudge the laird\u0027s temper until she knew what kind of reaction she was going to get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d better be cautious, she decided. It was common knowledge that Scots lashed out before thinking better of it. They all beat their wives as often as the inclination came over them. \"Sheep settle in, Kincaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m a lady, if you haven\u0027t taken the time to notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve noticed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he drew out that remark made her heart quicken. \"Yes,\" she stammered. \"Women, you see, don\u0027t settle in. It isn\u0027t at all the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" he contradicted with a lazy grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it isn\u0027t,\" she snapped. \"You\u0027l have to take my word on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you chal enging me, English?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was hard enough to frighten her, but he was determined to make her understand her place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for her to cringe… and apologize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am chal enging you,\" Jamie announced, nodding vigorously when he looked incredulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod\u0027s truth, he didn\u0027t know what to make of her now. Her voice and stance reeked with authority. She wasn\u0027t wringing her hands together, either, they were fisted at her sides. Alec knew he really shouldn\u0027t let her get away with her insolence. A wife should always agree with her husband. Jamie obviously hadn\u0027t heard of this sacred dictate, however. Why, she dared to stand up to him as though she were his equal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat thought forced a deep chuckle. The woman was definitely daft, but she did have grit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been in England too long,\" he admitted, \"else I\u0027d find your arguments overbearing, wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you quit cal ing me \u0027wife\u0027? I have a name. Can you not cal me Jamie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a man\u0027s name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to throttle him. \"It\u0027s my name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027l find another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dare you argue with me again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wished she were as big as he was. He wouldn\u0027t dare laugh at her then. Jamie took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say my arguments are overbearing, yet perhaps once I\u0027ve settled in, as you\u0027ve so obscenely put it, you\u0027l get rid of your confusion and see the lightness in what I\u0027m saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since I haven\u0027t the faintest idea what it is you\u0027re saying, I doubt it,\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027ve insulted me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged his big shoulders. \"It\u0027s my right, wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began a prayer for patience. \"I see,\" she whispered hoarsely. \"Then I must assume it\u0027s also my right to insult you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t work that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie gave up. The man was as stubborn as she was. \"Have we crossed the border yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec shook his head. \"We\u0027ve only a stone\u0027s throw to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why were you smiling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In anticipation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec started to turn his back on her, but Jamie stayed the action with her next question. \"Alec? You really dislike England, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t been able to keep the amazement out of her voice. The very idea of anyone disliking her land was simply beyond her comprehension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone loved England, even dul -witted Scotsmen who liked to throw trees at one another. Why, England was the Rome of modern times. Its grandeur couldn\u0027t be denied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do dislike England most of the time. There are exceptions, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exceptions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well? When don\u0027t you dislike England, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I\u0027m raiding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You actually admit to such a sin?\" she asked, clearly appal ed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec\u0027s grin widened. Her blush had intensified until she looked as if the sun had burned her. His wife was so refreshingly honest in all her reactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deadly trait in a man, that, giving others advance warning of what he was thinking, yet most agreeable in a woman. Especial y his woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec let out a long sigh. It was a pity, but his wife didn\u0027t seem to have any sense of humor. She couldn\u0027t tel when he was jesting with her. \"Gain your mount. The sun is already setting,\" he told her. \"You may rest when we reach safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Safety?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scotland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie thought about asking him if he thought safety and Scotland were one and the same, then decided not to bother. She guessed his answer would just irritate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had already learned two very unpleasant things about her husband. One: he didn\u0027t like being questioned or contradicted. That was going to be a problem, Jamie knew, for she was determined to question or contradict him whenever she wanted to. She didn\u0027t care if he liked it or not. Two: when he was scowling at her, she didn\u0027t like him much at all . The second flaw was almost as worrisome as the first. Alec\u0027s mood changed like the wind. The most innocent remarks made him scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jamie, I\u0027m not getting back on that damn horse again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary pul ed on her sister\u0027s arm to get her attention. Alec heard the statement, but paid no attention to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and walked back to his mount. Jamie watched him, thinking to herself that he\u0027d just dismissed her with as much care as one would give a piece of lint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That man\u0027s rude by half,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jamie, aren\u0027t you listening to me?\" Mary demanded. \"You\u0027re going to have to insist that we rest here for the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie\u0027s heart went out to her sister. Mary\u0027s face was streaked with dirt. She looked as exhausted as Jamie felt. Jamie had a good deal more stamina than her sister did, but she\u0027d been up most of the night before, helping one of the servants with her sick child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t dare offer Mary any sympathy, knowing that a firm hand was needed now. Mary would start crying if Jamie gave her an ounce of compassion. That thought was quite chil ing. Once Mary got started, she was worse than the twins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you done with your pride?\" Jamie demanded. \"It\u0027s unladylike to use a common word like\u0027damn\u0027 when you speak. Only serfs use such crude words, Mary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thunder went out of Mary\u0027s expression. \"How can you lecture me now, for God\u0027s sake?\" she wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go home. I miss my papa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough!\" Jamie\u0027s command was given in a much harsher tone of voice. She patted her sister\u0027s shoulder to soften her rebuke, then whispered, \"What\u0027s done is done. We\u0027re married to Scots, and that\u0027s that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t disgrace us by carrying on. Besides, it\u0027s only a little farther to the Highlands,\" she exaggerated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec has promised me that we\u0027l stop for the night just as soon as we cross the border. Surely you can last a few more minutes, sister. Let your husband see what a courageous woman you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary nodded. \"What if he\u0027s too dense to notice my courage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027l be happy to instruct him,\" Jamie promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jamie, did you ever, in all your days, think we\u0027d end up in this predicament? We\u0027re married to Scots!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mary, I never once considered that eventuality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God must be very angry with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not God,\" Jamie qualified. \"Our king.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary\u0027s pitiful sigh trailed behind her as she walked back to her mount. Jamie watched her sister until she\u0027d reached Daniel\u0027s side. The Scottish lord was smiling. Jamie guessed he was amused by the sight of his bride walking like an old woman with rickety knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie shook her head over her sister\u0027s pitiful condition until she realized she was in much the same condition. Her legs were as shaky as dried leaves. She placed the blame on the stupid saddle she was forced to put up with so Alec would think she was a lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took her three attempts to climb up on Wildfire\u0027s back. She\u0027d made her mount nervous with the distraction, too. The mare started prancing, and it took Jamie precious strength to get her calm again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWildfire obviously didn\u0027t like the saddle any more than Jamie did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel had assisted Mary into her saddle, but Alec hadn\u0027t shown any such gentlemanly consideration. He wasn\u0027t even watching her. She wondered what held his attention, for he was gazing intently toward the area they\u0027d just come from, a frown of concentration on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie decided to ignore him as thoroughly as he was ignoring, her. She turned to cal a word of encouragement to her sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never heard Alec approach. He was suddenly by her side. Before she could react, he\u0027d pul ed her off her mount. Then he half carried, half dragged her to the ragged boulder adjacent to the bush Mary had split down the middle when she took her fal . Alec shoved Jamie up against the rock with one hand, slapped Wildfire\u0027s flank with other, then turned his back on her and motioned to Daniel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever are you—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of Jamie\u0027s question was pushed from her mind when Mary was shoved up against her. Daniel positioned himself in front of his bride. His broad back kept both women pinned to the boulder behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Daniel drew his sword, Jamie understood what was happening. She took a deep breath while she watched Daniel motion to Alec and hold up three fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec shook his head, then indicated the number was four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary stil didn\u0027t catch on to the threat. Jamie slapped her hand over her sister\u0027s mouth when she started to stammer a protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec walked back to the center of the smal clearing. Jamie pushed Mary\u0027s hair out of her face so she could see him clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t drawn his weapon yet. Then Jamie realized that Alec didn\u0027t have a sword. Good God, the man was virtual y defenseless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie was sick with fear for Alec\u0027s safety. With that fear came fury. What kind of warrior journeyed through the wilderness without a weapon at his side?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA damn forgetful one, Jamie decided with a scowl. He\u0027d probably lost his sword somewhere along the way to London and hadn\u0027t bothered to replace it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d have to intervene, of course. Alec Kincaid was her husband, and no one was going to put a mark on him as long as she lived. Refusing to understand the true reason she didn\u0027t want to see him harmed, she simply told herself she didn\u0027t want to be widowed on her wedding day, and that was that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie removed the smal dagger from the looped belt she wore around her waist, hoping there was stil time to pass the weapon to Alec. The dagger could inflict real injury if accuracy was employed. There was also Daniel\u0027s sword, Jamie remembered. She prayed Alec\u0027s friend knew how to wield his weapon and was just about to ask him to help her husband when Alec suddenly turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was motioning to Daniel. She could see his face clearly now and immediately started to shiver. The look of fury in those cold dark eyes terrified her. She could see the raw strength in his muscular arms and thighs. Anger was there, too. It washed over her like a hot wave. Power radiated from him until it became a thick mist surrounding them all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never seen such a look before, but she recognized it all the same: he was ready to kil .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary started crying. \"It isn\u0027t a wild boar, is it, Jamie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mary,\" Jamie whispered. She kept her gaze on her husband when she squeezed her sister\u0027s arm. \"It will be all right. Our husbands will keep us safe. You\u0027l see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie almost believed her assurance until she saw the bandits slowly advancing toward Alec. She guessed then it wasn\u0027t going to be all right at all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had moved quite a distance away from the others. Jamie thought he was deliberately trying to draw the bandits as far from the women as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thieves slowly followed him. They took their time, too, acting as if they had all the time in the world to see their kil completed. Alec was much larger than his enemies, but he was unarmed. The odds certainly didn\u0027t favor him. Two of the four bandits carried blackened clubs. The other two waved curved swords in the air. The slicing motion made the air whistle. There was dried blood crusted on the blades, indicating their earlier attacks had been successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie thought she was going to be sick. They were such evil-looking men. They looked as if they enjoyed their sport; two were actually smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat teeth they had were as black as their clubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daniel, please go and help Alec,\" Jamie ordered, her voice weak with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are only four of them, lass. It will be over in just a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer infuriated her. She knew Daniel stood in front of them to offer protection, yet didn\u0027t think that was noble given the fact that his friend was about to be slaughtered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie reached over Mary\u0027s shoulder and shoved Daniel\u0027s back. \"Alec doesn\u0027t have a weapon to defend himself. Give him my dagger or your sword, Daniel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec doesn\u0027t need a weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe answered her in such a cheerful voice that Jamie was certain he\u0027d lost his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped trying to argue with him. \"Either you go and help him or I will .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Al right, lass, if you insist.\" Daniel shrugged Mary\u0027s hands away from his tunic and started toward the men circling Alec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet when he reached the edge of the clearing, he stopped. Jamie couldn\u0027t believe what she was seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel calmly replaced his sword in his scabbard, folded his arms across his chest, and damn if he didn\u0027t grin at Alec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec grinned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re wed to half-wits,\" Jamie told Mary. She decided she was stil more frightened than angry, as her voice actually shivered in the stil ness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep bel ow suddenly gained her full attention. The battle cry came from Alec. The bone-chil ing sound sent Mary into a fit of screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe circle had tightened around Alec. He waited until the first was within striking distance, then moved so swiftly he became a blur of motion to Jamie. She watched him grab hold of one man by his throat and jaw, heard the horrid sound of bone cracking when he twisted the enemy\u0027s neck into an unnatural position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec hurled the man to the ground just as two others, shouting their intentions, attacked from his left side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec slammed their heads together, then tossed them atop the crumpled man on the ground. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-10.html","bookId":1852,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:43 PM"}
