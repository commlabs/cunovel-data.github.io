After all, if a federal judge thought the case warranted a hearing, then maybe Patrick hadn\u0027t gone off his head with \"this sim thing,\" as she liked to call it. A little champagne before dinner and a Graves Bordeaux with perfectly done steaks had finished the melt, leading to a hefty serving of aerobic sex for dessert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now for some much-needed sleep. But his slow slide toward dreamland was cut short by the crash of shattering glass. He levered up in the bed. Not again! The sound had come from the living room this time. Anger bloomed with the crash, but thewhoomp! that followed it shot a bolt of terror through his heart, even before he saw the flicker of flames along the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pam!\" he shouted, shaking her. \"Pam, wake up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was slow coming to. Not used to all that wine. But when she saw the flames and smelled the smoke\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"My God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of them was wearing a stitch but they still had a few seconds. Patrick found Pam\u0027s slacks and blouse on the floor and tossed them to her. As she slipped into them - God knew where their underwear might be - he dialed 911. He found his jeans as he was reporting the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLess than a minute later, cold and barefoot, they stood on the curb and watched the flames fan out from the living room. The howling fire trucks arrived shortly and brought the blaze quickly under control, but not before it had gutted Patrick\u0027s house. Somewhere along the way a neighbor had draped a blanket over their shoulders; another had brought them some old sneakers, ill-fitting but a hell of a lot more comfortable than the cold wet asphalt of the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was over and the firemen were rolling up their hoses, Patrick stood mute, numb with shock, unable to move a muscle as he stared at the smoking ruin of his home. But Pamela began to lose it. She started with a few deep sobs that quickly graduated to wails. Patrick tried to comfort her but she shoved him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t come near me!\" she screamed. \"This is all your fault! I told you to forget this crazy sim thing but you wouldn\u0027t listen! You had to keep pushing and pushing until you almost got us killed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick saw the terror slithering in her eyes. He took a step toward her. \"Pam - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" She held out a hand and backed away. She looked wild with her hair in disarray and her tears reflecting red and blue flashes from the police and fire vehicles. \"No, you stay away! I\u0027ve had it! I can\u0027t take this anymore! Everyone I work with thinks you\u0027re either a nut or an opportunist! I\u0027m tired of defending you and I don\u0027t want to be burned alive! We\u0027rethrough , Patrick! I can\u0027t take any more...I just can\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s hysterical, he thought. She doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s saying. \"Pam, please...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" She raised her hand higher and turned away, moving toward her car. Through a sob she said, \"I\u0027m going home alone, Patrick. Good-bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left Patrick standing alone outside the smoking timbers of what had been his home, wondering how a day that had started out so well could go so hideously wrong. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-17.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
