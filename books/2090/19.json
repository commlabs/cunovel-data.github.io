That\u0027s just weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic lifted a brow. \"Says someone who shouldn\u0027t throw stones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips tightened. If he was going to be snotty, I was going to leave. As soon as someone gave me a ride. I could shift into a werewolf and run back to town, but why should I when I had nowhere to go and nothing pressing to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are a lot of cases like this,\" Nic continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not only defensive, where the victim bites the murderer, but offensive, where an attacker gets off on inflicting pain, exerting control, or marking the victim as his own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we can\u0027t expect normal behavior out of a killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or anyone else, for that matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers clenched, but I refrained from flattening him. I was so proud of myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bite will help you catch the guy, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic shrugged. \"Bite-mark evidence is more often used for conviction than apprehension.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to my frown, he explained further. \"In order to match that bite we\u0027d have to check the impression against everyone\u0027s dental records in Fairhaven. And if the culprit isn\u0027t from here, or hasn\u0027t been to a dentist - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got nothing but worthless information,\" I finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. On the other hand, once a suspect\u0027s in custody, a match can be used to issue charges, maybe even result in a conviction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never dealt with bite-mark evidence before,\" Dr. Watchry murmured, still working. \"But I have an acquaintance who\u0027s a forensic odontologist out of Madison. We\u0027ve discussed the best way to record the evidence. Photos. Measurements.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it better to get him here?\" Nic asked quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The window for collecting saliva in a DNA test is very small. Plus, the skin slides on a corpse if you leave it too long. Shifts the tissue underneath, alters everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI refrained from making gagging noises. I was, after all, a scientist. I\u0027d seen more disgusting things than a corpse. Remember Billy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sooner the better with this kind of evidence,\" Dr. Watchry continued. \"But I\u0027ll call and ask him for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdontology is a very specific science.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be great,\" Nic said. \"I suppose forensic dentists are few and far between out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the only one to be had.\" Dr. Watchry got to his feet. \"Thought the transport would be along by now. I should get this to the clinic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll wait for them.\" Nic helped the doctor pack the lights and gear, then escorted him to his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned with a phone to his ear. I wondered for a minute where he\u0027d gotten it, since his had blown up along with mine in Montana, then decided where didn\u0027t matter. At least he had one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic disconnected the call. \"Still no deputy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled between us, heavy with things neither one of us wanted to say. Or I didn\u0027t want to. Nic didn\u0027t seem to have a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What good would it have done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I loved you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePast tense. I wasn\u0027t surprised. He hadn\u0027t spoken of love before he\u0027d known of my affliction. Now, I was just shocked he hadn\u0027t declared his everlasting hate and blown my head off with silver. If he had any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze lowered to the gun he now wore and I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elise?\" My eyes met his before he turned to stare at the trees. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward didn\u0027t tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Demons, Nazis, incurable blood lust. I think he was trying to scare me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he succeed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough for me to put the silver bullets he gave me into my gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that answered one question, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not like the others,\" I felt compelled to point out; I\u0027m not sure why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve never killed innocent people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed thickly. \"I didn\u0027t say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I wasn\u0027t going to say any more. If Edward had told him everything, Nic would be arresting me - or at least trying to. I\u0027m sure my boss thought showing him I was werewolf would be enough to make Nic stay out of my life forever. Edward was no doubt right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a whole world out here no one knows about,\" Nic murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the J��ger-Suchers\u0027 job to make sure one world stays separate from the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty-eight hours ago Nic hadn\u0027t believed in magic, power, the supernatural. Of course, seeing goes a long way toward believing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he cursed. I moved forward, putting myself between him and the trees. No matter what everyone said - that this was a regular murder, no werewolves, nothing strange but a killer - I was still jumpy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis place wasn\u0027t right. Something was out there. Or maybe, as Damien said, something was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething always was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My own stupidity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic stared at me with a curious expression, which couldn\u0027t quite disguise the trickle of fear. \"I didn\u0027t use a condom. What does that mean? Puppies? Cubs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed me by the arms, shook me once, hard. \"You will. Tell me. I have the right to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let. Me. Go.\" I said quietly, prepared to make him if he didn\u0027t. There was only so much manhandling I would accept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic did as I ordered with a shove that would have sent me sprawling if I hadn\u0027t had the reflexes of a wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers curled into fists, but I didn\u0027t retaliate. I had to cut the man some slack, though not for much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean I can\u0027t tell you; I meant I can\u0027t have children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have if you hadn\u0027t been so bent on mauling me. Do you get off on that now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I get off on. Or at least I did until I found out she wasn\u0027t human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was chilly and distant. I remembered the dreams we\u0027d shared - the picket fence, the little kids, the life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad he still been dreaming those things? Had he been dreaming of having them with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI doubted that. Nevertheless, I did owe him an explanation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cross-species impregnation is impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Cross-species?\" His lip curled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not human; I\u0027m not a wolf. I\u0027m both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. That\u0027s a load off my mind. Am 1 going to get furry now that we\u0027ve swapped spit and various other bodily fluids?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you be more graphic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice had gone cool and prim. Ice queen was back. I\u0027d kind of missed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should just tell him what he wanted to know, then leave him in the woods. He wouldn\u0027t mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lycanthropy is a virus, passed only through saliva while in wolf form. You can\u0027t catch it from me. Unless I bite you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And just to set your mind at ease, since a werewolf can cure anything but silver, you don\u0027t have to worry about STDs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gee, a technicality I\u0027d completely forgotten about amid all the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I once considered him funny and smart? I couldn\u0027t fathom it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your pals fled town,\" he murmured. \"Why are you still here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Batting cleanup.\" I pointed at the sheriff, then froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s nothing supernatural about this, so you can get lost.\" Nic turned and saw what I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheriff\u0027s body was gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3/page-19.html","bookId":2090,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM"}
