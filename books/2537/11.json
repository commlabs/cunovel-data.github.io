Some memorable phrase from the textbook Our Native Tongue, about how wonderfully tasty milk is straight from the cow. And the naive city kids believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact milk straight from the cow tastes rather peculiar. But after it\u0027s been left to stand in the cellar for a day and cooled off¡ª now that\u0027s a different matter. Even those poor souls who lack the necessary digestive enzymes drink it. And there are plenty of them, by the way: As far as mother nature\u0027s concerned, grown-ups have no business drinking milk¡ªit\u0027s children who need it...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut people usually don\u0027t pay much attention to nature\u0027s opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Others pay even less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached for the jug and poured myself another glass. Cold, with a smooth layer of cream... why does boiling make the cream so smooth, the tastiest part of milk? I took a large swallow. No more¡ªI had to leave some for Svetka and Nadiushka. The whole village¡ªit was quite a big one, with fifty houses¡ªhad only one cow. It was a good thing there was at least one... and I had a strong suspicion that the humble Raika had Svetlana to thank for her magnificent yields. Her owner, Granny Sasha, already an old woman at forty, had no real reason to feel proud. As well as Raika, she owned the pig Borka, the goat Mishka, and a gaggle of miscellaneous poultry without any names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just that Svetlana wanted her daughter to drink genuine milk. That was why the cow never caught any illnesses. Granny Sasha could have fed her on sawdust and it wouldn\u0027t have changed a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut genuine milk really is good. Never mind the characters in the ads¡ªthey can arrive in a village with their cartons of milk and that jolly gleam in their eyes and say \"the real thing!\" as often as they like. They\u0027re paid money to do that. And it makes things easier for the peasants, who were long ago broken of the habit of keeping any kind of livestock. They can just carry on abusing the politicians and the \"city folk\" and not worry about pasturing any cows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put down my empty glass and sprawled back in a hammock hung between two trees. The locals must have thought I was a real bourgeois. I arrived in a fancy car and brought my wife lots of funny foreign groceries, spent the whole day lounging in a hammock with a book... In a place where everybody else spent the whole day roaming about, searching for a drop of something to fix their hangovers...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Anton Sergeevich,\" someone said over the top of the fence¡ªit was Kolya, a local alcoholic. He might have been reading my thoughts¡ªand how come he\u0027d remembered my name?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was the drive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Kolya,\" I greeted him in lordly fashion, not making the slightest attempt to get up out of the hammock. He wouldn\u0027t appreciate it in any case. That wasn\u0027t what he\u0027d come for. \"It was fine, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Need any help with anything, around the house and the garden, or you know...\" Kolya asked hopelessly. \"I thought, you know, I\u0027d just come and ask...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes¡ªthe sun, already sinking toward the horizon, glowed blood-red through my eyelids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing I could do. Not the slightest little thing. A sixth or seventh-level intervention would have been enough to free the poor devil Kolya from his hankering for alcohol, cure his cirrhosis and inspire him with a desire to work, instead of drinking vodka and thrashing his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what if I had defied all the stipulations of the Treaty and made that intervention in secret? A brief gesture of the hand... And then what? There wasn\u0027t any work in the village. And nobody in the city wanted Kolya, a former collective farm mechanic. Kolya didn\u0027t have any money to start \u0027his own business\u0027. He couldn\u0027t even buy a piglet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he\u0027d go off again to look for moonshine, getting by on money from odd jobs, and working off his anger on his wife, who drank as much as he did and was just as weary of everything. It wasn\u0027t the man I needed to heal¡ªit was the entire planet Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr at least this particular sixth part of the planet Earth. The part with the proud name of Russia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anton Sergeevich, I\u0027m desperate...\" Kolya said pathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho needs a former alcoholic in a dying village where the collective farm has fallen apart and the only private farmer was burned out three times before he took the hint?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kolya,\" I said. \"Didn\u0027t you have some kind of special trade in the army? A tank driver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid we have any paid professional soldiers at all? It would be better if he went off to the Caucasus, instead of just dropping dead in a year\u0027s time from all that fake vodka...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t in the army,\" Kolya said in a miserable voice. \"They wouldn\u0027t take me. They were short of mechanics here back then. They kept giving me deferments, and then I got too old... Anton Sergeevich, if you want somebody\u0027s face smashed in, I can still do that all right. Don\u0027t you worry, I\u0027ll tear them to pieces!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kolya,\" I asked him, \"would you take a look at the engine in my car? I thought it was knocking a bit yesterday...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, I\u0027ll take a look!\" said Kolya, brightening up. \"You know, I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the keys.\" I tossed him the bunch. \"And I owe you a bottle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKolya broke into a happy smile. \"Would you like me to wash your car too? It must have cost a lot... and these roads of ours...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said. \"I\u0027d be very grateful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only I don\u0027t want any vodka,\" Kolya suddenly said, and I started in surprise. What was this, had the world turned upside down? \"It\u0027s got no taste to it... now a little bottle of homebrew...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done,\" I said. Delighted, Kolya opened the gate and set off toward the small barn I\u0027d driven the car into the evening before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Svetlana came out of the house¡ªI didn\u0027t see her, but I sensed her. That meant Nadiushka had settled down and was enjoying a sweet after-lunch nap... Sveta came over, stood at the head of the hammock and paused for a moment, then she put her cool hand on my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bored?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh huh,\" I mumbled. \"Svetka, there\u0027s nothing I can do. Not a single thing. How can you stand it here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been coming to this village since I was a child,\" Svetlana said. \"I remember Uncle Kolya when he was still all right. Young and happy. He used to give me rides on his tractor when I was still a little snot-nose. He was sober. He used to sing songs. Can you imagine that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were things better before?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People drank less,\" Svetlana replied laconically. \"Anton, why didn\u0027t you remoralize him? You were going to¡ªI felt a tremor run through the Twilight. There aren\u0027t Watch members here... apart from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give a dog a bone and how long does it last?\" I answered churlishly. \"I\u0027m sorry... Uncle Kolya\u0027s not where we need to start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s not,\" Svetlana agreed. \"But any intervention in the activities of the authorities is prohibited by the Treaty. \u0027Humans deal with their own affairs, Others deal with theirs...\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything. Yes, it was prohibited. Because it was the simplest and surest way of directing the mass of humanity toward Good or Evil. Which was a violation of the equilibrium. There had been kings and presidents in history who were Others. And it had always ended in appalling wars...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll just be miserable here, Anton...\" said Svetlana. \"Let\u0027s go back to town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Nadiushka loves it here,\" I objected. \"And you wanted to stay here another week, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re fretting... Why don\u0027t you go on your own? You\u0027ll feel happier in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anybody would think you wanted to get rid of me,\" I growled. \"That you had a lover here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana snorted. \"Can you suggest a single candidate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, after a moment\u0027s reflection. \"Except maybe one of the vacationers...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a kingdom of women,\" Svetlana retorted. \"Either single mothers, or their husbands are slaving away and the women are here to give the children some fresh air and exercise... That reminds me, Anton. There was one strange thing that happened here...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" I asked, intrigued. If Svetlana called something \"strange\"...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember Anna Viktorovna came over to see me yesterday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The teacher?\" I laughed. Anna Viktorovna was such a typical school marm, she should have been in the film The Muddle. \"I thought she came over to see your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother and me, too. She has two kids¡ªa little boy, Romka, he\u0027s five, and Ksyusha¡ªshe\u0027s ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" I said, giving Anna Viktorovna my approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t try to be funny. Two days ago the children got lost in the forest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy drowsiness suddenly evaporated and I sat up in the hammock, holding onto a tree with one hand. I looked at Svetlana. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me straight away? The Treaty\u0027s all very well, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, they got lost, but then they turned up again. They came home in the evening on their own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s really unusual,\" I couldn\u0027t resist saying. \"Children who stayed in the forest for an extra couple of hours. Don\u0027t tell me they actually like wild strawberries?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When their mother started scolding them, they started telling her they got lost,\" Svetlana went on imperturbably. \"And they met a wolf. The wolf drove them through the forest¡ªand straight to some wolf cubs...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see...\" I muttered. I felt a vague flutter of alarm in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, the kids were in a real panic. But then this woman appeared and recited some lines of verse to the wolf, and it ran away. The woman took the kids to her little house, gave them some tea, and showed them to the edge of the forest. She said she was a botanist and she knew special herbs that wolves are afraid of...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Childish fantasies,\" I snapped. \"Are the kids all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And here I was expecting some kind of foul play,\" I said, and lay back down in the hammock. \"Did you check them for magic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re absolutely clean,\" said Svetlana. \"Not the slightest trace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fantasies. Or maybe they did get a fright from someone... maybe even a wolf. And some woman led them out of the forest. The kids were lucky, but a good belt...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The young one, Romka, used to stammer. Quite badly. Now he speaks without the slightest problem. He rattles on, recites pieces of poetry...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can stammering be cured? By suggestion, you know, hypnosis... or what else is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no cure for it. Like the common cold. And any doctor who promises to stop you stammering with hypnosis is a charlatan. Of course, if it were some kind of reactive neurosis, then...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spare me the terminology,\" I asked her. \"So there is no cure. What about folk medicine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, except maybe some wild Others... Can you cure stammering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even bedwetting,\" I growled. \"And incontinence. But Sveta, you didn\u0027t sense any magic, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the stammer\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That can only mean one thing...\" I said reluctantly. I sighed and got up out of the hammock after all. \"Sveta this is not good. A witch. With Power greater than yours. And you\u0027re first level.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana nodded. I didn\u0027t often mention the fact that her Power exceeded my own. It was the main thing that came between us... that could come between us some day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in any case, Svetlana had deliberately withdrawn from the Night Watch. Otherwise... otherwise she would already have been an enchantress beyond classification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But nothing happened to the children,\" I went on. \"No odious wizard pawed the little girl, no evil witch made soup out of the little boy... No, if this is a witch, why such kindness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Witches don\u0027t have any compulsion to indulge in cannibalism or sexual aggression,\" Svetlana said pompously, as if she were giving a lecture. \"All their actions are determined by plain, ordinary egotism. If a witch were really hungry, she might eat a human being. For the simple reason that she doesn\u0027t think of herself as human. But otherwise... why not help the children? It didn\u0027t cost her anything. She led them out of the forest and cured the little boy\u0027s stammer as well. After all, she probably has children of her own. You\u0027d feed a homeless puppy, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like it,\" I confessed. \"A witch as powerful as that? They don\u0027t often reach first level, do they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very rarely.\" Svetlana gave me a quizzical look. \"Anton, do you have a clear idea of the difference between a witch and an enchantress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve worked with them,\" I said curtly. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Svetlana wasn\u0027t satisfied with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An enchantress works with the Twilight directly and draws Power from it. A witch uses accessories, material objects charged with a greater or lesser degree of Power. All the magical artifacts that exist in the world were created by witches or warlocks¡ªyou could call them their artificial limbs. Artifacts can be things or cornified elements of the body¡ªhairs, long fingernails... That\u0027s why a witch is harmless if you undress her and shave her, but you have to gag an enchantress and tie her hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For sure nobody\u0027s ever going to gag you,\" I laughed. \"Sveta, why are you lecturing me like this? I\u0027m not a Great Magician, but I know the elementary facts. I don\u0027t need reminding...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you,\" Svetlana apologized quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at her and saw the pain in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a brute I was. How long could I go on taking out my complexes on the woman I loved? I was worse than any Dark One...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Svetka, forgive me...\" I whispered and touched her hand. \"Forgive a stupid fool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m no better myself,\" Svetlana admitted. \"Really, why am I lecturing you on the basics? You deal with witches every day in the Watch...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeace had been restored, and I was quick to say, \"With ones as powerful as this? Come on, in the whole of Moscow there\u0027s only one first-level witch, and she retired ages ago... What are we going to do, Sveta?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no actual reason to interfere,\" Sveta said thoughtfully. \"The children are all right, the boy\u0027s even better off than he was before. But there are still two questions that need to be answered. First, where did the strange wolf that drove the children toward the cubs come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s if it was a wolf,\" I remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it was,\" Svetlana agreed. \"But the children\u0027s story hangs together very well... And the second question is¡ªis the witch registered in this locality, and what\u0027s her record like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll soon find out,\" I said, taking out my cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later I had the answer. There was nothing in the Night Watch records about any witches in the area and there shouldn\u0027t be any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes after that I walked out of the yard, armed with instructions and advice from my wife¡ªin her capacity as a potential Great Enchantress. On my way past the barn, I glanced in through the open doors¡ªKolya was hovering over the open hood of the car, and there were some parts lying on a newspaper spread out on the ground. Holy Moses... all I\u0027d done was mention a knocking sound in the engine!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Uncle Kolya was singing too, crooning quietly to himself:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re not stokers and not carpenters either, But we\u0027re not bitter, we have no regrets!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were clearly the only lines his memory had retained. And he kept repeating them nonstop as he rummaged enthusiastically in the engine:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re not stokers and not carpenters either, But we\u0027re not bitter, we have no regrets!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he spotted me, Uncle Kolya called out happily, \"This is going to cost you more than half a liter, Antosha! Those Japanese have completely lost it. The things they\u0027ve done to the diesel engine, I can hardly bear to look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not Japanese, they\u0027re Germans,\" I corrected him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Germans?\" Uncle Kolya said. \"Ah, right, it\u0027s a BMW, and I\u0027ve only fixed Subarus before... I was wondering why everything was done different... Never mind, I\u0027ll put it back together. Only my head\u0027s humming, the son of a bitch...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look in to Sveta. She\u0027ll pour you a drop,\" I said, accepting the inevitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Uncle Kolya shook his head. \"Not while I\u0027m working, no way... Our first farm chairman taught me that¡ªwhile you\u0027re messing with the metal, not a single drop. You go on, go on. I\u0027ve got enough here to keep me busy till the evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBidding a mental farewell to the car, I walked out into the dusty, hot street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Romka was absolutely delighted at my visit. I walked in just as Anna Viktorovna was about to suffer ignominious defeat in the battle of the afternoon nap. Romka, a skinny, suntanned little kid, was bouncing up and down on the springy bed and yelling ecstatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to sleep by the wall! My knees get all bent!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do with him?\" asked Anna Viktorovna, very glad to see me. \"Hello, Anton. Tell me, does your Nadyenka behave like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomka stopped jumping up and down and pricked up his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you take him and keep him?\" Anna Viktorovna suggested craftily. \"What do I want with a silly dunce like him? You\u0027re a strict man. You\u0027ll teach him how to behave. He can look after Nadyenka, wash her nappies, wash the floors for you, put the garbage out...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she said all this Anna Viktorovna kept winking at me emphatically, as if I really might take her suggestion seriously and carry off little Romka as an underage slave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll think about it,\" I said, to support her pedagogical efforts. \"If he just won\u0027t do anything he\u0027s told, we\u0027ll take him for reeducation. We\u0027ve had worse cases, and they turned out as meek as lambs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you won\u0027t take me!\" Romka said boldly, but he stopped bouncing, sat down on the bed and pulled the blanket up over his legs. \"What would he want with a silly dunce like me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll put you in a boarding school,\" Anna Viktorovna threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only heartless people put children in boarding schools,\" said Romka, clearly repeating a phrase he\u0027d heard somewhere. \"But you\u0027re not heartless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do with him?\" Anna Viktorovna repeated rhetorically. \"Can I offer you some cold kvass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too, me too!\" Romka squealed, but a stern glance from his mother shut him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I said with a nod. \"Actually, it was this silly dunce that I came to see you about...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What has he been up to?\" asked Anna Viktorovna, taking a businesslike approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just that Sveta told me about their adventures... about the wolf. I\u0027m a hunter, and the thing is.. .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later I was already sitting at the table with a glass of cold kvass, the center of attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know what they say, but I\u0027m a teacher,\" Anna Viktorovna was saying. \"They say wolves help clean up the forest... only it\u0027s not true, of course, a wolf doesn\u0027t just kill sick animals. It kills any animals it can get... But it\u0027s still a living creature. A wolf\u0027s not to blame for being a wolf... But here¡ªright next to the village. Chasing children! It drove them toward the cubs. Do you realize what that means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was teaching the cubs to hunt.\" Anna Viktorovna\u0027s eyes lit up, either with fear or that mother\u0027s fury that sends wolves and bears running for the bushes. \"What was it¡ªa man-eater?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It couldn\u0027t have been,\" I said. \"There haven\u0027t been any cases of wolves attacking people around here. There haven\u0027t been any wolves at all left in these parts for a long time... most likely it was a feral dog. But I want to check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, check,\" Anna Viktorovna said firmly. \"And if... even if it\u0027s a dog. If the children didn\u0027t imagine the whole thing...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot it,\" Anna Viktorovna asked me. And then she added in a whisper, \"I can\u0027t sleep at night... for imagining... what could have happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a doggy!\" Romka piped up from the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush!\" Anna Viktorovna shouted at him. \"All right then, come here. Tell the nice man what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomka didn\u0027t need to be asked twice. He got down off the bed, came over to us, clambered up onto my knees with a very serious air and looked into my eyes searchingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ruffled up his coarse, sun-bleached hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this is what happened...\" Romka began contentedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Viktorovna looked at him in a very sad sort of way. I could understand her. It was these little kids\u0027 father that I couldn\u0027t understand. All sorts of things can happen... okay, so they were separated... but after that, how could anyone just cancel his own children out of his life, and do nothing but pay the alimony?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We walked and walked, you know, we were out for a walk,\" Romka told us with agonizing slowness. \"And after we walked for a while we reached the forest. And then Ksyusha started telling me scary stories...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened to his story very carefully. Well, the \"scary stories\" might be one more reason to believe the whole business was just imagination, but there was the child speaking perfectly clearly. Save for repeating a few words in the usual way for his age, there was nothing to find fault with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust to be on the safe side, I scanned the boy\u0027s aura. A little human being. A good little human being, and I wanted to believe he would grow up into a good adult. Not the slightest sign of any Other potential. And no traces of magical influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, if Svetlana hadn\u0027t spotted anything, what could I expect, with my second-level abilities...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then the wolf laughed out loud!\" Romka exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air in glee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weren\u0027t you frightened?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise, Romka thought about that for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he said, \"Yes, I was. I\u0027m little, and the wolf was big. And I didn\u0027t have a stick¡ªwhere would I get a stick from in the forest? And then I stopped being afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re not afraid of the wolf now?\" I asked. After an adventure like that, any normal child would have developed a stammer, but Romka had lost his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a bit,\" said the boy. \"Oh, now you\u0027ve gotten me lost! What part did I get to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The part where the wolf laughed,\" I said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just exactly like a man,\" said Romka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that was it. It was a long time since I\u0027d had any dealings with werewolves. Especially werewolves as brazen as this... hunting children, only a hundred kilometers from Moscow. Had they been counting on the fact that there was no Night Watch in the little village? But then, the district office checked every case when someone went missing. They had a very skillful, specialized magician for that. From the normal human viewpoint what he did was pure charlatanism¡ªhe looked at photographs, and then either put them aside or phoned the operations office and said in an embarrassed voice, \"I think I\u0027ve got something here... I\u0027m not quite sure what...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then we would have swung into action, driven out into the country, found the signs... and the signs would have been terrible, but we were used to that. Then the werewolves would probably have resisted arrest. And someone¡ªit could easily have been me¡ªwould have waved his hand. Then a jangling gray haze would have gone creeping through the Twilight...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe rarely took that kind alive. But this time I really wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what I think as well,\" Romka said thoughtfully, \"is that the wolf said something. I think so, I think so... Only he didn\u0027t talk. I know wolves don\u0027t talk, do they? But I dream that he did talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what did he say?\" I asked cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away, witch!\" Romka said, trying in vain to imitate a hoarse bass voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. I could already issue the warrant for a search. Or at least request help from Moscow. It was a werewolf, no doubt about it. But fortunately for the little kids, there was a witch there too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA powerful witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t just driven away the werewolf¡ªshe\u0027d tidied up the kids\u0027 memories without leaving any trace. Only she hadn\u0027t gone in deep. She hadn\u0027t expected there would be a vigilant watchman in the village... The boy didn\u0027t remember anything when he was awake, but in his dream¡ªthere it was. \"Go away, witch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow very interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Romka.\" I held out my hand to him. \"I\u0027ll go to the forest and take a look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But aren\u0027t you afraid? Have you got a gun?\" Romka asked eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s at home,\" Anna Viktorovna said strictly. \"And guns aren\u0027t toys for children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomka sighed and asked plaintively, \"Only don\u0027t shoot the cubs, all right? Better bring me one and I\u0027ll train it as a dog. Or two¡ªone for me, one for Ksyusha!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roman.\" Anna Viktorovna snapped in a voice of iron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found Ksyusha at the pond, as her mother had said I would. A flock of little girls was sunbathing beside a pack of little boys, and the gibes were flying thick in both directions. The male sun-bathers were old enough not to pull the girls\u0027 braids anymore, but they still didn\u0027t understand what girls were any good for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turned up everyone stopped talking and stared at me warily. I hadn\u0027t put in an appearance in the village before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oksana?\" I asked the little girl I thought I\u0027d seen in the street with Romka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very serious girl in a dark blue swimsuit looked at me, nodded, and said politely, \"Hi... hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello. I\u0027m Anton, Svetlana Nazarova\u0027s husband. Do you know her?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your daughter\u0027s name?\" Oksana asked suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nadya.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know,\" Oksana said with a nod and got up off the sand. \"You want to talk about the wolves, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOksana glanced at the boys. The boys, not the girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh huh, that\u0027s Nadya\u0027s dad,\" said a freckle-faced kid who was somehow obviously from the village. \"My dad\u0027s fixing your car right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around proudly at his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can talk here,\" I said to reassure the children. It was terrible, of course, that at that age normal kids living in families were already in the habit of being so cautious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was better that they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We went for a walk in the forest,\" Oksana began, standing at attention in front of me. I thought for a moment and sat down on the sand¡ªthen the girl sat down too. Anna Viktorovna certainly knew how to bring up her children. \"It was my fault we got lost...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the village kids giggled. But quietly. After the business with the wolves Oksana was probably the most popular girl with the boys in the junior grades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn principle Oksana didn\u0027t tell me anything new. And there were no traces of magic on her either. Only the mention of a bookcase \"with old books\" made me prick up my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember what they were called?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOksana shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try to remember,\" I asked her. I looked down at my feet¡ª at my long, irregular shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow obediently rose up to meet me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the cool, gray Twilight accepted me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s always a pleasure to look at kids from the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the most intimidated and unhappy of them still have auras without any of the malice and bitterness that grown-ups are shrouded in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentally apologized to the kids¡ªafter all, they hadn\u0027t asked me to do what I was going to do. I ran the lightest possible, imperceptible touch across them. Just to remove the drops of evil that had already been poured onto them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I stroked Oksana\u0027s hair and whispered, \"Remember, little girl...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I wouldn\u0027t be able to remove the block put in place by the witch if she was more powerful than me, or at least equal in power. But fortunately for me, the witch had been very gentle with their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI emerged from the Twilight and the air hit me like a blast from a stove. The summer had really turned out hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember!\" Oksana said triumphantly. \"One book was called Aliada Ansata.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat book wasn\u0027t a herbarium... or at least it wasn\u0027t an ordinary witch\u0027s herbarium¡ªit was particularly heinous. It even had a few vile uses for dandelions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Kassagar Garsarra,\" said Oksana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the children giggled, but uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was it written?\" I asked. \"In Latin letters? You know, like English?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, in Russian,\" Oksana said. \"In really funny, old letters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never heard of a Russian translation of that manuscript, which was extremely rare, even among the Dark Ones. It couldn\u0027t be printed¡ªthe magic of the spells would be erased. It could only be copied out by hand. And only in blood. Not the blood of a virgin or innocent victims¡ªthose were erroneous beliefs introduced later, and modern copies like that were no use at all. The Kassagar Garsarra was still believed only to exist in Arabic, Spanish, Latin, and Old German. A magician who rewrote the book had to use his own blood¡ªa separate jab for every spell. And it was a thick book...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Power was lost with the blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was enough to make me feel proud of Russian witches for producing even one fanatic like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuaran.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no such book, it\u0027s an invention...\" I replied automatically. \"What? Fuaran?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Fuaran,\" Oksana repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, there was really nothing so horrible in that book. But in all the textbooks it was mentioned as an imaginary invention. Because according to legend, that book contained instructions on how to turn a human child into a witch or a warlock. Detailed instructions that supposedly worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was impossible!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn\u0027t it, Gesar?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful books,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re books on botany, are they?\" Oksnana asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh huh,\" I confirmed. \"Like catalogues, kind of. Aliada Ansata tells you where to look for various kinds of herbs... and so on. Well, thank you, Ksyusha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were interesting things going on in our forest. Right there, just outside Moscow, a powerful witch sitting in the dark depths of the forest... no, what dark depths? It was only a small stretch of forest... with a library of extremely rare books on Dark magic. And sometimes she saved children from dim-witted werewolves, for which I was very grateful to her. But books like that were supposed to be registered on a special list¡ª in both Watches and the Inquisition. Because the Power that stood behind them was immense, and dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I owe you a chocolate bar,\" I told Oksana. \"You told me your story really well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOksana didn\u0027t make any fuss. She just said \"thank you,\" and then she seemed to lose all interest in the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the little girl was older, the witch had obviously brainwashed her more thoroughly. Only she\u0027d forgotten about the books the witch had seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that made me feel a bit less worried. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-watch-watch-3/page-11.html","bookId":2537,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:51:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:51:30 PM"}
