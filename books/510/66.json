{"id":12038,"no":66,"title":"CHAPTER LXIV. TODD COMMENCES PACKING UP.","content":"\u0026nbsp;\"Yes,\" said Todd, as he suddenly with a spring rose from the shaving-chair, upon which we left him enjoying reflections of no very pleasant character. \"Yes, the game is up.\" \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He stood for a few moments now in silence, confronting a small piece of looking glass that hung upon the wall exactly opposite to him, and it would appear that he was struck very much by the appearance of his own face, for he suddenly said—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How old and worn I look.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No one could have looked upon the countenance of Todd for one moment without fully concurring in this opinion. In truth, he did look old and worn. But a comparatively short time has elapsed since we first presented him to the readers of this most veracious narrative. Then he was a man whose hideous ugliness was combined with such a look of cool triumphant villany, that one did not know which most to ponder upon. Now his face had lost its colour; a yellowish whiteness was the predominating tint, and his cheeks had fallen. There was a wild and an earnest restlessness about his eyes that made him look very much like some famished wolf, with a touch of hydrophobia to set him off; and certainly, take him for all in all, one would not be over anxious\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To see his like again!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Old and worn,\" he repeated, \"and the game is up; I am decided. Off and away! is my game—off and away!—I have enough to be a prince anywhere where money is worshipped, and that of course must be the case in all civilised and religious communities. I must keep in some such. In the more savage wilds of nature man is prized for what he is, but, thank God, in highly cultivated and educated states he is only prized for what he has been. Ha! ha! If mankind had worshipped virtue, I would have been virtuous, for I love power.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A thought seemed suddenly to strike Todd; and he went into the parlour muttering to himself—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My friend Peter must be effectually disposed of.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He raised the cover which was upon the table, and with a grunt of satisfaction, added—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Gone!—that will do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was no trace of the body that he had kicked under the table. By some strange mysterious agency it had entirely disappeared, and then Todd went somehow to the back of the house and got a wet mop, by the aid of which he got rid of some stains of blood upon the floor and the fender.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All\u0027s right,\" he said, \"I have done some service to Fogg, and I will, when I am far enough off for any sting not to recoil upon myself, take good care that the law pays him a visit. The villain as well as the fool, to deceive me regarding the boy Tobias. What can have become of him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was a question that gave Todd some uneasiness, but at length he came to the conclusion that the dreadful treatment he, Tobias, had received at the asylum had really driven him mad, and that in all human probability he had fallen or cast himself into the river, or gone into some field to die.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Were it otherwise,\" he said, \"I should and must have heard something of him before now.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd then fairly began packing up. From beneath several tables in the room he dragged out large trunks, and opening then some of the drawers and cupboards that abounded in his parlour, he began placing their valuable contents in the boxes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My course is simple enough,\" he said—\"very simple; I must and will, by violence—for she is by far too wily and artful to allow me to do so by any other means—get rid of Mrs. Lovett. Then I must and will possess myself of all that she calls her share of the proceeds of business. Then, at night—the dead hour of the night—after having previously sent all my boxes full of such valuables as from their likelihood to be identified I dare not attempt to dispose of in England, to Hamburgh, I will set the whole house in a flame.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The idea of burning down his house, and if possible involving a great portion of Fleet Street in the conflagration, always seemed to be delightful enough to Todd to raise his spirits a little.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" he added, with a demoniac grin. \"There is no knowing what amount of mischief I may do to society at large upon that one night, besides destroying amid the roar of the flames a mass of accumulated evidence against myself that would brand my memory with horrors, and, for aught I know, cause a European search after me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he spoke, watches—rings—shoe buckles—brooches—silver heads of walking canes—snuff boxes, and various articles of bijouterie were placed row upon row in the box he was packing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" he added, \"I know—I feel that there is danger; I know now that I have spies upon me—that I am watched; but it is from that very circumstance that I ground my belief that as yet I am safe. They fancy there is something to find out, and they are trying to find it out. If they really knew anything, of course it would be—Todd, you are wanted.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Having placed in one of the boxes as many articles of gold and silver as made up a considerable weight, Todd lifted it at one end, and feeling satisfied that if he were to place any more metal in the box it would be too heavy for carriage, he opened a cupboard which was full of hats, and filled up the box with them. By this means he filled up the box, so that the really valuable articles within it would not shake about, and then he securely locked it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"One,\" he said. \"Some half-dozen of such will be sufficient to carry all that I shall think worth the taking. As for my money, that will be safest about me. Ah, I will outwit them yet, I will be off and away—only just in time. Suspicion will take a long time to ripen into certainty, and before it does, the flaming embers of this house will be making the night sky as fair and magnificent as the most golden sunset of summer.\" Another box was now opened, and in that, as it was of considerable length, he began to pack swords of a valuable character. He went to the rooms above stairs, which, as the reader is already aware, contained much valuable property, and brought down troops of things, which with complacent looks he carefully placed in the chest. Ever and anon, as he went through this process, he kept muttering to himself his hopes and fears. \"What is to hinder me, in some principality of Germany, from purchasing a title which shall smother all remembrance of what I now am, and as the Baron Something, I shall commence a new life, for I am not old; no—no, I am not old—far from old, although late anxieties have made me look so. I am not so nervous and fearful of slight things as I was, although my imagination has played me some tricks of late.\" Some slight noise, that sounded as if in the house, although it was in all probability in the next one, came upon his ears, and with a howl of terror he shrunk down by the side of the box he had been packing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd Alarmed At Strange Sounds Whilst Packing His Plunder.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd Alarmed At Strange Sounds Whilst Packing His Plunder.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Help! mercy! What is that?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The noise was not repeated, but for the space of about ten minutes or so, Todd was perfectly incapable of moving except a violent attack of trembling, which kept every limb in motion, and terribly distorted his countenance, if it might be called so.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What—what was it?\" he at length gasped. \"I thought I heard something, nay, I am sure I heard something—a slight noise, but yet slight noises are to me awfully suggestive of something that may follow. Am I really getting superstitious now?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He slowly rose and looked fearfully round him. All was still. True, he had heard a voice, but that was all. No consequences had resulted from it, and the fit of trembling that had seized him was passing away. He went to the cupboard where he kept that strong stimulant that had so much excited the admiration of Peter. He did not go through the ceremony of procuring a glass, but placing the neck of the bottle to his throat, he took a draught of the contents which would have been amply sufficient to confound the faculties of any ordinary person. Upon Todd, however, it had only a sort of sedative effect, and he gradually recovered his former diabolical coolness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was nothing,\" he said. \"It was nothing. My fears and my imaginations are beginning now to play the fool with me. If there were none others, such would be sufficient warnings to me to be off and away.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He continued the packing of the box which had been temporarily suspended, but ever and anon he would pause, and lifting up one of his huge hands, placed it at his ear to listen more acutely, and when nothing in the shape of alarm reached him he would say with a tone of greater calmness and contentment—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All is still—all is still. I shall be off and away soon—off and away!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The dusky twilight had crept on while Todd was thus engaged, and he was thinking of going out, when he heard the creaking noise of his shop door opening. As he was but in the parlour, he made his way to the shop at once, and saw a young man, who spoke with an affected lisp, as he said—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Todd, can you give my locks a little twirl? I\u0027m going to a party to-night, and want to look fascinating.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Allow me,\" said Todd, as he rapidly passed him and bolted the door. \"I am annoyed by a drunken man, so, while I am dressing your hair, I wish to shut him out, or else I might scorch you with the tongs.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, certainly. If there\u0027s anything, do you know, Mr. Todd, that I really dislike more than another, it\u0027s a drunken man.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s only one thing in society,\" said Todd, \"can come near it.—Sit here, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why, a drunken woman, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Werry good—Werry good.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Some one made an effort to enter the shop, but the bolt which Todd had shot into its place effectually resisted anything short of violence sufficient to break the door completely down.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Todd—Mr. Todd,\" cried a voice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In a moment, sir,\" said Todd. \"In a moment.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He darted into the parlour. There was a loud bang in the shop as though something had fallen, and then a half-stifled shriek. Todd reappeared. The shaving chair in which the young man had been sitting was empty. Todd took up his hat, and threw it into the parlour. He then unbolted the door, and admitted a man who glanced around him, and then, without a word, backed out again, looking rather pale. Todd did not hear him mutter to himself, as he reached the street—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sir Richard will be frantic at this. I must post off to him at once, and let him know that it was none of our faults. What an awkward affair to be sure.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89623.html","bookId":510,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:24:10 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:24:10 AM"}
