He died at age ten. He never saw a doctor. We couldn’t get good treatment because of who my family was—warlords, landowners, traitors. We didn’t even know what was wrong with him. He was frail, clumsy. He broke bones a lot. Finally his body just . . . quit on him. Since then, since I came to America, I’ve figured out what he had.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was silent for a verse of “We Three Kings.” “Muscular dystrophy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been talking to doctors,” Maia said. “It passes through the mother’s side, even if the mother doesn’t have it. A boy child would have about a fifty percent chance of inheriting the disease.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And . . . is it a boy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know yet, Tres. I kind of don’t want to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia’s present was still next to me on the porch rail. I stared at the green bow and said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t choose to be a dad, Tres. You’re not obligated to help. Especially not . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t finish, but I understood: Especially not after Ralph’s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid her the present. “Open it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the battered shoebox. One of the many things I’ve never mastered is gift-wrapping. The box looked like it had been packaged by a clumsy, color-blind kindergartner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia set her tea on the railing and opened the box. Inside, wads of tissue paper and a smaller box. Inside that, a still smaller box. This one black velvet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the hinged lid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Corny, I know,” I said. “Ana helped me. She guessed the right size.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia held up the ring like it was critical case evidence. “Tres—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t know about diamonds. The guy said that one was good. I didn’t figure you for a diamond person, but Ana thought it was the right thing. So—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tres—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you think it’s a bad idea . . .” My face felt hot. “I mean, I know it’s weird.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re proposing to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could keep the Austin apartment for business. The house here is huge. I mean . . . I never figured myself for old-fashioned, but the kid needs a dad. I mean, he’s got one, but he needs one full-time. So, yeah. I’m proposing. Marriage, I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that a no?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw her arms around me and kissed me hard. The tea hit the porch and went rolling, splattering all over the place. The diamond ring dug into my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finally let go I felt dizzy, like I’d just been pulled back from the edge of a cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a yes, stupid,” she told me. “A very big yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed me again, and I tried to force myself back into my life, but I couldn’t do it. Something had changed. Something huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat King Cole was playing inside. The air outside was getting colder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Loomis called to us from the front door. She had atole for us to try. She and Sam were waiting to play Old Maid. We’d promised them a game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia ran her hands through my hair. “Tres, do you have any idea what you’re getting yourself into?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None,” I admitted. “Absolutely none.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That makes two of us,” she said. “Come on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took my hand and led me inside, where the rest of our makeshift family was waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJULY 14, 1987\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN SHE WAS SURE THE POLICEWOMAN was gone, thirteen-year-old Madeleine White opened the passenger’s door of the Mercedes and got out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at her brother’s body. A halo of blood glistened around his head. His fingers were curled like claws into the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t want to get closer. She wanted to run. But a hot, scratchy rope knotted around her heart, pulling her forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had watched the argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil the end, she’d been more afraid of Frankie than the policewoman. Even now, as he lay motionless on the pavement, Madeleine was certain he’d get up. He was dazed, or faking it. You couldn’t kill Frankie that easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took another step toward him. Rain began to splatter her clothes, soaking into the cheap green cotton of her patient scrubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to be back at the facility. She hated the security guard for springing her from her room, shuffling her without explanation to a service exit where Frankie had been waiting. Frankie had handed him a thick roll of cash, told him, You didn’t see anything, then driven away with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t supposed to leave. The judge had said so. She hadn’t been outside Stokes-McLean in four months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to show you something,” Frankie told her. “I’m going to make you understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn’t say where they were going. All she knew: This wasn’t the way home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a lazy route through the South Side, past dark fields and clapboard houses, store signs in Spanish, Hispanic men sitting in pools of yellow light outside cantinas. He seemed to be giving her a tour, going slow so she could memorize every storefront, every turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered how much he’d heard from her counselors. She’d started talking about him in therapy. She hated him now, for the times he’d hit her, the things he’d said, the nights she’d awakened and found him sitting at the foot of her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew now that Frankie had killed those women. She’d even toyed with the idea of talking to the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn art class, she’d made a clay sculpture of his face. The counselors said it would make her feel better if she smashed it, to get power over him. Most of the kids were younger than she. They’d all been sexually or physically abused before they did whatever violence got them committed. Their clay images were crude little voodoo dolls which they smashed with enthusiasm. But Madeleine was an artist. She made Frankie’s clay bust with the same care as the blue self-portrait she’d drawn him for Christmas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bust looked just like him. Even the counselors said so. But she couldn’t smash it. Every day they would encourage her to do so, but the clay hardened, drying in splotchy white patches like mold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe counselors must’ve broken confidentiality to warn Frankie. They’d probably taken his money just like that son-of-a-bitch security guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrankie turned onto Mission Road, a crumbling stretch of blacktop that led nowhere except into deeper darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the cop pulled them over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrankie grabbed Madeleine and shoved her back against the door. “Not one sound. Whatever happens, you stay in this fucking car or I’ll slap the shit out of you. Understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, looking down at his body, she could still feel the electric charge of his rage, the promise of violence that made her skin tingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to make you understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knelt. The policewoman’s baton lay next to Frankie’s motionless hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about her classmate, the girl in the locker room who’d teased her about Frankie being a psychopath. Rumors were all around town, the girl said. Frankie raped women. He got off on strangling them. The girl asked if he’d tried anything with Madeleine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeleine remembered picking up the nearest heavy object, a biology textbook. She remembered hitting the girl in the face, then slamming her to the floor, pummeling her, not realizing until her friends pulled her off that the girl wasn’t fighting back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had done that to someone she barely knew, yet she couldn’t touch a clay mask of Frankie’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized she should be doing something—running, calling the police. But she couldn’t call the police. The police had done this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCicadas chirred in the woods. Water was trickling somewhere—a stream out in the fields. Far off in the direction the police car had gone, a single streetlight gleamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the place Frankie had killed those women. Madeleine was sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had brought her here, his own sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the lady cop hadn’t come . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wound was just behind Frankie’s ear. His hair was sticky with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeleine felt no anger toward the policewoman. Instead, she felt a strange kind of awe. One quick strike . . . was that really all it took to stop him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA siren wailed in the distance. Maybe another police car, maybe something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t want the policewoman to get in trouble. Frankie had made a world of trouble for all those women he’d hurt. She didn’t want Frankie to ever get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to think of what to do. She couldn’t go home. Her father would never believe Frankie had meant to hurt her. He would somehow turn this into her fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hospital was just over those fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have to walk miles in the dark, but she could do it. The security guard would let her in. He’d keep quiet. What choice did he have? He couldn’t say anything without getting himself in trouble. The counselors may have betrayed her, but Stokes-McLean was still the safest place she’d ever known. She would just have to be more careful. She couldn’t talk about her family anymore. Nobody could help her but herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d leave Frankie, pretend she was never here. As long as he stayed motionless, as long as he couldn’t hurt her anymore . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he groaned. Madeleine started to tremble when Frankie rolled onto his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was unmarred, his eyes—so like hers—were dazed, searching the sky. He didn’t look exactly conscious, but he was trying to make a fist, like he was trying to grab hold of life, pull himself back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that instant, Madeleine knew what would happen. Frankie would live. He would get better. He would punish her. The lady cop, whoever she was, would die for daring to touch him, just like the other women had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at her brother’s face, pale and perfectly sculpted, so much like the clay bust. She heard her counselor’s voice: Take control. You’ll never be free of him otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the policewoman’s baton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAFTERWARD, SHE RAN DEEP INTO THE woods. Cactus tore at her legs. Branches scraped her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stumbled in a stream, dropped the baton in the water. She kept going, running from the sound of the police siren somewhere behind her, impossibly thin and weak, but growing steadily louder, like a lament from the other side of the world. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mission-road-tres-navarre-6/page-37.html","bookId":2421,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:35 PM"}
