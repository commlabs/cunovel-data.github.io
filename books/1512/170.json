I was the one who did it last…” The male scientist hit the back of her head and knocked her out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe carried her in his arms. His tears flowed down his cheeks as he kissed her. Then he handed her over to Lan before turning to Zheng. “Let me do the surgery. I was the one who taught her. Rest assured. If I make any mistakes, you have her in your hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng said calmly. “Smart. I need another volunteer.” He looked at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe other scientists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChengXiao immediately said. “No need. I am different from your woman. My blood is poisonous. Any organism that enters my body will dissolve. How else do you think I could wake up so fast? Haha. My mom is an expert with Gu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others looked at him in shock. He seemed proud of himself and threw two kisses to the girls. Though they ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng said. “Gu? Can you use it to clear the Alien inside her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChengXiao waved his hand. “It isn’t so simple. Do you really think those legends are real? Perhaps, but not to my knowledge. There also isn’t any herbs or insects here. How do you expect me to help you? Don’t worry. Look at the callus in his hands. He had probably done this surgery numerous times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng fell into silence. His eyes returned to normal. He couldn’t simulate Xuan’s personality for too long. This was what Xuan would do in the same situation. Of course, he was more likely to just abandon Lori in the first place. But Zheng wouldn’t do it. And this was the result he obtained from thinking in Xuan’s personality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No time to waste. We will talk on the way.” Zheng took the lead into the corridor. Lan ran up to him to give him directions. They headed to the infirmary at a fast speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng yelled as they were running. “Just like what I said, I am much faster than you. This path should only take around fifteen minutes. Don’t question it. I want everyone to continue going forward. Complete this movie and return to God’s dimension. If I die, the next Guide will appear in the newbies. One of you that unlocked the constraint will get tested. The leader position will be passed on as long as you can pass the test. Don’t worry about me. I won’t die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng and Yinkong opened their lips but at the end didn’t say anything. Lan was silent. Honglu nodded and said. “Understood. This is the best solution for the team. Don’t die or our strength will drop to the bottom. We will be in dangerous situations the following movies. The two of you take the lead. Choose the shortest path. Get to the shuttle as fast as possible, understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scientists were shocked by the series of events. They nodded immediately without saying much like they were part of the team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng said. “Don’t underestimate the Aliens. They are much stronger than the first movie in power, speed, and maybe other things. Do your best to kill them from afar. If they get close, Yinkong, stab their head. It should kill them in one hit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYinkong nodded. She decided not to say anything and stood there without any expression. ChengXiao clapped his hands and laughed. “So you like our leader. Haha. You are my dream girl. Big breasts loli. Why do I laugh when you like another man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang! ChengXiao was sent flying several meters. He lay on the floor for a while then ran back laughing. The atmosphere felt more relaxed. However, Lori said unexpectedly. “I am not going. I don’t want to do the surgery!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng asked her in confusion. “Lori. Don’t be stupid. Listen, there’s anesthesia. It wont hurt. Don’t worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLori suddenly cried out and said. “But what about you? Fifteen minutes is a lie. They need forty minutes. I don’t believe it. It’s all my fault for coming to the movie and getting attacked by the Alien. I don’t want you to die…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she was crying, a hand pressed the back of her head lightly and she fell unconscious. ChengXiao said calmly. “A good girl won’t make things difficult for her man! When a man made his decision with resolution, whether it’s right or wrong, she shouldn’t try to change his mind by throwing a tantrum! And the man shouldn’t be affected, or else he’s not qualified to be a man!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng looked at ChengXiao in surprise. This was the first time he took a serious look at this man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take good care of her, even if it costs your life. This is what a man should do!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore long, they had reached room 17, the infirmary. The scientist who decided to stay behind looked at his wife quietly. He didn’t touch her. He just looked at her then turned around into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng sighed. He carried Lori inside. The others kept going in the corridor. There were only a few minutes left for the thirty-minute limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng said in a rushed tone once they were inside. “Hurry. I will act as your assistant. What do you need?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scientist took out a can of gas and said. “This gas can put Aliens to sleep for a short period. It also works on the Chestburster. This can will last about five minutes. There’s only one due to its high cost, you are very lucky. I will cut off the nutrition tube between the Alien and the host. It will stop growing then we will have time to take it out. The whole procedure takes about thirty minutes. Now show her chest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng hesitated for a moment then did as he was told. Life was the priority at this point. This man had also basically given up his own life. There was no reason for him to hold back. Though at the end, only the center of her chest was shown. The other areas were covered in sterile drapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scientist was a proficient surgeon. The anesthesia shot was almost instant. It only took him three minutes to put Lori in an isolated room with the can of gas. Then he focused on the scalpel with all his heart like completing a piece of art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter opening Lori’s chest with a cut, he searched inside with a pair of surgical pliers. After a while, he inserted the scalpel into the chest seriously. When he pulled out the scalpel, blood also shot out from the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng immediately asked in panic. “Did you cut any major blood vessel? Anything wrong? What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scientist said calmly. “Relax. I haven’t had any accidents in the last dozen years. The nutrition tube is cut. I just have to take the Alien out now. But judging by its size, I am afraid.” He sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng took a deep breath and calmed down. “What’s the problem? Tell me. What did you see from its size? Don’t hide anything!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scientist moved the pliers then said. “Just as I thought. This is a Queen. The Queen only gets born every several hundred Aliens. The situation is terrible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng asked. “What do you mean? Is it difficult to take out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. We took the Queen out last time. But have you heard of queen bees and queen ants? They have special connection with their bees and ants. So when their lives are in danger, the bees and ants will attack the cause of danger. Aliens are a similar species. When I forcibly take this Queen out, the Aliens will come charging at us in frenzy. Then we will likely get torn apart!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, they heard banging from the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-9-chapter-2-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-9-chapter-3-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-9-chapter-3-01","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
