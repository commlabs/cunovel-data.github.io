Otto, Natalie, and Richard were sympathetic about my lack of success as a songwriter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t know great songs when they hear them,\" Natalie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe economic situation at home had not improved. I reluctantly went back to work at the Bismarck checkroom. I managed to get a job during the day parking cars at a restaurant on the North Side, in Rogers Park. My irrational mood swings continued. I had no control over them. I became ecstatic for no reason and depressed when things were going well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne evening, Charley Fine, my Stewart Warner mentor, and his wife, Vera, came to the apartment for dinner. For economical reasons, we served a cheap takeout dinner I had picked up at a neighborhood Chinese restaurant, but the Fines pretended not to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the evening, Vera said, \"I\u0027m driving to Sacramento, California, next week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalifornia. Hollywood. It was as though a door had suddenly opened for me. I thought of all the magical hours I had spent at the RKO Jefferson Theatre, solving crimes with William Powell and Myrna Loy in After the Thin Man, riding with John Wayne in the covered wagon to California in The Oregon Trail, watching helplessly as Robert Montgomery terrorized Rosalind Russell in Night Must Fall, swinging through the trees with Tarzan in Tarzan Escapes, and having dinner with Cary Grant, Clark Gable, and Judy Garland. I took a deep breath and said, \"I\u0027d like to drive you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all looked at me in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s very kind of you, Sidney,\" Vera Fine said, \"but I don\u0027t want to imp - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be my pleasure,\" I said enthusiastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to Natalie and Otto. \"I\u0027d like to take Vera to California.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an uncomfortable silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe picked up the conversation after the Fines had left. \"You can\u0027t go away again,\" Otto said. \"You just got back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if I could get a job in Hollywood - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We\u0027ll find something for you to do here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what there was for me to do in Chicago. Checkrooms and drugstores and parking cars. I had had enough of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a brief silence, Natalie said, \"Otto, if that\u0027s what Sidney wants, we should give him a chance. I\u0027ll tell you what. Let\u0027s compromise.\" She turned to me. \"If you don\u0027t find a job in three weeks, you\u0027ll come back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a deal,\" I said happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sure I could easily get a job in Hollywood. The more I thought about it, the more wildly optimistic I became.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was finally going to be my big break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive days later, I was packing, getting ready to drive Vera and her young daughter, Carmel, to Sacramento.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard was upset. \"Why are you leaving again? You just got back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could I explain to him all the wonderful things that were about to happen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said, \"but this is important. Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m going to send for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was near tears. \"Is that a promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my arms around him. \"That\u0027s a promise. I\u0027m going to miss you, buddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took five days to get to Sacramento, and when we arrived, I said goodbye to Vera and Carmel, and spent the night in a cheap hotel. Early the following morning I took a bus to San Francisco, where I changed to another bus, to Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arrived in Los Angeles with one suitcase and fifty dollars in my pocket. I bought a copy of the Los Angeles Times at the bus station and turned to the want ads to look for rooms to rent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one that instantly appealed to me was an ad for a boardinghouse that had rooms for four-fifty a week, breakfast included. It was in the Hollywood area, a few blocks from the famed Sunset Boulevard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turned out to be a charming, old-fashioned house in a lovely residential area on a quiet street, at 1928 Carmen Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I rang the bell, the door was opened by a small, pleasant-faced woman who appeared to be in her forties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello. Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. My name is Sidney Sheldon. I\u0027m looking for a place to stay for a few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Grace Seidel. Come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up my suitcase and walked into the hall. The house had obviously been converted from a sprawling family residence to a boardinghouse. There was a large living room, a dining room, a breakfast room, and a kitchen. There were twelve bedrooms, most of them occupied, and four communal bathrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I understand that the rent is four-fifty a week, and that includes breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace Seidel contemplated my rumpled suit and my worn shirt, and said, \"If you press me, I could make it four dollars a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at her and desperately wanted to say, I\u0027ll pay the four-fifty. But the little money I had left was not going to last very long. I swallowed my pride and said, \"I\u0027m pressing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a warm smile. \"That\u0027s fine. I\u0027ll show you to your room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was small but neat and attractively furnished, and I was very pleased with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to Grace. \"This is great,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ll give you a key to the front door. One of our rules is that you\u0027re not allowed to bring any women in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me introduce you to some of the other boarders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took me into the living room where several of the boarders were gathered. I met four writers, a prop man, three actors, a director, and a singer. As time went on, I learned that they were all wannabes, unemployed, pursuing wonderful dreams that would never come true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGracie had a well-mannered twelve-year-old son, Billy. His dream was to become a fireman. It was probably the only dream in the boardinghouse that would come true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI phoned Natalie and Otto to tell them that I had arrived safely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember,\" Otto said, \"if you don\u0027t find a job in three weeks, we want you back here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, Gracie\u0027s boarders sat around the large living room, telling their war stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a tough business, Sheldon. Every studio has a gate and inside the gate the producers are screaming for talent. They\u0027re yelling that they desperately need actors and directors and writers. But if you\u0027re standing outside the gate, they won\u0027t even let you in. The gates are closed to outsiders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe, I thought. But every day someone manages to get through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI learned that there was no Hollywood, as I had imagined it. Columbia Pictures, Paramount, and RKO were located in Hollywood, but Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Selznick International Studios were in Culver City. Universal Studios was in Universal City, Disney Studios was in Silverlake, Twentieth-Century-Fox was in Century City, and Republic Studios was in Studio City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had thoughtfully subscribed to Variety, the show business trade paper, and it was left in the living room like a Bible for all of us to look at, to see what jobs were available and which pictures were being produced. I picked it up and looked at the date. I had twenty-one days to find a job, and the clock was running. I knew that somehow I had to find a way to get through those studio gates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, while we were having breakfast, the telephone rang. Answering the telephone was almost an Olympic event. Everyone raced to be the first to pick it up because - since none of us could afford any kind of social life - the phone call had to be about a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe actor who picked up the phone listened a moment, turned to Grace and said, \"It\u0027s for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were sighs of disappointment. Each boarder had hoped that it was a job for him. That phone was the lifeline to their futures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bought a tourist\u0027s guide to Los Angeles, and since Columbia Pictures was the closest to Gracie\u0027s boardinghouse, I decided to start there. The studio was on Gower Street, just off Sunset. There was no gate in front of Columbia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked in the front door. An elderly guard was seated behind a desk, working on a report. He looked up as I came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said confidently. \"My name is Sidney Sheldon. I want to be a writer. Who do I see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied me a moment. \"Do you have an appointment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you don\u0027t see anybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There must be someone I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not without an appointment,\" he said firmly. He went back to his report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently the studio did not need a gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent the next two weeks making the rounds of all the studios. Unlike New York, Los Angeles was widely spread out. It was not a city for walking. Streetcars ran down the center of Santa Monica Boulevard and buses were on all the main streets. I soon became familiar with their routes and schedules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile every studio looked different, the guards were all the same. In fact, I began to feel that they were all the same man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to be a writer. Who do I see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you have an appointment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t see anybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHollywood was a cabaret, and I was hungry. But I was outside looking in, and all the doors were locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was running out of my short supply of funds, but worse than that, I was running out of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was not haunting the studios, I was in my room, working on stories on my old battered portable typewriter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, Gracie made an unwelcome announcement. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said, \"but from now on there will be no more breakfasts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had to ask why. Most of us were behind in our rent and she could no longer afford to keep carrying us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up the next morning, starving and broke. I had no money for breakfast. I was trying to work on a story, but could not concentrate. I was too hungry. Finally, I gave up. I went into the kitchen. Gracie was there, cleaning the stove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw me and turned around. \"Yes, Sidney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stammering. \"Gracie, I - I know the new rule about - about no breakfast, but I was wondering if - if I could just have a bite to eat this morning. I\u0027m sure that in the next few days - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me and said, sharply, \"Why don\u0027t you go back to your room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt crushed. I walked back to my room and sat in front of my typewriter, humiliated that I had embarrassed both of us. I tried to go back to the story but it was no use. All I could think of was that I was hungry and broke and desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later there was a knock at the door. I walked over and opened it. Gracie stood there, holding a tray, and on it was a large glass of orange juice, a steaming pot of coffee, and a plate of bacon and eggs with toast. \"Eat it while it\u0027s hot,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat may have been the best meal I ever had. Certainly the most memorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I returned to the boardinghouse one afternoon, after another futile day making the rounds of the studios, there was a letter from Otto. In it was a bus ticket to Chicago. It was the most depressing piece of paper I had ever seen. His note read: We will expect you home next week. Love, Dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had four days left and nowhere else to go. The gods must have been laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat evening, as Gracie\u0027s group and I sat around the living room, chatting, one of them said, \"My sister just got a job as a reader at MGM.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A reader? What does that mean?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the studios have them,\" he explained. \"They synopsize stories for producers, which saves them the trouble of reading a lot of trash. If the producer likes the synopsis, he\u0027ll take a look at the full book or play. Some studios have staffs of readers. Some use outside readers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind was racing. I had just read Steinbeck\u0027s masterpiece, Of Mice and Men, and -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes later, I was skimming through the book and typing a synopsis of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy noon the next day I had made enough copies on a borrowed mimeograph machine to send to half a dozen studios. I figured that it would take a day or two to deliver them all and I should hear back about the third day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the third day came, the only mail I received was from my brother, Richard, asking when I was going to send for him. The fourth day brought a letter from Natalie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day was Thursday, and my bus ticket was for Sunday. One more dream had died. I told Gracie that I would be leaving Sunday morning. She looked at me with sad, wise eyes. \"Is there anything I can do?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her a hug. \"You\u0027ve been wonderful. Things haven\u0027t worked out as I hoped they would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never stop dreaming,\" she told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly the following morning, the telephone rang. One of the actors ran over to it and grabbed it. He picked up the receiver and in his best actor voice said, \"Good morning. Can I help you? . . . Who? . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tone of his voice changed. \"David Selznick\u0027s office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room went completely silent. David Selznick was the most prestigious producer in Hollywood. He had produced A Star Is Born, Dinner at Eight, A Tale of Two Cities, Viva Villa!, David Copperfield, and dozens of other movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe actor said, \"Yes, he\u0027s here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were literally holding our breaths. Who was he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to me. \"It\u0027s for you, Sheldon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may have broken the boardinghouse record racing to the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman\u0027s high voice said, \"Is this Sidney Sheldon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sensed instantly that I was not speaking to David Selznick himself. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Anna, David Selznick\u0027s secretary. Mr. Selznick has a novel that he wants synopsized. The problem is that none of our readers are available.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs available, I thought automatically. But who was I to correct someone who was about to launch my career?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Mr. Selznick needs the synopsis by six o\u0027clock this evening. It\u0027s a four-hundred-page novel. Our synopses usually run about thirty pages with a two-page summary and a one-paragraph comment. But it must be delivered by six o\u0027clock this evening. Can you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no possible way I could get to the Selznick Studios, read a four-hundred-page novel, find a decent typewriter somewhere, write a thirty-page synopsis, and get it done by six o\u0027clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Of course I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. You can pick up the book at our studio in Culver City.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on my way.\" I replaced the receiver. Selznick International Studios. I looked at my watch. It was nine-thirty in the morning. Culver City was an hour and a half away. There were a few other problems. I had no transportation. I am a hunt-and-peck typist, and to have typed a thirty-page synopsis would have taken me forever, and forever did not even include time to read a four-hundred-page novel. If I arrived at the Culver City studio at eleven, I would have exactly seven hours to perform a miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I had a plan. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-other-side-of-me/page-8.html","bookId":2371,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM"}
