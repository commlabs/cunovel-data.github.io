He\u0027ll show up, but he won\u0027t bother us...he wants her to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking out through the window of the Jeep I could see no sign of the tracker. I was secretly hoping that he wouldn\u0027t show up. Putting Bella in the line of danger was burning holes through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not here,\" my voice was tense. \"Let\u0027s go,\" I firmly commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Emmett a tight nod and he started unbuckling Bella\u0027s harness. I could hear her pulse start to race as her breathing became harsh and ragged. Her breath filled my lungs, reminding me forcibly of the precious creature I would be protecting this evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s worried...so human. \"Don\u0027t worry, Bella,\" Emmett said in an amused voice, \"we\u0027ll take care of things here quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoisture was beginning to build up in Bella\u0027s eyes and in that most fleeting of seconds I wanted to take her and run �C run thousands of miles �C just me and her, together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s not an option, Alice\u0027s vision swirled in her head before it went up in a wisp of smoke as I realized she was right. We should hurry, her thoughts were strained as the many smoky and shadowy figures shifted and disappeared with each decision that was being made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice, Emmett,\" I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope he\u0027s here! This is going to be so much fun! Emmett ran away gleefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t worry, Edward. We\u0027ll keep her safe. Alice slid silently into the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella was showing extraordinary strength for someone so human. I swept out of the Jeep and opened the back door to see Bella\u0027s face which was still full of sadness and my protective side took a different turn as I took her hand and brought her to my side to comfort and protect her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the terror rose in my chest I was beginning to drag my feet reluctantly towards her door, where she would leave me to go inside. I knew the only safe place for her was in my arms. Our footsteps echoed in the silence but I was not oblivious to my surroundings as we walked; my eyes continually darting from every corner of the open space like we were in the middle of a war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear someone approaching, Emmett resisted the temptation to attack but his thoughts were always wildly enthusiastic about the prospect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifteen minutes,\" I reminded Bella while stealing a glance to look at her face, an icy surge of terror rising in the pit of my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny tears began seeping from beneath her eye lids as she looked up into my eyes. \"I can do this,\" she sniffed like she was trying to convince herself more than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights on the porch were on, making her tears reflect the light as soon as we ascended the last step. She turned around to face me, bringing her warm hands to my face, sending a quivering feeling through my body in the most hostile of times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" Bella said intensely. \"I will always love you, no matter what happens now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did she think was going to happen to her? An odd chill ran up my spine. \"Nothing is going to happen to you, Bella,\" I replied fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just follow the plan, okay? Keep Charlie safe for me. He\u0027s not going to like me very much after this, and I want to have the chance to apologize later,\" she looked up at me with her tear stained face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel my heart sinking as I took in her pitiful expression. Before I could show this emotion on my face I heard the thoughts of my family from the woods, distracting me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re here �C only James and Victoria. Alice thought flatly. Laurent went to see Carlisle �C or �C to warn him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are keeping their distance. They caught our scent. Emmett was still hoping for a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, well, well... I heard James\u0027 thoughts. This is going to be a lot more fun than I realized, a laugh escaped his lips at the prospect of his new hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get inside, Bella. We have to hurry,\" I said urgently while leaning over her protectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more thing,\" she whispered hastily. \"Don\u0027t listen to another word I say tonight!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly her lips were on mine, sending warmth and pleasant electric shocks through my body. I forgot where I was for a fraction of a second before she pulled away, tears still streaming down her face. Her expression changed to searing anger, she turned on her heal and kicked the front door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away, Edward!\" her voice was a scream before she slammed the door in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there looking at the door in stunned disbelief; my breath being temporarily robbed. The feelings pulsing through me were oddly disembodying. Shrugging off the sensation as best I could, I continued to look around the cool misty grounds, stealing glances through my siblings\u0027 minds along with Charlie\u0027s. James continued to keep his distance even though his thoughts were smug and optimistic to the point of foolishness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is she doing? Emmett wondered. I underestimated her... hilarious, this should be entertaining!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\" Charlie called out anxiously at his daughter\u0027s angry words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move closer and see if you can get a better look at what\u0027s going on,\" I heard James order Victoria. Better her neck than mine, James thought coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave me alone!\" Bella shouted back at Charlie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s thoughts were incoherent with panic at his daughter\u0027s obvious pain. He began pounding on her door while startling flashes of insight and thought filled my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The human is fighting with her father,\" Victoria told James after returning to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis I have to see, James thought menacingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s on the move, Alice warned me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he gets too close I\u0027ll take care of him, Emmett thought pleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes searched the forest for any sign of the tracker but came up empty. I continued to stand protectively below Bella\u0027s window. James moved in to hear the conversations going on inside the house but stayed clear of my vision. My concentration flew up fifteen feet to where Bella was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, are you okay? What\u0027s going on?\" Charlie called out, frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going home,\" she shouted angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s almost believable �C chuckle �C this is getting good, Emmett\u0027s amusement was heightened at her acting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he hurt you?\" Charlie asked, disjointed anger rising in his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo...he protects her, James thought with great disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt their thoughts I snapped. I flew through the air swiftly entering her bedroom through the window, starting to grab anything and everything from her dresser in a fierce attempt to speed the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Bella shouted back at her dad while she ran around her room, packing her belongings. She hadn\u0027t noticed my presence until she turned to her dresser. Her eyes found mine and they were full of sadness and guilt. Before I could pull her into my embrace we were interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he break up with you?\" Charlie asked, perplexed by her sudden angst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Bella shrieked at Charlie again while shoving handfuls of clothes into her bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictoria is heading to our house because she knows that we plan to bring Bella there. Alice informed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie began beating on Bella\u0027s door, panic rushing his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened, Bella?\" Charlie shouted through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I broke up with him!\" she shouted back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was jerking her hand on the zipper of the bag so I caught her hand gently with mine and zipped it for her. I picked up the bag and gently placed it on her shoulder. \"I\u0027ll be in the truck �C go!\" I whispered and lightly pushed her towards her door, trying to press the fact that we needed to get far away from James. I jumped out of the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Charlie asked when she opened her door, following her downstairs. \"I thought you liked him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do like him �C that\u0027s the problem. I can\u0027t do this anymore! I can\u0027t put down anymore roots here! I don\u0027t want to end up trapped in this stupid, boring town like Mom! I\u0027m not going to make the same dumb mistake she did. I hate it �C I can\u0027t stay here another minute!\" Bella yelled in a desperate attempt to convince Charlie to let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s good, Emmett thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is setting up an escape...clever, but not clever enough. James thought. Things are about to get real interesting, James sneered in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bells, you can\u0027t leave now. It\u0027s nighttime,\" Charlie whispered to her with pure sadness in his voice. Charlie\u0027s shocked thoughts were over powering as each word lashed at him, causing him pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yes she can. Come on little girl, come out to play. James snarled with great smugness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resisted the temptation to whip around and attack him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is not a good idea, Alice thought in hollow tones. Flashes of the future floated into her mind but disintegrated when I decided not to follow through with my plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll sleep in the truck if I get tired,\" Bella responded to Charlie, her voice emotionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just wait another week,\" Charlie begged. \"Ren��e will be back by then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Bella stuttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need to get her out of there, Alice pushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She called while you were out.\" Charlie knew he had caught her off guard. \"Things aren\u0027t going so well in Florida, and if Phil doesn\u0027t get signed by the end of the week, they\u0027re going back to Arizona. The assistant coach of the Sidewinders said they might have a spot for another shortstop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArizona is it? Surely she wouldn\u0027t actually go there. Hum... James\u0027 thoughts trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a key,\" Bella retorted to Charlie\u0027s pitiful attempt at keeping her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s right. Just come outside. James was wistful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it weren\u0027t for our presence James would have already attacked. I was instantly becoming nervous at our plan. Is this plan going to back fire? I wondered gravely. We would shortly be in her very slow truck driving several miles towards my house before she would be in the protective custody of seven vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just let me go, Charlie.\" Bella said softly. \"It didn\u0027t work out, okay? I really, really hate Forks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is really going to hurt Charlie, Alice thought sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella walked out of the house. \"I\u0027ll call you tomorrow!\" she yelled back to Charlie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumped into her truck and the engine roared to life. She backed out and squealed her tires on the asphalt as she sped away. I was running next to her truck and jumped in. She was trembling and tears were leaking out of her eye lashes in massive amounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pull over,\" I said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can drive,\" she barely sputtered a sobbing protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the fun begins! James thought while running behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m right behind you, Edward. Don\u0027t worry, he won\u0027t try anything, Alice reassured me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Bella\u0027s face and pain knotted my stomach at the thought of her grief in this moment. I wanted to do something but I couldn\u0027t think of how to comfort her. She was barely staying in between the lines on the road, probably because her vision was blinded by more tears. I grabbed her waist and put my foot on the gas pedal, moving her warm body over mine until I was the one driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t be able to find the house,\" I tried to explain to her in a way that wouldn\u0027t upset her anymore than she already was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights of the Jeep flashed across the truck and she turned to look out of the window, horror displayed in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just Alice,\" I immediately tried to soothe her by cradling her hand in mine. At my touch she sighed and began to relax, though her face showed a great sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tracker?\" Bella whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...is running behind us. Emmett\u0027s a few steps ahead of him, Alice informed me of the situation outside the truck but I was too intent on continued to leak from her eyes as she looked up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He heard the end of your performance,\" I said with the deepest of loathing while remembering his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie?\" she looked like she was going to choke from the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice quickly began scanning for Charlie\u0027s future - which was solidly there. His future looks bright, she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tracker followed us. He\u0027s running behind us now.\" I continued to try and calm her nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we outrun him?\" she asked anxious and curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that truck? Funny, Emmett mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I pressed the gas pedal down to the floor, emphasizing Emmett\u0027s thoughts. The truck groaned, sputtered and continued to move at its regular fifty-five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice try, but that truck isn\u0027t going any faster. Emmett thought before jumping in the back, highly amused by the whole situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA high pitched scream exited Bella\u0027s parted lips and I reached up, clamping my hand across her mouth to quiet her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Emmett,\" I explained while removing my hand from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was screwed up in anguish and terror so I wound my arm around her waist and brought her into my side. I felt better immediately at her closeness because this was the safest place for her to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay Bella,\" I promised, though I wasn\u0027t sure if my promise was empty. \"You\u0027re going to be safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face still showed a twist of emotions: terror, panic, and sadness. Expelling all thoughts that were around me I concentrated every last particle of my mind on the one person who needed me most �C Bella. I needed to distract her and to distract myself. I knew the best way to get her talking was to make an assumption, which she would undoubtedly correct for me - usually with a lengthy explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t realize you were still so bored with small-town life,\" I began, looking sideways at her face. \"It seemed like you were adjusting fairly well �C especially recently. Maybe I was just flattering myself that I was making life more interesting for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t being nice,\" she thwarted my attempts at a diversion while gazing down. \"That was the same thing my mom said when she left him. You could say I was hitting below the belt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. He\u0027ll forgive you,\" my lips turned up in an attempt to ease her pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe returned her gaze to mine and her eyes were still wide with panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, it\u0027s going to be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it won\u0027t be all right when I\u0027m not with you,\" her lips barely let the whisper escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be together again in a few days,\" I tightened my grip on her, realizing that I didn\u0027t ever want her to leave my protective custody. \"Don\u0027t forget that this was your idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the best idea �C of course it was mine,\" she replied smugly and a smile crept up my face at the sign of a new emotion, but it was fleeting at best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did this happen?\" she choked. \"Why me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared out into the darkness realizing that it was my error. You idiot, moron! I knew that there were others in the vicinity and in a moment of happiness I forgot the dangers that could befall a human, especially one that smelled as tempting as she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my fault �C I was a fool to expose you like that.\" I replied with rage present in my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I meant,\" she said exasperated. \"I was there, big deal. It didn\u0027t bother the other two. Why did this James decide to kill me? There\u0027re people all over the place, why me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my attempt to block out all thoughts one still protruded into my mind, answering the question for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause you are protected by seven vampires �C something I have never come across. This is the best challenge, yet. I couldn\u0027t have asked for anything better than this! James thought hungrily for the hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated before answering Bella\u0027s question, trying to word it in a way that wouldn\u0027t scare her beyond her current state of terror though the cold fury that was in every line of my face was obvious to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a good look at his mind tonight,\" I began in a low voice. \"I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s anything I could have done to avoid this, once he saw you. It is partially your fault.\" I looked at her reflection in the glass. \"If you didn\u0027t smell so appallingly luscious, he might not have bothered. But when I defended you...well, that made it a lot worse. He\u0027s not used to being thwarted, no matter how insignificant the object. He thinks of himself as a hunter and nothing else. His existence is consumed with tracking, and a challenge is all he asks of life. Suddenly we\u0027ve presented him with a beautiful challenge �C a large clan of strong fighters all bent on protecting the one vulnerable element. You wouldn\u0027t believe how euphoric he is now. It\u0027s his favorite game, and we\u0027ve just made it his most exciting game ever,\" I said in disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will win, James\u0027s thoughts were rapt and exultant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, trying to control the sensation that was building in my chest to pull over and attack. I controlled my urge and continued. \"But if I had stood by, he would have killed you right then,\" I said, frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought...I didn\u0027t smell the same to the others...as I do to you,\" she said hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t. But that doesn\u0027t mean that you aren\u0027t still a temptation to every one of them. If you had appealed to the tracker �C or any of them �C the same way you appeal to me, it would have meant a fight right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt her quiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I have any choice but to kill him now,\" I muttered. \"Carlisle won\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you kill a vampire?\" she asked through her petrified sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlad I\u0027m not the one to tell her this one, Emmett chuckled and I ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy focus was solely on Bella. Her gaze met mine and I could see the darkness of my face and eyes as I spoke. \"The only way to be sure is to tear him to shreds, and then burn the pieces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the other two will fight with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways so full of questions, isn\u0027t she? Alice mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The woman will. I\u0027m not sure about Laurent. They don\u0027t have a very strong bond �C he\u0027s only with them for convenience. He was embarrassed by James in the meadow...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But James and the woman �C they\u0027ll try to kill you?\" she choked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou silly girl! You are the fragile one, the breakable one �C the one that is being hunted, I internally replied. \"Bella, don\u0027t you dare waste time worrying about me. Your only concern is keeping yourself safe and �C please, please �C trying not to be reckless.\" I pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he still following?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, he\u0027s keeping his distance; he\u0027s pretty keen not to be seen. He won\u0027t come after Bella tonight, Alice informed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He won\u0027t attack the house, though. Not tonight.\" I replied while turning onto my driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the several mile drive to the house we could finally see the distant lights of the house becoming larger and clearer. I could immediately hear the thoughts of Laurent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe they live like this �C Amazing! I can\u0027t understand why they are planning on ruining all of this for a human. Laurent thought in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s at the forest edge, I\u0027ll grab Bella. Emmett thought while jumping out of the truck and running alongside it. When we were coming to a stop he opened the door and pulled Bella under his coat and ran her towards the house and through the front door, Alice and I at their side. Relief flowed through my veins now that she was inside, protected. Everyone stood at our arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe this crap, Rosalie was muttering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh thank heavens they are all right, Esme and Carlisle both thought, relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent stood in the mist of my family members, his eyes a gleaming ominous red, making the difference between us and them stand out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell is he doing in our house? I might get that fight after all, a feral snarl ripped up Emmett\u0027s throat, low and vibrating. He sat Bella down next to him, preparing to pounce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s tracking us,\" I stared coldly at Laurent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was afraid of that,\" Laurent frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear James as he began thinking strategy in his mind, he was going to meet up with Victoria who was already waiting for him a short distance from the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will he do?\" Carlisle asked Laurent in chilling tones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Laurent began. \"I was afraid, when your boy there defended her, that it would set him off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSame old games, Laurent thought angrily in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you stop him?\" Carlisle questioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll stop him, Emmett roared internally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing stops James when he gets started.\" Laurent answered while shaking his head in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll stop him,\" Emmett promised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t bring him down. I\u0027ve never seen anything like him in my three hundred years. He\u0027s absolutely lethal. That\u0027s why I joined his coven.\" Laurent said doubtfully. His head began to shake back and forth again, this time in confusion. Why her? What is so special about this human girl that would make them want to provoke such a vicious hunter? He stole a look at Bella, and then turned back to Carlisle, perplexed by the situation. \"Are you sure it\u0027s worth it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA growl formed in my stomach and ripped up my throat so loudly that it had him cringing away from me in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re going to have to make a choice.\" Carlisle said gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one hell of a life style to live in. But James �C I could never defeat James. They mentioned something about a settlement in Denali. \"I\u0027m intrigued by the life you\u0027ve created here. But I won\u0027t get in the middle of this. I bear none of you any enmity, but I won\u0027t go up against James. I think I will head north �C to that clan in Denali,\" should I warn them? Oh, why not! \"Don\u0027t underestimate James. He\u0027s got a brilliant mind and unparalleled senses. He\u0027s every bit as comfortable in the human world as you seem to be, and he won\u0027t come at you head on...I\u0027m sorry for what\u0027s been unleashed here. Truly sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go in peace,\" Carlisle said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHum, I hope it is like this in Denali, Laurent wondered, looking around before sweeping out of the house, his thoughts fading with distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle turned to meet my gaze. \"How close?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to seal off all entrances to the house, Esme thought while walking over to the wall, pressing a key pad - making large metal walls creek and groan as they sealed up the glass wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About three miles out past the river; he\u0027s circling around to meet up with the female.\" I explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust drop her off at the river\u0027s bank and get this over with, Rosalie sneered in her head. I ignored her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the plan?\" Carlisle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll lead him off, and then Jasper and Alice will run her south.\" I explained to him in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouth? Interesting choice. \"And then?\" Carlisle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as Bella is clear, we hunt him.\" I replied darkly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, we know we won\u0027t let them hurt Bella. \"I guess there\u0027s no other choice,\" Carlisle agreed but his lips were turned down into a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to Rosalie. She needed to learn that Bella is now a part of our family. \"Get her upstairs and trade clothes,\" I commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thoughts sputtered incoherently for several seconds before anger surged through her mouth. \"Why should I?\" she said vehemently. \"What is she to me? Except a menace �C a danger you\u0027ve chosen to inflict on all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose...,\" Emmett put a hand on her shoulder but she shrugged it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease ignore her, she\u0027ll come around one of these days, please, Emmett begged for Rosalie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith everything that Emmett has been doing for me lately I decided that I would do something for him. I ignored Rosalie\u0027s jibe and changed tack in the speed of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll do it, Edward. Esme suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to her, \"Esme?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" she responded immediately. Esme flew to Bella\u0027s side and without flinching brought her into her grasp and raced upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Bella was upstairs everyone was in a hurry, running around packing their belongings or preparing for their independent trips. I continued to ignore Rosalie\u0027s thoughts as they grew meaner and more visual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rosalie, you will take Bella\u0027s truck. Esme will go with you,\" I commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to ride in that...that...thing?\" she barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Rose. Do it for me,\" Emmett asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t!\" she hissed loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rosalie, Bella is part of this family and you will treat her with respect, do you understand me?\" Carlisle\u0027s voice became firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Rose snapped at us and then stalked away. I could feel the angry satisfaction on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m coming with you to hunt James. Maybe we can talk him out of this nonsense and can spare his life, Carlisle thought wishfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme and Bella appeared down the stairs only a few minutes after they went up, both of them changed. It was an odd sensation to smell Bella all over Esme but we were in a hurry so I informed Bella of our plan. \"Esme and Rosalie will be taking your truck, Bella,\" I said while passing her to grab a cell phone that Carlisle was giving to each family member.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice, Jasper �C take the Mercedes. You\u0027ll need the dark tint in the south.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll keep her safe, Edward...promise. I\u0027ll miss you. Alice thought while Jasper silently nodded in approval of the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re taking the Jeep,\" I told Bella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice,\" Carlisle asked, \"will they take the bait?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice closed her eyes while swirls of colors flashed and danced around until she solidly saw their path. \"He\u0027ll track you. The woman will follow the truck. We should be able to leave after that\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go.\" I\u0027ll give you a minute, Carlisle thought but there was still a bite of impatience in his thoughts �C we had to hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rushed over to Bella, not even hesitating while I brought her into my tight embrace, letting her body warm every inch of mine. The monster, desire, was still positively, solidly there. I placed my hand under her chin, bringing her lips to mine. Euphoria splashed through my hectic nerves - calming them, though the electricity reminded me that I was doing this for her, that I would die for her - to protect her. In seconds the kiss was over and I could feel the slight tearing of my body as I placed her back on the ground. I kept her face in my hands, communicating silently the love I had for her as tears strolled down her pink cheeks, her face eloquent with despair. It was time to go, so I wretched myself away from her and then I was gone, a chill filling my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran to the jeep, hoping into the passenger\u0027s side. Carlisle was driving and Emmett was in the back, we took off, driving north. James caught my scent easily and began chasing after us in the Jeep. I picked up the phone to call Esme. It only rang once, \"Go now,\" I ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could still here the thoughts of Victoria as we speed away. Rosalie and Esme fired up Bella\u0027s truck and drove east. Victoria caught the smell of Bella and took off after her truck. I called Alice, even though I was positive she already knew. She answered her phone before it even rang, \"Victoria is on their trail,\" I informed her. \"It\u0027s time.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-5-midnight-sun-twilight-2/page-21.html","bookId":2027,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:00 PM"}
