We can’t do this.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Captain Fiddler.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Have your scouts guide the ones who can walk back to the food wagons. Ask the Khundryl to attend to those who cannot. See to it that everyone gets water, and food if they can manage any.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, Adjunct.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBadalle watched him ease his arms under Rutt, watched him lift the boy. Rutt is now Held. He carried Held until he could carry her no longer, and now he is carried, and this is how it goes on .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Adjunct,’ she said as Fiddler carried Rutt away, ‘I am named Badalle, and for you I have a poem.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Child, if you stand there unattended to for much longer, you are going to die. I will hear your poem, but not now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBadalle smiled. ‘Yes, Mother.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for you I have a poem . She stared at the straining backs, the shedding ropes, the toppled statues by the wayside. Two nights now since that meeting, since the last time Badalle had seen the Adjunct. Or the man named Fiddler. And the water was now gone, and still Rutt would not wake, and Saddic sat atop the bales putting his things in patterns only to pack them away again, until the next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she listened to the arguments. She heard the fighting, saw the sudden roiling eddies where fists lashed out, soldiers grappled, knives were drawn. She watched as these men and women stumbled towards death, because Icarias was too far away. They had nothing left to drink, and now those who drank their own piss were starting to go mad, because piss was poison – but they would not bleed out the dead ones. They just left them to lie on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis night, she had counted fifty-four. The night before there had been thirty-nine, and on the day in between they’d carried seventy-two bodies from the camp, not bothering to dig a trench this time, simply leaving them lying in rows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children of the Snake were on the food wagons. Their walking was done, and they too were dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarias. I see your wells. They were almost dry when we left you. Something is taking the water away, even now. I don’t know why. But it doesn’t matter. We will not reach them. Is it true, then, that all mothers must fail? And all fathers must walk away never to be seen again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother, for you I have a poem. Will you come to me? Will you hear my words?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wagon rocked, the heavies strained. Soldiers died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were on a path now. Fiddler’s scouts had little trouble following it. Small, bleached bones, all the ones who had fallen behind the boy named Rutt, the girl named Badalle. Each modest collection he stumbled over was an accusation, a mute rebuke. These children. They had done the impossible. And now we fail them .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear the blood in his own veins, frantic, rushing through hollow places, and the sound it made was an incessant howl. Did the Adjunct still believe? Now that they were dying by the score, did she still hold to her faith? When determination, when stubborn will, proved not enough, what then? He had no answers to such questions. If he sought her out – no, she’s had enough of that. They’re on her constantly. Fists, captains, the cutters . Besides, talking was torture – lips split open, the swollen tongue struggled, the back of the throat – tight and cracked – was pained by every uttered word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked with his scouts, not wanting to drop back, to see what was happening in the column. Not wanting to witness its disintegration. Were his heavies still pulling the wagons? If they were, they were fools. Were any of those starved children left? That boy, Rutt – who’d carried that thing for so long his arms looked permanently crippled – was he still in a coma, or had he slipped away, believing he’d saved them all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be the best. To ride the delusion into oblivion. There are no ghosts here, not in this desert. His soul just drifted away. Simple. Peaceful. Rising, carrying that baby – because he will always carry that baby. Go well, lad. Go well, the both of you .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d come looking for a mother and a father. A thousand children, a thousand orphans – but he was beginning to see, here on this trail, just how many more there had once been – in this train Badalle had called the Snake, and the comprehension of that twisted like a knife in his chest. Kolanse, what have you done? To your people? To your children? Kolanse, had you no better answer than this? Gods, if we could have found you – if we could have faced you across a killing field. We would give answer to your crimes .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdjunct, you were right to seek this war .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you were wrong thinking we could win it. You cannot wage war against indifference. Ah, listen to me. But am I dead? Not yet .\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-246.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
