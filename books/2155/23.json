The Lady Jessica had propped herself up in the bed. She was clad in a parasilk gown of shimmering white with a matching band around her copper hair. Farad\u0027n had come bursting in upon her moments before. He wore the grey leotard and his face was sweaty with excitement and the exertions of his dash through the palace corridors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time is it?\" Jessica asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time?\" Farad\u0027n appeared puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the guards spoke up: \"It is the third hour past midnight, My Lady.\" The guard glanced fearfully at Farad\u0027n. The young prince had come dashing through the night-lighted corridors, picking up startled guards in his wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it moves,\" Farad\u0027n said. He held out his left hand, then his right. \"I saw my own hands shrink into chubby fists, and I remembered! They were my hands when I was an infant. I remembered being an infant, but it was... a clearer memory. I was reorganizing my old memories!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good,\" Jessica said. His excitement was infectious. \"And what happened when your hands became old?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My... mind was... sluggish,\" he said. \"I felt an ache in my back. Right here.\" He touched a place over his left kidney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve learned a most important lesson,\" Jessica said. \"Do you know what that lesson is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped his hands to his sides, stared at her. Then: \"My mind controls my reality.\" His eyes glittered, and he repeated it, louder this time: \"My mind controls my reality!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is the beginning of prana-bindu balance,\" Jessica said. \"It is only the beginning, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I do next?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lady,\" the guard who had answered her question ventured now to interrupt. \"The hour,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAren\u0027t their spy posts manned at this hour? Jessica wondered. She said: \"Begone. We have work to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But My Lady,\" the guard said, and he looked fearfully from Farad\u0027n to Jessica and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I\u0027m going to seduce him?\" Jessica asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n laughed, a joyous outburst. He waved a hand in dismissal. \"You heard her. Begone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guards looked at each other, but they obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n sat on the edge of her bed. \"What next?\" He shook his head. \"I wanted to believe you, yet I did not believe. Then... it was as though my mind melted. I was tired. My mind gave up its fighting against you. It happened. Just like that!\" He snapped his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was not me that your mind fought against,\" Jessica said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" he admitted. \"I was fighting against myself, all the nonsense I\u0027ve learned. What next now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica smiled. \"I confess I didn\u0027t expect you to succeed this rapidly. It\u0027s been only eight days and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was patient,\" he said, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ve begun to learn patience, too,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Begun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve just crept over the lip of this learning,\" she said. \"Now you\u0027re truly an infant. Before... you were only a potential, not even born.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corners of his mouth drew down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so gloomy,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve done it. That\u0027s important. How many can say they were born anew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What comes next?\" he insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will practice this thing you\u0027ve learned,\" she said. \"I want you able to do this at will, easily. Later you\u0027ll fill a new place in your awareness which this has opened. It will be filled by the ability to test any reality against your own demands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all I do now... practice the -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Now you can begin the muscle training. Tell me, can you move the little toe on your left foot without moving any other muscle of your body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My...\" She saw a distant expression come over his face as he tried to move the toe. He looked down at his foot presently, staring at it. Sweat broke out on his forehead. A deep breath escaped him. \"I can\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes you can,\" she said. \"You will learn to do it. You will learn every muscle in your body. You will know these muscles the way you know your hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed hard at the magnitude of this prospect. Then: \"What are you doing to me? What is your plan for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I intend to turn you loose upon the universe,\" she said. \"You will become whatever it is you most deeply desire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mulled this for a moment. \"Whatever I desire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you learn to control your desires the way you control your reality,\" she said. And she thought: There! Let his analysis examine that. They\u0027ll advise cautious approval, but Farad\u0027n will move a step closer to realization of what I\u0027m really doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe proved his surmise by saying: \"It\u0027s one thing to tell a person he\u0027ll realize his heart\u0027s desire. It\u0027s another thing to actually deliver that realization.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve come farther than I thought,\" Jessica said. \"Very good. I promise you: if you complete this program of learning, you\u0027ll be your own man. Whatever you do, it\u0027ll be because that\u0027s what you want to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd let a Truthsayer try to pry that apart, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up, but the expression he bent upon her was warm, a sense of camaraderie in it. \"You know, I believe you. Damned if I know why, but I do. And I won\u0027t say a word about the other things I\u0027m thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica watched his retreating back as he let himself out of her bedchamber. She turned off the glowglobes, lay back. This Farad\u0027n was a deep one. He\u0027d as much as told her that he was beginning to see her design, but he was joining her conspiracy of his own volition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait until he begins to learn his own emotions, she thought. With that, she composed herself for the return to sleep. The morrow, she knew, would be plagued by casual encounters with palace personnel asking seemingly innocuous questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumankind periodically goes through a speedup of its affairs, thereby experiencing the race between the renewable vitality of the living and the beckoning vitiation of decadence. In this periodic race, any pause becomes luxury. Only then can one reflect that all is permitted; all is possible. -The Apocrypha of Muad\u0027Dib\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe touch of sand is important, Leto told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel the grit beneath him where he sat beneath a brilliant sky. They had force-fed him another heavy dosage of melange, and Leto\u0027s mind turned upon itself like a whirlpool. An unanswered question lay deep within the funnel of the whirlpool: Why do they insist that I say it? Gurney was stubborn; no doubt of that. And he\u0027d had his orders from his Lady Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d brought him out of the sietch into the daylight for this \"lesson.\" He had the strange sensation that he\u0027d let his body take the short trip from the sietch while his inner being mediated a battle between the Duke Leto I and the old Baron Harkonnen. They\u0027d fought within him, through him, because he would not let them communicate directly. The fight had taught him what had happened to Alia. Poor Alia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was right to fear the spice trip, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA welling bitterness toward the Lady Jessica filled him. Her damned gom jabbar! Fight it and win, or die in the attempt. She couldn\u0027t put a poisoned needle against his neck, but she could send him into the valley of peril which had claimed her own daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnuffling sounds intruded upon his awareness. They wavered, growing louder, then softer, louder... softer. There was no way for him to determine whether they had current reality or came from the spice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto\u0027s body sagged over his folded arms. He felt hot sand through his buttocks. There was a rug directly in front of him, but he sat on open sand. A shadow lay across the rug: Namri. Leto stared into the muddy pattern of the rug, feeling bubbles ripple there. His awareness drifted on its own current through a landscape which stretched out to a horizon of shock-headed greenery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis skull thrummed with drums. He felt heat, fever. The fever was a pressure of burning which filled his senses, crowding out awareness of flesh until he could only feel the moving shadows of his peril. Namri and the knife. Pressure... pressure... Leto lay at last suspended between sky and sand, his mind lost to all but the fever. Now he waited for something to happen, sensing that any occurrence would be a first-and-only thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHot-hot pounding sunshine crashed brilliantly around him, without tranquillity, without remedy. Where is my Golden Path? Everywhere bugs crawled. Everywhere. My skin is not my own. He sent messages along his nerves, waited out the dragging other-person responses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp head, he told his nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA head which might have been his own crept upward, looked out at patches of blankness in the bright light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone whispered: \"He\u0027s deep into it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurn fire sun building heat on heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, outbending, the current of his awareness took him drifting through a last screen of green blankness and there, across low folding dunes, distant no more than a kilometer beyond the stretched out chalk line of a cliff, there lay the green burgeoning future, upflung, flowing into endless green, greenswelling, green-green moving outward endlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all of that green there was not one great worm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiches of wild growth, but nowhere Shai-Hulud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto sensed that he had ventured across old boundaries into a new land which only the imagination had witnessed, and that he looked now directly through the very next veil which a yawning humankind called Unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was bloodthirsty reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the red fruit of his life swaying on a limb, fluid slipping away from him, and the fluid was the spice essence flowing through his veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout Shai-Hulud, no more spice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had seen a future without the great grey worm-serpent of Dune. He knew this, yet could not tear himself from the trance to rail against such a passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly his awareness plunged back - back, back, away from such a deadly future. His thoughts went into his bowels, becoming primitive, moved only by intense emotions. He found himself unable to focus on any particular aspect of his vision or his surroundings, but there was a voice within him. It spoke an ancient language and he understood it perfectly. The voice was musical and lilting, but its words bludgeoned him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not the present which influences the future, thou fool, but the future which forms the present. You have it all backward. Since the future is set, an unfolding of events which will assure that future is fixed and inevitable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words transfixed him. He felt terror rooted in the heavy matter of his body. By this he knew his body still existed, but the reckless nature and enormous power of his vision left him feeling contaminated, defenseless, unable to signal a muscle and gain its obedience. He knew he was submitting more and more to the onslaught of those collective lives whose memories once had made him believe he was real. Fear filled him. He thought that he might be losing the inner command, falling at last into Abomination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto felt his body twisting in terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had come to depend upon his victory and the newly won benevolent cooperation of those memories. They had turned against him, all of them - even royal Harum whom he\u0027d trusted. He lay shimmering on a surface which had no roots, unable to give any expression to his own life. He tried to concentrate upon a mental picture of himself, was confronted by overlapping frames, each a different age: infant into doddering ancient. He recalled his father\u0027s early training: Let the hands grow young, then old. But his whole body was immersed now in this lost reality and the entire image progression melted into other faces, the features of those who had given him their memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA diamond thunderbolt shattered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto felt pieces of his awareness drifting apart, yet he retained a sense of himself somewhere between being and nonbeing. Hope quickening, he felt his body breathing. In... Out. He took in a deep breath: yin. He let it out: yang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere just beyond his grasp lay a place of supreme independence, a victory over all of the confusions inherent in his multitude of lives - no false sense of command, but a true victory. He knew his previous mistake now: he had sought power in the reality of his trance, choosing that rather than face the fears which he and Ghanima had fed in each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear defeated Alia!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the seeking after power spread another trap, diverting him into fantasy. He saw the illusion. The entire illusion process rotated half a turn and now he knew a center from which he could watch without purpose the flight of his visions, of his inner lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElation flooded him. It made him want to laugh, but he denied himself this luxury, knowing it would bar the doors of memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhhhh, my memories, he thought. I have seen your illusion. You no longer invent the next moment for me. You merely show me how to create new moments. I\u0027ll not lock myself on the old tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis thought passed through his awareness as though wiping a surface clean and in its wake he felt his entire body, an einfalle which reported in most minute detail on every cell, every nerve. He entered a state of intense quiet. In this quiet, he heard voices, knowing they came from a great distance, but he heard them clearly as though they echoed in a chasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the voices was Halleck\u0027s. \"Perhaps we gave him too much of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamri answered. \"We gave him exactly what she told us to give him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps we should go back out there and have another look at him.\" Halleck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sabiha is good at such things; she\u0027ll call us if anything starts to go wrong.\" Namri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like this business of Sabiha.\" Halleck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a necessary ingredient.\" Namri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto felt bright light outside himself and darkness within, but the darkness was secretive, protective, and warm. The light began to blaze up and he felt that it came from the darkness within, swirling outward like a brilliant cloud. His body became transparent, drawing him upward, yet he retained that einfalle contact with every cell and nerve. The multitude of inner lives fell into alignment, nothing tangled or mixed. They became very quiet in duplication of his own inner silence, each memory-life discrete, an entity incorporeal and undivided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto spoke to them then: \"I am your spirit. I am the only life you can realize. I am the house of your spirit in the land which is nowhere, the land which is your only remaining home. Without me, the intelligible universe reverts to chaos. Creative and abysmal are inextricably linked in me; only I can mediate between them. Without me, mankind will sink into the mire and vanity of knowing. Through me, you and they will find the only way out of chaos: understanding by living.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this he let go of himself and became himself, his own person compassing the entirety of his past. It was not victory, not defeat, but a new thing to be shared with any inner life he chose. Leto savored this newness, letting it possess every cell, every nerve, giving up what the einfalle had presented to him and recovering the totality in the same instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a time, he awoke in white darkness. With a flash of awareness he knew where his flesh was: seated on sand about a kilometer from the cliff wall which marked the northern boundary of the sietch. He knew that sietch now: Jacurutu for certain... and Fondak. But it was far different from the myths and legends and the rumors which the smugglers allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young woman sat on a rug directly in front of him, a bright glowglobe anchored to her left sleeve and drifting just above her head. When Leto looked away from the glowglobe, there were stars. He knew this young woman; she was the one from his vision earlier, the roaster of coffee. She was Namri\u0027s niece, as ready with a knife as Namri was. There was the knife in her lap. She wore a simple green robe over a grey stillsuit. Sabiha, that was her name. And Namri had his own plans for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabiha saw the awakening in his eyes, said: \"It\u0027s almost dawn. You\u0027ve spent the whole night here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And most of a day,\" he said. \"You make good coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis statement puzzled her, but she ignored it with a single-mindedness which spoke of harsh training and explicit instructions for her present behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the hour of assassins,\" Leto said. \"But your knife is no longer needed.\" He glanced at the crysknife in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Namri will be the judge of that,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot Halleck, then. She only confirmed his inner knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shai-Hulud is a great garbage collector and eraser of unwanted evidence,\" Leto said. \"I\u0027ve used him thus myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rested her hand lightly on the knife handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much is revealed by where we sit and how we sit,\" he said. \"You sit upon the rug and I upon the sand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand closed over the knife handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto yawned, a gaping and stretching which made his jaws ache. \"I\u0027ve had a vision which included you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoulders relaxed slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been very one-sided about Arrakis,\" he said. \"Barbaric of us. There\u0027s a certain momentum in what we\u0027ve been doing, but now we must undo some of our work. The scales must be brought into better balance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA puzzled frown touched Sabiha\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My vision,\" he said. \"Unless we restore the dance of life here on Dune, the dragon on the floor of the desert will be no more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he\u0027d used the Old Fremen name for the great worm, she was a moment understanding him. Then: \"The worms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in a dark passage,\" he said. \"Without spice, the Empire falls apart. The Guild will not move. Planets will slowly lose their clear memories of each other. They\u0027ll turn inward upon themselves. Space will become a boundary when the Guild navigators lose their mastery. We\u0027ll cling to our dunetops and be ignorant of that which is above us and below us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak very strangely,\" she said. \"How have you seen me in your vision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrust Fremen superstition! he thought. He said: \"I\u0027ve become pasigraphic. I\u0027m a living glyph to write out the changes which must come to pass. If I do not write them, you\u0027ll encounter such heartache as no human should experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What words are these?\" she asked, but her hand remained lightly on the knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto turned his head toward the cliffs of Jacurutu, seeing the beginning glow which would be Second Moon making its predawn passage behind the rocks. The death-scream of a desert hare shocked its way through him. He saw Sabiha shudder. There came the beating of wings - a predator bird, night creature here. He saw the ember glow of many eyes as they swept past above him, headed for crannies in the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must follow the dictates of my new heart,\" Leto said. \"You look upon me as a mere child, Sabiha, but if -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They warned me about you,\" Sabiha said, and now her shoulders were stiff with readiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the fear in her voice, said: \"Don\u0027t fear me, Sabiha. You\u0027ve lived eight more years than this flesh of mine. For that, I honor you. But I have untold thousands more years of other lives, far more than you have known. Don\u0027t look upon me as a child. I have bridged the many futures and, in one, saw us entwined in love. You and I, Sabiha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are... This can\u0027t... \" She broke off in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The idea could grow on you,\" he said. \"Now help me back to the sietch, for I\u0027ve been in far places and am weak with the weariness of my travels. Namri must hear where I have been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the indecision in her, said: \"Am I not the Guest of the Cavern? Namri must learn what I have learned. We have many things to do lest our universe degenerate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe that... about the worms,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor about us entwined in love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. But he could see the thoughts drifting through her mind like windblown feathers. His words both attracted and repelled her. To be consort of power, that certainly carried high allure. Yet there were her uncle\u0027s orders. But one day this son of Muad\u0027Dib might rule here on Dune and in the farthest reaches of their universe. She encountered then an extremely Fremen, cavern-hiding aversion to such a future. The consort of Leto would be seen by everyone, would be an object of gossip and speculations. She could have wealth, though, and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the son of Muad\u0027Dib, able to see the future,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly she replaced her knife in its sheath, lifted herself easily from the rug, crossed to his side and helped him to his feet. Leto found himself amused by her actions then: she folded the rug neatly and draped it across her right shoulder. He saw her measuring the difference in their sizes, reflecting upon his words: Entwined in love?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSize is another thing that changes, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put a hand on his arm then to help him and control him. He stumbled and she spoke sharply: \"We\u0027re too far from the sietch for that!\" Meaning the unwanted sound which might attract a worm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto felt that his body had become a dry shell like that abandoned by an insect. He knew this shell: it was one with the society which had been built upon the melange trade and its Religion of the Golden Elixir. It was emptied by its excesses. Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s high aims had fallen into wizardry which was enforced by the military arm of Auqaf. Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s religion had another name now; it was Shien-san-Shao, an Ixian label which designated the intensity and insanity of those who thought they could bring the universe to paradise at the point of a crysknife. But that too would change as lx had changed. For they were merely the ninth planet of their sun, and had even forgotten the language which had given them their name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Jihad was a kind of mass insanity,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Sabiha had been concentrating on the problem of making him walk without rhythm, hiding their presence out here on open sand. She was a moment focusing on his words, then interpreted them as another product of his obvious fatigue. She felt the weakness of him, the way he\u0027d been drained by the trance. It seemed pointless and cruel to her. If he were to be killed as Namri said, then it should be done quickly without all of this by-play. Leto had spoken of a marvelous revelation, though. Perhaps that was what Namri sought. Certainly that must be the motive behind the behavior of this child\u0027s own grandmother. Why else would Our Lady of Dune give her sanction to these perilous acts against a child?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChild?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain she reflected upon his words. They were at the cliff base now and she stopped her charge, letting him relax a moment here where it was safer. Looking down at him in the dim starlight, she asked: \"How could there be no more worms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only I can change that,\" he said. \"Have no fear. I can change anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some questions have no answers,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve seen that future, but the contradictions would only confuse you. This is a changing universe and we are the strangest change of all. We resonate to many influences. Our futures need constant updating. Now, there\u0027s a barrier which we must remove. This requires that we do brutal things, that we go against our most basic, our dearest wishes... But it must be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What must be done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever killed a friend?\" he asked and, turning, led the way into the gap which sloped upward to the sietch\u0027s hidden entrance. He moved as quickly as his trance-fatigue would permit, but she was right behind him, clutching his robe and pulling him to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this of killing a friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll die anyway,\" Leto said. \"I don\u0027t have to do it, but I could prevent it. If I don\u0027t prevent it, is that not killing him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is this... who will die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The alternative keeps me silent,\" he said. \"I might have to give my sister to a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain he turned away from her, and this time when she pulled at his robe he resisted, refusing to answer her questions. Best she not know until the time comes, he thought. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-23.html","bookId":2155,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:17 PM"}
