Was she going to try and pass off Emily’s baby as her own? It left a horrible taste in her mouth. The Bakers had told Emily that the child would know she’d been adopted. They’d even tell her about Emily. What else would Gayle lie to the baby about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d fled back to her car, revved the engine fast, and driven away, too upset to even leave a message for Derrick. Everything was so clear in that moment. There was no way Gayle was getting her baby. The money didn’t matter. The privileged life the child might lead in Gayle’s care didn’t matter. And so, the next day, she called Gayle and told her that the doctor had rescheduled her C-section for two days later than originally planned. Then she’d called Aria, Hanna, and Spencer, asking for their help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emily?” Aria called now. “Em, you have to come see this!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily followed Aria’s voice to a smaller bedroom down the hall. “Look!” Aria said, spreading out her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily spun around. The walls were striped with green and yellow paint. On the far wall was a mural of a circus train, a lion, tiger, elephant, and monkey peeking out of the cars. Above the mural was a decal that said Violet, the o a smiley face, and the t sprouting a flower out the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was her room,” Aria whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears filled Emily’s eyes. She remembered the Bakers telling her that they’d designed a nursery for the baby in gender-neutral colors, leaving a space on the wall for a boy name or a girl name. They hadn’t told Emily their choices, though, saying they wanted to see what the baby looked like before they made a final decision. The name Violet, she thought, was perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s so beautiful,” Emily whispered, walking to the little window seat and settling on the cushion. There were still marks where the crib and changing table had stood. When the Bakers found the baby seat on their doorstep, had they brought her in here to sleep? No, Emily decided. Not that first night. They’d probably held the baby until the sun came up, amazed she was theirs. Scared, too. They’d probably made plans to move that very night to avoid questions and to make sure the baby wouldn’t be taken away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Emily knew something for sure: The Bakers had done everything they could for the baby. They’d uprooted their lives just to ensure they could keep her, her happiness meaning more than their community, their home. That was worth more than any amount of money. She had made the right choice giving her daughter—Violet—to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Aria said soothingly, noticing Emily’s tear-streaked face. She wrapped her arms around Emily and squeezed tight. Emily hugged back, and they remained that way for several minutes. She felt happy and sad at the same time. It was wonderful to know that the baby had such a loving home, but she hated that she still didn’t know where the Bakers had gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily broke from Aria’s embrace and started down the stairs to find the realtor, suddenly fueled with purpose. Sandra was in the kitchen, rearranging papers in a binder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me,” she called. Sandra turned, a plastic smile frozen on her face. “The family that lived here before. Do you know what happened to them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I recall, they left in early September, I believe.” Sandra flipped through a file folder containing information about the house. “Their names were Charles and Lizzie Baker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a forwarding address?” Emily asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra shook her head. “Were you the one who e-mailed me about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“E-mail?” Emily raised an eyebrow. “No . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra whipped out her BlackBerry and scrolled through it. “That’s funny. I got an e-mail asking the same question. Someone else was eager to know where the Bakers went, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria, who had just arrived in the kitchen, coughed. “Do you remember who sent the e-mail?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra stared at her BlackBerry. “I swore I had it on here, but maybe I deleted it. It was a woman’s name, definitely. Maybe it started with a G?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gayle Riggs?” Aria blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra’s face lit up. “Yes, I believe that’s it! Do you know her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily and Aria exchanged a haunted look. Emily had never told Gayle who she’d originally chosen to give the baby to. The adoption agency would never have given out that information, either. What if she’d found out, somehow? What if A had told her? And what if—Emily’s heart started to pound—Gayle was trying to track the baby down?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a ping sounded from inside Aria’s bag. She pulled it out and looked at her phone. “Hanna says she’s been trying to contact you, Em.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily reached into her pocket for her phone and studied the dark screen. “The battery’s dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s eyes were still on her phone. She hit a button and gasped. “Look at this.” She passed it to Emily. Tell Em it’s urgent, a text from Hanna said. I think Gayle is after her baby. Call me ASAP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” Emily whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother ping sounded as a new message arrived on Aria’s phone. The sender was a jumble of letters and numbers. Aria clapped her hand to her mouth. Emily’s heart thudded fast as she read the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess Emily’s not the only one looking for that little bundle of joy. Who’s going to get there first? —A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSECRET AGENT HANNA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing about camo, Hanna realized, was that it was really ugly. There should be Louis Vuitton camo or camo that actually complemented one’s skin tone. It wasn’t like she was hiding out in the green and brown woods, after all. She was lurking in the King James Mall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a little later on Saturday afternoon, and Hanna had just put on her first—and last—camouflage outfit to kick off Operation Figure Out If Colleen Is Hiding Something. She’d bought the outfit at the Rosewood Army/Navy, a terrifying store full of gas masks, grenade holders, unflattering combat boots, and other sundries she hoped to never see again, except maybe on CNN. She’d also picked up a field scope that had scratches on it (probably from some scary war), night-vision goggles, and a platoon helmet, just in case she had to do a commando roll or jump out of a moving car. Perhaps it was overkill to buy all that equipment to spy on a girl who’d probably be delighted if she knew Hanna had taken such an acute interest in her, but Hanna thought it would help her get in the mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, she was crouching behind a large fake plant in the middle of the esplanade and peering through the binoculars at Colleen and Mike strolling into Victoria’s Secret. Hanna felt a moment of misgiving. Was it weird that she was doing this? It was sort of like she was becoming an A herself. But then, maybe Gayle was right—maybe Colleen had a secret she didn’t know about. Everyone did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna checked her watch. She would give it another half hour, she decided, and then call Emily again. As for the Colleen thing, it wasn’t like she and Gayle were on the same team or anything—A just had a good idea for once. All she needed to do was unearth some embarrassing secret of Colleen’s to turn Mike off her for good and kick her back to dork-dom where she belonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one problem: so far, Colleen seemed like an open book. Hanna had peeked in Colleen’s car in the parking garage, but she kept it tidy and boring. She’d followed the couple to Otter, the best boutique in the mall, and watched as Hanna’s favorite salesgirl showed Colleen a brand-new style of James jeans that had just come in—jeans that Hanna was supposed to see first. Traitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Colleen approached the Victoria’s Secret salesgirl and explained she was looking for some new lingerie. “What size are you?” the assistant asked. Hanna had learned how to lip-read when she was in fifth grade, mostly to decipher her parents’ tense fights through the glass back-patio door. Colleen gave her the answer, and Hanna’s jaw dropped. Colleen’s boobs were even bigger than she had thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the salesgirl searched for some styles Colleen might like, Mike wandered over to a table of satin bras, held an enormous pink one to his chest, and started striking exaggerated poses. Hanna snickered. Mike used to do that all the time when they went shopping together, and it never failed to crack her up. But when Colleen saw him, a disapproving scowl settled over her features. Mike pouted and dropped the bra back to the table, looking like a scolded puppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s phone chimed loudly, and she frantically patted her pocket to silence it. Aria’s picture was flashing on the screen. “Did you get in touch with Emily?” Hanna whispered into the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m with Emily, and I’ve patched in Spencer, too.” Aria’s voice echoed on speakerphone. “We’re really freaked. I got a note today. A is definitely after Emily’s baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna sank down further into the bushes. “We have to prove Gayle is A. But how do we do that without going to the cops?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gayle’s psycho,” Aria explained. “Just like Kelsey. The cops wouldn’t believe anything she says.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but she has money,” Hanna reminded her. “And she’s an adult. That holds some weight, don’t you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guys, I’m not so sure Gayle is A,” Spencer’s voice sounded far away. “I got a note last night, and I’m at Princeton. How could Gayle be in two places at once?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna watched as a bunch of kids from Rosewood Day passed. “Maybe she can be. At the race this morning, Gayle apologized for being late, saying she’d just come from Princeton. Her husband just donated some cancer lab.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer made a small noise at the back of her throat. “Do you think she followed me to my party? Wouldn’t I have noticed someone like her in a crowd of kids?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was probably hiding in the bushes outside,” Hanna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That still doesn’t prove Gayle is A,” Emily protested. “But the important thing is, either way, she’s after the baby. How are we going to find out where the Bakers went? We need to warn them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The realtor didn’t have the information on where they moved,” Aria added, sounding despondent. “They could be anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I might be able to find them.” Hanna moved the phone to the other ear. “My dad’s campaign has voter registration information for people across Pennsylvania. If they stayed in the state, I can probably dig up their new address.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” Emily sounded hopeful. “How soon can you do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll look into it when I get home,” Hanna promised. “It may take a few days, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I still think Gayle’s A,” Aria said. “But how can we prove it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause on the line. “Well, A is following all of us, right?” Spencer said after a moment. “Maybe one of us could try to catch her in the act.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or one of us could try to steal her cell phone,” Hanna piped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would be great, but we’d have to know her schedule and show up somewhere she’s going to be.” Aria sounded discouraged. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stunning-pretty-little-liars-11/page-19.html","bookId":2387,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:15 AM"}
