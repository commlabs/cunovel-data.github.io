{"id":85382,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u003cp\u003e36\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dream, Conner moved like molasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hovered near third base waiting for the pitch. At which time he\u0027d take off running for home in the hopes the batter laid down a good bunt. Conner had to start running before he knew if the bunt was down. That was the tough part. It required guts. Faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pitch. And Conner ran. His feet caught in the mud. He strained to put one foot in front of the other. Tyranny was at home plate waving him in. When Conner looked again, she was waving him off. He tried to run, barely able to move, not able to tell if he was welcomed at home or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fell, facefirst in the mud. He tried to see, to blink the mud out of his eyes. Where was the ball? Had the bunt been laid down? He tried to get up, couldn\u0027t make his body obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weight of eternity held him facedown in the mud, and from a long way away, a voice called, Conner\u0027s name echoing down a dark tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Conner!\" Big hands shaking him awake. \"Conner-man, get your ass up. Come on! We\u0027ve got to get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner\u0027s eyes popped open, tried to focus. He saw Otis shove aside Rocky\u0027s desk like it was made of foam rubber. Otis knelt at a cabinet behind the desk, opened the bottom drawer, and withdrew a big leather doctor\u0027s bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner faded briefly, eyes crossing. He felt his body being lifted, arms and legs dangling. His head cleared. How many times had he been knocked cold in the last few days? He looked around. He was being carried. Fat Otis toted him under a huge arm. Bleeding bodies lay around the office. Rocky looked so small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of dread and grief washed over Conner. He forced it down into his gut, cut himself off from it. \"Put me down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have time for you to pull yourself together,\" Otis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtis put him down. Conner wobbled on his feet a moment, steadied himself. He remembered the Japanese guy holding the DiMaggio card and darted for Rocky\u0027s desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtis yelled, \"Dammit, come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One second.\" Conner rifled the papers on Rocky\u0027s desk until he found what he was looking for. The Japanese had taken the card but left the Monroe letter in the plastic bag. Conner snatched it just as Otis grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the office. Conner stuffed the letter in his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warehouse was a mess. More bodies. A few Japanese but mostly Rocky\u0027s guys. The strip club was worse. The bar was on fire. They coughed their way through and out the open door into the street. They passed a group of determined firemen going the other way. The street flickered in the red lights of the emergency vehicles. More sirens in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Conner understood Otis\u0027s hurry. The place crawled with cops (there were already one squad car and a brace of uniforms directing traffic away from the fire), and neither Conner nor Otis was inclined to stick around and answer awkward questions. There was still plenty of confusion, but soon they\u0027d get organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtis had parked his Lincoln just beyond the fire trucks. They drove in a random direction. Conner slumped in the passenger seat, every one of his nerves frazzled. Pensacola suddenly looked like a town he\u0027d never seen before, full of strangers and enemies. Nothing was understandable, Playerz and Rocky swept away in a blazing storm. On a whim. For a baseball card. Conner\u0027s life had revealed itself as a surreal, cosmic joke. Somewhere, the gods held their sides laughing. Look at the silly mortals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner figured he must have only been out of it a few minutes. It had seemed like days. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" Otis spit. \"I was hoping you could tell me.\" Otis relayed his side of it. After the car wash, Otis had run some errands, taken care of Rocky\u0027s business. When he returned, he\u0027d found Playerz a smoldering, bloody wreck. He\u0027d run back to find Rocky, only to find his boss shot full of lead. Conner had survived by dumb luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner felt anger radiating off Otis. He\u0027d been loyal to Rocky. Every muscle in the big man\u0027s body was a coiled spring. Jaw set. The vein in his neck throbbing time like a bass drum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what you know about this,\" Otis said. \"So I know who to kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner spilled the story. It didn\u0027t occur to him for a second to hold anything back. The Electric Jenny, the Japanese, the DiMaggio card. The whole shooting match. Otis asked the obvious questions. Conner answered. Otis said he didn\u0027t think Rocky had pissed off any Japanese dudes, not that he knew of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a vendetta,\" Conner said. \"It\u0027s the baseball card. They killed another guy for it too.\" He told Otis about Folger and the bungalow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is fucking bullshit.\" Otis slammed the palm of his hand against the steering wheel. \"Nobody kills a bunch of people and burns down a fucking strip club for no fucking baseball card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny collectible is only worth what somebody is willing to pay, thought Conner. But the price wasn\u0027t just money now. It included blood. \"Those Asian guys must know there\u0027s a reward for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtis\u0027s eyes flamed wild with rage. \"We got to find these motherfuckers and do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, no, no.\" Otis shook his head. \"Don\u0027t you shut down on me. I\u0027m not in the mood for your Conner Samson sit-on-the-sidelines bullshit. You\u0027re in this right up to your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your damn attitude. Like you ain\u0027t involved. You know what your problem is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\" America \u0027s new pastime. Tell Conner Samson his problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ain\u0027t a team player.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true. That\u0027s why you got kicked off the college baseball team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t get kicked off the team,\" Conner said. \"I flunked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtis went on like he didn\u0027t hear. \"Rocky was my team. And somebody just fucked with my team big-time. And if you think I\u0027m going to sit around with my thumb up my ass, then you\u0027re screwed in the head. Now you better tell me on whom I can vent my mighty wrath. Otherwise, the only motherfucker around here to vent on is you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have one idea,\" Conner said. \"Somebody who might know something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then call them,\" Otis said. \"What you waiting on? Dial the fucking phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e37\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t escape the hangover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried lying on the couch, then sitting up, lying in bed. She sprawled on the floor, tried standing in the shower under cold water. She dried off, returned to the couch. Nothing helped. Joellen Becker\u0027s head thundered, her stomach queasy. There was no way she could arrange herself that would abate the misery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer life hovering in front of her like a rapidly deflating balloon didn\u0027t help matters. She refused to return to her dismal desk at the insurance agency. The thought of it made her stomach heave. She\u0027d need to track down some of the old contacts, start looking for a gig. If she stayed in the States, there wouldn\u0027t be much, corporate stuff or insurance work again. Better prospects out of the country. She\u0027d had an offer from an old NSA chum in El Salvador, but it could be tough for women down there. Worse in the Middle East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would her daddy general think if he could see Joellen Becker now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang, like sonic beams shot through her ears to melt her brain. She didn\u0027t want to answer. Why bother? But she squirmed off the couch, held her head, picked up the phone before the machine clicked on. \"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Conner Samson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about that a second. \"So what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m at the Waffle House across from the mall,\" Samson said. \"Why don\u0027t you come down here and explain why a gang of killer Japs are so crazy to get their hands on this Joe DiMaggio card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have the card with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamson said, \"Be here in half an hour.\" He hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Samson know? If so, how much? For some reason he still needed her. So he didn\u0027t have the whole story. He had the pieces of the puzzle but couldn\u0027t make them fit together. Conner Samson still needed Joellen Becker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made it to the Waffle House in twenty-two minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker sat next to Samson in the plastic booth. The black bald behemoth took up almost the entire seat on the other side. When she\u0027d arrived, she\u0027d been shocked to see how bruised and battered Samson looked. He\u0027d been through the wringer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat back, let him tell his story. She knew a few Zen techniques that were supposed to help suppress her headache, but they never worked. She tried them anyway. Then she lit a cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner told her about the Japanese goon squad, how they busted in, shot up the local syndicate, and made off with DiMaggio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker blew a long stream of smoke. \"Wait a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamson froze in midsentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker asked, \"Do you mean to tell me you don\u0027t have the card?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Samson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Japs have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Thanks for wasting my fucking time, guys. At least the coffee was fresh.\" She started to slide out of the booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa, hold on. Hear me out.\" Samson grabbed her forearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at her arm. \"You want to lose that hand, sport?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go, held up his hands, palms out. Placating. \"No offense. Just give me five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got until I get to the bottom of this coffee cup,\" she said. \"Talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, well, I\u0027m not exactly sure, okay? But you\u0027ve got a buyer on the line for a million bucks, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know all about it, okay? Well, not all about it. I don\u0027t know who the buyer is but he\u0027s willing to pay a cool million. I figure these Japanese got wind of the reward and now they\u0027re trying to collect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner didn\u0027t know. The Japanese were the buyers. She let that sink in, mulled it, and said, \"So what are you going to do, sport? Storm the castle? Take the card back from the Japs? Doesn\u0027t look like you did too well against them last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with the hangover, Joellen marveled at her ability to think through several things simultaneously. The old training never went away. On the surface, she took in Conner\u0027s story, sifted what he knew, what he didn\u0027t know, and what he thought he knew. Another part of her brain gauged how to use this information to her advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, you\u0027ve been a step ahead of me the whole time,\" Samson said. \"Every time I turn around, you\u0027re there. I figure I bring you the information, you know what to do with it. We were talking about a finder\u0027s fee before, and I thought maybe-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"All deals are off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on, you can\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to the big black guy. \"What\u0027s with Chatty Cathy here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah,\" Samson said. \"This is Otis. I was getting to him. He sort of has a side interest in all this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtis leaned forward. \"I implied I\u0027d stomp his little ass if he didn\u0027t help me find out who fucked up Playerz. I\u0027ve sort of got a revenge thing going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" Becker mashed out her cigarette, lit another. Her wheels were turning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you know the identity of these Asian dudes, I\u0027d appreciate your help,\" Otis said. \"Just point me in the right direction and stand back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why should I help you?\" Becker asked. \"And please keep in mind I don\u0027t stomp as easy as Samson. Take my word for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtis plopped the leather doctor\u0027s bag on the table, opened it, and fished out two wads of cash, hundred-dollar bills. \"That\u0027s ten big. Like I said, show me where to unleash, then step away from ground zero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect. With these two suckers on board, her plan might just work. Yes, she was starting to like the odds. There were still details to work out, but...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, she couldn\u0027t seem too eager. Becker pushed the money back at Otis. \"Look, I don\u0027t think-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtis went back into the bag, threw two more wads of money on the pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cast about the restaurant. People were looking. \"Put it away, you idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamson cleared his throat. He wanted back in the conversation. \"I\u0027m just saying, you can probably track these guys down. A big Japanese mob can\u0027t be that easy to hide in a town this size. You can find them and get the card back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I do that, Samson? Call in an air strike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care about no fucking card.\" Otis raised his voice. \"Just find out where they\u0027re at, then tell me. You can at least do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress stopped by their table. \"A little loud here.\" She topped off their coffees and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker lowered her voice. \"Okay, I might have a few ideas. But not here. Let\u0027s discuss it back at my place.\" She looked at Otis. \"Bring your bag of money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at her apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe showed them in, told them to have a seat, went into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed two Advil and made herself drink three full glasses of water. Put on a pot of coffee. It had been a long time since she\u0027d had so much to drink. The headache was bad, and she suspected she\u0027d feel worse before she felt better. There were some drugs she could take to ease the effects, but there\u0027d be a price to pay later. She\u0027d known some of her fellow agents to become dependent on such drugs, and it could get ugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed a clean dishrag, soaked it in cold water under the faucet, and dabbed her eyes, behind her ears. The headache grew worse by the minute, but she put on her game face, took the.25 caliber Beretta out of the kitchen junk drawer. It was so small and light, she could jam it into her waistband near her navel, produce it quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a precaution. Samson was harmless, but there was an angry fire in the big man\u0027s eyes. Better safe than sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head: thump thump thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker remembered the first time she\u0027d met Samson, the state he\u0027d been in, hungover to his yellow eyeballs, his apartment reeking of sick. She remembered thinking that might be a typical morning for Samson. How did people do it, live like this, boozing as a lifestyle? Never again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever mind. A lapse. Becker was more in control of her life. Or she was trying to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she did all this-the Advil, the water, the.25 caliber pistol, contemplating Samson\u0027s self-destructive lifestyle-the part of her brain that was always working sorted the final details of her scheme. She had a good shot at the bounty on Kurisaka\u0027s head, and the two chumps sitting in her living room would provide the perfect diversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t mean anything to Becker if Conner Samson and his giant pal got themselves shot full of holes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/suicide-squeeze/page-22.html","bookId":2245,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:32 PM"}
