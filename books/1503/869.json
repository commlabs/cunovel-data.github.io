Even though the black dragon before his eyes did not possess the powerful Dragon Emperor Bloodline, it was still an enormous dragon after all!

Furthermore, this was a black dragon who released the Darkness Attribute. As someone who possessed the Divine Attribute, he was naturally prejudiced and hostile against users of the Darkness Attribute. Hence, he had immediately assumed that it belonged to the enemy. After hearing what Tian’er said, Xue AoTian looked at the dragon once again.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eHe saw a woman standing on the head of the black dragon with such grandeur. Because the woman was all decked in black, under the concealment of the Darkness Energy given off by the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, she could not be clearly seen. Leaning against the horn on the head of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, she had an icy look on her remarkably beautiful face. Albeit faintly, one could see the unwavering killing intent and the superior dignified aura in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eOnce the enormous black dragon appeared on the battlefield, it started spitting out tyrannical dragon flames. Even though the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley powerhouses were not afraid of it as they joined forces, this was a sudden attack. Furthermore, it was an attack from a Heavenly God. They had no choice but to swiftly retreat before putting up a defense together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eThis woman, riding on a dragon, who came at the most crucial moment of the battle was none other than Dongfang Hanyue, the woman who Zhou Weiqing had a fling with on the Xuantian Continent.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eIndeed, this was Zhou Weiqing’s other hidden trump - one that had shocked everyone.

Using the trace of Saint Energy she shared with Zhou Weiqing, she managed to locate Zhou Weiqing, with the help of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eThis was also the reason why Zhou Weiqing’s wives had an unhappy look on their faces earlier. Shangguan Bing’er was the only person aware of Zhou Weiqing’s relation with Dongfang Hanyue - the rest of them were in the dark. Since she came knocking on his door, it was no wonder they were unhappy. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eDue to the fact that the Grand Tournament was about to begin, Zhou Weiqing did not have much time to explain himself. Hence, his wives had isolated him earlier. Furthermore, he had no right to blame Dongfang Hanyue - it was his fault that he could not suppress his lust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eThe reason why Dongfang Hanyue came looking for Zhou Weiqing was simple - she wanted to tell Zhou Weiqing something, which had left Zhou Weiqing completely stunned, with no other choice but to accept her arrival. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eDongfang Hanyue told Zhou Weiqing that she had given birth to his son recently. Indeed, it was that one time - he had hit the jackpot, a match made in heaven, and Dongfang Hanyue was blessed with Zhou Weiqing’s son. The child remained on the Xuantian Continent, becoming the next successor of the Xuantian Continent. The reason why Dongfang Hanyue came was simple - she wanted to negotiate certain terms with Zhou Weiqing. It was not possible for the child to grow up without a father, hence she wanted to request for Zhou Weiqing to live on the Xuantian Continent for a month, every year from now on, to accompany her and their son.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eAs the Xuantian Palace Master, Dongfang Hanyue had a tough personality. Additionally, this request of hers had forced Zhou Weiqing to devote one month of his time every year - naturally, she did not get along that well with Tian’er, the three Shangguan sisters, and Little Witch.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eHenceforth, the unlucky Zhou Weiqing was directly relegated to purgatory. During the few days before the Grand Tournament, his wives had completely ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eEven though Dongfang Hanyue could not get along well with his wives, the moment she heard that there was a possibility that Zhou Weiqing could die in the battle on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, she tagged along. Naturally, she did not make her appearance earlier. She also refused to stick around Tian’er and the other ladies. However, during the crucial moment, she had finally decided to take action. Even though she was extremely enraged by Zhou Weiqing’s womanizing ways, she could clearly distinguish what was important.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eDongfang Hanyue took a deep breath, a copious amount of powerful energy erupted from within her body. In an instant, rays of dark golden light flickered from her body - she had directly entered the state of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eDongfang Hanyue had the Tenebrous Demon Dragon bloodline within her body. Even though her Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation was still inferior to Zhou Weiqing’s Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation, the biggest advantage of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation was that it allowed her body to be perfectly merged as one with the Tenebrous Demon Dragon itself and engage in combat. This was something that the Heavenly Snow Mountain powerhouses could not do with their respective Heavenly Beast guardian.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eAn enormous pair of wings spread wide open on Dongfang Hanyue’s back. She had also equipped herself with the Legendary Set that she had shown Zhou Weiqing previously.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eOne by one, dark golden plates of armor appeared on her body. Very quickly, six pieces of them had been completely pieced together. The seventh piece was a helmet - her helmet was akin to a dragon’s mouth. It did not look feminine or beautiful, but it was filled with a powerful aura. A mask had covered her beautiful face.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eAfter she had equipped herself with all seven pieces of her Legendary Set , immediately after, the eighth one started to appear. The eighth piece extended out from her waist, within the intense dark golden light, the eighth piece merged with the horn of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon behind her back, firmly anchoring her body on the head of the dragon. The dark golden armor continued extending downwards, combining itself with the head of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eA layer of terrifying Darkness Attribute energy erupted from within the body of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon. A rich bout of Darkness Energy was frantically channeled into Dongfang Hanyue’s body via its horn.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eAt this moment, the ninth dark golden ray of light appeared. This time, the armor directly appeared on the body of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon. The dark golden armor extended from Dreamwake’s feet, anchoring both her legs on the head of the dragon. The armor extended downwards from the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s neck, covering the dragon’s lower neck - which was its vital point.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003eIndeed, this was Dongfang Hanyue’s Tenebrous Demon Dragon Set.

This time, the dark golden ray was glowing from the top of Dreamwake’s head. Thereafter, a melodious dragon’s roar was heard from the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s mouth. The powerful roar made the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley powerhouses in the surroundings retreat. The combined energy ripples created by two Heavenly Gods was too intimidating. At this moment, although vaguely, a thousand-feet long enormous dragon figure appeared in the sky. Because it was also black, it was hard to distinguish how it looked within the area covered by the Destruction Celestial Territory. However, its existence was real.
