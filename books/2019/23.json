But how are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych was forty-four now and his hair was beginning to show a bit of gray, but his mustache remained thick and dark and very Dahlite in appearance. Seldon wondered if he touched it up with dye, but it would have been the wrong thing to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon said, \"Are you through with your lecturing for a while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a while. Not for long. And I\u0027m glad to be home and see the baby and Manella and Wanda-and you, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. But I have news for you, Raych. No more lecturing. I\u0027m going to need you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych frowned. \"What for?\" On two different occasions he had been sent to carry out delicate missions, but those were back during the days of the Joranumite menace. As far as he knew, things were quiet now, especially with the overthrow of the junta and the reestablishment of a pale Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Wanda,\" said Seldon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda? What\u0027s wrong with Wanda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s wrong with her, but we\u0027re going to have to work out a complete genome for her-and for you and Manella as well-and eventually for the new baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Bellis, too? What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon hesitated. \"Raych, you know that your mother and I always thought there was something lovable about you, something that inspired affection and trust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you thought so. You said so often enough when you were trying to get me to do something difficult. But I\u0027ll be honest with you. I never felt it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you won over me and... and Dors.\" (He had such trouble saying the name, even though four years had passed since her destruction.) \"You won over Rashelle of Wye. You won over Jo-Jo Joranum. You won over Manella. How do you account for all that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Intelligence and charm,\" said Raych, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you thought you might have been in touch with their-our-minds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ve never thought that. And now that you mention it, I think it\u0027s ridiculous. With all due respect, Dad, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I told you that Wanda seems to have read Yugo\u0027s mind during a moment of crisis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coincidence or imagination, I should say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raych, I knew someone once who could handle people\u0027s minds as easily as you and I handle conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t speak of him. Take my word for it, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-\" said Raych dubiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been at the Galactic Library, checking on such matters. There is a curious story, about twenty thousand years old and therefore back to the misty origins of hyperspatial travel. It\u0027s about a young woman, not much more than Wanda\u0027s age, who could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun called Nemesis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely a fairytale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely. And incomplete, at that. But the similarity with Wanda is astonishing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych said, \"Dad, what are you planning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure, Raych. I need to know the genome and I have to find others like Wanda. I have a notion that youngsters are born-not often but occasionally-with such mental abilities, but that, in general, it merely gets them in trouble and they learn to mask it. And as they grow tip, their ability, their talent, is buried deep within their minds- sort of an unconscious act of self-preservation. Surely in the Empire or even just among Trantor\u0027s forty billion, there must be more of that sort, like Wanda, and if I know the genome I want, I can test those I think may be so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what would you do with them if you found them, Dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have the notion that they are what I need for the further development of psychohistory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych said, \"And Wanda is the first of the type you know about and you intend to make a psychohistorian out of her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Yugo. Dad, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I want her to grow up like a normal girl and become a normal woman. I will not have you sitting her before the Prime Radiant and make her into a living monument to psychohistorical mathematics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon said, \"It may not come to that, Raych, but we must have her genome. You know that for thousands of years there have been suggestions that every human being have his genome on file. It\u0027s only the expense that\u0027s kept it from becoming standard practice; no one doubts the usefulness of it. Surely you see the advantages. If nothing else, we will know Wanda\u0027s tendencies toward a variety of physiological disorders. If we had ever had Yugo\u0027s genome, I am certain he would not now be dying. Surely we can go that far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe, Dad, but no further. I\u0027m willing to bet that Manella is going to be a lot firmer on this than I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon said, \"Very well. But remember, no more lecture tours. I need you at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see,\" Raych said and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon sat there in a quandary. Eto Demerzel, the one person he knew who could handle minds, would have known what to do. Dors, with her nonhuman knowledge, might have known what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor himself, he had a dim vision of a new psychohistory-but nothing more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not an easy task to obtain a complete genome of Wanda. To begin with, the number of biophysicists equipped to handle the genome was small and those that existed were always busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor was it possible for Seldon to discuss his needs openly, in order to interest the biophysicists. It was absolutely essential, Seldon felt, that the true reason for his interest in Wanda\u0027s mental powers be kept secret from all the Galaxy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if another difficulty was needed, it was the fact that the process was infernally expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon shook his head and said to Mian Endelecki, the biophysicist he was now consulting, \"Why so expensive, Dr. Endelecki? I am not an expert in the field, but it is my distinct understanding that the process is completely computerized and that, once you have a scraping of skin cells, the genome can be completely built and analyzed in a matter of days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true. But having a deoxyribonucleic acid molecule stretching out for billions of nucleotides, with every purine and pyrimidine in its place, is the least of it; the very least of it, Professor Seldon. There is then the matter of studying each one and comparing it to some standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, consider, in the first place, that although we have records of complete genomes, they represent a vanishingly small fraction of the number of genomes that exist, so that we don\u0027t really know how standard they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon asked, \"Why so few?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A number of reasons. The expense, for one thing. Few people are willing to spend the credits on it unless they have strong reason to think there is something wrong with their genome. And if they have no strong reason, they are reluctant to undergo analysis for fear they will find something wrong. Now, then, are you sure you want your granddaughter genomed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do. It is terribly important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Does she show signs of a metabolic anomaly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she doesn\u0027t. Rather the reverse-if I knew the antonym of \u0027anomaly.\u0027 I consider her a most unusual person and I want to know just what it is that makes her unusual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unusual in what way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mentally, but it\u0027s impossible for me to go into details, since I don\u0027t entirely understand it. Maybe I will, once she is genomed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twelve. She\u0027ll soon be thirteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case, I\u0027ll need permission from her parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon cleared his throat. \"That may be difficult to get. I\u0027m her grandfather. Wouldn\u0027t my permission be enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For me, certainly. But, you know, we\u0027re talking about the law. I don\u0027t wish to lose my license to practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was necessary for Seldon to approach Raych again. This, too, was difficult, as he protested once more that he and his wife, Manella, wanted Wanda to live a normal life of a normal girl. What if her genome did turn out to be abnormal? Would she be whisked away to be prodded and probed like a laboratory specimen? Would Hari, in his fanatical devotion to his Psychohistory Project, press Wanda into a life of all work and no play, shutting her off from other young people her age? But Seldon was insistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, Raych. I would never do anything to harm Wanda. But this must be done. I need to know Wanda\u0027s genome. If it is as I suspect it is, we may be on the verge of altering the course of psychohistory, of the future of the Galaxy itself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so Raych was persuaded and somehow he obtained Manella\u0027s consent, as well. And together, the three adults took Wanda to Dr. Endelecki\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMian Endelecki greeted them at the door. Her hair was a shining white, but her face showed no sign of age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the girl, who walked in with a look of curiosity on her face but with no signs of apprehension or fear. She then turned her gaze to the three adults who had accompanied Wanda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Endelecki said with a smile, \"Mother, father, and grandfather-am I right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon answered, \"Absolutely right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych looked hang-dog and Manella, her face a little swollen and her eyes a little red, looked tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda,\" began the doctor. \"That is your name, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" said Wanda in her clear voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to tell you exactly what I\u0027m going to do with you. You\u0027re right-handed, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, then, I\u0027ll spray a little patch on your left forearm with an anesthetic. It will just feel like a cool wind. Nothing else. I\u0027ll then scrape a little skin from you just a tiny bit. There\u0027ll be no pain, no blood, no mark afterward. When I\u0027m done, I\u0027ll spray a little disinfectant on it. The whole thing will take just a few minutes. Does that sound all right to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" said Wanda, as she held out her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was over, Dr. Endelecki said, \"I\u0027ll put the scraping under the microscope, choose a decent cell, and put my computerized gene analyzer to work. It will mark off every last nucleotide, but there are billions of them. It will probably take the better part of a day. It\u0027s all automatic, of course, so I won\u0027t be sitting here watching it and there\u0027s no point in your doing so, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once the genome is prepared, it will take an even longer time to analyze it. If you want a complete job, it may take a couple of weeks. That is why it\u0027s so expensive a procedure. The work is hard and long. I\u0027ll call you in when I have it.\" She turned away, as if she had dismissed the family, and busied herself with the gleaming apparatus on the table in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon said, \"If you come across anything unusual, will you get in touch with me instantly? I mean, don\u0027t wait for a complete analysis if you find something in the first hour. Don\u0027t make me wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The chances of finding anything in the first hour are very slim, but I promise you, Professor Seldon that I will be in touch with you at once if it seems necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManella snatched Wanda\u0027s arm and led her off triumphantly. Raych followed, feet dragging. Seldon lingered and said, \"This is more important than you know, Dr. Endelecki.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Endelecki nodded as she said, \"Whatever the reason, Professor, I\u0027ll do my best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon left, his lips pressed tightly together. Why he had thought that somehow the genome would be worked out in five minutes and that a glance at it in another five minutes would give him an answer, he did not know. Now he would have to wait for weeks, without knowing what would be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ground his teeth. Would his newest brainchild, the Second Foundation, ever be established or was it an illusion that would remain always just out of reach?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHari Seldon walked into Dr. Endelecki\u0027s office, a nervous smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"You said a couple of weeks, Doctor. It\u0027s been over a month mow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Endelecki nodded. \"I\u0027m sorry, Professor Seldon but you wanted everything exact and that is what I have tried to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" The look of anxiety on Seldon\u0027s face did not disappear. What did you find?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hundred or so defective genes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What! Defective genes. Are you serious, Doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite serious. Why not? There are no genomes without at least a hundred defective genes; usually there are considerably more. It\u0027s not as bad as it sounds, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t know. You\u0027re the expert, Doctor, not I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Endelecki sighed and stirred in her chair. \"You don\u0027t know anything about genetics, do you, Professor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t. A man can\u0027t know everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re perfectly right. I know nothing about this-what do you call it?-this psychohistory of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Endelecki shrugged, then continued. \"If you wanted to explain anything about it, you would be forced to start from the beginning and I would probably not understand it even so. \"Now, as to genetics-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An imperfect gene usually means nothing. There are imperfect genes-so imperfect and so crucial that they produce terrible disorders. These are very rare, though. Most imperfect genes simply don\u0027t work with absolute accuracy. They\u0027re like wheels that are slightly out of balance. A vehicle will move along, trembling a bit, but it will move along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what Wanda has?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. More or less. After all, if all genes were perfect, we would all look precisely the same, we would all behave precisely the same. It\u0027s the difference in genes that makes for different people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But won\u0027t it get worse as we grow older?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. We all get worse as we grow older. I noticed you limping when you came in. Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A touch of sciatica,\" muttered Seldon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have it all your life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, some of your genes have gotten worse with time and now you limp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what will happen to Wanda with time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t predict the future, Professor; I believe that is your province. However, if I were to hazard a guess, I would say that nothing unusual will happen to Wanda-at least, genetically-except the gathering of old age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon said, \"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to take my word for it. You wanted to find out about Wanda\u0027s genome and you ran the risk of discovering things perhaps it is better not to know. But I tell you that, in my opinion, I can see nothing terrible happening to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The imperfect genes-should we fix them? Can we fix them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. In the first place, it would be very expensive. Secondly, the chances are that they would not stay fixed. And finally, people are against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they\u0027re against science in general. You should know this as well as anyone, Professor. I\u0027m afraid the situation is such, especially since Cleon\u0027s death, that mysticism has been gaining ground. People don\u0027t believe in fixing genes scientifically. They would rather cure things by the laying on of hands or by mumbo-jumbo of some sort or other. Frankly it is extremely difficult for me to continue with my job. Very little funding is coming in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon nodded. \"Actually I understand this situation all too well. Psychohistory explains it, but I honestly didn\u0027t think the situation was growing so bad so rapidly. I\u0027ve been too involved in my own work to see the difficulties all around me.\" He sighed. \"I\u0027ve been watching the Galactic Empire slowly fall apart for over thirty years now-and now that it\u0027s beginning to collapse much more rapidly, I don\u0027t see how we can stop it in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you trying to?\" Dr. Endelecki seemed amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of luck. About your sciatica. You know, fifty years ago it could have been cured. Not now, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the devices used for it are gone; the people who could have handled them are working on other things. Medicine is declining.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Along with everything else,\" mused Seldon. \"But let\u0027s get back to Wanda. I feel she is a most unusual young woman with a brain that is different from most. What do her genes tell you about her brain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Endelecki leaned back in her chair. \"Professor Seldon do you know just how many genes are involved in brain function?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll remind you that, of all the aspects of the human body, the brain function is the most intricate. In fact, as far as we know, there is nothing in the Universe as intricate as the human brain. So you won\u0027t be surprised when I tell you that there are thousands of genes that each play a role in brain function.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thousands?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. And it is impossible to go through those genes and see anything specifically unusual. I will take your word for it, as far as Wanda is concerned. She is an unusual girl with an unusual brain, but I see nothing in her genes that can tell me anything about that brain-except, of course, that it is normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you find other people whose genes for mental functioning are like Wanda\u0027s, that have the same brain pattern?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it very much. Even if another brain were much like hers, there would still be enormous differences in the genes. No use looking for similarities. Tell me, Professor, just what is it about Wanda that makes you think her brain is so unusual?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon shook his head. \"I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s not something I can discuss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case, I am certain that I can find out nothing for you. How did you discover that there was something unusual about her brain-this thing you can\u0027t discuss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accident,\" muttered Seldon. \"Sheer accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case, you\u0027re going to have to find other brains like hers-also by accident. Nothing else can be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled over both of them. Finally Seldon said, \"Is there anything else you can tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid not. Except that I\u0027ll send you my bill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon rose with an effort. His sciatica hurt him badly. \"Well then, thank you, Doctor. Send the bill and I\u0027ll pay it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHari Seldon left the doctor\u0027s office, wondering just what he would do next. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forward-the-foundation-foundation-7/page-23.html","bookId":2019,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:50 PM"}
