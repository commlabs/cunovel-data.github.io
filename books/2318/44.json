When I…when we set up the dinner, the stag, we thought we would have a wedding cake with a girl jumping out of it. We thought it would be so…so corny that it might be cute. You know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one said anything. Abeles was sweating up a storm. The dinner had been his show and it had not turned out as he had planned it, and he looked as though he wanted to go somewhere quiet and die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I asked around to find out where to get a girl,” he went on. “Honest, I asked a dozen guys, two dozen. I don’t know how many. I asked everybody in this room except Mark. I asked half the guys on Madison Avenue. Someone gave me a number, told me to call it and ask for Karen. So I did. She said she’d jump out of the cake for $100 and I said that was fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t know she was Donahue’s mistress?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, brother,” he said. “You have to be kidding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe told him we weren’t kidding. He got greener. “Maybe that made it a better joke,” I suggested. “To have Mark’s girl jump out of the cake the night before he married someone else. Was that it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell, no!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry grilled everyone in the place. No one admitted knowing Karen Price, or realized that she had been involved with Mark Donahue. No one admitted anything. Most of the men were married. They were barely willing to admit that they were alive. Some of them were almost as green as Phil Abeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wanted to go home. That was all they wanted. They kept mentioning how nice it would be if their names didn’t get into the papers. Some of them tried a little genteel bribery. Jerry was tactful enough to pretend he didn’t know what they were talking about. He was an honest cop. He didn’t do favors and didn’t take gifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy 1:30, he had sent them all home. The lab boys were still making chalk marks but there wasn’t much point to it. According to their measurements and calculations of the bullet’s trajectory, and a few other scientific bits and pieces, they managed to prove conclusively that Karen Price had been shot by someone in McGraw’s private dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was all they could prove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour of us rode down to Headquarters at Centre Street. Mark Donahue sat in front, silent. Jerry Gunther sat on his right. A beardless cop named Ryan, Jerry’s driver, had the wheel. I occupied the backseat all alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Fourteenth Street Mark broke his silence. “This is a nightmare. I didn’t kill Karen. Why in God’s name would I kill her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody had an answer for him. A few blocks further he said, “I suppose I’ll be railroaded now. I suppose you’ll lock me up and throw the key away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunther told him, “We don’t railroad people. We couldn’t if we wanted to. We don’t have enough of a case yet. But right now you look like a pretty good suspect. Figure it out for yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to lock you up, Donahue. You can’t talk me out of it. Ed can’t talk me out of it. Nobody can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m supposed to get married tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid that’s out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car moved south. For a while nobody had anything to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few blocks before police Headquarters Mark told me he wanted me to stay on the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll be wasting your money,” I told him. “The police will work things out better than I can. They have the manpower and the authority. I’ll just be costing you a hundred a day and getting you nothing in return.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you trying to talk yourself out of a fee?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s an ethical bastard,” Jerry put in. “In his own way, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you working for me, Ed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited a minute, organizing his thoughts. “Look,” he sighed, “do you think I killed Karen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honestly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honestly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s one reason I want you in my corner. Maybe the police are fair in these things. I don’t know anything about it. But they’ll be looking for things that’ll nail me. They have to—it’s their job. From where they sit I’m the killer.” He paused, as if the thought stunned him a little. “But you’ll be looking for something that will help me. Maybe you can find someone who was looking at me when the gun went off. Maybe you can figure out who did pull that trigger and why. I know I’ll feel better if you’re working for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t expect anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll do what I can,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I caught a cab from Headquarters to my apartment, I told Mark to call his lawyer. He wouldn’t be able to get out on bail because there is no bail in first-degree murder cases; but a lawyer could do a lot of helpful things for him. Lynn Farwell’s family had to be told that there wasn’t going to be a wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t envy anyone who has to call a mother or father at 3 A.M. and explain that their daughter’s wedding, set for 10:30 that very morning, must be postponed because the potential bridegroom has been arrested for murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back in the cab with an unlit pipe in my mouth and a lot of aimless thoughts rumbling around in my head. Nothing made much sense vet. Perhaps nothing ever would. It was that kind of a deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorning was noisy, ugly, and several hours premature. A sharp, persistent ringing stabbed my brain into a semiconscious state. I cursed and groped for the alarm clock…turned it off. The buzzing continued. I reached for the phone, lifted the receiver to my ear, and listened to a dial tone. The buzzing continued. I cursed even more vehemently and stumbled out of bed. I found a bathrobe and groped into it. I splashed cold water on my face and blinked at myself in the mirror. I looked as bad as I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell kept ringing. I didn’t want to answer it, but that seemed the only way to make it stop ringing. I listened to my bones creak on the way to the door. I turned the knob, opened the door, and blinked at the blonde who was standing there. She blinked back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mister,” she said. “You look terrible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t. Even at that ghastly hour she looked like a toothpaste ad. Her hair was blond silk and her eyes were blue jewels and her skin was creamed perfection. With a thinner body and a more severe mouth she could have been a Vogue model. But the body was just too bountiful for the fashion magazines. The breasts were a perfect 38, high and large, the waist trim, the hips a curved invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re Ed London?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded foolishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Lynn Farwell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t have to tell me. She looked exactly like what my client had said he was going to marry, except a little better. Everything about her stated emphatically that she was from Long Island’s North Shore, that she had gone to an expensive finishing school and a ritzy college, that her family had half the money in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“May I come in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got me out of bed,” I grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry. I wanted to talk to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could you sort of go somewhere and come back in about ten minutes? I’d like to get human.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t really have anyplace to go. May I just sit in your living room or something? I’ll be quiet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a pair of matching overstuffed leather chairs in my living room, the kind they have in British men’s clubs. She curled up and got lost in one of them. I left her there and ducked back into the bedroom. I showered, shaved, dressed. When I came out again the world was a somewhat better place. I smelled coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I put up a pot of java.” She smiled. “Hope you don’t mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t mind less,” I said. We waited while the coffee dripped through. I poured out two cups, and we both drank it black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven’t seen Mark,” she said. “His lawyer called. I suppose you know all about it, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More or less.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be seeing Mark later this afternoon, I suppose. We were supposed to be getting married in”—she looked at her watch—“a little over an hour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed unperturbed. There were no tears, not in her eyes and not in her voice. She asked me if I was still working for Donahue. I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t kill that girl,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think he did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure. Of all the ridiculous things…Why did he hire you, Ed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought a moment and decided to tell her the truth. She probably knew it anyway. Besides, there was no point in sparing her the knowledge that her fiancé had a mistress somewhere along the line. That should be the least of her worries, compared to a murder rap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was. She greeted the news with a half-smile and shook her head sadly. “Now why on earth would they think she could blackmail him?” Lynn Farwell demanded. “I don’t care who he slept with…Policemen are asinine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t say anything. She sipped her coffee, stretched a little in the chair, crossed one leg over the other. She had very nice legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both lit cigarettes. She blew out a cloud of smoke and looked at me through it, her blue eyes narrowing. “Ed,” she said, “how long do you think it’ll be before he’s cleared?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s impossible to say, Miss Farwell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lynn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lynn. It could take a day or a month.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded thoughtfully. “He has to be cleared as quickly as possible. That’s the most important thing. There can’t be any scandal, Ed. Oh, a little dirt is bearable. But nothing serious, nothing permanent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething didn’t sound right. She didn’t care who he slept with, but no scandal could touch them—this was vitally important to her. She sounded like anything but a loving bride-to-be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read my mind. “I don’t sound madly in love, do I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not particularly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled kittenishly. “I’d like more coffee, Ed…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got more for both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she said, “Mark and I don’t love each other, Ed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grunted noncommittally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We like each other, though. I’m fond of Mark, and he’s fond of me. That’s all that matters, really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded positively. Finishing schools and high-toned colleges produce girls with the courage of their convictions. “It’s enough,” she said. “Love’s a poor foundation for marriage in the long run. People who love are too…too vulnerable. Mark and I are perfect for each other. We’ll both be getting something out of this marriage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What will Mark get?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A rich wife. A proper connection with an important family. That’s what he wants.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A respectable marriage to a promising young man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If that’s all you want—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all I want,” she said. “Mark is good company. He’s bright, socially acceptable, ambitious enough to be stimulating. He’ll make a good husband and a good father. I’m happy.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-night-stands-and-lost-weekends/page-44.html","bookId":2318,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM"}
