Can I call you back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, it\u0027s my health club,\" she says. \"They\u0027ve screwed up my account. I\u0027ll call you back in a sec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I say and hang up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go into the bedroom and take off what I was wearing today: a herringbone wool suit with pleated trousers by Ciorgio Correggiari, a cotton oxford shirt by Ralph Lauren, a knit tie from Paul Stuart and suede shoes from Cole-Haan. I slip on a pair of sixty-dollar boxer shorts I bought at Barney\u0027s and do some stretching exercises, holding the phone, waiting for Patricia to call back. After ten minutes of stretching, the phone rings and I wait six rings to answer it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she says. \"It\u0027s me, Patricia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you hold on? I\u0027ve got another call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh sure,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put her on hold for two minutes, then get back on the line. \"Hi,\" I say. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So. Dinner,\" I say. \"Stop by my place around eight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s what I wanted to talk to you about,\" she says slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no,\" I moan. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, see, it\u0027s like this,\" she begins. \"There\u0027s this concert at Radio City and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, no,\" I tell her adamantly. \"No music.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But my ex-boyfriend, this keyboardist from Sarah Lawrence, he\u0027s in the backup band and - \" She stops, as if she has already decided to protest my decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Uh-uh, Patricia,\" I tell her firmly, thinking to myself: Damnit, why this problem, why tonight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Patrick,\" she whines into the phone. \"It\u0027ll be so much fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am now fairly sure that the odds of having sex with Patricia this evening are quite good, but not if we attend a concert in which an ex-boyfriend (there is no such thing with Patricia) is in the backup band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like concerts,\" I tell her, walking into the kitchen. I open the refrigerator and take out a liter of Evian. \"I don\u0027t like concerts,\" I say again. \"I don\u0027t like \u0027live\u0027 music.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this one isn\u0027t like the others.\" She lamely adds, \"We have good seats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen. There\u0027s no need to argue,\" I say. \"If you want to go, go. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I thought we were going to be togeth er,\" she says, straining for emotion. \"I thought we were going to have dinner,\" and then, almost definitely an afterthought, \"Be together. The two of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know,\" I say. \"Listen, we should all be allowed to do exactly what we want to do. I want you to do what you want to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pauses and tries a new angle. \"Mis music is so beautiful, so... I know it sounds corny, but it\u0027s... glorious. The band is one of the best you\u0027ll ever see. They\u0027re funny and wonderful and the music is so great and, oh gosh, I just want you to see them so badly. We\u0027ll have a great time, I guarantee it,\" she says with dripping earnestness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, you go,\" I say. \"You have a good time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick,\" she says. \"I have two tickets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I don\u0027t like concerts,\" I say. \"Live music bugs me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" she says and her voice sounds genuinely tinged with maybe real disappointment, \"I\u0027ll feel bad that you\u0027re not there with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say go and have a good time.\" I unscrew the cap off the Evian bottle, timing my next move. \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll just go to Dorsia alone then. It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a very long pause that I am able to translate into: Uh-huh, right, now see if you want to go to that lousy f**king concert. I take a large gulp of Evian, waiting for her to tell me what time she\u0027ll be over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dorsia?\" she asks and then, suspiciously, \"You have reservations there? I mean for us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\" I say, \"Eight-thirty,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" She emits a little laugh and then, faltering, \"It was... well, what I mean is, I\u0027ve seen them. I just wanted you to see them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen. What are you doing?\" I ask. \"If you\u0027re not coming I have to call someone else. Do you have Emily Hamilton\u0027s number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh now now, Patrick, don\u0027t be... rash.\" She giggles nervously. \"They are playing two more nights so I can see them tomorrow. Listen, calm down, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I say. \"I\u0027m calm.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-31.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
