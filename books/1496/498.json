However, the incredible gravitational force simply plucked him off of the wall and sent him flying out into the air and past the spell formation shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sensation of profound crisis filled Bai Xiaochun, rumbling in his mind like heavenly thunder and causing his face to drain of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he screamed, he looked around and realized that there were many other cultivators of the five legions who, just like him, were being sucked toward the enormous mouth behind the pentagon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of them had already reached the mouth itself, and were being shredded into masses of blood and gore. The entire battlefield was shaken by their screams; this was a huge blow to the forces of the Great Wall!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mouth was like a hungry ghost, and the gravitational force exerted by it caused heaven and earth to grow dim. The screaming winds swept the cultivators through the air, who were now calling upon all sorts of techniques to try to protect themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome used secret magics, others used powerful magical treasures. Some combined the two. A few even called upon their powerful trump cards!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome succeeded and some failed. As for Bai Xiaochun, he was so scared out of his mind that he could only think of one thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t let myself reach that mouth....” Gritting his teeth, he opened his Heavenspan Dharma Eye, whereupon intense fluctuations of spiritual power erupted out, transforming into a restrictive spell that instantly tried to lock him in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it wasn’t very useful.... As he watched himself flying over the heads of the savage giants, and as the enormous ghost mouth grew larger, Bai Xiaochun truly started to get anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes completely bloodshot, he performed a double-handed incantation gesture and then slapped his hands onto his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Living Mountain Incantation!!” he shouted at the top of his lungs. Instantly, his body began to expand, almost as if he were being surrounded by countless boulders. As the boulders merged together and swirled around him, he flew along another 300 meters or so, whereupon Bai Xiaochun wasn’t visible anymore. Instead, he had been replaced by a huge stone golem!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was now 300 meters tall, like a small mountain, and also much heavier than before. Even with the gravitational force tugging at him, he suddenly lurched to a stop, and began to fall downward!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, he landed on the ground with a boom, causing shockwaves to roll out from the point of impact. However, despite being on the ground, he was still being pulled toward the mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s stone golem face bore the same features as his normal face, except that they were twisted ferociously as he threw his head back and howled. Shoving his hands forward, he stabbed them into the ground in front of him, causing everything to tremble!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing all the power at his disposal, he shoved himself like a nail into the ground, ensuring that, no matter how wildly the gravitational force tugged at him, he didn’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gravitational force didn’t last for very long, only about ten breaths of time. Then the mouth behind the pentagram rift closed, taking the blood and gore that remained of the cultivators it had sucked away with it. Then, the rift slowly began to close up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was shivering, his breath coming in ragged pants as he reverted from his Living Mountain Incantation form to normal. Seeing the huge mouth fade away, he felt as if he had just passed through a deadly tribulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun wasn’t the only one among the cultivators of the five legions to have resisted the gravitational force exerted by the mouth. After all, considering that there were hundreds of thousands of cultivators among the forces of the Great Wall, it was impossible for the mouth to have affected them all. Furthermore, many of them had trump cards of their own to use, and as such, had been able to pass through the tribulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there was no time to rejoice. As the surviving cultivators looked around, they realized that they were surrounded by numerous Wildlands giants, whose cold eyes seemed to flicker with ravenous hunger!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was that the Wildlanders didn\u0027t necessarily care whether or not the huge mouth actually consumed many of the five legions cultivators. They simply wanted to get them outside of the shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as they were outside of that shield and within reach of the army, then most of their lives would be within the hands of the Wildlanders!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe generals and major generals of the armies were in the middle of fighting the necromancer souls, and were unable to do anything other than shout, “Fall back immediately!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, more beams of light began to shoot out from the enormous eye to attack enemies on the battlefield. Simultaneously, the spell formation shield began to advance, hoping to bring the exposed cultivators back under its protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the cultivators who were close to the shield to begin with were able to retreat behind it with reckless bursts of speed. However, there at least 200,000 who were too far away to make it, or who were blocked by the vast numbers of giants!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill them!!” the tribal chiefs shouted. The truth was that the savage giants on the battlefield didn’t need any orders to do just that. Roaring, they began to charge the nearest cultivators!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundreds of thousands immediately intercepted the cultivators who had been pulled beyond the shield, making it impossible for them to retreat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLingering fear could still be seen on Bai Xiaochun’s ashen face, and he was still trembling. His heart felt cold as he looked around at the battlefield, almost on the verge of tears. Moments ago, he had been safe on the wall, relishing the sensation of having so much battle credit being added to his name. But now, he was now surrounded by the enemy, and in mortal danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis turn of events was too sudden, and he almost couldn’t accept it. However, as he looked around at the scores of savage giants, he realized he had no choice. All of them were glaring at him with madness and greed as they rushed in his direction, cackling madly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Devil Bai’s here! Kill him!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hahaha! I can’t believe Devil Bai is right in front of me!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s mine! I\u0027m gonna eat him!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun almost felt like his head was going to explode as the giants neared. They were so close that he could smell the rotting stench that came from their mouths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were bloodshot, and the sensation of deadly crisis was like a needle slowly poking into his mind. However, it was in that moment that, all of a sudden, his veins of steel began to pulse, and a murderous aura erupted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, I\u0027m... I’m friends with your commanding officer....” he said. However, the clever words which came out of his mouth did no good. This was not a situation in which he could retreat, and as such, his fleshly body began to pulse with power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My flesh belongs to me, not you people!! You want me dead? Well you’re gonna regret it!” With that, he slapped his bag of holding, causing numerous suits of armor to fly out. Most people would, at most, wear a few sets of armor at the same time. But somehow, Bai Xiaochun was using a strange method to don far more than was normal. Plus, he was putting them on with blinding speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlying swords flew out to surround him, as well as magical items. Within the blink of an eye, he was surrounded by scintillating, multicolored light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, things weren’t over yet. Stacks of paper talismans appeared, which he slapped all over himself, then activated, creating a glittering shield with more than a thousand layers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuicker than words could describe, Bai Xiaochun was armed to the teeth, which was when the dozens of incoming savage giants slammed into him. These giants all had profound cultivation bases that were comparable to Core Formation. However, they were completely incapable of penetrating Bai Xiaochun’s defenses, and in fact, were hit with a backlash that sent them stumbling backward, blood spraying out of their mouths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other nearby giants stared, dumbstruck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, I can’t believe he’s wearing more than ten suits of armor! How do we pierce through that!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And look at all the paper talismans! Even one of them alone would be very expensive, and he’s using more than a thousand!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heavens! He’s like a living bag of holding!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering that he was temporarily invincible, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and mustered his courage. Seemingly ready to put his life on the line, he charged toward the nearby giants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You people push things too far!!” he roared. Although some observers might think that having so many suits of armor, defenses, magical items, flying swords, and the like would be very cumbersome, they didn’t affect his speed at all. In the briefest of moments, he was upon the nearest savage giant, whom he slammed into before a reaction was even possible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-495\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-497\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-496","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM"}
