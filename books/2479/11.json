An extra sixty dollars was, in its own way, a small miracle. \"I\u0027ll call it a loan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call it whatever you please.

He\u0027s got a cabin in a fishin\u0027 camp, down in the bayou country south of Houma. The camp\u0027s called Vermilion.

Before Dan could respond, Susan went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gary\u0027s taken Chad and me down there a few weekends. He checks on the oil rigs and we do some fishin\u0027.

The nearest neighbors a mile or so away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bringin\u0027 Chad was enough,\" Dan told her. \"You don\u0027t have to-\" \"I want to,\" she interrupted. \"The cabin\u0027s two or three miles past the bridge, up a turnoff on the left.

Figure out what to do next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"Is this fella ... Gary ... is he good to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is. He and Chad get along real well, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan grunted. It was going to take him some time to digest this news. \"Chad needs a father,\" he said in spite of the pain it caused him. \"Somebody who takes him fishin\u0027. Stuff like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Susan said. \"I wish I could do more for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve done enough. More than enough.\" He pushed the money into his pocket. \"This is my problem, and I\u0027ll handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stubborn as hell.\" Her voice had softened. \"Always were, always will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the station wagon\u0027s door. \"Well, I guess this is good-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flashlight clicked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts dazzling beam hit Dan\u0027s eyes and blinded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Freeze, Lambert!\" a man\u0027s voice ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@e of Fire The shock paralyzed Dan. Susan caught her breath with a harsh psp and spun around to face the intruder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy, easy,\" the man behind the flashlight cautioned. He had a whisPery, genteel southern accent. \"Don\u0027t do anythin\u0027 foolish, Lambert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m armed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was standing about twenty feet away. Dan expected to be hit by a second light, and then the policemen would nish in, slam him against the car, and frisk him. He lifted his hands to shield his face from the stabbing white beam. \u0027I,m not packin\u0027 a gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good.\" It was a relief to Flint urt gh t M all , who had crePt up from the edge of the parking lot by keeping the woman\u0027s car between himself and the fugitive. He\u0027d been standing there for a couple of minutes in the darkness, listening to their conversation. In his left hand was the flashlight, in his right was a .45 automatic aimed just to Lambert\u0027s side. \"Put your hands behind your head and lock your fingers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s Over, Dan thought. He could run, maybe, but he wouldn\u0027t get very far. Where were the other policemen, though? Surely there wasn\u0027t just the one. He obeyed the command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan was squinting into the light. She\u0027d talked to the policemen in-charge of the stakeout on her house and to the one who\u0027d followed her to the Holiday Inn; she hadn\u0027t heard this man\u0027s voice before. \"Don\u0027t hurt him,\" she said. \"It was self-defense, he\u0027s not a cold-blooded killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint ignored her. \"Lambert, walk toward me. Slowly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan paused. Something was wrong; he could feel it in the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere were the backup policemen? Where were the police cars, the spinning bubble lights and the crackling radios? They should\u0027ve converged on him by now, if they were even here. \"Come on, move it,\" Flint said. step out of the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady, Susan thought. The other policemen had addressed her as Mrs. Lambert. \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flint Murtaugh. Pleased to meet you. Lambert, come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, Dan.\" Susan stepped in front of him to take the full force of the light. \u0027Show me your badge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint clenched his teeth. His patience was already stretched tinn from the hellish drive with Pelvis Eisley and Mama. He was in no mood for complications. Flint had never cared to know the names of all the characters Elvis Presley had played in his wretched movies. Trying to @ Eisley cease jabbering about Presley was as futile as trying to make that dsamn mutt stop pawing at fleas. Flint was @ and his sharkskin suit was damp with sweat, Clint was agitated by the beat and kept twitching, and it was long past time for a cold shower and a glass of lemon juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d @ to see your badge,\" Susan repeated, the man\u0027s hesitation \u003ca href\u003d\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class\u003d\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail\u003d\"e6949383a6\"\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/a\u003e her doubt.

Susan moved to shield her ex-husband once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady, I told you to step out of the way.1% \"Do you have a badge, or not?tl Flint\u0027s composure was fast unraveling. He wanted Lambert to come to him because he didn\u0027t want to have to Pass the woman; if she grabbed for the flashlight or the gun, things could get messy. He wished he\u0027d circled around the other side and crept up on Lambert from behind to keep the woman from being between them. It was Eisley\u0027s fault, he decided, for screwing up his concentration. Flint had a small spray can of Mace in his inside coat pocket, and he suspected that he might have to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady,\" he replied, \"that man standin\u0027 there is worth fifteen thousand dollars to me. I\u0027ve come from Shreveport to find him, and I\u0027ve had a hard night. You really don\u0027t want to get yourself involved in this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not a policeman,\" Dan said to Susan. \"He\u0027s a bounty hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou workin\u0027 for the bank?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Independent contract.

Come on, real slow and easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a lucky break, actually. Flint had driven along Jackson Avenue and had seen the police surveillance teams, one at either end of the block. Held parked two streets away and sat beside a hedge in someone\u0027s Yard, watching the house to see what developed. Then the woman had pulled out of her garage, followed by another policeman in an unmarked car, and Flint had decided to tag along at a distance. At the Holiday Inn he\u0027d been on the verge of calling it quits when her watchdog had rushed off, obviously answering a radio summons, but then the woman had emerged again and Flint had smelled an opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do it,\" Susan said before Dan could move. \"if he doesn\u0027t work for the state of Louisiana, he doesn\u0027t have any right to take you in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got a gun!\" Flint was about ready to snort steam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You understand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a gun\u0027s not a badge. You\u0027re not gonna be shootin\u0027 an unarmed man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom?\" Chad called from the car. \"You need some help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Just stay where you are!\" Susan directed her attention at the bounty hunter again. She took two steps toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan!\" Dan said. \"You\u0027d better keep-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush. Ixt somebody help you, for God\u0027s sake.\" She advanced another step on Flint. \"You\u0027re a vulture, aren\u0027t you? Swoopin\u0027 in on whatever meat you can snatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady, you\u0027re tryin\u0027 to make me forget MY manners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou ready to shoot a woman, too? You and Dan could share the same cell.\" She moved forward two more paces, and Flint retreated one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dan?\" Susan said calmly. \"He\u0027s not takin\u0027 you anywhere. Get in your car and go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! No, goddamn it!\" Flint shouted. \"Lambert, don\u0027t you move!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t kill you, but I\u0027ll sure as hell put some hurt on you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s empty talk, Dan.\" Susan had decided what needed to be done, and she was getting herself into position to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took one more step toward the bounty hunter. \"Go on, get in the car and drive away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint hollered, \"No, you don\u0027t!\" It was time to put i I Lambert on the ground. Flint jammed the automatic into his waistband and plucked the small red can of Mace from inside his coat. He popped the cap off with his thumb and put his index finger on the nozzle. The concentrated spray had a range of fifteen feet, and Flint realized he was going to have to shove the woman aside to get a clear shot at Lambert. He was so enraged he almost fired a burst into her eyes, but he\u0027d never Maced a woman and he wasn\u0027t going to start now. He stalked toward her and was amazed when she stood her ground. \"To hell with this!\" he snarled, and he jabbed an elbow at her shoulder to drive her out of the @e of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut suddenly she was moving. I She was moving very, very fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clamped a wiry hand to his right wrist, stepped into him with her own shoulder, and pivoted, her elbow thunking upward into FUnt\u0027s chin and rattling his brains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis black wingtips left the pavement. His trapped wrist was turned in on itself, pain shooting up his arm. Somewhere in midair he lost both the flashlight and the Mace. As he went over the woman\u0027s hip, one word blazed in Flint\u0027s consciousness: sucker. Then the ground came up fast and hard and he slammed down on his back with a force that whooshed the Line of Fire breath from his lungs and made stars and comets pinwheel through his skull. Susan stepped back from the fallen man and scooped up the flashlight. \"Way to go, Mom!\" Chad yelled, leaning out of the Toyota\u0027s window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn\" was all Dan could think to say. It had happened so quickly that his hands were Stan locked behind his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you-\" \"Tar kwon do,\" Susan said. She wasn\u0027t even breathing hard. \"I\u0027ve got a brown belt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. Now Dan understood why Susan hadn\u0027t been afraid to meet him. He lowered his hands and walked to her side, where he looked down the @light\u0027s beam at the bounty hunters pained and pallid face. A comma of white-streaked hair hung over Flint Murtaugh\u0027s sweat-glistening forehead, and he\u0027d curled up on his side and was clutching his right wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan saw the automatic and freed it from the man\u0027s waistband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brown belt or not, that was a damn fool thing to do. You could\u0027ve gotten yourself killed.\" He removed the, bullet clip, threw it in one direction and the gun in another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had something\u0027 in his other hand.\" Susan shone the light around. \"I couldn\u0027t tell what it was, but I heard him drop it.\" She steadied the beam on Murtaugh again. \"I can\u0027t figure out where he came from. I thought I made sure nobody was follow-\" She stopped speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, her voice tight: \"Dan. What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked. The front of the man\u0027s white shirt was twitching, as if his heart were about to beat through his chest. Dan stared at it, transfixed, and then he reached down to touch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Murtaugh! Mr. Murtaugh, you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan straightened up. Another man was out there in the dark. Both Dan and Susan had the eerie sensation that they recognized the voice\u0027s deep, snarly resonance, but neither one of them could place it. A dog began to yap again, and on the pavement Flint gave a muffled half-groan, half e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etti Susan switched the light off. \"You\u0027d better hit it. Ge n\u0027 kind of crowded around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan hurried to the station wagon and Susan followed him, and so neither of them saw the slim, pale third arm push free from Flint Murtaugh\u0027s shirt and flail angrily in the air. Dan got behind the wheel, started the engine, and turned on the headlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan reached in and grasped his shoulder. \"Good luck,\" she said over the engine\u0027s rumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did love you,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you did.\" He put his hand over hers and squeezed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of Chad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. And you take care of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So long,\" Dan said, and he put the station wagon in reverse and backed away past the bounty hunter. Flint pulled himself up to his knees, pain stabbing through his lower back and his right wrist surely sprained. Clint\u0027s was thrashing around, the hand clenched in a fighting fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough a dreamlike haze Flint watched the fifteenthousand-dollar skin twist the station wagon around and drive across the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint tried to summon up a yell but a hoarse rasp emerged: \"Eisley!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s comin\u0027 at you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn another moment Dan had to stomp on the brake. He feared he must be losing his mind, because right there in front of the pickup stood a big-bellied, pompadour-haired -up black Cadillac behind him blocking Elvis Presley, a beat the road. Elvis-a credible impersonator for sure-was holding on to a squirming little bulldog. \"Where\u0027s Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurtaugh?\" Elvis shouted in that husky Memphis drawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027cha done to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan had seen everything now. He hit the gas pedal taking the station wagon up over the curb onto the park\u0027s grass. The rear tires fislrtailed and threw up clods of earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElvis scrambled out of the way, bellowing for Mr. Murtaugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint had gotten to his feet and was hobbling in the dion of the Cadillac.

The thing was making an unearthly metallic roar as if on the verge of blowing its cylinders. He saw in his rearview mirror the one-eyed Cadillac speeding up on his tail, and he braced for collision. There was a blinking caution light ahead, marking an intersection. Dan had no time to think about it; he twisted the wheel violently to the left. As the station wagon sluggishly obeyed, its worn tires skidding across the pavement, the Cadillac hit him, a grazing blow from behind, and sparks shot between their crumpled fenders. Then, as Dan fought the wheel to keep from sliding over the curb into somebody\u0027s front yard, the Cadillac zoomed past the intersection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on!\" Flint shouted, his foot jamming the brake pedal. The Eldorado was heavy, and would not slow down without screaming, smoking protest from the tires. Pelvis clung to Mama, who was trying her damnedest to jump into the backseat. Flint reversed to the intersection, the bitter smoke of burned rubber swirling through the windows, and turned left onto a winding street bordered by brick homes with manicured lawns and honest-to-God white picket fences. He sped after Lambert, but there was no sign of the station wagon\u0027s taillights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther streets veered off on either side, and it became clear after a few seconds that Lambert had turned onto one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll find you, you bastard!\" Flint said between clenched teeth, and he whipped the car to the right at the next street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt, too, was dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s done gone,\" Pelvis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!

Flint took the next right, the tires squealing. He was in a mazelike residential area, the streets going in all directions. Anger throbbed like drumbeats at his temples, pain lancing his lower back He tasted panic like cold copper in his mouth. Then he turned right onto another street and his heart kicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree blocks away was a pair of red taillights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint hit the accelerator so hard the Cadillac leapt forward like a scalded dog. He roared up behind Lambert\u0027s car, intending to swerve around him and cut him off. But in the next instant Flint\u0027s triumph shriveled into terror. The Cadillac\u0027s headlight revealed the car was not a rust-eaten old station wagon but a new Chevrolet Caprice. Across its fast-approaching rear end was silver lettering that spelled Out \u003ca href\u003d\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class\u003d\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail\u003d\"4203171a030c0602\"\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/a\u003e POLICE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint stood on the brake pedal. A thousand cries for God, Jesus, and Mother Mary rang @ crazy bells in his brain. As the Cadillac\u0027s tires left a quarter-inch of black rubber on the pavement, the prowl cars driver punched it and the Caprice shot forward to avoid the crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Caddy stewed to one side before it stopped, the engine rattled and died, and the police cruiser\u0027s bubble lights started spinning. It backed up, halting a couple of feet from Flint\u0027s busted bumper. A spotlight on the drivers side swiveled around and into Flint\u0027s face @ an angry Cyclopean eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Pelvis drawled, \"now we\u0027ve done shit and stepped in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver nearer the intersection with the flashing caution light, Dan started the station wagon\u0027s engine and backed out of the driveway he\u0027d pulled into. He eased onto the street, his headlights still off. The black Cadillac had sped past about two minutes before, and Dan had expected it to come flying back at any second. As the saying went, it was time to git while the gittin\u0027 was good. He switched on his lights and at the caution sipal took a left toward Interstate 49 and the route south. There were no cars ahead of him, nor any in his rearview mirror. But it was going to be a long night, and a long drive yet before he could rest. He breathed a good-bye to Alexandria, and a good riddance to the bounty hunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint, still stunned by the sudden turn of events, was watching the red and blue lights spin around. \"Eisley, you\u0027re a jinx,\" he said hoarsely. \"That\u0027s what you are. A jinx.\" Two policemen were getting out of the car. Flint pushed the can of Mace under his seat. Clint\u0027s arm resisted him, but he forced it inside his shirt and buttoned his coat. The two officers both had young, rawboned faces, and they didn\u0027t appear happy. Before they reached the Cadillac, Flint dug his wallet out and presed his left arm over his chest to pin Clint down. \"Keep your mouth zipped,\" he told Pelvis. \"I\u0027ll do all the talkin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe policeman who walked up on Flint\u0027s side of the car had a fresh crew cut and a jaw that looked as if it could chop wood. He shone a flashlight into Flint\u0027s eyes. \"You near \u0027bout broke our necks, you know that? Look what you did to my cap.\" He held up a crushed and formless thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m awful sorry, sir.\" Flint\u0027s voice was a masterpiece of studied remorse. \"I\u0027m not from around here, and I\u0027m lost. I guess I panicked, \u0027cause I couldn\u0027t find my way out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. You had to be goin\u0027 at least sixty. Sign back there says fifteen miles an hour.

Look what we\u0027ve got here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How you fellas doin\u0027?\" Pelvis asked, grinning. In his arms Mama had begun a low, menacing growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet this\u0027ll be a real interestin\u0027 story,\" the policeman with the light said. \"Let\u0027s see a driver\u0027s license.
