I hope you will engrave in your memory the words you have spoken today!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From herein, I shall strive to impart to you everything I know. As for how much you can learn, it will all depend on your diligence and luck…” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Mentor!” Leylin gave a deep respectful bow. He knew that, as a Morning Star Magus and an elder of the clan, Duke Gilbert was very busy everyday. It was most definitely not easy to take time out every day to teach him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis also meant that Gilbert was optimistic about Leylin’s future. Besides, regardless of the inconveniences, it was not going to be a long journey!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it was as such, this opportunity was even more precious!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThereafter, Leylin would be at Gilbert’s manor, receiving his teachings on foundation subjects. Although Leylin had already learnt most of it, the content from the southern coast and Twilight Zone differed from that of the central continent and Gilbert aimed to acknowledge and reverse these discrepancies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though it was just basic foundational knowledge, with Gilbert’s way of narration Leylin gained even more insight from the content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, Gilbert had placed his personal library in a separate concealed room, allowing Leylin to browse the books freely. Content that he needed to memorize were those relating to history and magic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Introduction to dimension theory!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Space communication knowledge!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Research on the boundary of the stars!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin as usual, approached the concealed room and picked out three thick books that he had marked. After flipping to a specific page, he started to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the illumination of the unceasing flame in the concealed room, Leylin was focused and devout. These were qualities that all researchers should have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter an hour had passed, Gilbert approached Leylin. He saw the contents of the book in his hand and was all smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well? I see you are interested in interdimensional travel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Mentor!” Leylin nodded his head and admitted it. Magi from ancient times were formidable because they had plundered an enormous amount of the world’s accumulated knowledge and their consistent research to upgrade themselves. Leylin wanted to be like them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Interdimensional travel may be dangerous but it is also very enticing. Once you succeed, the benefits of the world will be solely reaped by you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilbert let out a sigh and pulled out a chair, ”Alright! Today I will tell you about the research the central continent has conducted on interdimensional travel!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The central continent has already begun research in this field?’ Leylin’s heart skipped a beat. He sat upright and was all ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilbert gave it some thought and decided on where to begin. “First of all, you need to understand the concept of worlds and dimensions!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The multiverse is wide and borderless. Even the ancient Magi at their peak they were unable to explore to the extreme ends of it. Surrounding the Magi were the existences of multiple other great worlds as well. And so, a plane is but a small tiny world. If the world of the Magi is the sun for instance, a plane is a small star! However, no matter how small the plane is, their surface area will still exceed what you have imagined it to be….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And among the different worlds and dimensions, all kinds of bizarre living beings exist within them. In fact, there are existences that surpass that of the Magi in history. Some were the ones who initiated the start of a brilliant civilization. While other were the amalgamation of consciousnesses and concepts. No living organisms exist there, only a terrifying mix of chaotic beings with consciousness….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ancient Magi won by means of conquering these worlds and researching their powers. They robbed the necessary resources and created their own splendid civilization….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so, the basis of interdimensional travel is a cosmic gate! One theory states that the cosmos is the highest state of the multiverse. It is also the core of all dimensions, time and space! Through the cosmos, the world of Magi could connect to any other world at will!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see! So it simply means, that the so-called Star Realm is actually a central hub for various dimensions and the world! “ Leylin remarked after some thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you can look at it that way! However the mystery of the Star Realm can never be fully comprehended, so you need to show your utmost respect!” Gilbert smiled and gave Leylin a stern warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes! I understand now, Mentor” Leylin nodded his head in compliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By opening the cosmic gate, you will be exposed to countless dangers. There were Magi who stumbled into unknown worlds carelessly and died to attacks from various dangerous creatures. And others who went and came back to the Magus world with unusual and terrifying curses…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, on the whole, Magi dominated the various worlds, well, except for \u003ci\u003ethat\u003c/i\u003e world…..”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are they the formidable enemy that we fought with, during the battle that ended our golden period?” Leylin vaguely remembered the details from the antique book he had read back in Twilight Zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right!” Gilbert replied with a tone of seriousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Magi from the ancient past conquered one dimension after another, causing many living creatures to bow and surrender and to be used as slaves. However, the huge victories and glory soon clouded their egos, and they became greedy for more insane strategies of attacks, ignoring all signs of dangers, until they met that world….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of world is that?” Leylin couldn’t help asking, knowing very well the formidable power it possessed yet not knowing the seldom-mentioned details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is a world that consists of multiple planes that can no longer evolve any further. Clusters of smaller dimensions are suspended at its edges. And surrounding the entire world is yet another strong layer of crystal walls!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a rank 4 Magus of the central continent. Gilbert naturally knew the details of ancient secrets very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are many strong Magi in that world, some at rank 7, rank 8…. Of course, they are not called Magi there, instead they address themselves as—Gods!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gods?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, and so that world is known as the ‘World of Gods’ ! Although the opposing side is extremely strong and powerful, the Magi at that time were also at the peak of their own prosperity. Resources in the World of Gods were plentiful and this made the ancient Magi jealous. They saw great value in the Gods’ lands and sought to attain them. Hence, those Rank 7 and Rank 8 Magi who wielded horrifying powers started a war with them…..”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened next, you should know very well! “ Gilbert turned to look at Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I do! Neither side won! Many of the ancient Magi died one after another to the point that it ended our golden period. The door to the cosmos, on the other hand, had no choice but to be sealed too. All this led the collapse of the Magus world! “\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm! The way I see it, our Magus world and the opposing World of Gods are each at one end of a funnel and the cosmos is the link between us. As for the planes and other worlds, they are sprinkled between us along the way!” Gilbert explained his personal opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As the strength of both sides were similar, the opposing Gods did not have an easy time. There were rumours that their most powerful, the ‘Supreme God,’ suffered an irreversible injury that caused him to sink into an eternal sleep. As for the other fallen Gods, the numbers were astounding, hence it was termed the ‘Sunset of the Gods’…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So….. after finding out about it, the new generations of Magi recently reopened cosmic gates and started conducting interdimensional travel!” Leylin guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis explains why the central continent is much more prosperous than all the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the beginning, it was the lone decision of a single Morning Star Magus to do so, but when it was revealed that there were no signs of invasion from the World of Gods and no adverse consequences, the other Morning Star Magi followed suit…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilbert smiled bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the central continent, if you did not improve, the others would naturally improve and leave you in the dust. Since using cosmic gates would cause no harm and yet reap great rewards, then how could the rest of the Magi endure this temptation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After some cautious travel, we finally got word of the World of Gods. The external layer of their crystal wall system had been stabilized, reinforced and hardened, resisting all external intruders and it had already reached a new, stronger level of sealing…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Upon hearing this news, all the Magi in the central continent unanimously let out sighs of relief, and decided to carry out even more interdimensional travel, slowly regaining the glory of our ancient past, so much so that a few Rank 6 Magi, those we now call Kings, started to appear….” Gilbert said conclusively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin nodded his head. The current Leylin, with his newfound knowledge of the central continent and battle of the ancient past, finally understood the total picture. At the same time, he looked forward to experiencing interdimensional travel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The world where I used to live in, is it a part of the endless multiverse?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the bottom of his heart, Leylin was suddenly filled with indifferent expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current Leylin had already combined innate spells with science and technology, embarking on his own personal journey. Even if other Magi were to achieve the much needed accumulated knowledge of science and technologies, they might not be able to match up to his rate of advancement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, the A.I. Chip had fused with his soul when he was shuttled through space and time. This was not something any Magus could achieve, and the probability of success was simply too low. Even if other Magi were to try and attempt it, their soul would likely be destroyed at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But, as your Mentor, I would like to remind you this. You are too weak to conduct research on this currently!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilbert pressed on the interdimensional travel research that Leylin held in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only when you have reached the status of a Morning Star Magus will you be able to venture out into the cosmos!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-401\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-403\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-402","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
