They could only play a supporting role and a martial artist’s own strength was the main factor.

His strength erupted from his body like a volcano. Behind him, the phantom of the Heretical God Tree appeared and the manic power of thunder and fire howled forth!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKa ka ka!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe void trembled.

He didn’t know what those runes were used for but he definitely couldn’t let them activate. Otherwise, if those runes could greatly increase the defenses of those two or even form a defensive barrier around them then that would give them the time to use some other methods to escape.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The power of thunder and fire, Heavenly Dao Judgment!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t hold back.

To use this move to deal with two people that were nearly equal to ordinary human Divine Lord martial artists was like using a giant cleaver to slay a chicken.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut, in order to be cautious against the existence of these god runes, Lin Ming had used this move without hesitation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA terrifying detonation lit up the world. Countless crushed stones and waves of sands were sent soaring into the heavens, directly disintegrating and turning into endless clouds of dust. It was like a giant meteor had smashed into the earth, obscuring all vision on the ground within a dazzling red and purple glow!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ahhhh!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe two robbers cried out in pain.

His entire skeleton was shattered and his skin was burned black.

It must have greatly strengthened this fellow’s defensive abilities.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf an early Divine Lord martial artist was able to achieve such an effect with such a god rune, then what effects would it display with a Holy Lord or World King?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming felt more and more that within the Asura Road, these god runes were considered an extremely important part of a martial artist’s strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, a martial artist’s own strength was the first and most important factor. But, if one had enough god runes and enough formidable god runes, then that might allow a martial artist’s strength to rise by a large boundary.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot just that, but after completing certain smelting trials in the Asura Road, these god runes would transform into true strength within Lin Ming’s body. The mightier the runes that Lin Ming was able to obtain, the more his strength would rise.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt seemed that his first goal after arriving at the Asura Road should be to understand the functions of as many god runes as he could as well as to obtain his own god runes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That’s right, didn’t Senior Divine Dream say that there were many god runes I would be able to take from others?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming happily smiled as he thought of this. He glanced over at the two robbers. One had been torn to bits and pieces by the power of thunder and fire and had died on the spot.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for the other, because of the protection of the god rune, he was still hanging onto one final breath of life. He had just arrived at the Asura Road and Lin Ming hadn’t even gone to steal anyone’s runes, yet some people had already come to deliver their runes right to him. This was like running into a pot of gold. Although these two robbers’ runes were likely not too heaven-defying, it was still better than nothing at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming walked towards the dead robber and swept through the shredded corpse with his divine sense. He discovered that this robber’s god runes had already disappeared. This caused Lin Ming to sigh with regret. It seemed that upon a martial artist’s death, the god runes they had would disappear. Unfortunately, he hadn’t known of this just now and had wasted many runes in vain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThen, Lin Ming walked towards the next robber.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis robber was still conscious. He looked at Lin Ming, his lips purple and his face white and cold. His voice shook, “For… forgive me… I… I will give you… my runes…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe robber rolled over with some difficulty, crawling on the ground. His hand pawed against the rocky sand floor, leaving behind a trail of bright red blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I don’t need you to give me your god runes. I’ll take them myself…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming callously said. He had no sympathy towards someone who murdered others and stole their possessions. The Phoenix Blood Spear in his hands thrust out and stabbed into the robber.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe robber squealed like a pig and almost fainted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis piece of flesh actually had a rune carved into it. Lin Ming wanted to separate this rune, but he discovered that as soon as he cut it out, although a god rune really did appear, it vanished as soon as it floated upwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“No… no…” The robber’s voice continued to tremble, “If you kill me… you…won’t… have anything… if you can make an oath, I… I will give you… all my runes…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe robber haltingly spoke. However, Lin Ming wouldn’t care about the words of a robber at all. He only thought for a moment as he recalled Empyrean Divine Dream’s words.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe had told him, ‘Of course, there remains the most simple and direct way of obtaining god runes… and that is to take them from others. There are some god runes that you can take for yourself as long as you kill the other party’…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEmpyrean Divine Dream had only said ‘some’, which meant that only some runes were able to be taken. As for the others, he likely couldn’t take them even if he killed others. Those runes were likely bound to a martial artist’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“So that’s how it is…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming finally understood. He raised his spear once more and thrust it straight through the robber’s back.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe robber spat out a mouthful of blood, dead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFrom his corpse, seven runes appeared. Six of them disappeared, leaving behind a single one that slowly floated towards Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming stared at this rune for some time. Then, he slowly reached out his hand and touched this rune with a fingertip.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWoosh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a light sound, this rune flitted forth like a little butterfly and entered Lin Ming’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming felt heat flow into his flesh, blood, and meridians. After that, a message appeared in his mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“God rune: Mournful Spirit’s Right Hand. Grade: silver level.

There are a total of seven runes within the Mournful Spirit’s Right Hand, divided into the gold and silver levels. The more that are collected, the greater the strength will be. By collecting all seven, they may be fused into one.
