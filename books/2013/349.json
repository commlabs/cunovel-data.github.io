The parade of Letherii whores is now at an end, so your pimp soldiers will have to make their extra coin elsewhere.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Edur commander led his troop away, down off the summit of the hill. Sirryn stared after them for a moment, until he was certain they would not return. He then withdrew a second scroll and approached the Preda of the Imperial Brigade. ‘These, too,’ he said, ‘are the Chancellor’s orders.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Preda was a veteran, not just of battle, but of the ways of the palace. He simply nodded as he accepted the scroll. ‘Finadd,’ he asked, ‘will the Chancellor be commanding us in person when the time comes?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I imagine not, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat could make things awkward.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In some matters, I will speak for him, sir. As for the rest, you will find, once you have examined that scroll, that you are given considerable freedom for the battle itself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if I find myself at odds with Hanradi?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I doubt that will be a problem,’ Sirryn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched the Preda mull that over, and thought he saw a slight widening of the man’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Finadd,’ the Preda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How fares the Chancellor, at the moment?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well indeed, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And… in the future?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He is most optimistic, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Very good. Thank you, Finadd.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSirryn saluted. ‘Begging your leave, sir, I wish to oversee the establishment of my camp.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Make it close to this hill, Finadd-this is where we will command the battle-and I will want you close.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir, there is scant room left-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have my leave to move people out at your discretion, Finadd.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Thank you, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, he would enjoy that. Grubby soldiers with dust on their boots-they always imagined themselves superior to their counterparts in the palace. Well, a few cracked skulls would change that quick enough. By leave of their very own Preda. He saluted again and led his troops back down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked familiar. Had he been a student of hers? Son of a neighbour, son of another scholar? These were the questions in Janath’s mind as the troop dragged them from Tehol’s home. Of the journey to the compound of the Patriotists, she now recalled very little. But that man, with the familiar face-a face that stirred oddly intimate feelings within her-would not leave her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChained in her cell, chained in the darkness that crawled with vermin, she had been left alone for some time now. Days, perhaps even a week. A single plate of watery stew slid through the trap at the foot of the door at what seemed irregular intervals-it would not be pushed into her cell if she did not leave the empty plate from the last meal within easy reach of the guard. The ritual had not been explained to her, but she had come to admire its precision, its eloquence. Disobedience meant hunger; or, rather, starvation-hunger was always there, something that she had not experienced in the household of Bugg and Tehol. There had been a time, back then, when she had come to loathe the taste of chicken. Now she dreamed of those damned hens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man, Tanal Yathvanar, had visited but once, apparently to gloat. She’d no idea she had been wanted for sedition, although in truth that did not surprise her much. When thugs were in power, educated people were the first to feel their fists. It was so pathetic, really, how so much violence came from someone feeling small. Small of mind, and it did not matter how big the sword in hand, that essential smallness remained, gnawing with very sharp teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Bugg and Tehol had hinted, occasionally, that things would not go well if the Patriotists found her. Well, them, as it turned out. Tehol Beddict, her most frustrating student, who had only attended her lectures out of adolescent lust, now revealed as the empire’s greatest traitor-so Tanal Yathvanar had said to her, the glee in his voice matched by the lurid reflections in his eyes as he stood with his lantern in one hand and the other touching his private parts whenever he thought she wasn’t looking. She had been sitting with her back to the stone wall, head tilted down chin to chest, with her filthy hair hanging ragged over her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol Beddict, masterminding the empire’s economic ruin-well, that was still a little hard to believe. Oh, he had the talent, yes. And maybe even the inclination. But for such universal collapse as was now occurring, there was a legion of co-conspirators. Unwitting for the most part, of course, barring that niggling in their guts that what they were doing was, ultimately, destructive beyond measure. But greed won out, as it always did. So, Tehol Beddict had paved the road, but hundreds-thousands?-had freely chosen to walk it. And now they cried out, indignant and appalled, even as they scurried for cover lest blame spread its crimson pool. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-349.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
