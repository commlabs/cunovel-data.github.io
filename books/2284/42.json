But the thing is we have three dead women, one who escaped and a dead man. We also believe Gus was a victim. We assume that both men were killed because they stumbled onto something. The women were new to Savannah, although Helen Long had been here for a while. They were all attractive—all beautiful female captives. But I suspect the killer saw them, watched them, before he took them. I suspect he’s looking for a woman to be the perfect mate in his life of pirate crime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby had come down and stood in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He has a whole fantasy built up,” Abby said, continuing Malachi’s narrative. “He’s the pirate who seizes a captive and the captive falls in love with him, eschews her old life and joins him on the high seas. Perhaps the killer thought he had the right woman with Helen—but she kept saying she was repulsed by him. She didn’t want him to touch her, and she couldn’t pretend. That’s what happens when he gets to the point where he feels rejected, he kills. And then he searches for another woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby lifted her hands. “How does this help us, though?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It does help us. We watch for someone who...watches,” Malachi told her. “Let’s head back to the Dragonslayer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because we’re going to find the killer there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her for a moment. She was obviously trying to keep the bitterness out of her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he said. “Because we’ll find him there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late for lunch, but the Dragonslayer was still doing a booming business. Macy was at the host stand, and Bootsie and Aldous were at the bar. Abby got up onto the stool next to Aldous. He’d just finished a plate of fish and chips, and while she affectionately called him a barfly, he wasn’t drinking; he sipped from a cup of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you holding up?” he asked, nodding at Malachi, who sat beside Abby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine, Aldous. Just confused—like everyone else. And scared. There’s another girl out there somewhere, and I’m hoping we can find her, as we did Helen. Alive, I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, alive. It’s a sorry thing, huh? And your friend Roger English—is he broken up over it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. They’d just started dating, but he felt he’d found the ‘one,’” Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBootsie did have a beer in front of him. He let out a snort. “Roger, ah, that boy! Well, she was—sorry, is a pretty girl. But I don’t think she’s the one for him. Roger is falling apart now, but that boy is a passionate soul. He loves the city, he loves dress up and history. She’s a little namby-pamby for him. He’ll figure that out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s hope he gets to figure that out,” Malachi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s hope,” Aldous repeated. “He’s here now—over there, at a table. With your other high school bud, Abby. What’s that other kid’s name? The one he works with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Paul Westermark?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Apparently the girl playing Missy Tweed isn’t available tomorrow—she’s up in Charleston for her mother’s birthday. You said the show was to go on, so...I guess they’re trying to come up with someone to fill in or rewrite or whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That doesn’t sound like a problem,” Malachi said. “They have Abby. She’s a wench at heart, the best wench ever, I’d think. She’s related to Blue Anderson. His descendent, I should say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was my great-great-great-whatever uncle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still, the whole swashbuckling thing is in the genes,” Malachi said. “It sounds like great fun. I’d love to get in on it, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lad, I’m betting they’d welcome you!” Bootsie assured him. “There’s nothing like playing pirate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye-aye!” Aldous said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not when you have to do it every day and make drinks in costume and wash these bleached cotton shirts all the time!” Sullivan chimed in. He’d finished preparing a tray of drinks for one of the waitresses but was listening to them and now walked down on his side of the bar to join them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t really mind, do you?” Abby asked him. “The pirate and wench outfits here have become tradition. Maybe I could spruce them up, though. We haven’t changed in while. Maybe get you a nice new frock coat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan laughed, running his fingers through his red hair. “It’s not so bad, Abby. I’m just bitching. Well, we could spruce up some of them. I’m not sure I want a frock coat. It can be hot as hell in Savannah.” He looked at Abby anxiously. “Were you planning to make a lot of changes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “No, Sullivan. I love the Dragonslayer, and Gus handled it brilliantly by leaving things alone. I won’t be here all the time, anyway. And Macy and Grant do a great job. But I’ll okay new uniforms if we can improve on tradition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan seemed pleased. “Cool. I love my job here. And I agree that the costumes add to the ambience. One day, I’ll save enough to buy my own place. Oh, I’m not going to compete with you—it won’t be pirate-themed! Maybe I’ll go with a high-Victorian type of place. And it won’t be for years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby couldn’t help laughing at his conciliatory tone. “Savannah abounds with fine places and the Dragonslayer is only one of them. When you open your own place, Sullivan, we’ll all celebrate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” he said. “I’ll make my bartenders dress to the nines! I know—I’ll have them look like the butler in Downton Abbey. Grant will love it—whoops, don’t worry. I won’t steal him away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not worried,” Abby shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might want to worry about Rog over there, Abby,” Bootsie murmured. “He’s down in the dumps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep, he’s broken up about that girl,” Sullivan said. “I don’t blame him. She seemed to be nice. He was so pleased and proud to introduce her around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go talk to him.” Abby slid off her bar stool. She walked over to the tables in the dining room with the Blue Anderson statue by the grate. Roger and Paul Westermark were there. She wasn’t sure what they were talking about because they glanced up at her approach and grew silent. Paul quickly stood and gave her a hug. Roger did so more slowly. He looked at her anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet, Roger. But the police are following new leads.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“New leads?” he asked. “Like what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re inspecting the rowboat we found last night. They’re still combing the river and the ships and boats. They will find her, Roger. You have to have faith and...and keep living your life,” Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Abby just lost her grandfather,” Paul reminded him. “One of the greatest old guys on earth. And she’s doing things. She’s not sitting around moping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s hardly the same thing!” Roger waved a hand in the air. “Besides, Abby wanted to be a cop. Or an agent. She’s good at this. I’m not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nobody’s good at worrying about someone they care about, Roger. It’s a terrifying situation,” Abby told him. “But you do have to keep on with your life while we’re searching.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, yeah, are we doing the street show tomorrow?” Paul asked. “We did it every Saturday until...well, until Gus died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gus would want it go on, of course. Yes—and I’ll be your Missy Tweed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul sat back, grinning at her. “Wow. I was afraid you’d come back here thinking you were above such things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, this is my heritage we’re talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You remember the lines and everything, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More or less. It’s half ad-lib, anyway,” Abby said, rolling her eyes. “It was never my favorite role. Missy Tweed just screams a lot and gets tossed from man to man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The crowds love Missy Tweed. Look at me—I get to play Scurvy Pete. I’ve had people throw stuff at me,” Paul said. “And I had such high Shakespearean hopes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby smiled at that. “Paul, you act beautifully and you always seem to have work, here or in commercials or with your singing. I heard you’re going to start recording.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I’m planning on getting into a studio. A producer showed up at one of my performances in the Irish bar. He’s going to finance it for me. I’m pretty happy with that,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I used to be happy,” Roger moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s had a few beers,” Paul told Abby in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you eat anything?” Abby asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Mom, I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, I’ll get into the wench costume and we’ll do our pirate act,” Abby said. “We’ll make Gus proud, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bet, Abby. You bet.” Paul nodded vigorously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, Abby, of course. I’m sorry,” Roger said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be sorry, just be strong,” she told him. She gave them both a slightly grim smile and returned to the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings here had changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAldous and Malachi were gone; Will Chan had come in with Dirk Johansen and they were now seated next to Bootsie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did Aldous and Malachi go?” Abby asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Aldous has some business to check on. Malachi...I don’t know. I think he was going upstairs. Or maybe he went outside. I’m not sure,” Bootsie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did everything go today?” Abby looked past Dirk to Will Chan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChan’s features gave away nothing of his thoughts; his smile and mannerisms were consistently pleasant. “I’m having a great time as a pirate,” he said. “And the ship sails on as always, right, Dirk?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-alive-krewe-of-hunters-10/page-42.html","bookId":2284,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:48:37 PM"}
