You know. Like a band,\" I explain, sensing from her expression that I\u0027m saying totally the wrong things. \"Oh, I forgot. I did see U2.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How were they?\" she asks. \"I liked the new CD a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were great, just totally great. Just totally...\" I pause, unsure of what to say. Bethany raises her eyebrows quizzically, wanting to know more. \"Just totally... Irish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard they\u0027re quite good live,\" she says, and her own voice has a light, musical lilt to it. \"Who else do you like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh you know,\" I say, completely stuck. \"The Kingsmen. \u0027Louie, Louie.\u0027 That sort of stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gosh, Patrick,\" she says, looking at every part of my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I panic, immediately touching my hair. \"Too much mousse? You don\u0027t like the Kingsmen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She laughs. \"I just don\u0027t remember you being so tan back at school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a tan then, didn\u0027t I?\" I ask. \"I mean I wasn\u0027t Casper the Ghost or anything, was I?\" I put my elbow on the table and flex my biceps, asking her to squeeze the muscle. After she touches it, reluctantly, I resume my questions. \"Was I really not that tan at Harvard?\" I ask mock-worriedly, but worriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no.\" She laughs. \"You were definitely the George Hamilton of the class of eighty-four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I say, pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter brings our drinks - two bottles of San Pellegrino water. Scene Two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re at Mill... on the water? Taffeta? What is it?\" I ask. Her body, her skin tone, seem firm and rosy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milbank Tweed,\" she says. \"That\u0027s where I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I say, squeezing a lime into my glass. \"That\u0027s just wonderful. Law school really paid off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re at... P \u0026amp; P?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, pauses, wants to say something, debates whether she should, then asks, all in a matter of seconds: \"But doesn\u0027t your family own - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk about this,\" I say, cutting her off. \"But yes, Bethany. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you still work at P \u0026amp; P?\" she asks. Each syllable is spaced so that it bursts, booming sonically, into my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I say, looking furtively around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \" She\u0027s confused. \"Didn\u0027t your father - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course,\" I say, interrupting. \"Have you had the focaccia at Pooncakes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t want to talk about...\" I stop. \"About work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I hate it,\" I say. \"Now listen, have you tried Pooncakes yet? I think Miller underrated it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick,\" she says slowly. \"If you\u0027re so uptight about work, why don\u0027t you just quit? You don\u0027t have to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\" I say, staring directly at her, \"I... want... to... fit... in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long pause, she smiles. \"I see.\" There\u0027s another pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one I break. \"Just look at it as, well, a new approach to business,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\" - she stalls - \"sensible.\" She stalls again. \"How, um, practical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunch is alternately a burden, a puzzle that needs to be solved, an obstacle, and then it floats effortlessly into the realm of relief and I\u0027m able to give a skillful performance - my overriding intelligence tunes in and lets me know that it can sense how much she wants me, but I hold back, uncommitted. She\u0027s also holding back, but flirting nonetheless. She has made a promise by asking me to lunch and I panic, once the squid is served, certain that I will never recover unless it\u0027s fulfilled. Other men notice her as they pass by our table. Sometimes I coolly bring my voice down to a whisper. I\u0027m hearing things - noise, mysterious sounds, inside my head; her mouth opens, closes, swallows liquid, smiles, takes me in like a magnet covered with lipstick, mentions something involving fax machines, twice. I finally order a J\u0026amp;B on the rocks, then a cognac. She has mint-coconut sorbet. I touch, hold her hand across the table, more than a friend. Sun pours into Vanities, the restaurant empties out, it nears three. She orders a glass of chardonnay, then another, then the check. She has relaxed but something happens. My heartbeat rises and falls, momentarily stabilizes. I listen carefully. Possibilities once imagined plummet. She lowers her eyes and when she looks back at me I lower mine. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-101.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
