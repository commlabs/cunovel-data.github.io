The ghosts kept looking up fearfully.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we getting close?\" Lyra called to the Lady Salmakia.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Not far now,\" she called down, hovering above them. \"You could see him if you climbed that rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Lyra didn\u0027t want to waste time. She was trying with all her heart to put on a cheerful face for Roger, but every moment in front of her mind\u0027s eye was that terrible image of the little dog-Pan abandoned on the jetty as the mist closed around him, and she could barely keep from howling. She must, though; she must be hopeful for Roger; she always had been.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen they did come face to face, it happened quite suddenly. In among the press of all the ghosts, there he was, his familiar features wan but his expression as full of delight as a ghost could be. He rushed to embrace her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut he passed like cold smoke through her arms, and though she felt his little hand clutch at her heart, it had no strength to hold on. They could never truly touch again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut he could whisper, and his voice said, \"Lyra, I never thought I\u0027d ever see you again, I thought even if you did come down here when you was dead, you\u0027d be much older, you\u0027d be a grownup, and you wouldn\u0027t want to speak to me...”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why ever not?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I done the wrong thing when Pan got my daemon away from Lord Asriel\u0027s! We should\u0027ve run, we shouldn\u0027t have tried to fight her! We should\u0027ve run to you! Then she wouldn\u0027t have been able to get my daemon again, and when the cliff fell away, my daemon would\u0027ve still been with me!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But that weren\u0027t your fault, stupid!\" Lyra said. \"It was me that brung you there in the first place, and I should\u0027ve let you go back with the other kids and the gyptians. It was my fault. I\u0027m so sorry, Roger, honest, it was my fault, you wouldn\u0027t\u0027ve been here otherwise...\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said, \"I dunno. Maybe I would\u0027ve got dead some other way. But it weren\u0027t your fault, Lyra, see.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe felt herself beginning to believe it; but all the same, it was heartrending to see the poor little cold thing, so close and yet so out of reach. She tried to grasp his wrist, though her fingers closed in the empty air; but he understood and sat down beside her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe other ghosts withdrew a little, leaving them alone, and Will moved apart, too, to sit down and nurse his hand. It was bleeding again, and while Tialys flew fiercely at the ghosts to force them away, Salmakia helped Will tend to the wound.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Lyra and Roger were oblivious to that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And you en\u0027t dead,\" he said. \"How\u0027d you come here if you\u0027re still alive? And where\u0027s Pan?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Roger, I had to leave him on the shore, it was the worst thing I ever had to do, it hurt so much, you know how it hurts, and he just stood there, just looking, oh, I felt like a murderer, Roger, but I had to, or else I couldn\u0027t have come!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I been pretending to talk to you all the time since I died,\" he said. \"I been wishing I could, and wishing so hard...Just wishing I could get out, me and all the other dead \u0027uns, \u0027cause this is a terrible place, Lyra, it\u0027s hopeless, there\u0027s no change when you\u0027re dead, and them bird-things... You know what they do? They wait till you\u0027re resting, you can\u0027t never sleep properly, you just sort of doze, and they come up quiet beside you and they whisper all the bad things you ever did when you was alive, so you can\u0027t forget \u0027em. They know all the worst things about you. They know how to make you feel horrible, just thinking of all the stupid things and bad things you ever did. And all the greedy and unkind thoughts you ever had, they know \u0027em all, and they shame you up and they make you feel sick with yourself... But you can\u0027t get away from \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" she said, \"listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDropping her voice and leaning closer to the little ghost, just as she used to do when they were planning mischief at Jordan, : she went on:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You probably don\u0027t know, but the witches, you remember Serafina Pekkala, the witches\u0027ve got a prophecy about me. They don\u0027t know I know, no one does. I never spoke to anyone about it before. But when I was in Trollesund, and Farder Coram the gyptian took me to see the Witches\u0027 Consul, Dr. Lanselius, he gave me like a kind of a test. He said I had to go outside and pick out the right piece of cloud-pine out of all the others to show I could really read the alethiometer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I done that, and then I came in quickly, because it was cold and it only took a second, it was easy. The Consul was talking to Farder Coram, and they didn\u0027t know I could hear \u0027em. He said the witches had this prophecy about me, I was going to do something great and important, and it was going to be in another world...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Only I never spoke of it, and I reckon I must have even forgot it, there was so much else going on. So it sort of sunk out of my mind. I never even talked about it with Pan, \u0027cause he would have laughed, I reckon.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But then later on Mrs. Coulter caught me and I was in a trance, and I\u0026nbsp; was dreaming and I dreamed of that, and\u0026nbsp; I dreamed of you. And I remembered the gyptian boat mother, Ma Costa, you remember, it was their boat we got on board of, in Jericho, with Simon and Hugh and them...”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! And we nearly sailed it to Abingdon! That was the best thing we ever done, Lyra! I won\u0027t never forget that, even if I\u0027m down here dead for a thousand years...”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but listen, when I ran away from Mrs. Coulter the first time, right, I found the gyptians again and they looked after me and... Oh, Roger, there\u0027s so much I found out, you\u0027d be amazed, but this is the important thing: Ma Costa said to me, she said I\u0027d got witch-oil in my soul, she said the gyptians were water people but I was a fire person.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And what I think that means is she was sort of preparing me for the witch-prophecy. I know I got something important to do, and Dr. Lanselius the Consul said it was vital I never found out what my destiny was till it happened, see, I must never ask about it... So I never did. I never even thought what it might be. I never asked the alethiometer, even.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But now I think I know. And finding you again is just a sort of proof. What I got to do, Roger, what my destiny is, is I got to help all the ghosts out of the land of the dead forever. Me and Will, we got to rescue you all. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s that. It must be. And because Lord Asriel, because of something my father said... \u0027Death is going to die,\u0027 he said. I dunno what\u0027ll happen, though. You mustn\u0027t tell \u0027em yet, promise. I mean you might not last up there. But...”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe was desperate to speak, so she stopped.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just what I wanted to tell you!\" he said. \"I told \u0027em, all the other dead \u0027uns, I told them you\u0027d come! Just like you came and rescued the kids from Bolvangar! I says, Lyra\u0027ll do it, it anyone can. They wished it\u0027d be true, they wanted to believe me, but they never really did, I could tell.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"For one thing,\" he went on, \"every kid that\u0027s ever come here, every single one, starts by saying, \u0027I bet my dad\u0027ll come and get me,\u0027 or \u0027I bet my mum, as soon as she knows where I am, she\u0027ll fetch me home again. If it en\u0027t their dad or mum, it\u0027s their friends, or their grandpa, but someone\u0027s going to come and rescue \u0027em. Only they never do. So no one believed me when I told \u0027em you\u0027d come. Only I was right!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" she said, \"well, I couldn\u0027t have done it without Will. That\u0027s Will over there, and that\u0027s the Chevalier Tialys and the Lady Salmakia. There\u0027s so much to tell you, Roger...\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Will? Where\u0027s he come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLyra began to explain, quite unaware of how her voice changed, how she sat up straighter, and how even her eyes looked different when she told the story of her meeting with Will and the fight for the subtle knife. How could she have known? But Roger noticed, with the sad, voiceless envy of the unchanging dead.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Will and the Gallivespians were a little way off, talking quietly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do, you and the girl?\" said Tialys.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Open this world and let the ghosts out. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve got the knife for.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe had never seen such astonishment on any faces, let alone those of people whose good opinion he valued. He\u0027d acquired a great respect for these two. They sat silent for a few moments, and then Tialys said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"This will undo everything. It\u0027s the greatest blow you could strike. The Authority will be powerless after this.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How would they ever suspect it?\" said the Lady. \"It\u0027ll come at them out of nowhere!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And what then?\" Tialys asked Will.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What then? Well, then we\u0027ll have to get out ourselves, and find our daemons, I suppose. Don\u0027t think of then. It\u0027s enough to think of now. I haven\u0027t said anything to the ghosts, in case…, in case it doesn\u0027t work. So don\u0027t you say anything, either. Now I\u0027m going to find a world I can open, and those harpies are watching. So if you want to help, you can go and distract them while I do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eInstantly the Gallivespians urged their dragonflies up into the murk overhead, where the harpies were as thick as blowflies. Will watched the great insects charging fearlessly up at them, for all the world as if the harpies were flies and they could snap them up in their jaws, big as they were. He thought how much the brilliant creatures would love it when the sky was open and they could skim about over bright water again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen he took up the knife. And instantly there came back the words the harpies had thrown at him, taunts about his mother, and he stopped. He put the knife down, trying to clear his mind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe tried again, with the same result. He could hear them clamoring above, despite the ferocity of the Gallivespians; there were so many of them that two fliers alone could do little to stop them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, this was what it was going to be like. It wasn\u0027t going to get any easier. So Will let his mind relax and become disengaged, and just sat there with the knife held loosely until he was ready again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis time the knife cut straight into the air, and met rock. He had opened a window in this world into the underground of another. He closed it up and tried again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd the same thing happened, though he knew it was a different world. He\u0027d opened windows before to find himself above the ground of another world, so he shouldn\u0027t have been surprised to find he was underground for a change, but it was disconcerting.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNext time he felt carefully in the way he\u0027d learned, letting the tip search for the resonance that revealed a world where the ground was in the same place. But the touch was wrong wherever he felt. There was no world anywhere he could open into; everywhere he touched, it was solid rock.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLyra had sensed that something was wrong, and she jumped up from her close conversation with Roger\u0027s ghost to hurry to Will\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" she said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe told her, and added, \"We\u0027re going to have to move somewhere else before I can find a world we can open into. And those harpies aren\u0027t going to let us. Have you told the ghosts what we were planning?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Only Roger, and I told him to keep it quiet. He\u0027ll do whatever I tell him. Oh, Will, I\u0027m scared, I\u0027m so scared. We might not ever get out. Suppose we get stuck here forever?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The knife can cut through rock. If we need to, we\u0027ll just cut a tunnel. It\u0027ll take a long time, and I hope we won\u0027t have to, but we could. Don\u0027t worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You\u0027re right. Course we could.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut she thought he looked so ill, with his face drawn in pain and with dark rings around his eyes, and his hand was shaking, and his fingers were bleeding again; he looked as sick as she felt. They couldn\u0027t go on much longer without their daemons. She felt her own ghost quail in her body, and hugged her arms tightly, aching for Pan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the ghosts were pressing close, poor things, and the children especially couldn\u0027t leave Lyra alone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" said one girl, \"you won\u0027t forget us when you go back, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Lyra, \"never.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll tell them about us?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise. What\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut the poor girl was embarrassed and ashamed: she\u0027d forgotten. She turned away, hiding her face, and a boy said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s better to forget, I reckon. I\u0027ve forgotten mine. Some en\u0027t been here long, and they still know who they are. There\u0027s some kids been here thousands of years. They\u0027re no older than us, and they\u0027ve forgotten a whole lot. Except the sunshine. No one forgets that. And the wind.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said another, \"tell us about that!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd more and more of them clamored for Lyra to tell them about the things they remembered, the sun and the wind and the sky, and the things they\u0027d forgotten, such as how to play; and she turned to Will and whispered, \"What should I do, Will?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m scared. After what happened back there, the harpies...”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them the truth. We\u0027ll keep the harpies off.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him doubtfully. In fact, she felt sick with apprehension. She turned back to the ghosts, who were thronging closer and closer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Please!\" they were whispering. \"You\u0027ve just come from the world! Tell us, tell us! Tell us about the world!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere was a tree not far away, just a dead trunk with its bone white branches thrusting into the chilly gray air, and because Lyra was feeling weak, and because she didn\u0027t think she could walk and talk at the same time, she made for that so as to have somewhere to sit. The crowd of ghosts jostled and shuffled aside to make room.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen she and Will were nearly at the tree, Tialys landed on Will\u0027s hand and indicated that he should bend his head to listen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re coming back,\" he said quietly, \"those harpies. More and more of them. Have your knife ready. The Lady and I will hold them off as long as we can, hut you might need to fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWithout worrying Lyra, Will loosened the knife in its sheath and kept his hand close to it. Tialys took off again, and then Lyra reached the tree and sat down on one of the thick roots.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo many dead figures clustered around, pressing hopefully, wide-eyed, that Will had to make them keep back and leave room; but he let Roger stay close, because he was gazing at Lyra, listening with a passion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd Lyra began to talk about the world she knew.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe told them the story of how she and Roger had climbed over Jordan College roof and found the rook with the broken leg, and how they had looked after it until it was ready to fly again; and how they had explored the wine cellars, all thick with dust and cobwebs, and drunk some canary, or it might have been Tokay, she couldn\u0027t tell, and how drunk they had been. And Roger\u0027s ghost listened, proud and desperate, nodding and whispering, \"Yes, yes! That\u0027s just what happened, that\u0027s true all right!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen she told them all about the great battle between the Oxford townies and the clayburners.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFirst she described the claybeds, making sure she got in everything she could remember, the wide ocher-colored washing pits, the dragline, the kilns like great brick beehives. She told them about the willow trees along the river\u0027s edge, with their leaves all silvery underneath; and she told how when the sun shone for more than a couple of days, the clay began to split up into great handsome plates, with deep cracks between, and how it felt to squish your fingers into the cracks and slowly lever up a dried plate of mud, trying to keep it as big as you could without breaking it. Underneath it was still wet, ideal for throwing at people.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd she described the smells around the place, the smoke from the kilns, the rotten-leaf-mold smell of the river when the wind was in the southwest, the warm smell of the baking potatoes the clayburners used to eat; and the sound of the water slipping slickly over the sluices and into the washing pits; and the slow, thick suck as you tried to pull your foot out of the ground; and the heavy, wet slap of the gate paddles in the clay-thick water.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs she spoke, playing on all their senses, the ghosts crowded closer, feeding on her words, remembering the time when they had flesh and skin and nerves and senses, and willing her never to stop.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen she told how the clayburners\u0027 children always made war on the townies, but how they were slow and dull, with clay in their brains, and how the townies were as sharp and quick as sparrows by contrast; and how one day all the townies had swallowed their differences and plotted and planned and attacked the claybeds from three sides, pinning the clayburners\u0027 children back against the river, hurling handfuls and handfuls of heavy, claggy clay at one another, rushing their muddy castle and tearing it down, turning the fortifications into missiles until the air and the ground and the water were all mixed inextricably together, and every child looked exactly the same, mud from scalp to sole, and none of them had had a better day in all their lives.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen she\u0027d finished, she looked at Will, exhausted. Then she had a shock.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs well as the ghosts, silent all around, and her companions, close and living, there was another audience, too: the branches of the tree were clustered with those dark bird forms, their women\u0027s faces gazing down at her, solemn and spellbound.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up in sudden fear, but they didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" she said, desperate, \"you flew at me before, when I tried to tell you something. What\u0027s stopping you now? Go on, tear at me with your claws and make a ghost out of me!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That is the least we shall do,\" said the harpy in the center, who was No-Name herself. \"Listen to me. Thousands of years ago, when the first ghosts came down here, the Authority gave us the power to see the worst in every one, and we have fed on the worst ever since, till our blood is rank with it and our very hearts are sickened.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But still, it was all we had to feed on. It was all we had. And now we learn that you are planning to open a way to the upper world and lead all the ghosts out into the air...”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd her harsh voice was drowned by a million whispers, as every ghost who could hear cried out in joy and hope; but all the harpies screamed and beat their wings until the ghosts fell silent again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" cried No-Name, \"to lead them out! What will we do now? I shall tell you what we will do: from now on, we shall hold nothing back. We shall hurt and defile and tear and rend every ghost that comes through, and we shall send them mad with fear and remorse and self-hatred. This is a wasteland now; we shall make it a hell!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEvery single harpy shrieked and jeered, and many of them flew up off the tree and straight at the ghosts, making them scatter in terror. Lyra clung to Will\u0027s arm and said, \"They\u0027ve given it away now, and we can\u0027t do it. They\u0027ll hate us, they\u0027ll think we betrayed them! We\u0027ve made it worse, not better!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet,\" said Tialys. \"Don\u0027t despair. Call the harpies back and make them listen to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo Will cried out, \"Come back! Come back, every one of you! Come back and listen!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne by one the harpies, their faces eager and hungry and suffused with the lust for misery, turned and flew back to the tree, and the ghosts drifted back as well. The Chevalier left his dragonfly in the care of Salmakia, and his little tense figure, green-clad and dark-haired, leapt to a rock where they could all see him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Harpies,\" he said, \"we can offer you something better than that. Answer my questions truly, and hear what I say, and then judge. When Lyra spoke to you outside the wall, you flew at her. Why did you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Lies!\" the harpies all cried. \"Lies and fantasies!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet when she spoke just now, you all listened, every one of you, and you kept silent and still. Again, why was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it was true,\" said No-Name. \"Because she spoke the truth. Because it was nourishing. Because it was feeding us. Because we couldn\u0027t help it. Because it was true. Because we had no idea that there was anything but wickedness. Because it brought us news of the world and the sun and the wind and the rain. Because it was true.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Then,\" said Tialys, \"let\u0027s make a bargain with you. Instead of seeing only the wickedness and cruelty and greed of the ghosts that come down here, from now on you will have the right to ask all the ghosts to tell you the stories of their lives, and they will have to tell the truth about what they\u0027ve seen and touched and heard and loved and known in the world. Every one of these ghosts has a story; every single one that comes down in the future will have true things to tell you about the world. And you\u0027ll have the right to hear them, and they will have to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLyra marveled at the nerve of the little spy. How did he dare speak to these creatures as if he had the power to give them rights? Any one of them could have snapped him up in a moment, wrenched him apart in her claws or carried him high and then hurled him down to the ground to smash in pieces. And yet there he stood, proud and fearless, making a bargain with them! And they listened, and conferred, their faces turning to one another, their voices low.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll the ghosts watched, fearful and silent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen No-Name turned back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not enough,\" she said. \"We want more than that. We had a task under the old dispensation. We had a place and a duty. We fulfilled the Authority\u0027s commands diligently, and for that we were honored. Hated and feared, hut honored, too. What will happen to our honor now? Why should the ghosts take any notice of us, if they can simply walk out into the world again? We have our pride, and you should not let that be dispensed with. We need an honorable place! We need a duty and a task to do, one that will bring us the respect we deserve!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey shifted on the branches, muttering and raising their wings. But a moment later Salmakia leapt up to join the Chevalier, and called out:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You are quite right. Everyone should have a task to do that\u0027s important, one that brings them honor, one they can perform with pride. So here is your task, and it\u0027s one that only you can do, because you are the guardians and the keepers of this place. Your task will be to guide the ghosts from the landing place by the lake all the way through the land of the dead to the new opening out into the world. In exchange, they will tell you their stories as a fair and just payment for this guidance. Does that seem right to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo-Name looked at her sisters, and they nodded. She said: \"And we have the right to refuse to guide them if they lie, or if they hold anything back, or if they have nothing to tell us. If they live in the world, they should see and touch and hear and learn things. We shall make an exception for infants who have not had time to learn anything, but otherwise, if they come down here bringing nothing, we shall not guide them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That is fair,\" said Salmakia, and the other travelers agreed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo they made a treaty. And in exchange for the story of Lyra\u0027s that they\u0027d already heard, the harpies offered to take the travelers and their knife to a part of the land of the dead where the upper world was close. It was a long way off, through tunnels and caves, hut they would guide them faithfully, and all the ghosts could follow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut before they could begin, a voice cried out, as loudly as a whisper could cry. It was the ghost of a thin man with an angry, passionate face, and he cried:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What will happen? When we leave the world of the dead, will we live again? Or will we vanish as our daemons did? Brothers, sisters, we shouldn\u0027t follow this child anywhere till we know what\u0027s going to happen to us!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOthers took up the question: \"Yes, tell us where we\u0027re going! Tell us what to expect! We won\u0027t go unless we know what\u0027ll happen to us!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLyra turned to Will in despair, but he said, \"Tell them the truth. Ask the alethiometer, and tell them what it says.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe took out the golden instrument. The answer came at once. She put it away and stood up.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"This is what\u0027ll happen,\" she said, \"and it\u0027s true, perfectly true. When you go out of here, all the particles that make you up will loosen and float apart, just like your daemons did. If you\u0027ve seen people dying, you know what that looks like. But your daemons en\u0027t just nothing now; they\u0027re part of everything. All the atoms that were them, they\u0027ve gone into the air and the wind and the trees and the earth and all the living things. They\u0027ll never vanish. They\u0027re just part of everything. And that\u0027s exactly what\u0027ll happen to you, I swear to you, I promise on my honor. You\u0027ll drift apart, it\u0027s true, but you\u0027ll be out in the open, part of everything alive again.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo one spoke. Those who had seen how daemons dissolved were remembering it, and those who hadn\u0027t were imagining it, and no one spoke until a young woman came forward. She had died as a martyr centuries before. She looked around and said to the other ghosts:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"When we were alive, they told us that when we died we\u0027d go to Heaven. And they said that Heaven was a place of joy and glory and we would spend eternity in the company of saints and angels praising the Almighty, in a state of bliss. That\u0027s what they said. And that\u0027s what led some of us to give our lives, and others to spend years in solitary prayer, while all the joy of life was going to waste around us and we never knew.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the land of the dead isn\u0027t a place of reward or a place of punishment. It\u0027s a place of nothing. The good come here as well as the wicked, and all of us languish in this gloom forever, with no hope of freedom, or joy, or sleep, or rest, or peace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But now this child has come offering us a way out and I\u0027m going to follow her. Even if it means oblivion, friends, I\u0027ll welcome it, because it won\u0027t be nothing. We\u0027ll be alive again in a thousand blades of grass, and a million leaves; we\u0027ll be falling in the raindrops and blowing in the fresh breeze; we\u0027ll be glittering in the dew under the stars and the moon out there in the physical world, which is our true home and always was.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"So I urge you: come with the child out to the sky!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut her ghost was thrust aside by the ghost of a man who looked like a monk: thin and pale, with dark, zealous eyes even in his death. He crossed himself and murmured a prayer, and then he said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a bitter message, a sad and cruel joke. Can\u0027t you see the truth? This is not a child. This is an agent of the Evil One himself! The world we lived in was a vale of corruption and tears. Nothing there could satisfy us. But the Almighty has granted us this blessed place for all eternity, this paradise, which to the fallen soul seems bleak and barren, but which the eyes of faith see as it is, overflowing with milk and honey and resounding with the sweet hymns of the angels. This is Heaven, truly! What this evil girl promises is nothing but lies. She wants to lead you to Hell! Go with her at your peril. My companions and I of the true faith will remain here in our blessed paradise, and spend eternity singing the praises of the Almighty, who has given us the judgment to tell the false from the true.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnce again he crossed himself, and then he and his companions turned away in horror and loathing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLyra felt bewildered. Was she wrong? Was she making some great mistake? She looked around: gloom and desolation on every side. But she\u0027d been wrong before about the appearance of things, trusting Mrs. Coulter because of her beautiful smile and her sweet-scented glamour. It was so easy to get things wrong; and without her daemon to guide her, maybe she was wrong about this, too.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Will was shaking her arm. Then he put his hands to her face and held it roughly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You know that\u0027s not true,\" he said, \"just as well as you can feel this. Take no notice! They can all see he\u0027s lying, too. And they\u0027re depending on us. Come on, let\u0027s make a start.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. She had to trust her body and the truth of what her senses told her; she knew Pan would have.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo they set off, and the numberless millions of ghosts began to follow them. Behind them, too far back for the children to see, other inhabitants of the world of the dead had heard what was happening and were coming to join the great march. Tialys and Salmakia flew back to look and were overjoyed to see their own people there, and every other kind of conscious being who had ever been punished by the Authority with exile and death. Among them were beings who didn\u0027t look human at all, beings like the mulefa, whom Mary Malone would have recognized, and stranger ghosts as well.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Will and Lyra had no strength to look back; all they could do was move on after the harpies, and hope.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Have we almost done it, Will?\" Lyra whispered. \"Is it nearly over?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t tell. But they were so weak and sick that he said, \"Yes, it\u0027s nearly over, we\u0027ve nearly done it. We\u0027ll be out soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/9/172.html","bookId":392,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:10:06 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:10:06 AM"}
