This was not Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no red-light district with disreputable flophouses whose proprietors asked few questions, and flick did not know of a convent where the nuns would hide anyone who begged for sanctuary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no dark alleys in which down-and-outs slept behind rubbish bins ignored by the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick knew of three possible hideouts: Michel\u0027s town house, Gilberte\u0027s apartment, and Mademoiselle Lemas\u0027s house in the rue du Bois.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, any of them might be under surveillance, depending on how deeply the Gestapo had penetrated the Bollinger circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Dieter Franck was in charge of the investigation, she had to fear the worst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing to do but go and look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must split up into pairs again,\" she told the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four women together is too conspicuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby and I will go first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta and Jelly, follow a hundred meters behind us.\" They walked to Michel\u0027s place, not far from the station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was flick\u0027s marital home, but she always thought of it as his house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was plenty of room for four women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Gestapo almost certainly knew of the place: it would be astonishing if none of the men taken captive last Sunday had revealed the address under torture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was in a busy street with several shops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking along the pavement, Flick surreptitiously looked into each parked car while Ruby checked the houses and shops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel\u0027s property was a high, narrow building in an elegant eighteenth-century row.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had a small front yard with a magnolia tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was still and quiet, with no movement at the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorstep was dusty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn their first pass along the street, they saw nothing suspicious: no workmen digging up the road, no watchful loiterers at the pavement tables outside the bar, Chez Regis, no one leaning on a telegraph pole reading a newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey returned on the opposite side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the baker\u0027s shop was a black CitroensTraction Avant with two men in suits sitting in the front, smoking cigarettes and looking bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick tensed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing her dark wig, so she felt sure they would not recognize her as the girl on the Wanted poster, but all the same her pulse beat faster and she hurried past them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll along the pavement she listened for a shout behind her, but it did not come, and at last she turned the corner and breathed easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slowed her pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fears had been justified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel\u0027s house was no use to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did not have a rear entrance, being part of a row with no back alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jackdaws could not enter without being seen by the Gestapo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe considered the other two possibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel was presumably still living at Gilberte\u0027s apartment, unless he had been captured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building had a useful back entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was a tiny place, and four overnight guests at a one-room apartment would not only be uncomfortable but also might be noticed by other people in the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe obvious place for them to spend the night was the house in the rue du Bois.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick had been there twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a big house with lots of bedrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMademoiselle Lemas was completely trustworthy and was more than willing to feed unexpected guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been sheltering British agents, downed airmen, and escaping prisoners of war for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she might know what had happened to Brian Standish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a mile or two from the center of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four women set out to walk there, still in pairs a hundred meters apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey arrived half an hour later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rue du Bois was a quiet suburban street: a surveillance team would have trouble concealing themselves here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one parked car within sight, an impeccably upright Peugeot 201 that was much too slow for the Gestapo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick and Ruby took a preliminary walk past Mademoiselle Lemas\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked the same as always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer Simca Cinq stood in the courtyard, which was unusual only in that she normally parked it in the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick slowed her pace and surreptitiously looked in at the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw no one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMademoiselle Lemas used that room only rarely: it was an old-fashioned front parlor, the piano immaculately dusted, the cushions always plumped, the door kept firmly closed except for formal visits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer secret guests always sat in the kitchen at the back of the house, where there was no chance they would be seen by passersby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Flick passed the door, her eye was caught by something on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a wooden toothbrush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout pausing in her stride, she stooped and picked it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby said, \"Do you need to clean your teeth?\" \"This looks like Paul\u0027s.\" She almost thought it was Paul\u0027s, although there must be hundreds like it in France, maybe thousands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think he might be here?\" \"Maybe.\" \"Why would he have come?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo warn us of danger, perhaps.\" They walked on around the block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore approaching the house again, she let Greta and Jelly catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This time we\u0027ll go together,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greta and Jelly, knock on the front door.\" Jelly said, \"Thank gordon, my feet are killing me.\" \"Ruby and I will go around to the back, just as a precaution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t say anything about us, just wait for us to appear.\" They walked along the street again, all together this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick and Ruby went into the courtyard and past the Simca Cinq and crept around to the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen ran almost the whole width of the house at the rear, with two windows and a door between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick waited until she heard the metallic ring of the doorbell; then she risked a peep through a window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were three people in the kitchen: two men in uniform, and a tall woman with luxuriant red hair who was definitely not the middle-aged Mademoiselle Lemas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a frozen fraction of a second, Flick noted that all three were looking away from the windows, reflexively turning in the direction of the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she ducked down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men were obviously Gestapo officers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman must be a French traitor, posing as Mademoiselle Lemas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had looked vaguely familiar, even from the back: there was something about the stylish drape of her green summer dress that struck a chord in Flick\u0027s memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dismayingly clear to Flick that the safe house had been betrayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was now a trap for Allied agents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Brian Standish must have fallen straight into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick wondered whether he was still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA feeling of cold determination came over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew her pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three people,\" she told Ruby in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two men and a woman.\" She took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to be ruthless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to kill the men,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay?\" Ruby nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick thanked heaven for Ruby\u0027s cool head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d prefer to keep the woman alive for questioning, but we\u0027ll shoot her if she seems likely to escape.\" \"Got it.\" \"The men are at the left-hand end of the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman will probably go to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou take this window, I\u0027ll take the far one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAim at the man nearest to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoot when I shoot.\" She crept across the width of the house and crouched under the other window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer breath was coming fast and her heart was beating like a steam hammer, but she was thinking as clearly as if she were playing chess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no experience of firing through glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to shoot three times in rapid succession: once to shatter the window, a second time to kill her man, and a third time to be sure of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thumbed the safety catch on her pistol and held it pointing to the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she straightened up and looked in through the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men were standing facing the door to the hail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth had pistols drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick leveled her gun at the one nearest her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman had gone, but as Flick looked she returned, holding the kitchen door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta and Jelly walked in ahead of her, all unsuspecting; then they saw the Gestapo men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta gave a small scream of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was said-Flick could not hear what-then Greta and Jelly raised their hands in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fake Mademoiselle Lemas walked into the kitchen behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing her full-face, Flick felt a shock of recognition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had seen her before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn instant later she remembered where.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman had been in the square at Sainte-Cecile last Sunday with Dieter Franck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick had thought she was the officer\u0027s mistress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously she was something more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later the woman saw Flick\u0027s face at the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth dropped open, her eyes widened, and she lifted her hand to point at what she had seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men began to turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bang of the gun seemed simultaneous with the crash of breaking glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding the gun level and steady, she fired twice more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second later, Ruby fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick threw open the back door and stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman had already turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was making a dash for the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick raised her gun, but too late: in a split second the woman was in the hail and out of Flick\u0027s line of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jelly, moving surprisingly fast, threw herself through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a crash of falling bodies and breaking furniture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick crossed the kitchen and looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJelly had brought the woman down on the tiled floor of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had also broken the delicate curved legs of a kidney-shaped table, smashed a Chinese vase that had stood on the table, and scattered a spray of dried grasses that had been in the vase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe French woman struggled to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick aimed her pistol but did not fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJelly, showing remarkably quick reactions, grabbed the woman by the hair and banged her head on the tiles until she stopped wriggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman was wearing odd shoes, one black and one brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick turned back and looked at the two Gestapo men on the kitchen floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth lay still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up their guns and pocketed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoose firearms left lying around might be used by the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the moment, the four Jackdaws were safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick was operating on adrenaline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time would come, she knew, when she would think about the man she had killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end of a life was a dreadful moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts solemnity might be postponed but would return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours or days from now, Flick would wonder if the young man in uniform had left behind a wife who was now alone, and children fatherless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for the present, she was able to put that aside and think only of her mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Jelly, keep the woman covered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta, find some string and tie her to a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby, go upstairs and make sure there\u0027s no one else in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll check the basement.\" She ran down the stairs to the cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere on the dirt floor she saw the figure of a man, tied up and gagged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gag covered much of his face, but she could see that half his ear had been shot oft She pulled the gag from his mouth, bent down, and gave him a long, passionate kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome to France.\" He grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best welcome I ever had.\" \"I\u0027ve got your toothbrush.\" \"It was a last-second thing, because I wasn\u0027t perfectly sure of the redhead.\" \"It made me just that little bit more suspicious.\" \"Thank God.\" She took the sharp little knife from its sheath under her lapel and began to cut the cords that bound him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get here?\" \"Parachuted in last night.\" \"What the hell for?\" \"Brian\u0027s radio is definitely being operated by the Gestapo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to warn you.\" She threw her arms around him in a burst of affection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here!\" He hugged and kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case I\u0027m glad I came.\" They went upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look who I found in the cellar,\" Flick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all waiting for instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes had passed since the shooting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe neighbors must have heard gunfire, but few French citizens were quick to call the police nowadays: they were afraid they would end up answering questions at the Gestapo office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, she would not take needless risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to be out of here as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her attention to the fake Mademoiselle Lemas, now tied to a kitchen chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew what had to be done, and her heart sank at the prospect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your name?\" she asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stephanie Vinson.\" \"You\u0027re the mistress of Dieter Franck.\" She was as pale as a sheet but looked defiant, and Flick thought how beautiful she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He saved my life.\" So that was how Franck had won her loyalty, Flick thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made no difference: a traitor was a traitor, whatever the motive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You brought Helicopter to this house to be captured.\" She said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Helicopter alive or dead?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" Flick pointed to Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You brought him here, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou would have helped the Gestapo capture us all.\" The anger sounded in her voice as she thought of the danger to Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie lowered her gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick walked behind the chair and drew her gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re French, yet you collaborated with the Gestapo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might have killed us all.\" The others, seeing what was coming, stood aside, out of the line of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephane could not see the gun, but she sensed what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispered, \"What are you going to do with me?\" Flick said, \"If we leave you here now, you will tell Dieter Franck how many we are, and describe us to him, and help him to capture us so that we can be tortured and killed... won\u0027t you?\" She did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick pointed the gun at the back of Stephanie\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any excuse for helping the enemy?\" \"I did what I had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoesn\u0027t everyone?\" \"Exactly,\" Flick said, and she pulled the trigger twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gun boomed in the confined space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood and something else spurted from the woman\u0027s face and splashed on the skirt of her elegant green dress, and she slumped forward soundlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJelly flinched and Greta turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Paul went white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Ruby remained expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all silent for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Flick said, \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws/page-41.html","bookId":2681,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM"}
