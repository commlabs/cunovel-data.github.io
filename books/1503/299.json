(3)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the corner of the room, Fat Cat popped her head out, staring blankly at Zhou Weiqing in the doorway, a complicated look in her eyes as well as she pawed the couch in front of her with her claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment, Zhou Weiqing finally seemed to snap out of it, abruptly turning around and saying: “Come on Fat Cat, let’s go to the Skill Storing Palace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it was already in the small hours of the morning, Zhou Weiqing could not still his restless heart. Fat Cat started a little, but quickly jumped onto his shoulder and sliding down into her usual spot in his arms. She did not know why, but at that moment, she particularly wanted to feel his warm embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling the warm furry body of Fat Cat in his arms, the empty feeling in Zhou Weiqing’s heart felt a little better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter exiting the inn, the fresh cold air cleared Zhou Weiqing’s mind in a flash. Looking up, he was instantly caught by the breathtaking sight of a sky filled with stars, as if they were winking at him from a close distance, just a hand\u0027s reach away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a huge breath, he held it in until his lungs felt like they were about to explode. Only then did Zhou Weiqing stop, expelling out his troubles in that one long breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe troubled look on his face disappeared, replaced by a resolute edge to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing was only seventeen years old, and yet, at this moment, he had finally truly grown up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his earlier re-uniting with Shangguan Bing’er, was just like his coming of age ceremony, signalling that he was now truly an adult, a man!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Skill Storing Palace on the Heavenly Jewel Island was very close to their inn, and before long Zhou Weiqing had entered it. With the Heavenly Jewel Plaque, he easily gained access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, he had been worried that the Skill Storing Palace might be closed at night, but on reaching his destination, he found that his worries had been unfounded, and that the Skill Storing Palace on the Heavenly Jewel Island was actually open everyday, at all hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Skill Storing Palace here had a slightly different payment system as compared to the others Zhou Weiqing had visited before; when entering, no matter which level of Heavenly Beast one wanted to Skill Store from, every day was a flat fee of fifty thousand gold coins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs compared to the lowest prices in some of the Empires’ Skill Storing Palace of five hundred gold coins, it was more than a hundred times more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, no one would complain of it being too pricey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was because each and every one of the Heavenly Beasts in this Skill Storing Palace was painstakingly chosen, and only the best would be allowed to stay here, each having only the best, strongest or most useful Skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmongst them, there was no lack of Heavenly King or even Heavenly Emperor stage Heavenly Beasts!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for whether there were even higher stage Heavenly God Heavenly Beasts, not many people knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder normal circumstances, entering the Skill Storing Palace, the first thing Zhou Weiqing would have done would be to first Store his two last remaining Skills of the Time Attribute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, the current him was filled with the image of Shangguan Bing’er, and he could not maintain a calm head. In such a state, he had no patience to slowly look for the most suitable Skill for himself. Coming here in the dead of the night, his target was not to go through Skill Storing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the guidance of an employee, Zhou Weiqing entered the depths of the Skill Storing Palace. The size of this place was actually smaller than that of the ZhongTian Empire Skill Storing Palace, but at every passageway there was a Lustre Gem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guide who brought Zhou Weiqing in asked him: “Which Heavenly Beast Attributes are you looking to Skill Store?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing hesitated a moment, before asking solemnly: “Do you all have any Heavenly Beasts with both the Darkness Attribute and Demonic Attribute? Any stage is fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white clad guide looked at him in surprise, saying: “Please hold a moment, I will have to check regarding that request.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, he walked to one of the Lustre Gems at the side and started to search for the required information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, Zhou Weiqing had a reason for choosing a Heavenly Beast with both Darkness and Demonic Attributes. The reason he came here this night was actually to Devour a Heavenly Beast’s Heavenly Energy in order to cultivate faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter seeing Shangguan Bing’er, his thirst for power had grown to new heights, and he wasn’t even willing to waste any time, wanting to grow stronger in the shortest possible time to gain back his Bing’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for why one which had both the Darkness and Demonic Attributes, there was naturally a reason for that as well. After reading through the Demonic Manual, Zhou Weiqing had a much deeper understanding of the intricate profound mysteries of the Devour Skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the records in the Demonic Manual, when using the Devour Skill for the purpose of cultivation and training, the easiest for one to purify and absorb was the Heavenly Energy from Heavenly Beasts with both these attributes. That was because the Devour Skill was after all a Demonic Skill, and the Demonic Attribute was intricately linked to the Darkness Attribute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, having both the Darkness and Demonic Attributes was the hidden foundation that one had to have before they could actually have the Devour Skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, when the Devoured Heavenly Energy consisted of those two attributes, it would have the greatest fit with Zhou Weiqing’s own Heavenly Energy, allowing him to gain a greater proportion after purifying and absorbing, reducing wastage and greatly further increasing his rate of cultivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the fastest speed possible for cultivating!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, a Heavenly Beast having both the Darkness and Demonic Attributes was even rarer than a human with those two attributes. If not for the fact that this was the Heavenly Jewel Island Skill Storing Palace, Zhou Weiqing would not even bother asking about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t take long for the guide to finish his search and return to Zhou Weiqing, saying respectfully: “Sir, I have completed the search. Heavenly Beasts with those two Darkness and Demonic Attributes are extremely rare, and even in our Heavenly Jewel Island Skill Storing Palace, we only have two. One is a Top level Zong Stage Heavenly Beast, the Eight-Eyed Demon Spider, and the other is a Heavenly Emperor Stage Heavenly Beast, the Devil Dragon Girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, in order to Skill Store Heavenly King Beasts and above, one needs to have a certain contribution to our Heavenly Jewel Island, otherwise a barter trade of equivalent exchange is required.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing started: “Additional payment of gold coins isn’t accepted?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guide smiled as he shook his head, saying: “I’m sorry Sir, the value of Heavenly King Beasts and above isn’t measurable by just gold coins alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing his words, Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “I see… so the fifty thousand gold coins here are just for Zong Stage Beasts. In that case, I’ll choose that Eight-Eyed Demon Spider you mentioned earlier then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please follow me.” The guide nodded as he led Zhou Weiqing into the passageway where the Darkness Attribute Heavenly Beasts were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it was late in the night, the rather empty Skill Storing Palace was eerily quiet, and only their footsteps could be heard as they walked down the path led by the guide. As they walked, the guide told Zhou Weiqing: “In order to ensure the Heavenly Beasts are active and in a good environment, although they are given Seals and restrictions, the restrictions are much weaker than compared to other Skill Storing Palaces. The Eight-Eyed Demon Spider is a fierce, violent creature, and you need to be careful when you are going through Skill Storing later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing nodded towards him, saying: “Thanks for your advice, I will take care.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two walked almost a hundred metres through various passageways, twisting and turning before they finally reached a large door, about two metres tall and a metre wide. Clearly, there was a Sealed Heavenly Beast behind this door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the guide stopped right before the door, pausing a second before saying: “Sir, the Eight-Eyed Demon Spider you requested is right behind that door. Please do note that you have one day in order to go through Skill Storing. If you do not come out within a day, you will be charged a second day’s fee even if you do not make full use of the time. After completing your Skill Storing, please return via the route we came by, and do not wander into any of the other Heavenly Beasts’ rooms, lest any harm comes to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, he took out a key and opened the door, before motioning Zhou Weiqing to enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing thanked the guide before entering the room alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room wasn’t large, though it was specially reserved only for the lone Heavenly Beast, and it was only about a dozen or so square metres. As soon as he entered the door, Zhou Weiqing spotted his target easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a huge spider, almost totally lifeless-grey in colour. It’s body was large, almost the size of a big millstone. As compared to ordinary spiders, its eight limbs were not long at all, but its large eight glowing eyes on its back were icy cold, almost terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts entire body was also covered densely with black tattoo lines, almost forming a strange web design on its body. It’s relatively short legs were actually terrifying, with vicious reverse spikes studding it. On a single look, one could easily tell this was a fierce creature designed to be a killing machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the Eight-Eyed Demon Spider indeed. It truly lived up to its name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing drew in a deep breath as soon as he saw the creature. Even someone used to seeing Heavenly Beasts like himself was almost caught by surprise. His earlier excitement cooled down instantly, as he forced himself to calm down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout even looking at the introduction, he understood clearly that if not for the fact that this Heavenly Beast was Sealed, he could not possibly even dream of facing it. In fact, even the entire Fei Li Battle Team together would not be a match for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDual Attributes. Darkness and Demonic. Top Level Zong Stage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was already more than comparable to an ordinary nine-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Zhou Weiqing was busy thinking, the Eight-Eyed Demon Spider decided to try to give him a show down, a scare. Its still, unmoving body abruptly charging forward in a sudden pounce at Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts swift, violent abrupt movement, coupled with the intense killing intent from all its eight eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost subconsciously, Zhou Weiqing flew backwards in retreat, his back striking the door heavily. At the same time, the Eight-Eyed Demon Spider’s body was stopped in mid air, barely a metre from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been stopped by a long thick black chain, which seemed to made of an unknown material, tough and flexible as could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn just that short instant, Zhou Weiqing was startled into cold sweat. The Eight-Eyed Demon Spider looked at him, its eight eyes seeming to mock him as it glared coldly from its position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it, are you asking for death?” Zhou Weiqing growled in a low tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheer violent tyranny of the Eight-Eyed Demon Spider had sparked his own anger and fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had originally already been in a bad mood, and had came here specially to train, and now he had met a creature testing his limits as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muscles of both arms bulged out, growing at a sudden insane speed that the naked eye could follow. Soon after, the usual black tiger tattoos spread across his entire body, and with a savage stomp of his right foot, Zhou Weiqing suddenly charged forward towards the Eight-Eyed Demon Spider’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this powerful Heavenly Beast had not been Sealed, perhaps Zhou Weiqing could only attempt to run if he saw it, and even that would be a minuscule chance of escaping. Yet, now, it was severely restricted by the Darkness Seal on it, and it could barely unleash a fraction of its own power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Zhou Weiqing entered the Demonic Change State, the Eight-Eyed Demon Spider seemed to grow agitated. Seeing him charge forward, it emitted a shrill cry, its legs shrinking in as it lowered its back, revealing layers of scales like an armored covering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, what met its defenses was Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic Right Leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud explosion. The Eight-Eyed Demon Spider’s body was smashed savagely down onto the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-12-chapter-95-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-12-chapter-96-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-12-chapter-95-03","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
