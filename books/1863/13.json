Jez felt herself relax in Morgead\u0027s arms before she knew\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat she was doing. His heart was beating so fast against hers. She felt dizzy, but safe, too; a wonderful\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the approach of his mind was another thing. It was just like the first time: that terrible, irresistible pull\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrying to suck her soul out and mix it with Morgead\u0027s until they were both one person. Until he knew her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eevery secret and she had no place to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the worst thing Was that she knew it wasn\u0027t Morgead doing it. It was that outside force doing it to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboth of them, carrying them along helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether we want it or not. And we don\u0027t want it, Jez told herself desperately. We both hate it. Neither\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof us wants to share our souls....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then why was he still holding her, still kissing her? And why was she letting him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that instant she felt his mind touch hers, reaching through the smoke-screen of protection she\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrown around herself to brush her thoughts as lightly as a moth\u0027s wing. She recognized Morgead\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eessence in it; she could feel his soul, dark and bright and full of fierce emotion for her. He was opening\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehimself to her; not trying to fight this or even holding back. He was going farther than the pull forced him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto, giving himself to her freely....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a gift that sent her reeling. And she couldn\u0027t resist it. Her mind flowed out of its own accord to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etouch his, tendrils of thought wrapping around his gratefully. The shock of pleasure when she let it happen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas frightening-except that she couldn\u0027t be frightened anymore, not now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she felt him respond, felt his happiness, felt his thoughts enfolding hers, holding her mind as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egently as his arms held her body. And white light exploded behind her eyes....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez! Morgead! What\u0027s wrong with you two?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought was foreign, cold, and unwanted. It broke into Jez\u0027s warm little world and rattled around\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eannoyingly. Jez tried to push it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, look; I\u0027m just trying to help. If you guys are alive, then, like give us a sign, okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead made a sound like a mental groan. It\u0027s Vol. I have to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to help, Jez told him. Then something occurred to her. Oh-wait. Where are we... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good question. A weird but necessary question. It took them a moment to untangle their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethoughts from each other and rise back to the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere they seemed to be sitting under the ruins of a redbud tree, arms around each other, Jez\u0027s head on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead\u0027s shoulder, Morgead\u0027s face pressed into Jez\u0027s hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least we weren\u0027t still kissing, Jez thought abstractedly. She could feel herself flushing scarlet. The rest\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof the gang was standing around them, looking down with worried expressions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you guys want?\" Morgead said brusquely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we want?\" Raven leaned forward, dark hair swinging. Jez actually saw both her midnight blue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes underneath. \"You three jumped off the roof just as the fire got out of control. We put it out and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecame down to see if you were still alive- and then we find you here hanging on to each other and totally\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout of it. And you want to know what we want? We want to know if you\u0027re okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re fine,\" Morgead said. He didn\u0027t say anything more, and Jez understood. Neither of them had any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edesire to talk about it in front of other people. That could wait until they were alone, until it was the right\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t need to express this to each other. Jez simply knew, and knew that he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about her?\" Thistle pointed to Iona, still asleep on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez was already moving to the child. She checked the little body over, noted the even breathing and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeaceful expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine, too,\" she said, settling back. She held Thistle\u0027s gaze. \"No thanks to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThistle\u0027s cheeks were pink. She looked angry, embarrassed, and defensive. \"She\u0027s just a human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a kid!\" Morgead yelled, shooting up to his feet. He towered over Thistle, who suddenly looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003every small. \"Which you\u0027re not,\" he went on unsym-pathetically. \"You\u0027re just a-a sixteen-year-old Shirley\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemple-wannabe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, both of you!\" Jez said sharply. She waited until they shut up and looked at her before\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econtinuing. \"You-be quiet and let me take care of things,\" she said to Morgead. \"And you-if you ever try\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto hurt a kid again, I\u0027ll knock your head off.\" This to Thistle, who opened her mouth, but then shut it again\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewithout speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez nodded. \"Okay, that\u0027s settled. Now we\u0027ve got to get this girl home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVal stared at her. \"Home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Val.\" Jez picked the child up. \"In case you missed something, she\u0027s not the Wild Power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" Val wriggled his broad shoulders uncomfortably and looked at Morgead. \"You mean you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a first time for everything, right?\" Morgead glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, then-who is the Wild Power?\" Raven put in quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows?\" It was the first time Pierce had spoken, and his voice was low and distantly amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez glanced at him. His blond hair glinted in the red light of the sunset, and his dark eyes were mocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really don\u0027t think I like you much, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut of course he was right \"If this kid isn\u0027t the one-well, I guess it could have been anybody at the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003escene,\" she said slowly. \"Anybody worried enough to want to save her. One of the firefighters, a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneighbor-anybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assuming the blue flash on the tape really was evidence of a Wild Power,\" Pierce said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it was.\" Jez glanced at Morgead. \"It sure looked like blue fire. And it certainly was some kind of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Grandma Harman dreamed about the Wild Power being in San Francisco,\" Morgead added. \u0027It all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efits too well.\" He looked at Jez slyly. \"But it couldn\u0027t have been anybody at the scene, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of what you said about that line in the prophecy. \u0027Born in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027s vision.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means it has to be somebody born less than eighteen years ago. Before that, Aradia couldn\u0027t have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evisions because she wasn\u0027t alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddess, I\u0027m slow today, Jez thought. I should have thought of that. She gave him a wry nod of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erespect and he returned it with a grin. Not maliciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still not much to go on,\" Raven said in her pragmatic way. \"But don\u0027t you think we should go back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einside to discuss it? Somebody\u0027s going to come along eventually and see us with an unconscious kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good point,\" Jez said. \"But I\u0027m not going up with you. I\u0027m taking the kid home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too,\" Morgead said. Jez glanced at him; he had his stubborn expression on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, but just us. Two motorcycles are going to be conspicuous enough.\" She turned to Raven. \"The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erest of you can do what you want tonight; try to figure out who the Wild Power is or whatever. Well\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emeet again tomorrow and see what we\u0027ve come up with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wait?\" Val said. \"It\u0027s only dusk. We could meet tonight-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTm tired,\" Jez cut in. \u0027It\u0027s enough for the day.\" And Goddess knows how I\u0027m going to explain being gone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis long to Aunt Nan, she thought wearily. Not to mention missing school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce was watching her with an odd expression. \"So you\u0027ll have to report to Hunter that we failed,\" he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid, and there was a probing tone in his voice that Jez didn\u0027t like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027ll tell him you screwed up,\" she said heavily. \"But that we still have some options. Unless you\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erather I just tell him that you\u0027re all idiots and not worth giving a second chance.\" She kept looking at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce until he looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she turned to Morgead he was scowling, but he didn\u0027t say anything. He silently started toward\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etheir bikes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey couldn\u0027t talk while they were riding. Jez was too full of her own thoughts anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was finally free to consider those last minutes with Morgead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been... amazing. Electrifying. But also enlightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew now what had happened to them, what was happening. He had been right. It was the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esoul-mate principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we\u0027re soulmates. Morgead and I. After all our fighting and challenging each other and everything. It\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso strange, but in a way it makes sense, too....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0027s really a pity that even if we both survive the next week or so, we\u0027re never going to see each\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought came from some deep part of her that was utterly heartless and practical and saw everything\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the cold light of truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause unfortunately the universe had picked the wrong person for Jez to be soulmates with. It had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epicked one that would hate her and want to kill her once he realized what she really was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBad mistake, universe, Jez thought, biting down on a laugh. She realized, dimly, that she was verging on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeing hysterical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been such a long day, and she was so tired, and so hurt, and she\u0027d failed in her mission, and now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead was in love with her, but there was just no hope. Small wonder she was punchy and an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eemotional wreck. She was lucky not to be railing off her bike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere really was no hope. Even in that last encounter, even when Morgead had been revealing his soul\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto her, Jez had managed to keep her own secrets buried. He didn\u0027t know. He had no idea that the girl he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas in love with was vermin. Was working with Circle Daybreak. Was lying to him to steal the Wild\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower out from under his nose and end the hopes of the vampires for a world without humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was ambitious, she had always known that. All he\u0027d ever cared about was climbing higher and getting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore power. She\u0027d promised him a position in the new world order-while all the time she was working as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehard as she could to make sure that the new world order never came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would never forgive that deception. He would never even be able to understand why she had done\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you have to forget about him, the cold-and-practical part of her mind said quietly. And there was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enothing inside Jez that even tried to argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dark by the time they reached the Marina district. As they approached the housing project, Jez\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaw flashing lights ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolice car lights. Well, that wasn\u0027t unexpected. Iona\u0027s mother would have notified them by now. Jez just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehoped she wasn\u0027t too worried....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdiot! her mind said sarcastically. How worried do you expect her to be, with it getting dark and her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeight-year-old missing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned into an alley and Morgead followed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well have to do a drive-by,\" she said over the thrum of the engines. \"Drop her by the police cars and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen shoot out of there. They\u0027ll probably chase us. Are you up for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"We should go separate ways. That\u0027ll make it harder for them to catch us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. You go on home once you lose them. So will I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t see his features clearly in the dark alley, but she knew he was looking at her. \"So will you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean I\u0027ll go to the place where I\u0027m staying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe expected him to ask about that, try to find out where it was, what she was doing. He didn\u0027t Instead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe said, \"Do you have to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bunked at him, startled. Then she frowned. \"Yes, I have to. I want to. I\u0027m tired, Morgead, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanyway I\u0027m not ready to be spending the night with a guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean that-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez waved a hand. \"I know. I\u0027m sorry. But I\u0027m still tired, and-\" And I\u0027ve got other responsibilities that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou don\u0027t understand. And if I stick around you any longer, while I\u0027m this tired, I\u0027m afraid that you\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing to find out what they are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re still mad,\" he said bleakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTm not mad-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or disgusted or whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was he talking about? Tm just tired,\" she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid firmly. \"Now let\u0027s drop the kid off, and I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-\" He let out his breath violently. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez didn\u0027t waste any more time. She unzipped her jacket, which had been holding Iona firmly against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she sped out into the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne block, two blocks. And now she was right beside the dark and deserted playground, and now she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas almost level with the police cars. There were several officers standing around talking, and several\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother bystanders who might be neighbors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez targeted one of the neighbors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swooped in toward the woman, who was on the outside edge of the sidewalk. She came up fast,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen hit the brakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" she said. \"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman turned around and her jaw dropped. Jez didn\u0027t hesitate, just bundled Iona into her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman grabbed the child\u0027s weight automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give her to her mom, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Jez was roaring out and away. She could hear Morgead behind her, and shouts from the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehousing project. Then a police siren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced back. Morgead was just turning on a side street. He waved once at her, and then he was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espeeding off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez could hear more sirens now. She twisted the throttle and headed for the Bay Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least a pursuit was something she could enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finally shook the police cars tailing her, she turned toward Clayton. She would have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen worried about what her aunt and uncle were going to say if she hadn\u0027t already been too worried\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout Iona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027ll be all right, she told herself. She shouldn\u0027t remember anything, and her mom will take care of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jez couldn\u0027t help but feel guilty... and just plain sad. There was some sort of bond between her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand the child. She felt-responsible for her, and not just because she\u0027d kidnapped and terrorized her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody should have to grow up in that kind of place. I may have run around on the streets when I was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elittle, but at least I had Uncle Bracken, and a nice home to go to if I wanted. Iona-she doesn\u0027t even have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea safe playground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should do something for her, but what can I do that would matter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know; maybe I can visit her sometime. Maybe I can buy her a plant....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere weren\u0027t any easy answers, and she was drawing up to a neat yellow frame house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime, Jez thought, to face the music. Uncle Jim and Aunt Nan and nasty little Claire. She just hoped they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleft enough of her alive so that she could call Hugh afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled her motorcycle into the garage, climbed off, and went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... at all is bad enough, But to do it the day after you make us a promise-well, what are we supposed to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink? How are we supposed to trust you again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez was sitting on the blue floral couch in the living room. The Goddard living room didn\u0027t get used much,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eonly for very formal occasions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was one of them. It was a court martial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there wasn\u0027t really a thing that Jez could say to the humans she lived with. She certainly couldn\u0027t give\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem any excuse that would make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, ditching Claire even though you swore to us that you\u0027d let her drive you to school.\" Aunt Nanami\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas ticking items off on her fingers. \"Second, ditching school after you swore to us you weren\u0027t going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eskip again. Third, going off some place you won\u0027t even tell us about. Fourth, not even calling to let us\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow you were still alive. Fifth, getting home at almost ten o\u0027clock at night-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jim cleared his throat. \"Nan, I think we\u0027ve been over this already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of times, Jez thought. Oh, well, at least Claire is enjoying it. Her cousin was standing at the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eentrance to the living room, openly listening. When she happened to catch Jez\u0027s eye she smiled brilliantly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher small face actually glowing with smug satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Nan was shaking her head. \u0027I just want to make sure she understands, Jim. I thought she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstood last night, but obviously...\" She threw her hands up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the thing is-\" Uncle Jim cleared his throat again and looked at Jez. He looked uncomfortable; he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t very good at discipline, but Jez\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould see that he\u0027d reached his limit. \"The thing is that we can\u0027t just keep yelling at you. We have to do\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething, Jez. So we\u0027ve decided to lock up your motorcycle. You can\u0027t ride it anymore, not until you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elearn to be more responsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez sat stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot her bike. They couldn\u0027t take her bike from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow would she get anywhere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to be mobile. She had to get to Morgead tomorrow-she had to get to Hugh sometime. She had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto be able to track down the Wild Power. And she couldn\u0027t do any of that without transportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she could see from Uncle Jim\u0027s face that he was serious. He\u0027d finally decided to put his foot down,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand Jez had gotten caught underneath it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out her breath. Part of her wanted to yell and storm and rage about this, to lose control and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emake a big noisy fuss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wouldn\u0027t do any good. Besides, she\u0027d managed to keep her temper for almost a year with these\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeople, to live her double life as a student and vampire hunter and make it all work. To blow that now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould be stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd another part of her was scared that she was even verging on losing control. That was what even a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eday with Morgead did to her. It cut through all her careful discipline and changed her back into a raving\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebarbarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead... she couldn\u0027t think about him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Uncle Jim,\" she said out loud. \"I understand. You do what you have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you can just show us that you\u0027re learning to be responsible, then you can have the bike back. You\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave to learn to take life more seriously, Jez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat forced a tired snort out of her. She was laughing before she knew it, and her aunt and uncle were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooking shocked and displeased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \u0027I\u0027ll try harder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027ll just have to take public transportation tomorrow, she thought when the lecture was over and she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas free to go to her room. Even though that\u0027s a lot more dangerous. I could get hunted down so easily. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You messed with the wrong person, you know?\" Claire said as Jez reached her door. \"You shouldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave dumped me like that. You shouldn\u0027t make me mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Claire; well, now I know better. I\u0027m terrified.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re still not taking things seriously, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claire-\" Jez rounded on the smaller girl. Then she stopped dead. \"I don\u0027t have time for this,\" she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emuttered. \"I have to make a call. You just run along and harass somebody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shut the bedroom door in Claire\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich, she realized later, was a mistake. At the time, though, she was too tired to think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was too tired to think properly at all. Tired and distraught, with the feeling that everything was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclosing in and happening too fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so when she picked up the phone to dial Hugh she hardly noticed the little click on the line, and she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t stop for even a second to consider what it meant. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-13.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
