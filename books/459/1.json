Success, I am sufficient of a heretic to believe, matters little, but friendship a great deal. And I could as little think of sending a story friendless into the world as I would of sending a child, or horse, or dog. So \"Changeling\" itself I will put under the friendly hand of the Right Honorable the Lord Justice O\u0027Connor, who will find law treated in it in a dégagé manner that will surprise even him. And \"The Parliament at Thebes\" I dedicate to Addison and Josephine Hanan.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For Bulmer and Clare Hobson, near Three-Rock Mountain, is \"Delilah, Now It Was Dusk,\" and for Brinsley MacNamara, that splendid Irish novelist, \"Wisdom Buildeth Her House.\" And \"In Praise of Lady Margery Kyteler\" for Arthur Somers Roche, in memory of a chivalrous kindness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Reynardine\" for Miss OEnone Somerville and in memory of Martin Ross—their pens were one of the lost Irish glories. \"Irish\" for Jeffrey Farnol—none more than he loves and understands the Ring. And I am sorry there is not a story of war and its intricacies in the collection to dedicate to my friend Lieutenant-General J. J. O\u0027Connell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I have not by hundreds come to the end of those whom I love to think my friends; but so many of them are sportsmen that to dedicate stories to them would be like giving a two-year-old racer to a maiden and church-going lady, loading her with responsibility and embarrassment, so that—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So that the rest of the stories can go out and make friends for themselves, and if they can\u0027t, \u0027t was surely a poor hand that wrote them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Donn Byrne.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the Cinque Ports,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; England. 1923.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/89995.html","bookId":459,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:28:37 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:28:37 PM"}
