There’s a reason Demandred struck at Dashar Knob and then directly at you. He’s trying to destroy our command structure. Your duty is to assume command from someplace safe and secret. Once we’re far enough away that Demandred\u0027s scouts can’t sense you channeling, we’ll make a gateway and you will be back in control. Right now though, Elayne, you need to shut your mouth and let me protect you\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right. Burn her, she was. Elayne hung on as Birgitte galloped across the battlefield, her horse churning clods of dirt behind them in a flight toward safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least he’s making it easy to find him, Galad thought as he rode, watching the lines of fire streak from the enemy position toward Elayne’s army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalad’s heels dug into the flanks of his stolen horse, tearing across the Heights toward its eastern edge. Over and over, he saw Gawyn’s dying body in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Face me, Lews Therin!\" The thunder of Demandred’s shout shook the ground from up ahead. He had taken Galad’s brother. Now the monster hunted Galad’s sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe right thing had always seemed clear to Galad before, but never had it felt as right as this. Those streaks of light were like indicators on a map, arrows pointing his way. The Light itself guided him. It had prepared him, placed him here at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ripped through the back lines of the Sharan force to where Demandred stood, just above the riverbed looking down on Elayne’s troops. Arrows sank into the earth around him, archers firing, heedless of the risk of hitting their own men. Sword out, Galad pulled his leg from the stirrup, preparing to leap free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arrow struck the horse. Galad threw himself from the animal. He hit hard, skidding to a stop, and sliced the hand from a crossbowman nearby. A growling male channeler came for him, and the foxhead medallion grew cold against Galad’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalad rammed his blade through the man’s neck. The man raved, blood spurting from his neck with each beat of his heart. He didn’t seem surprised as he died, just angry. His howls drew more attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Demandred!\" Galad yelled. \"Demandred, you call for the Dragon Reborn! You demand to fight him! He is not here, but his brother is! Will you stand against me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDozens of crossbows were raised. Behind Galad, his horse collapsed, expelling a bloody froth from its nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand al’Thor. His brother. The shock of Gawyn’s death had numbed Galad to this revelation. He would have to deal with it eventually, if he survived. He still did not know if he would be proud or ashamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure in strange, coin-link armor stepped through the Sharan ranks here. Demandred was a proud man; one needed see only his face to know that. He looked like al’Thor, actually. They had a similar sense about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred inspected Galad, who stood with bloody sword out. The dying channeler scraped the ground with clawed fingers before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His brother?\" Demandred said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Son of Tigraine\", Galad said, \"who became a Maiden of the Spear. Who gave birth to my brother on Dragonmount, the tomb of Lews Therin. I had two brothers. You killed the other on this battlefield\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have an interesting artifact, I see\", Demandred said as the medallion grew cold again. \"Surely you don’t think that is going to keep you from meeting the same fate as your pathetic brother? The dead one, I mean\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we fight, son of Shadows? Or do we talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred unsheathed his sword, herons on the blade and hilt. \"May you give me a better match than your brother, little man. I grow displeased. Lews Therin can hate me or rail against me, but he should not ignore me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalad stepped forward into the ring of crossbowmen and channelers. If he won, he would still die. But Light, let him take one of the Forsaken with him. It would be a fitting end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred came at him, and the contest began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer back pressed against a stalagmite, seeing only by the light of Callandor reflected against the walls of the cavern, Nynaeve worked to save Alanna’s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were those who, in the White Tower, had mocked her reliance on ordinary healing techniques. What could two hands and thread do that the One Power could not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf any of those women had been here instead of Nynaeve, the world would have ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conditions were horrible. Little light, no tools besides the implements she kept in her pouch. Still, Nynaeve sewed, using the needle and thread she always carried. She had mixed a draught of herbs for Alanna and forced it through her lips. It wouldn’t do much, but every little bit might help. It would keep Alanna’s strength up, help her with the pain, keep her heart from giving out as Nynaeve worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wound was messy, but she had sewn messy wounds before. Though she trembled inside, Nynaeve’s hands were steady as she sewed up the wound and coaxed the woman back from the very precipice of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand and Moridin did not move. But she felt something thrumming from them. Rand was fighting. Fighting a fight she could not see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matrim Cauthon, you bloody fool. You’re still alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat glanced over as Davram Bashere rode up beside him in the early evening darkness. Mat had moved with the Deathwatch Guard to the back of the Andoran lines fighting at the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBashere was accompanied by his wife and a guard of Saldaeans. Judging by the blood on her clothing, she had seen her share of fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I’m alive\", Mat said. \"I’m usually pretty good at staying alive. I’ve only failed one time that I remember, and it hardly counts. What are you doing here? Aren’t you . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They dug into my bloody mind\", Bashere said, scowling. \"That they did, man. Deira and I talked it over. I’m not going to lead, but why should that stop me from killing a few Trollocs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat nodded. At Tenobia’s fall, this man had become king of Saldaea—but he had refused the crown, so far. The corruption in his mind had shaken him. All he had said was that Saldaea fights alongside Malkier, and told the troops to look toward Lan. The throne would be sorted out if they all survived the Last Battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to you?\" Bashere asked. \"I heard the command post fell\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat nodded. \"The Seanchan \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-249.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
