He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he is a little different from his fellow Dead. He may occasionally eat people, but he\u0027d rather be riding abandoned airport escalators, listening to Sinatra in the cozy 747 he calls home, or collecting souvenirs from the ruins of civilization. And then he meets a girl. First as his captive, then his reluctant house guest, Julie is a blast of living color in R\u0027s gray landscape, and something inside him begins to bloom. He doesn\u0027t want to eat this girl - although she looks delicious - he wants to protect her. But their unlikely bond will cause ripples they can\u0027t imagine, and their hopeless world won\u0027t change without a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1.jpg","author":"Isaac Marion","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:24 PM"}
