Aren’t you afraid that the wind will cut your tongue? I want to take a good look today at just how you’ll instantly defeat me!” Hua Xuan was filled with a righteous anger. After being derided and belittled again and again by someone else, anyone would have gone berserk.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the start of the battle, Hua Xuan laid down a thick origin energy shield around his body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHua Xuan was also an Empyrean descendant. He cultivated the Space Laws and the Metal Laws. The attacks of the Metal Laws were sharp and keen and its defensive power was considered nearly invincible, thick and powerful, not in any way weaker than the Earth Laws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA golden barrier completely shielded Hua Xuan. He had already revealed his stance and planned on engaging in a battle of defense. Although the Monster Prince was arrogant, his strength was obvious. Before now, the strength he revealed had been similar to Jun Bluemoon and Lin Ming. Although Hua Xuan was also confident in himself, he didn’t believe that his chances of winning were very high. Moreover, since the Monster Prince was still so full of himself, there were inevitably many cards that he had yet to reveal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis opponent had already spoken far too much; losing would not be a shame.

The power that gushed out from him was no less than that of a human body transformation martial artist. When combined with the erupting monster energy, this strike split through space, the halberd light like a wild dragon crossing the river, unstoppable!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe halberd light smashed into Hua Xuan’s metallic origin energy shield.

Hua Xuan shook and all the blood within his body tumbled. Although his metal-attribute barrier was able to barely withstand this strike, there were already faint cracks that began appearing within it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Damnit!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHua Xuan grit his teeth, pouring all of his true essence into his barrier. His Metal Laws had also stepped past the threshold of the fifth level Concept. If he gave up on the offensive and solely defended, then his barrier was extremely difficult to break through!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“How interesting!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Monster Prince pounded down with his halberd once more!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Rule the World!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs this halberd came sweeping out, Hua Xuan felt all of the power of space around him become chaotic.

This was not because he learned and comprehended it by himself, but because most of those Laws were already engraved into his body. As he grew, he only needed the light guidance of a teacher to master them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHua Xuan had already reached his limit by resisting this squeezing power of space.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMore and more cracks appeared in his barrier!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHua Xuan bit down so hard that his teeth were stained with blood.

Suddenly, the power of space that was squeezing around Hua Xuan exploded!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKa ka ka!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSpace violently twisted as if it would break down. At high levels, Void Collapse was able to destroy the stable space of the Divine Realm. Once this stable space exploded, the power of space that erupted could tear apart any martial artist to the tiniest of pieces.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Monster Prince was still far from reaching this boundary. But, causing the power of space to tremble and leak over to strangle someone to death was already a terrifying power.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was the belief of many Supreme Elders that the sharpest thing in the world was not forged weapons, but space!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the Monster Prince’s third strike, his use of the Laws had reached a horrifying height. Hua Xuan was no longer able to persist in defending. His metal-attribute barrier completely disintegrated and he flew backwards, vomiting out a mouthful of blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this battle, Hua Xuan had been completely defeated. The disparity was far too evident.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He lost! The disparity was too great! Hua Xuan tried his best, but he was still suppressed from the start!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm… in truth, Hua Xuan is very strong, but the reason he entered the top 10 has a high luck component to it. In terms of strength, he should be weaker than Ram Saber.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe final 10 of the first tier were all decided by the last matches they fought in the first round, which had been arranged by Vast Cosmos. If they won they would advance to the first tier, and if they lost they would advance to the second tier. Vast Cosmos wasn’t an omniscient god and it was still difficult for him to distinguish which genius was stronger and weaker. Thus, it wasn’t strange for lopsided situations like this to appear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, the top participants of the second tier could challenge the lower ranked participants of the first tier. At the end of the First Martial Meeting when the final rankings were determined, the top 10 might not all be from the current first tier.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKuh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHua Xuan half-knelt on the ground, supporting himself with his sword.

With so many people in the audience cursing him, they obviously wanted to enrage him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of the young elites present originated from great influences. Which one of them was not arrogant themselves?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, the Monster Prince didn’t care at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe thought, ‘Yes, I’m arrogant, but what can you do about it!?’\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“My skeletal age is 31 years old.

The martial artists that participated in the First Martial Meeting were 40 years old on average. Even Dragon Fang was 36 years old and that was considered quite young. Many of the young elites present were 40-50 years old, but even if their strength increased 10 times over they still wouldn’t be a match for the Monster Prince. Thus, they could only choke on their own rage without the energy to refute him. This was because the difference was far too great!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Have Xiao Moxian go on stage! She’ll definitely beat him to a pulp!” Many martial artists shouted, unable to swallow this anger. A Monster Prince had actually come to their territory and beaten up their geniuses. After that he had even loudly mocked all of them. Even so, there wasn’t a single person who was able to stand up to him, so how could their thoughts ever remain smooth after this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, they knew that they were not a match for the Monster Prince so they could only pin their hopes on these other extreme characters competing in the finals. They needed one of the other participants to surpass the Monster Prince in both strength and talent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Xiao Moxian is extremely young. I’ve heard that she is still in her twenties. Even so, she cannot be considered someone that is fully human.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian’s talent far surpassed the Monster Prince’s. However, half of her bloodline came from a Dark Phoenix, so she could be considered a half monster.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo have Xiao Moxian defeat the Monster Prince didn’t have any meaning at all. That was equal to a monster defeating a monster.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven though the Monster Prince was arrogant he didn’t deny Xiao Moxian’s talent. But besides her, the Monster Prince despised everyone else, including even Frost Dream. He believed that Frost Dream’s talent was no higher than his own. As for Hang Chi, he was even more useless.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That human called Lin Ming, aren’t you going to come up for a battle?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Monster Prince chuckled as he looked over in Lin Ming’s direction, his eyes filled with a provocative light. He wanted to see Lin Ming’s frightened and confused face, but he was disappointed. “This brat has some guts. Humph, I’ll see just how long you can maintain that calm demeanor of yours.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming looked at Vast Cosmos. Vast Cosmos said, “If the both of you agree and are willing to compete ahead of time then I will not oppose that!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe order of fights in the tournament didn’t matter much, and even Vast Cosmos was slowly becoming sick of hearing this Monster Prince shout again and again. But, he had to admit that this Monster Prince was indeed powerful!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s potential and the Monster Prince’s potential were on two different levels. Vast Cosmos knew that the reason Lin Ming was able to climb up the 33 steps of the Divine Seal Altar was because he had comprehended a very special type of Laws. His future achievements would be without limit. But, before Lin Ming could successfully transform these Laws into true combat strength, it would be very difficult for him to defeat the Monster Prince.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was because the Monster Prince’s talent perfectly manifested with his growth. With every second that passed, he fused with the Laws in his body more and more, becoming increasingly strong.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was the superiority of the monster race!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Lin Ming was defeated then not only did that mean a loss for him, but also a deep shame for the entirety of Vast Universe Heavenly Palace. This was because all the disciples of Vast Universe Heavenly Palace were inferior to Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo all of this, Vast Cosmos couldn’t help but consider the situation.
