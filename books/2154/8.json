It gave honest answers to dangerous questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes no difference that I know this is a weapon to be used against me, Paul thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should I do to protect myself from you?\" Paul asked. It was direct speech, no royal \"we,\" but a question as he might have put it to the old Duncan Idaho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send me away, m\u0027Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul shook his head from side to side. \"How are you to destroy me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHayt looked at the guards, who\u0027d moved closer to Paul after Stilgar\u0027s departure. He turned, cast his gaze around the hall, brought his metal eyes back to bear on Paul, nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a place where a man draws away from people,\" Hayt said. \"It speaks of such power that one can contemplate it comfortably only in the remembrance that all things are finite. Did my Lord\u0027s oracular powers plot his course into this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul drummed his fingers against the throne\u0027s arms. The mentat sought data, but the question disturbed him. \"I came to this position by strong decisions... not always out of my other... abilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strong decisions,\" Hayt said. \"These temper a man\u0027s life. One can take the temper from fine metal by heating it and allowing it to cool without quenching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you divert me with Zensunni prattle?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zensunni has other avenues to explore, Sire, than diversion and display.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul wet his lips with his tongue, drew in a deep breath, set his own thoughts into the counterbalance poise of the mentat. Negative answers arose around him. It wasn\u0027t expected that he\u0027d go haring after the ghola to the exclusion of other duties. No, that wasn\u0027t it. Why a Zensunni-mentat? Philosophy... words... contemplation... inward searching... He felt the weakness of his data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need more data,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The facts needed by a mentat do not brush off onto one as you might gather pollen on your robe while passing through a field of flowers,\" Hayt said. \"One chooses his pollen carefully, examines it under powerful amplification.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must teach me this Zensunni way with rhetoric,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe metallic eyes glittered at him for a moment, then: \"M\u0027Lord, perhaps that\u0027s what was intended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo blunt my will with words and ideas? Paul wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ideas are most to feared when they become actions,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send me away, Sire,\" Hayt said, and it was Duncan Idaho\u0027s voice full of concern for \"the young master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul felt trapped by that voice. He couldn\u0027t send that voice away, even when it came from a ghola. \"You will stay,\" he said, \"and we\u0027ll both exercise caution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHayt bowed in submission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul glanced up at the spy hole, eyes pleading for Alia to take this gift off his hands and ferret out its secrets. Gholas were ghosts to frighten children. He\u0027d never thought to know one. To know this one, he had to set himself above all compassion... and he wasn\u0027t certain he could do it. Duncan... Duncan... Where was Idaho in this shaped-to-measure flesh? It wasn\u0027t flesh... it was a shroud in fleshly shape! Idaho lay dead forever on the floor of an Arrakeen cavern. His ghost stared out of metal eyes. Two beings stood side by side in this revenant flesh. One was a threat with its force and nature hidden behind unique veils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing his eyes, Paul allowed old visions to sift through his awareness. He sensed the spirits of love and hate spouting there in a rolling sea from which no rock lifted above the chaos. No place at all from which to survey turmoil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy has no vision shown me this new Duncan Idaho? he asked himself. What concealed Time from an oracle? Other oracles, obviously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul opened his eyes, asked: \"Hayt, do you have the power of prescience?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, m\u0027Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSincerity spoke in that voice. It was possible the ghola didn\u0027t know he possessed this ability, of course. But that\u0027d hamper his working as a mentat. What was the hidden design?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld visions surged around Paul. Would he have to choose the terrible way? Distorted Time hinted at this ghola in that hideous future. Would that way close in upon him no matter what he did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisengage... disengage... disengage...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought tolled in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her position above Paul, Alia sat with chin cupped in left hand, stared down at the ghola. A magnetic attraction about this Hayt reached up to her. Tleilaxu restoration had given him youth, an innocent intensity which called out to her. She\u0027d understood Paul\u0027s unspoken plea. When oracles failed, one turned to real spies and physical powers. She wondered, though, at her own eagerness to accept this challenge. She felt a positive desire to be near this new man, perhaps to touch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s a danger to both of us, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruth suffers from too much analysis. -Ancient Fremen Saying\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reverend Mother, I shudder to see you in such circumstances,\" Irulan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood just inside the cell door, measuring the various capacities of the room in her Bene Gesserit way. It was a three-meter cube carved with cutterays from the veined brown rock beneath Paul\u0027s Keep. For furnishings, it contained one flimsy basket chair occupied now by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, a pallet with a brown cover upon which had been spread a deck of the new Dune Tarot cards, a metered water tap above a reclamation basin, a Fremen privy with moisture seals. It was all sparse, primitive. Yellow light came from anchored and caged glowglobes at the four corners of the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve sent word to the Lady Jessica?\" the Reverend Mother asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I don\u0027t expect her to lift one finger against her firstborn,\" Irulan said. She glanced at the cards. They spoke of the powerful turning their backs on supplicants. The card of the Great Worm lay beneath Desolate Sand. Patience was counseled. Did one require the tarot to see this? she asked herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guard stood outside watching them through a metaglass window in the door. Irulan knew there\u0027d be other monitors on this encounter. She had put in much thought and planning before daring to come here. To have stayed away carried its own perils, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reverend Mother had been engaged in prajna meditation interspersed with examinations of the tarot. Despite a feeling that she would never leave Arrakis alive, she had achieved a measure of calm through this. One\u0027s oracular powers might be small, but muddy water was muddy water. And there was always the Litany Against Fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had yet to assimilate the import of the actions which had precipitated her into this cell. Dark suspicions brooded in her mind (and the tarot hinted at confirmations). Was it possible the Guild had planned this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA yellow-robed Qizara, head shaved for a turban, beady eyes of total blue in a bland round face, skin leathered by the wind and sun of Arrakis, had awaited her on the heighliner\u0027s reception bridge. He had looked up from a bulb of spice-coffee being served by an obsequious steward, studied her a moment, put down the coffee bulb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo replay those words in her mind was to bring that moment alive in the memory. Her throat had constricted with an unmanageable spasm of fear. How had one of the Emperor\u0027s minions learned of her presence on the heighliner?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It came to our attention that you were aboard,\" the Qizara said. \"Have you forgotten that you are denied permission to set foot on the holy planet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not on Arrakis,\" she said. \"I\u0027m a passenger on a Guild heighliner in free space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no such thing as free space, Madame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read hate mingled with profound suspicion in his tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muad\u0027dib rules everywhere,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arrakis is not my destination,\" she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arrakis is the destination of everyone,\" he said. And she feared for a moment that he would launch into a recital of the mystical itinerary which pilgrims followed. (This very ship had carried thousands of them.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Qizara had pulled a golden amulet from beneath his robe, kissed it, touched it to his forehead and placed it to his right ear, listened. Presently, he restored the amulet to its hidden place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are ordered to gather your luggage and accompany me to Arrakis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I have business elsewhere!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, she suspected Guild perfidy... or exposure through some transcendent power of the Emperor or his sister. Perhaps the Steersman did not conceal the conspiracy, after all. The abomination, Alia, certainly possessed the abilities of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. What happened when those powers were coupled with the forces which worked in her brother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At once!\" the Qizara snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything in her cried out against setting foot once more on that accursed desert planet. Here was where the Lady Jessica had turned against the Sisterhood. Here was where they\u0027d lost Paul Atreides, the kwisatz haderach they\u0027d sought through long generations of careful breeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At once,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s little time,\" the Qizara said. \"When the Emperor commands, all his subjects obey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the order had come from Paul!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of protesting to the heighliner\u0027s Navigator-Commander, but the futility of such a gesture stopped her. What could the Guild do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Emperor has said I must die if I set foot on Dune,\" she said, making a last desperate effort. \"You spoke of this yourself. You are condemning me if you take me down there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say no more,\" the Qizara ordered. \"The thing is ordained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was how they always spoke of Imperial commands, she knew. Ordained! The holy ruler whose eyes could pierce the future had spoken. What must be must be. He had seen it, had He not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the sick feeling that she was caught in a web of her own spinning, she had turned to obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the web had become a cell which Irulan could visit. She saw that Irulan had aged somewhat since their meeting on Wallach IX. New lines of worry spread from the corners of her eyes. Well... time to see if this Sister of the Bene Gesserit could obey her vows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had worse quarters,\" the Reverend Mother said. \"Do you come from the Emperor?\" And she allowed her fingers to move as though in agitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrulan read the moving fingers and her own fingers flashed an answer as she spoke, saying: \"No - I came as soon as I heard you were here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t the Emperor be angry?\" the Reverend Mother asked. Again, her fingers moved: imperative, pressing, demanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him be angry. You were my teacher in the Sisterhood, just as you were the teacher of his own mother. Does he think I will turn my back on you as she has done?\" And Irulan\u0027s finger-talk made excuses, begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reverend Mother sighed. On the surface, it was the sigh of a prisoner bemoaning her fate, but inwardly she felt the response as a comment on Irulan. It was futile to hope the Atreides Emperor\u0027s precious gene pattern could be preserved through this instrument. No matter her beauty, this Princess was flawed. Under that veneer of sexual attraction lived a whining shrew more interested in words than in actions. Irulan was still a Bene Gesserit, though, and the Sisterhood reserved certain techniques to use on some of its weaker vessels as insurance that vital instructions would be carried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath small talk about a softer pallet, better food, the Reverend Mother brought up her arsenal of persuasion and gave her orders: the brother-sister crossbreeding must be explored. (Irulan almost broke at receiving this command.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must have my chance!\" Irulan\u0027s fingers pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve had your chance,\" the Reverend Mother countered. And she was explicit in her instructions: Was the Emperor ever angry with his concubine? His unique powers must make him lonely. To whom could he speak in any hope of being understood? To the sister, obviously. She shared this loneliness. The depth of their communion must be exploited. Opportunities must be created to throw them together in privacy. Intimate encounters must be arranged. The possibility of eliminating the concubine must be explored. Grief dissolved traditional barriers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrulan protested. If Chani were killed, suspicion would fasten immediately upon the Princess-Consort. Besides, there were other problems. Chani had fastened upon an ancient Fremen diet supposed to promote fertility and the diet eliminated all opportunity for administering the contraceptive drugs. Lifting the suppressives would make Chani even more fertile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reverend Mother was outraged and concealed it with difficulty while her fingers flashed their demands. Why had this information not been conveyed at the beginning of their conversation? How could Irulan be that stupid? If Chani conceived and bore a son, the Emperor would declare the child his heir!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrulan protested that she understood the dangers, but the genes might not be totally lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn such stupidity! the Reverend Mother raged. Who knew what suppressions and genetic entanglements Chani might introduce from her wild Fremen strain? The Sisterhood must have only the pure line! And an heir would renew Paul\u0027s ambitions, spur him to new efforts in consolidating his Empire. The conspiracy could not afford such a setback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefensively, Irulan wanted to know how she could have prevented Chani from trying this diet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Reverend Mother was in no mood for excuses. Irulan received explicit instructions now to meet this new threat. If Chani conceived, an abortifact must be introduced into her food or drink. Either that, or she must be killed. An heir to the throne from that source must be prevented at all costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn abortifact would be as dangerous as an open attack on the concubine. Irulan objected. She trembled at the thought of trying to kill Chani.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas Irulan deterred by danger? The Reverend Mother wanted to know, her finger-talk conveying deep scorn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngered, Irulan signaled that she knew her value as an agent in the royal household. Did the conspiracy wish to waste such a valuable agent? Was she to be thrown away? In what other way could they keep this close a watch on the Emperor? Or had they introduced another agent into the household? Was that it? Was she to be used now, desperately, and for the last time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a war, all values acquired new relationships, the Reverend Mother countered. Their greatest peril was that House Atreides should secure itself with an Imperial line. The Sisterhood could not take such a risk. This went far beyond the danger to the Atreides genetic pattern. Let Paul anchor his family to the throne and the Sisterhood could look forward to centuries of disruption for its programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrulan understood the argument, but she couldn\u0027t escape the thought that a decision had been made to spend the Princess-Consort for something of great value. Was there something she should know about the ghola? Irulan ventured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reverend Mother wanted to know if Irulan thought the Sisterhood composed of fools. When had they ever failed to tell Irulan all she should know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no answer, but an admission of concealment, Irulan saw. It said she would be told no more than she needed to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could they be certain the ghola was capable of destroying the Emperor? Irulan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could just as well have asked if melange were capable of destruction, the Reverend Mother countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a rebuke with a subtle message, Irulan realized. The Bene Gesserit \"whip that instructs\" informed her that she should have understood long ago this similarity between the spice and the ghola. Melange was valuable, but it exacted a price - addiction. It added years to a life - decades for some - but it was still just another way to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghola was something of deadly value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe obvious way to prevent an unwanted birth was to kill the prospective mother before conception, the Reverend Mother signaled, returning to the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Irulan thought. If you decide to spend a certain sum, get as much for it as you can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reverend Mother\u0027s eyes, dark with the blue brilliance of her melange addiction, stared up at Irulan, measuring, waiting, observing minutiae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reads me clearly, Irulan thought with dismay. She trained me and observed me in that training. She knows I realize what decision has been taken here. She only observes now to see how I will take this knowledge. Well, I will take it as a Bene Gesserit and a princess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrulan managed a smile, pulled herself erect, thought of the evocative opening passage of the Litany Against Fear:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen calmness had returned, she thought: Let them spend me. I will show them what a princess is worth. Perhaps I\u0027ll buy them more than they expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few more empty vocalizations to bind off the interview. Irulan departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she had gone, the Reverend Mother returned to her tarot cards, laying them out in the fire-eddy pattern. Immediately, she got the Kwisatz Haderach of the Major Arcana and the card lay coupled with the Eight of Ships: the sibyl hoodwinked and betrayed. These were not cards of good omen: they spoke of concealed resources for her enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away from the cards, sat in agitation, wondering if Irulan might yet destroy them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen see her as the Earth Figure, a demigoddess whose special charge is to protect the tribes through her powers of violence. She is Reverend Mother to their Reverend Mothers. To pilgrims who seek her out with demands that she restore virility or make the barren fruitful, she is a form of antimentat. She feeds on that proof that the \"analytic\" has limits. She represents ultimate tension. She is the virgin-harlot - witty, vulgar, cruel, as destructive in her whims as a coriolis storm. -St. Alia of the Knife as taken from The Irulan Report\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia stood like a black-robed sentinel figure on the south platform of her temple, the Fane of the Oracle which Paul\u0027s Fremen cohorts had built for her against a wall of his stronghold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hated this part of her life, but knew no way to evade the temple without bringing down destruction upon them all. The pilgrims (damn them!) grew more numerous every day. The temple\u0027s lower porch was crowded with them. Vendors moved among the pilgrims, and there were minor sorcerers, haruspices, diviners, all working their trade in pitiful imitation of Paul Muad\u0027dib and his sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed and green packages containing the new Dune Tarot were prominent among the vendors\u0027 wares, Alia saw. She wondered about the tarot. Who was feeding this device into the Arrakeen market? Why had the tarot sprung to prominence at this particular time and place? Was it to muddy Time? Spice addiction always conveyed some sensitivity to prediction. Fremen were notoriously fey. Was it an accident that so many of them dabbled in portents and omens here and now? She decided to seek an answer at the first opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a wind from the southeast, a small leftover wind blunted by the scarp of the Shield Wall which loomed high in these northern reaches. The rim glowed orange through a thin dust haze underlighted by the late afternoon sun. It was a hot wind against her cheeks and it made her homesick for the sand, for the security of open spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last of the day\u0027s mob began descending the broad greenstone steps of the lower porch, singly and in groups, a few pausing to stare at the keepsakes and holy amulets on the street vendors\u0027 racks, some consulting one last minor sorcerer. Pilgrims, supplicants, townfolk, Fremen, vendors closing up for the day - they formed a straggling line that trailed off into the palm-lined avenue which led to the heart of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia\u0027s eyes picked out the Fremen, marking the frozen looks of superstitious awe on their faces, the half-wild way they kept their distance from the others. They were her strength and her peril. They still captured giant worms for transport, for sport and for sacrifice. They resented the offworld pilgrims, barely tolerated the townfolk of graben and pan, hated the cynicism they saw in the street vendors. One did not jostle a wild Fremen, even in a mob such as the ones which swarmed to Alia\u0027s Fane. There were no knifings in the Sacred Precincts, but bodies had been found... later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe departing swarm had stirred up dust. The flinty odor came to Alia\u0027s nostrils, ignited another pang of longing for the open bled. Her sense of the past, she realized, had been sharpened by the coming of the ghola. There\u0027d been much pleasure in those untrammeled days before her brother had mounted the throne - time for joking, time for small things, time to enjoy a cool morning or a sunset, time... time... time... Even danger had been good in those days - clean danger from known sources. No need then to strain the limits of prescience, to peer through murky veils for frustrating glimpses of the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWild Fremen said it well: \"Four things cannot be hidden - love, smoke, a pillar of fire and a man striding across the open bled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an abrupt feeling of revulsion, Alia retreated from the platform into the shadows of the Fane, strode along the balcony which looked down into the glistening opalescence of her Hall of Oracles. Sand on the tiles rasped beneath her feet. Supplicants always tracked sand into the Sacred Chambers! She ignored attendants, guards, postulants, the Qizarate\u0027s omnipresent priest-sycophants, plunged into the spiral passage which twisted upward to her private quarters. There, amidst divans, deep rugs, tent hangings and mementos of the desert, she dismissed the Fremen amazons Stilgar had assigned as her personal guardians. Watchdogs, more likely! When they had gone, muttering and objecting, but more fearful of her than they were of Stilgar, she stripped off her robe, leaving only the sheathed crysknife on its thong around her neck, strewed garments behind as she made for the bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was near, she knew - that shadow-figure of a man she could sense in her future, but could not see. It angered her that no power of prescience could put flesh on that figure. He could be sensed only at unexpected moments while she scanned the lives of others. Or she came upon a smoky outline in solitary darkness when innocence lay coupled with desire. He stood just beyond an unfixed horizon, and she felt that if she strained her talents to an unexpected intensity she might see him. He was there - a constant assault on her awareness: fierce, dangerous, immoral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoist warm air surrounded her in the tub. Here was a habit she had learned from the memory-entities of the uncounted Reverend Mothers who were strung out in her awareness like pearls on a glowing necklace. Water, warm water in a sunken tub, accepted her skin as she slid into it. Green tiles with figures of red fish worked into a sea pattern surrounded the water. Such an abundance of water occupied this space that a Fremen of old would have been outraged to see it used merely for washing human flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was lust in tension with chastity, she thought. Her flesh desired a mate. Sex held no casual mystery for a Reverend Mother who had presided at the sietch orgies. The tau awareness of her other-selves could supply any detail her curiosity required. This feeling of nearness could be nothing other than flesh reaching for flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeed for action fought lethargy in the warm water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, Alia climbed dripping from the bath, strode wet and naked into the training chamber which adjoined her bedroom. The chamber, oblong and skylighted, contained the gross and subtle instruments which toned a Bene Gesserit adept into ultimate physical and mental awareness / preparedness. There were mnemonic amplifiers, digit mills from lx to strengthen and sensitize fingers and toes, odor synthesizers, tactility sensitizers, temperature gradient fields, pattern betrayers to prevent her falling into detectable habits, alpha-wave-response trainers, blink-synchronizers to tone abilities in light / dark / spectrum analysis...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn ten-centimeter letters along one wall, written by her own hand in mnemonic paint, stood the key reminder from the Bene Gesserit Creed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before us, all methods of learning were tainted by instinct. We learned how to learn. Before us, instinct-ridden researchers possessed a limited attention span - often no longer than a single lifetime. Projects stretching across fifty or more lifetimes never occurred to them. The concept of total muscle / nerve training had not entered awareness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she moved into the training room, Alia caught her own reflection multiplied thousands of times in the crystal prisms of a fencing mirror swinging in the heart of a target dummy. She saw the long sword waiting on its brackets against the target, and she thought: Yes! I\u0027ll work myself to exhaustion - drain the flesh and clear the mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword felt right in her hand. She slipped the crysknife from its sheath at her neck, held it sinister, tapped the activating stud with the sword tip. Resistance came alive as the aura of the target shield built up, pushing her weapon slowly and firmly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrisms glittered. The target slipped to her left. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dune-messiah-dune-chronicles-2/page-8.html","bookId":2154,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:19 PM"}
