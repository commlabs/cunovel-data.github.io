Still no reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia kindly offered her key chain knife, which I used to unlatch the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe living room was bright with morning sun. Pothos and ivy crowded the windows. I put the newspaper down on the sideboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA suitcase lay open and empty on the sofa. On the coffee table was the large brown binder Faye had shown Maia and me the week before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia went to the stereo, checked out the case on the CD player. She might\u0027ve been waiting in a doctor\u0027s office, for all the anxiety she showed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat next to the suitcase, opened the memory book. The picture of Ewin Lowry and Clara Doebler stared up at me—Clara smiling, her hand resting on the hood of the \u002765\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMustang as if it were a favourite horse. Ewin Lowry\u0027s smile was more devilish, his teeth perfectly white. Small build, dark skin—not really olive, as I\u0027d speculated before, but the hue of cinnamon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething shattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up. Faye Ingram was standing in her kitchen doorway, shards of a Jimmy Doebler coffee cup at her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers were flaked with mud. She wiped them absently on her gardening apron, then touched her face as if to make sure her mascara and jewellery and pennyred hairdo were still in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Navarre,\" she said. \"Miss Lee. What are you doing in my house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t disappeared,\" Maia said. \"I\u0027m glad to see that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye glanced behind her, into the kitchen. \"I\u0027m fine, thank you. I think you should leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s here,\" I said. \"Isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knelt down, began picking up pieces of the cup, using her apron as a collection pouch. \"I\u0027m afraid— I\u0027m not quite awake yet, Mr. Navarre. I haven\u0027t had my second cup of coffee, haven\u0027t had my thirty minutes in the garden. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not following you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped the picture of Ewin and Clara out of its plastic pocket. \"The resemblance is there, isn\u0027t it, if you blend the two of them together? I just wasn\u0027t looking for the right connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood, the pottery shards in her apron. Plucking up the ends of the fabric, she looked as if she were about to curtsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twentyfive years ago,\" I said. \"You saved your sister\u0027s child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t ask me this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clara had her second son, but it was another battle she couldn\u0027t win against the family, wasn\u0027t it? They forced her to give the baby away. W.B.\u0027s father made the arrangements—no paperwork, no embarrassment, just discreet payments to a family that would keep the secret and ask no questions as long as the money kept coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Doeblers either didn\u0027t know or didn\u0027t care what kind of operation the Hayeses were running—what kind of hell they inflicted on their charges. But you found out. You\u0027d watched Clara unravel—you knew that she was unfit to take care of herself, much less a child, but you also knew her misery. You resented the family for what they\u0027d done to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye pressed her lips tight, turned her face toward the door jamb. \"I never married, Tres, never had children. I saw how the family\u0027s expectations destroyed my sister—how she kept giving them more rope to strangle her with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you found a way to save something of your sister. You found a way to have a family, too. By the time your nephew was six, it was clear to you what kind of monsters the Hayeses were. Their own son Dwight was being twisted, misshaped by an abusive father and a dangerously unstable mother. Your nephew was not faring much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one incident, he almost died. That decided you. You rescued the child, kidnapped him. You placed him in a home of your choosing, supported by your money, and you made sure he was treated well. He became your son more than Clara\u0027s, and as he grew, you were not about to tell your sister—to see the one good deed of your life be tainted by the Doeblers. They would find a way to interfere again. Clara would insist on raising the child, and she would screw it up, the way she\u0027d screwed up everything in her life. The child was yours now. That\u0027s why the payments to the Hayeses stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the child was no longer there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the kitchen, a coffee machine gurgled and steamed as it let out the last of its water into the filter. Faye clutched her apron. One tear was making its way down her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mascara streaked like a smear of ashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He warned me. He said the best we could hope for was a few more quiet days. I so hoped— Oh, Tres. You don\u0027t understand. Until Clara\u0027s death, we had so many good years. Even after, when he was worried for my safety, when he was so busy guarding our lives and our secret that he could barely enjoy my company—even then, every day was a gift. I would give anything to protect him. Everything else failed to matter long ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could barely speak. The unequivocal love in her voice was humbling. \"We need to see him, Ms. Ingram.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, then nodded, resigned to the inevitable. She led us through the kitchen and into the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grass was dappled with light through the oak tree. A new jar of sun tea glowed on the sidewalk. Another Jimmy Doebler coffee cup and two plates of cinnamon toast sat on the patio table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was working near the tomato cages, cutting dead sunflower stalks with a machete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby on the grass, a flat of lantana waited, ready to be planted in the sunflowers\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore swim trunks, flipflops, a plain white Tshirt smeared with dirt and sweat and plant pigments. When he turned, expecting to see only Faye, his face was the most content I\u0027d ever seen it— calm, happy, at peace with his morning\u0027s work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his expression went absolutely blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Vic,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic Lopez raised his machete hand, used the back of his glove to wipe a sweat droplet off his chin. He studied us, the blade of the machete hovering over his left shoulder like an insect wing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Navarre. Maia. I was just giving Ms. Ingram a hand. Amazing the things you can do once you quit the day job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows,\" Faye told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez met her eyes, had a silent conversation, looked back at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwight\u0027s revenge,\" I said. \"It wasn\u0027t against his family—it was against yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye moved to the patio table, sank into one of the chairs. She began putting the shards of the broken cup on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the friend Dwight lost,\" I said. \"You were snatched out of the Hayes house when you and he were only six. You were rescued, and Dwight was left behind. He never forgot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez lowered his machete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know,\" he said. \"Until very recently, I didn\u0027t understand who was doing the killing. I was too young when I—when I got free of that place. Thankfully, I don\u0027t remember much. The name Hayes meant nothing to me. He was just another interviewee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye said, \"He never told me about Dwight. If he had, perhaps I would\u0027ve made the connection. But perhaps not ... it was so long ago. It was something we put behind us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it shaped Dwight\u0027s life,\" I said. \"He never forgot. You were his personal quest, Vic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe resented you, hated you, but somewhere in the back of his mind he also loved you, identified with you the way he identified with Matthew Pena. Dwight thought he was you. He wanted to do for you what he wished someone could do for him—kill the family who had let him down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez turned the blade of his machete, watching it reflect the sunlight. \"I never knew my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ewin Lowry was Hispanic,\" I said. \"That was part of the reason the Doebler family didn\u0027t want him around. His name—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was changed to something nice and Anglo when he was young,\" Lopez interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His surname was originally Lopez, which is the name Faye decided to give back to me. That\u0027s really all I know about him. When Dwight found Lowry in Waco, he killed a man who meant nothing to me. Clara—my mother—that was different, but mostly her death hurt me because she was Faye\u0027s sister, because I watched her die. I don\u0027t mean to be cold, Navarre, but you\u0027ve got to understand—Faye has always been my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never knew Clara well, or any of the other Doeblers. I never wanted to. I know now that Dwight meant for me to be there the night he killed Clara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d studied you, knew your patrol schedule. You realized Clara\u0027s death was more than a suicide. You went into homicide because of what you saw that night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew there was something wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after Jimmy was murdered—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went off in completely the wrong direction—exactly the way Dwight wanted me to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s only when Ruby died, when I realized the connection to Ewin Lowry—it did look like Clara\u0027s son might be involved. But I was Clara\u0027s son. I thought maybe Pena was re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esponsible, playing mind games with me. I didn\u0027t know what to believe.\" He gestured at Faye. \"I insisted that Faye leave town for a while, until I could figure things out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwight\u0027s plan,\" I said. \"Those unsigned files on the disk. He wasn\u0027t claiming to be Clara\u0027s son? he was leaving that as your suicide note. He meant to get away, leave you the blame—a dead man at the bottom of the lake, killing yourself the same way you\u0027d killed your victims, your family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except Maia saved me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia said nothing—exactly what she\u0027d said about her trip underwater for the past three days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor tugged off his leather gardening gloves, threw them on the dirt. \"So what now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye had arranged the pieces of broken cup into a line, the same way she\u0027d done with the poisonous coral beans on my last visit. I wondered if Faye always tried to organize things into straight lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one will charge you with a crime,\" Maia said. \"The police can\u0027t fire you for misrepresenting your identity if you\u0027ve already quit. But the tabloids will have a field day. It\u0027s only a matter of time before the reporters find out the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic nodded. \"When it happens I\u0027ll deal with that. Until then, I plan on spending my time here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe summer heat had started to burn through the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon the garden would be a hundred degrees, fit only for cicadas and dragonflies and herbs. But I could picture Faye and Victor out here again this evening—drinking freshly brewed sun tea, enjoying the catmint and sage that had infused the air during the afternoon, watching the blue glow of the moonlight tower take over from the sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike all Texans, they had learned to make the most of the edges of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a lot I regret,\" Lopez said. \"But the important things had to survive. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him I did. I shook his hand and said goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as we left him to his gardening, as we accepted Faye DoeblerIngram\u0027s hugs and then headed back into her house, I wasn\u0027t at ease with my own jealousy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye and Victor had salvaged a family from the ruins of a clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia laced her fingers in mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about her smile made it easier to go down the front porch steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 44\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was spoiling the guys in English 301. This was the second time in two weeks I\u0027d brought Maia Lee to class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll through my lecture on Coleridge, the flipflop dudes checked her out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about ways to recapture their interest—maybe get a dead bird and a rope and use Father Time as a visual aid for the Ancient Mariner. But in the end, I decided just to let them be distracted. They had a test next week. I had a red pen. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-50.html","bookId":2419,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM"}
