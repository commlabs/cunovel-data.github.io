I have always been in this fellow’s body.” Yan’s eyes paused on Ling Qingzhu. His gaze looked straight at her. This was not due to Ling Qingzhu’s appearance.

He was ultimately unable to give a direct answer. This caused Yan to be inwardly irritated. This little fellow was usually extremely decisive. Yet, he became extremely hesitant when it came to these two women.

She slowly retracted her gaze and was quiet for a moment. Finally, she said, “Every palace master and the successor of our Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace has practiced a mysterious martial art called the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’ since young. This martial art does not have any combat capabilities and cannot be used to battle our enemies. However, it is compulsory.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Zenith Sensing Art?” Lin Dong and Yan were stunned. They exchanged a glance.

Hence, the practitioner must… be a virgin. Otherwise, the art will be broken.” An astringent expression flashed across Ling Qingzhu’s eyes when she spoke until this point. Her eyes glanced at Lin Dong, causing the latter’s back to be covered in perspiration. This meant that one time back then had ridiculously destroyed ten years of Ling Qingzhu’s bitter training? No wonder she hated him to the point of wanting to kill him back then.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“But now… you seem to have successfully mastered it?” Yan looked at Ling Qingzhu and asked in surprise.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu nodded slightly and said, “Back then, teacher was exceptionally furious when she learnt that all my hard work was ruined. However, in the subsequent eight years, my proficiency in the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’ grew at an increasing rate. Some time ago, teacher used her life and the help of many elders to allow me to successfully master the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’. It was also at that time… that my body gained a trace of the so called fluctuation similar to that of the Symbol Ancestor.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This power is indeed very formidable.

He had saw Ling Qingzhu break open the Devil Feast World, which the Tian Yuanzi had created from their self-destruction, with a slash. Such power might appear inconspicuous, but it was extremely frightening.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYan looked at Lin Dong. Seeing that Lin Dong did not react, he involuntarily coughed dryly in his a resentful manner.

He was naturally aware of what Yan wanted him to do. However… damnit.

He laughed dryly and said, “It is already quite late.

He waved his hand towards Yan and laughed, “Why do you need to be so persistent. There are countless paths in this world. I do not believe that there are no other methods to catch up with the Ice Master. Let’s go.

However, he was suddenly stopped by Yan. After which, the latter pointed to their front. Lin Dong raised his head and saw that Ling Qingzhu had stopped. Soon after, she slowly turned around. The sunlight shone on her, emphasizing her enchanting curves. Her long eyelashes moved slightly and the expression in her eyes changed. Finally, she stared at Lin Dong and asked, “Do you wish to learn this ‘Zenith Sensing Art’?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong blankly stared at Ling Qingzhu.

She gently bit her red lips as she looked at Lin Dong, while her hand gripped her sword scabbard a little harder. There was a struggle in her eyes. This continued for a long time, before she finally sighed softly in her heart as if she had come to a decision.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Will you be going outside during this period of time?” Ling Qingzhu asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong was stunned by these rather strange words.

It is fortunate that it is you. Otherwise, we can forget about obtaining this ‘Zenith Sensing Art’...” Yan watched from the side as he sighed. The ‘Zenith Sensing Art’ was clearly a tightly guarded secret of Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace. Even if someone else had done a great favor for Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace, they would definitely not take out something of such importance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMoreover, Ling Qingzhu was extremely intelligent. She had clearly guessed the reason Lin Dong wanted to learn the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’. However, she did not comment about it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis girl really likes to silently endure and stubbornly keep everything to herself.

His heart was plagued by complicated emotions. After which, he walked forward and coincidentally saw Ling Qingzhu saying something to Su Rou. The latter held the former’s hand with a bright smile. From Lin Dong’s angle, he could see the tips of Ling Qingzhu’s tender ears turn red.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Big brother Lin Dong, we will be leaving senior sister in your care. Please help us take good care of her.” Su Rou waved her small hand towards Lin Dong and said in a lovely voice.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, Ling Qingzhu’s sword scabbard knocked onto her forehead with embarrassed anger. This caused some pain to appear on Su Rou’s small face.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe group of young ladies from Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace joked around and teased Ling Qingzhu for a while. Finally, their lovely laughter gradually became distant. The clear laughter continued to echo in the mountain forest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu watched them leave. Only then did she turn around and arrive in front of Lin Dong. She asked, “When do you plan to leave?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Tomorrow. I will return first to notify them.” Lin Dong pondered for a while. Now that there were no problems in Dao Sect, he should hurry and head to the Northern Xuan Region to bring Qingtan back.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Okay.” Ling Qingzhu nodded gently and did not speak any further. Lin Dong turned around after seeing this and the both of them returned to Dao Sect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThey coincidentally met Ying Xiaoxiao after returning to Dao Sect. The latter’s eyes involuntarily became somewhat strange when she saw the both of them. However, she did not comment, and Lin Dong did not explain anything either. He merely asked Ying Xiaoxiao to arrange for Ling Qingzhu’s accommodation, before heading straight to Ying Xuanzi to inform the latter that he had to leave for the time being. Ying Xuanzi was a little surprised, but did not voice any objection. He only instructed Lin Dong to be careful. After all, the world was currently not at peace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter which, Lin Dong headed to the back mountain and informed Ying Huanhuan. The latter agreed when she heard that Lin Dong was planning to bring Qingtan back. She was acquainted with Qingtan and the both of them had a relatively good relationship. She wanted to follow Lin Dong but her current condition was unsuitable. Hence, she could only regretfully remain in Dao Sect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong looked at a distant mountain after coming out from the back mountain. He pondered a little, before instruction a disciple to bring two jars of good wine. After which, he carried it to that particular mountain. On the mountain peak, he saw a red haired figure seated on a rock.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1225\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1227\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1226","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM"}
