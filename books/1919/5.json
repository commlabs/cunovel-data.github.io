She cried out, her entire body shaking violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easy, sweetheart,” he said hoarsely, anchoring her with his palm pressed flat to the small of her back. “I’ll take care of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next stroke of his tongue was skillful, rubbing over the hard knot of her clit with the perfect amount of pressure. She came in a rush, her back bowing as the pleasure seared her senses and racked her over-sensitized body with shudders of delight. In the midst of an orgasm that darkened her vision, Jake’s tongue darted inside her, thrusting furiously. The soft velvet of his licking against the tender tissues of her core was too much, yet not nearly enough. Her hips churned into the shallow plunges, her body seeking a deeper, stronger penetration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, Jake. Now. Now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood in a rush. Ana heard the sound of his zipper lowering; then she felt the silky heat of his rigid erection brush against her. He teased her, gliding the plush head of his cock through the slick lips of her sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arched her spine, her fingers grasping at air, her cheeks flushed and damp from the strain of being bound and unable to reach out to him as she needed. Not just for the physical pleasure of touching him, but to satisfy the demands of her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you,” she gasped, unable to hold the words back. “I love you, Jake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a low growl, his hips jerked and pushed him into her with one fierce, deep stroke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes!” Tears filled Ana’s eyes and spilled over onto the cushion. She ached for this, the delicious burn of his possession and the sense of connection she’d felt with no one else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to take you slow.” His voice was rough and raspy. “Slow and deep. But I can’t... It’s been too long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hitched against her, shoved the last little bit inside her that crammed her all the way full. “Damn, you’re like a fist, Ana. Squeezing me tight... rippling around me. I’m gonna come hard for you, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake withdrew, then slid in to the root. He rolled his hips, screwing deep. The feel of his long, thick cock stroking inside her was perfect—the slight burn as he stretched her, the decadent feel of him rubbing and pushing, the maddening clenching in her core as her body tried to hold him deep...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGripping her hips, he pumped hard again, an expert stroke that lifted her to the tip of her toes. Ana panted with pleasure, spinning dizzily toward climax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t stop,” she begged, desperate for the friction that would set her off again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never, Ana mine,” he purred, lunging quick and hard, shafting her tender pussy. “I’ll never stop...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe erotic sound of flesh slapping mingled with the heated words that spilled from his lips—tender promises and sensual threats, loving praise and coarsely-voiced hunger—all of which made her crazy with lust. She was rocking back into his measured thrusts, moaning at the way they radiated through her, her mind fogged with the intensity of her pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jake bent his knees and hit the perfect spot inside her, Ana unraveled with a muffled scream. She quaked with her release, struggling to breathe as her body seized in the throes of a powerful orgasm. Jake was right there with her, gasping as his body jerked with each scorching spurt of semen. He folded over her, clutching her close, the hard ridges of his abdomen slick with sweat against her palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sagged into the cushions as the tension left her, feeling wrung out and well-loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you.” Jake’s chest heaved against her and when he shifted slightly, Ana realized he was still hard and thick. “I’ll never stop needing you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Ana the space of two heartbeats to figure out what had woken her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell phone was vibrating beneath her pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled it out and squinted against the bright light of the backlit screen. Seeing an East Coast area code, she hit the button to answer the call before it went to voicemail and slipped out of bed. She hurried out of Jake’s bedroom and quietly shut the door, then ran to the living room while answering with, “Miller.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ana! My god.” Frankie gasped with relief. “We’re in trouble, Ana. Eric and me... And Mom. Ah, god, Mom...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Frankie.” Relief flowed through her, making her aware of just how worried she’d been. “Where are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Newark. Jesus... it all went wrong. Rick went in hot. Fuck— You know how Mom had it planned. Like Cannes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember.” She remembered the famous Carlton heist, just as she remembered that Terence Parker had a brother named Richard. “Is Rick’s name Richard Parker?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. How did you know?” He barked out a laugh. “What am I saying? Of course you know. He shot his own fucking brother, Ana. Lit him up like... Fuck. Oh fuck... Rick shot his own brother in cold blood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you safe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Eric with you?” She snatched up her duffel bag and dug out a pair of jeans and a top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have the take?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Fuck. Will you listen to me, goddammit! He’s got Mom!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAna froze, her heart thudding violently in her chest. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rick knew Mom was the fence. Eric and I ditched him and took the stones, because he’s fucking crazy. Shot his own goddamn brother. Who does that, Ana? We ditched him and made off with the take and he got to Mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe activated the phone’s speaker and set it on the coffee table. “How do you know he’s got Mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He just called and said he had her. Said he’d trade her for the stones. I tried calling the house but I keep getting the voicemail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, okay.” Think, Ana. Damn it. She yanked on a pair of panties. “Where are you supposed to make the trade?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t say. He’s supposed to call back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, I’m here in Whisper Creek. I’ll head over to Mom’s now and make sure the bastard’s not bluffing.” She hopped from one foot to the other as she tugged on her jeans, becoming aware of the deep soreness between her legs. “Maybe she’s got the ringer off or her sound machine turned up loud. You know how she needs white noise to sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ana... He’ll kill her. Rick must’ve planned all along to get rid of everyone who knew anything. He had to have looked her up before we ditched him. There’s no reason for him to keep her alive for a trade. We won’t know the difference until he’s got us face-to-face, then he’ll take us out, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up, Frankie.” She pulled a sports bra over her head, then grabbed her top. “You’re not going to think about anything but keeping your head down and your mind sharp. I’m gonna run by Mom’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You keep that burner phone on you at all times, you hear me? I want you and Eric to check in every thirty minutes. And find a safe place to hole up and stay there until I tell you otherwise. Don’t make a move without me, got it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I got it. Ana...” Frankie’s voice broke. “It’s all fucked up. It all fell apart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s usually what happens when you break the law, Frankie. You’ve just been really damned lucky so far.” She shoved her nightgown into her bag. “Be careful. Love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAna was straightening from grabbing her heels off the floor when Jake stepped into the room fully dressed with his gun on his hip and his badge clipped to the waistband of his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t come with me,” she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The hell I can’t.” His gaze bored into hers. “That’s my brother out there with yours. Christ, Ana. You’re here because you knew they’d pulled off that heist and you didn’t say a damn thing to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because they’re not going to jail, Jake!” She shoved her heels in her bag and slung it over her shoulder. “I can take care of this and you can keep your hands clean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that all you think I worry about?” He stared at her face, then cursed under his breath. “I’d break any law for you. Every law. There’s nothing I won’t do for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” She went to him and put her palm over his heart. “I know you would. I’m just not sure you could live with yourself afterward and I don’t want to put you in that position. I love you, Jake. Just the way you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake lifted her fingers to his mouth. “I have something for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released her hand and shoved his own into his pocket. A moment later, he was sliding a diamond onto the ring finger of her left hand, a square cushion-cut that caught the light of the moon shining through the gap in the shutters on the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed hard, afraid to blink. “Jake—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been holding on to that for years. Now it’s your turn.” He tugged her bag off her shoulder and dropped it on the couch. “Give me your keys. I want to drive the Jag.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAna felt damn near giddy. Too much adrenaline, she told herself. Neither of them was thinking straight. It’d never work... unless it did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they had to make it through the next few hours first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got a jacket?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the car. Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake watched as Ana opened the trunk of her car and revealed body armor and a handgun safe. She selected one of three guns she had locked away and slid it into her shoulder holster, then shrugged on a windbreaker and relocked the box. Her movements were calm, practiced, and efficient. Jake marveled at the strong, sexy woman she’d become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay?” he asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Shutting the trunk quietly, she studied the two-story house tucked into the woods. “But I’m really glad you’re here. Come on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the silver glow of moonlight, the old Victorian with its round, pointed rooftops and wraparound porch looked like something out of a fairytale—the kind where things went wrong. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-roses-shadow-stalkers-3/page-5.html","bookId":1919,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:54 AM"}
