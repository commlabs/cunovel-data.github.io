But new friend Shay would rather hoverboard to \"the Smoke\" and be free. Tally learns about a whole new side of the pretty world and it isn\u0027t very pretty. The \"Special Circumstances\" authority Dr Cable offers Tally the worst choice she can imagine: find her friend and turn her in, or never turn pretty at all. The choice Tally makes changes her world forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/uglies-uglies-1.jpg","author":"Scott Westerfeld","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/uglies-uglies-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:51:31 PM"}
