LANSDALE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e( For David Schow, a story of The Bad Guys and The Bad Guys)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a month\u0027s chase, Wayne caught up with Calhoun one night at a little honky-tonk called Rosalita\u0027s. It wasn\u0027t that Calhoun had finally gotten careless, it was just that he wasn\u0027t worried. He\u0027d killed four bounty hunters so far, and Wayne knew a fifth didn\u0027t concern him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last bounty hunter had been the famous Pink Lady McGuire - one mean, mama - three hundred pounds of rolling, ugly meat that carried a twelve-gauge Remington pump and a bad attitude. Story was, Calhoun jumped her from behind, cut her throat, and as a joke, fucked her before she bled to death. This not only proved to Wayne that Calhoun was a dangerous sonofabitch, it also proved he had bad taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne stepped out of his \u002757 Chevy reproduction, pushed his hat back on his forehead, opened the trunk, and got the sawed-off double barrel and some shells out of there. He already had a .38 revolver in the holster at his side and a bowie knife in each boot, but when you went into a place like Rosalita\u0027s it was best to have plenty of backup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne put a handful of shotgun shells in his shirt pocket, snapped the flap over them, looked up at the red-and-blue neon sign that flashed ROSALITA\u0027S: COLD BEER AND DEAD DANCING, found his center, as they say in Zen, and went on in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the shotgun against his leg, and as it was dark in there and folks were busy with talk or drinks or dancing, no one noticed him or his artillery right off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spotted Calhoun\u0027s stocky, black-hatted self immediately. He was inside the dance cage with a dead buck-naked Mexican girl of about twelve. He was holding her tight around the waist with one hand and massaging her rubbery ass with the other like it was a pillow he was trying to shape. The dead girl\u0027s handless arms flailed on either side of Calhoun, and her little tits pressed to his thick chest. Her wire-muzzled face knocked repeatedly at his shoulder and drool whipped out of her mouth in thick spermy ropes, stuck to his shirt, faded and left a patch of wetness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all Wayne knew, the girl was Calhoun\u0027s sister or daughter. It was that kind of place. The kind that had sprung up immediately after that stuff had gotten out of a lab upstate and filled the air with bacterium that brought dead humans back to life, made their basic motor functions work and made them hungry for human flesh; made it so if a man\u0027s wife, daughter, sister, or mother went belly up and he wanted to turn a few bucks, he might think: \"Damn, that\u0027s tough about ole Betty Sue, but she\u0027s dead as hoot-owl shit and ain\u0027t gonna be needing nothing from here on out, and with them germs working around in her, she\u0027s just gonna pull herself out of the ground and cause me a problem. And the ground out back of the house is harder to dig than a calculus problem is to work, so I\u0027ll just toss her cold ass in the back of the pickup next to the chain saw and the barbed-wire roll haul her across the border and sell her to the Meat Boys to sell to the tonks for dancing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a sad thing to sell one of your own, but shit, them\u0027s the breaks. I\u0027ll just stay out of the tonks until all the meat rots off her bones and they have to throw her away. That way I won\u0027t go in some place for a drink and see her up there shaking her dead tits and end up going sentimental and dewey-eyed in front of one of my buddies or some ole two-dollar gal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis kind of thinking supplied the dancers. In other parts of the country, the dancers might be men or children, but here it was mostly women. Men were used for hunting and target practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Meat Boys took the bodies, cut off the hands so they couldn\u0027t grab, ran screws threw their jaws to fasten on wire muzzles so they couldn\u0027t bite, sold them to the honky-tonks about the time the germ started stirring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonk owners put them inside wire enclosures up front of their joints, started music, and men paid five dollars to get in there and grab them and make like they were dancing when all the women wanted to do was grab and bite, which muzzled and handless, they could not do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a man liked his partner enough, he could pay more money and have her tied to a cot in the back and he could get on her and do some business. Didn\u0027t have to hear no arguments or buy presents or make promises or make them come. Just fuck and hike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as the establishment sprayed the dead for maggots and kept them perfumed and didn\u0027t keep them so long hunks of meat came off on a fella\u0027s dick, the customers were happy as flies on shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked to see who might give him trouble, and figured everyone was a potential customer. The six foot two, two-hundred fifty pound bouncer being the most immediate concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, there wasn\u0027t anything to do but to get on with things and handle problems when they came up. He went into the cage where Calhoun was dancing, shouldered through the other dancers and went for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun had his back to Wayne, and as the music was loud, Wayne didn\u0027t worry about going quietly. But Calhoun sensed him and turned with his hand full of a little .38.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne clubbed Calhoun\u0027s arm with the barrel of the shotgun. The little gun flew out of Calhoun\u0027s hand and went skidding across the floor and clanked against the metal cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun wasn\u0027t outdone. He spun the dead girl in front of him and pulled a big pigsticker out of his boot and held it under the girl\u0027s armpit in a threatening manner, which with a knife that big was no feat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne shot the dead girl\u0027s left kneecap out from under her and she went down. Her armpit trapped Calhoun\u0027s knife. The other men deserted their partners and went over the wire netting like squirrels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Calhoun could shake the girl loose, Wayne stepped in and hit him over the head with the barrel of the shotgun. Calhoun crumpled and the girl began to crawl about on the floor as if looking for lost contacts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bouncer came in behind Wayne, grabbed him under the arms and tried to slip a full nelson on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne kicked back on the bouncer\u0027s shin and raked his boot down the man\u0027s instep and stomped his foot. The bouncer let go. Wayne turned and kicked him in the balls and hit him across the face with the shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bouncer went down and didn\u0027t even look like he wanted up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne couldn\u0027t help but note he liked the music that was playing. When he turned he had someone to dance with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun charged him, hit Wayne in the belly with his head, knocked him over the bouncer. They tumbled to the floor and the shotgun went out of Wayne\u0027s hands and scraped across the floor and hit the crawling girl in the head. She didn\u0027t even notice, just kept snaking in circles, dragging her blasted leg behind her like a skin she was trying to shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other women, partnerless, wandered about the cage. The music changed. Wayne didn\u0027t like this tune as well. Too slow. He bit Calhoun\u0027s earlobe off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun screamed and they grappled around on the floor. Calhoun got his arm around Wayne\u0027s throat and tried to choke him to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne coughed out the earlobe, lifted his leg and took the knife out of his boot. He brought it around and back and hit Calhoun in the temple with the hilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun let go of Wayne and rocked on his knees, then collapsed on top of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne got out from under him and got up and kicked him in the head a few times. When he was finished, he put the bowie in its place, got Calhoun\u0027s .38 and the shotgun. To hell with pig sticker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dead woman tried to grab him, and he shoved her away with a thrust of his palm. He got Calhoun by the collar, started pulling him toward the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaces were pressed against the wire, watching. It had been quite a show. A friendly cowboy type opened the gate for Wayne and the crowd parted as he pulled Calhoun by. One man felt helpful and chased after them and said, \"Here\u0027s his hat, Mister,\" and dropped it on Calhoun\u0027s face and it stayed there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, a professional drunk was standing between two cars taking a leak on the ground. As Wayne pulled Calhoun past, the drunk said, \"Your buddy don\u0027t look so good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look worse than that when I get him to Law Town,\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne stopped by the \u002757, emptied Calhoun\u0027s pistol and tossed it as far as he could, then took a few minutes to kick Calhoun in the ribs and ass. Calhoun grunted and farted, but didn\u0027t come to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Wayne\u0027s leg got tired, he put Calhoun in the passenger seat and handcuffed him to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went over to Calhoun\u0027s \u002762 Impala replica with the plastic bull horns mounted on the hood - which was how he had located him in the first place, by his well known car - and kicked the glass out of the window on the driver\u0027s side and used the shotgun to shoot the bull horns off. He took out his pistol and shot all the tires flat, pissed on the driver\u0027s door, and kicked a dent in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy then he was too tired to shit in the backseat, so he took some deep breaths and went back to the \u002757 and climbed in behind the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching across Calhoun, he opened the glove box and got out one of his thin, black cigars and put it in his mouth. He pushed the lighter in, and while he waited for it to heat up, he took the shotgun out of his lap and reloaded it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of men poked their heads outside of the tonk\u0027s door, and Wayne stuck the shotgun out the window and fired above their heads. They disappeared inside so fast they might have been an optical illusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne put the lighter to his cigar, picked up the wanted poster he had on the seat, and set fire to it. He thought about putting it in Calhoun\u0027s lap as a joke, but didn\u0027t. He tossed the flaming poster out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove over close to the tonk and used the remaining shotgun load to shoot at the neon ROSALITA\u0027S sign. Glass tinkled onto the tonk\u0027s roof and onto the gravel drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow if he only had a dog to kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove away from there, bound for the Cadillac Desert, and finally Law Town on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[2]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cadillacs stretched for miles, providing the only shade in the desert. They were buried nose down at a slant, almost to the windshields, and Wayne could see skeletons of some of the drivers in the car, either lodged behind the steering wheels or lying on the dashboards against the glass. The roof and hood guns had long since been removed and all the windows on the cars were rolled up, except for those that had been knocked out and vandalized by travelers, or dead folks looking for goodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of being in one of those cars with the windows rolled up in all this heat made Wayne feel even more uncomfortable than he already was. Hot as it was, he was certain even the skeletons were sweating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished pissing on the tire of the Chevy, saw the piss had almost dried. He shook the drops off, watched them fall and evaporate against the burning sand. Zipping up, he thought about Calhoun, and how when he\u0027d pulled over earlier to let the sonofabitch take a leak, he\u0027d seen there was a little metal ring through the head of his dick and a Texas emblem dangling from that. He could understand the Texas emblem, being from there himself, but he couldn\u0027t for the life of him imagine why a fella would do that to his general. Any idiot who would put a ring through the head of his pecker deserved to die, innocent or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne took off his cowboy hat and rubbed the back of his neck and ran his hand over the top of his head and back again. The sweat on his fingers was thick as lube oil, and the thinning part of his hairline was tender; the heat was cooking the hell out of his scalp, even through the brown felt of his hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he put his hat on, the sweat on his fingers was dry. He broke open the shotgun, put the shells in his pocket, opened the Chevy\u0027s back door and tossed the shotgun on the floorboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got in the front behind the wheel and the seat was hot as a griddle on his back and ass. The sun shone through the slightly tinted windows like a polished chrome hubcap; it forced him to squint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing over at Calhoun, he studied him. The fucker was asleep with his head thrown back and his black wilted hat hung precarious on his head - it looked jaunty almost. Sweat oozed down Calhoun\u0027s red face, flowed over his eyelids and around his neck, running in riverlets down the white seat covers, drying quickly. He had his left hand between his legs, clutching his balls, and his right was on the arm rest, which was the only place it could be since he was handcuffed to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne thought he ought to blow the bastard\u0027s brains out and tell God he died. The shithead certainly needed shooting, but Wayne didn\u0027t want to lose a thousand dollars off his reward. He needed every penny if he was going to get that wrecking yard he wanted. The yard was the dream that went before him like a carrot before a donkey, and he didn\u0027t want anymore delays. If he never made another trip across this goddamn desert, that would suit him fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePop would let him buy the place with the money he had now, and he could pay the rest out later. But that wasn\u0027t what he wanted to do. The bounty business had finally gone sour, and he wanted to do different. It wasn\u0027t any goddamn fun anymore. Just met the dick cheese of the earth. And when you ran the sonofabitches to ground and put the cuffs on them, you had to watch your ass till you got them turned in. Had to sleep with one eye open and a hand on your gun. It wasn\u0027t anyway to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he wanted a chance to do right by Pop. Pop had been like a father to him. When he was a kid and his mama was screwing the Mexicans across the border for the rent money, Pop would let him hang out in the yard and climb on the rusted cars and watch him fix the better ones, tune those babies so fine they purred like dick-whipped women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was older, Pop would haul him to Galveston for the whores and out to the beach to take potshots at all the ugly, fucked-up critters swimming around in the Gulf. Sometimes he\u0027d take him to Oklahoma for the Dead Roundup. It sure seemed to do the old fart good to whack those dead fuckers with a tire iron, smash their diseased brains so they\u0027d lay down for good. And it was a challenge. Cause if one of those dead buddies bit you, you could put your head between your legs and kiss your rosy ass goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne pulled out of his thoughts of Pop and the wrecking yard and turned on the stereo system. One of his favorite country-and-western tunes whispered at him. It was Billy Conteegas singing, and Wayne hummed along with the music as he drove into the welcome, if mostly ineffectual, shadows provided by the Cadillacs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy baby left me,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left me for a cow,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don\u0027t give a flying fuck,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s gone radioactive now,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, my baby left me,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeft me for a six-tittied cow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when Conteegas was getting to the good part, doing the trilling sound in his throat he was famous for, Calhoun opened his eyes and spoke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ain\u0027t it bad enough I got to put up with the fucking heat and your fucking humming without having to listen to that shit? Ain\u0027t you got no Hank Williams stuff, or maybe some of that nigger music they used to make? You know, where the coons harmonize and one of them sings like his nuts are cut off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just don\u0027t know good music when you hear it, Calhoun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun moved his free hand to his hatband, found one of his few remaining cigarettes and a match there. He struck the match on his knee, lit the smoke and coughed a few rounds. Wayne couldn\u0027t imagine how Calhoun could smoke in all this heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I may not know good music when I hear it, capon, but I damn sure know bad music when I hear it. And that\u0027s some bad music.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ain\u0027t got any kind of culture, Calhoun. You been too busy raping kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reckon a man has to have a hobby,\" Calhoun said, blowing smoke at Wayne. \"Young pussy is mine. Besides, she wasn\u0027t in diapers. Couldn\u0027t find one that young. She was thirteen. You know what they say. If they\u0027re old enough to bleed, they\u0027re old enough to breed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old they have to be for you to kill them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She got loud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Change channels, Calhoun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just passing the time of day, capon. Better watch yourself bounty hunter, when you least expect it, I\u0027ll bash your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re gonna run your mouth one time too many, Calhoun, and when you do, you\u0027re gonna finish this ride in the trunk with ants crawling on you. You ain\u0027t so priceless I won\u0027t blow you away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lucked out at the tonk, boy. But there\u0027s always tomorrow, and every day can\u0027t be like at Rosalita\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne smiled. \"Trouble is, Calhoun, you\u0027re running out of tomorrows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[3]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they drove between the Cadillacs, the sky fading like a bad bulb, Wayne looked at the cars and tried to imagine what the Chevy-Cadillac Wars had been like, and why they had been fought in this miserable desert. He had heard it was a hell of a fight, and close, but the outcome had been Chevy\u0027s and now they were the only cars Detroit made. And as far as he was concerned, that was the only thing about Detroit that was worth a damn. Cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt that way about all cities. He\u0027d just as soon lie down and let a diseased dog shit in his face than drive through one, let alone live in one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaw Town being an exception. He\u0027d go there. Not to live, but to give Calhoun to the authorities and pick up his reward. People in Law Town were always glad to see a criminal brought in. The public executions were popular and varied and brought in a steady income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast time he\u0027d been to Law Town he\u0027d bought a front-row ticket to one of the executions and watched a chronic shoplifter, a red-headed rat of a man, get pulled apart by being chained between two souped-up tractors. The execution itself was pretty brief, but there had been plenty of buildup with clowns and balloons and a big-tittied stripper who could swing her tits in either direction to boom-boom music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne had been put off by the whole thing. It wasn\u0027t organized enough and the drinks and food were expensive and the front-row seats were too close to the tractors. He had gotten to see that the red-head\u0027s insides were brighter than his hair, but some of the insides got sprinkled on his new shirt, and cold water or not, the spots hadn\u0027t come out. He had suggested to one of the management that they put up a big plastic shield so the front row wouldn\u0027t get splattered, but he doubted anything had come of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drove until it was solid dark. Wayne stopped and fed Calhoun a stick of jerky and some water from his canteen. Then he handcuffed him to the front bumper of the Chevy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See any snakes, Gila monsters, scorpions, stuff like that,\" Wayne said, \"yell out. Maybe I can get around here in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d let the fuckers run up my asshole before I\u0027d call you,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving Calhoun with his head resting on the bumper, Wayne climbed in the backseat of the Chevy and slept with one ear cocked and one eye open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore dawn Wayne got Calhoun loaded in the \u002757 and they started out. After a few minutes of sluicing through the early morning grayness, a wind started up. One of those weird desert winds that come out of nowhere. It carried grit through the air at the speed of bullets, hit the \u002757 with a sound like rabid cats scratching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sand tires crunched on through, and Wayne turned on the windshield blower, the sand wipers, and the headbeams, and kept on keeping on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was time for the sun to come up, they couldn\u0027t see it. Too much sand. It was blowing harder than ever and the blowers and wipers couldn\u0027t handle it. It was piling up. Wayne couldn\u0027t even make out the Cadillacs anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to stop when a shadowy, whalelike shape crossed in front of him and he slammed on the brakes, giving the sand tires a workout. But it wasn\u0027t enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u002757 spun around and rammed the shape on Calhoun\u0027s side. Wayne heard Calhoun yell, then felt himself thrown against the door and his head smacked metal and the outside darkness was nothing compared to the darkness into which he descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[4]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne rose out of it as quickly as he had gone down. Blood was trickling into his eyes from a slight forehead wound. He used his sleeve to wipe it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first clear sight was of a face at the window on his side; a sallow, moon-terrain face with bulging eyes and an expression like an idiot contemplating sandscrit. On the man\u0027s head was a strange, black hat with big round ears, and in the center of the hat, like a silver tumor, was the head of a large screw. Sand lashed at the face, embedded in it, struck the unblinking eyes and made the round-eared hat flap. The man paid no attention. Though still dazed, Wayne knew why. The man was one of the dead folks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked in Calhoun\u0027s direction. Calhoun\u0027s door had been mashed in and the bending metal had pinched the handcuff attached to the arm rest in two. The blow had knocked Calhoun to the center of the seat. He was holding his hand in front of him, looking at the dangling cuff and chain as if it were a silver bracelet and a line of pearls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning over the hood, cleaning the sand away from the windshield with his hands, was another of the dead folks. He too was wearing one of the round-eared hats. He pressed a wrecked face to the clean spot and looked in at Calhoun. A string of snot-green saliva ran out of his mouth and onto the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore sand was wiped away by others. Soon all the car\u0027s glass showed the pallid and rotting faces of the dead folks. They stared at Wayne and Calhoun as if they were two rare fish in an aquarium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne cocked back the hammer of the .38.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about me,\" Calhoun said. \"What am I supposed to use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your charm,\" Wayne said, and at that moment, as if by signal, the dead folk faded away from the glass, leaving one man standing on the hood holding a baseball bat. He hit the glass and it went into a thousand little stars. The bat came again and the heavens fell and the stars rained down and the sand storm screamed in on Wayne and Calhoun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead folks reappeared in full force. The one with the bat started through the hole in the windshield, unheeding of the jags of glass that ripped his ragged clothes and tore his flesh like damp cardboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne shot the batter through the head, and the man, finished, fell through, pinning Wayne\u0027s arm with his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Wayne could pull his gun free, a woman\u0027s hand reached through the hole and got hold of Wayne\u0027s collar. Other dead folks took to the glass and hammered it out with their feet and fist. Hands were all over Wayne; they felt dry and cool like leather seat covers. They pulled him over the steering wheel and dash and outside. The sand worked at his flesh like a cheese grater. He could hear Calhoun yelling, \"Eat me, motherfuckers, eat me and choke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey tossed Wayne on the hood of the \u002757. Faces leaned over him. Yellow teeth and toothless gums were very near. A road kill odor washed through his nostrils. He thought: now the feeding frenzy begins. His only consolation was that there were so many dead folks there wouldn\u0027t be enough of him left to come back from the dead. They\u0027d probably have his brain for dessert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no. They picked him up and carried him off. Next thing he knew was a clearer view of the whale-shape the \u002757 had hit. It was a yellow school bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the bus hissed open. The dead folks dumped Wayne inside on his belly and tossed his hat after him. They stepped back and the door closed, just missing Wayne\u0027s foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked up and saw a man in the driver\u0027s seat smiling at him. It wasn\u0027t a dead man. Just fat and ugly. He was probably five feet tall and bald except for a fringe of hair around his shiny bald head the color of a shit ring in a toilet bowl. He had a nose so long and dark and malignant looking it appeared as if it might fall off his face at any moment, like an overripe banana. He was wearing what Wayne first thought was a bathrobe, but proved to be a robe like that of a monk. It was old and tattered and moth-eaten and Wayne could see pale flesh through the holes. An odor wafted from the fat man that was somewhere between the smell of stale sweat, cheesy balls and an upwiped asshole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good to see you,\" the fat man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charmed,\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the back of the bus came a strange, unidentifiable sound. Wayne poked his head around the seats for a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of the aisle, about halfway back, was a nun. Or sort of a nun. Her back was to him and she wore a black-and-white nun\u0027s habit. The part that covered her head was traditional, but from there down was quite a departure from the standard attire. The outfit was cut to the middle of her thighs and she wore black fishnet stockings and thick high heels. She was slim with good legs and a high little ass that, even under the circumstances, Wayne couldn\u0027t help but appreciate. She was moving one hand above her head as if sewing the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on the seats on either side of the aisle were dead folks. They all wore the round-eared hats, and they were responsible for the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were trying to sing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never known dead folks to make any noise outside of grunts and groans, but here they were singing. A toneless sort of singing to be sure, some of the words garbled and some of the dead folks just opening and closing their mouths soundlessly, but, by golly, he recognized the tune. It was \"Jesus Loves Me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked back at the fat man, let his hand ease down to the bowie in his right boot. The fat man produced a little .32 automatic from inside his robe and pointed at Wayne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s small caliber,\" the fat man said, \"but I\u0027m a real fine shot, and it makes a nice, little hole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne quit reaching in his boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s all right,\" said the fat man. \"Take the knife out and put it on the floor in front of you and slide it to me. And while you\u0027re at it, I think I see the hilt of one in your other boot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked back. The way he had been thrown inside the bus had caused his pants legs to hike up over his boots, and the hilts of both his bowie\u0027s were revealed. They might as well have had blinking lights on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was shaping up to be a shitty day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid the bowies to the fat man, who scooped them up nimbly and dumped them on the other side of his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bus door opened and Calhoun was tossed in on top of Wayne. Calhoun\u0027s hat followed after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne shrugged Calhoun off, recovered his hat, and put it on. Calhoun found his hat and did the same. They were still on their knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you gentleman mind moving to the center of the bus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne led the way. Calhoun took note of the nun now, said, \"Man, look at that ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat man called back to them. \"Right there will do fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne slid into the seat the fat man was indicating with a wave of the .32, and Calhoun slid in beside him. The dead folks entered now, filled the seats up front, leaving only a few stray seats in the middle empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun said, \"What are those fuckers back there making that noise for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re singing,\" Wayne said. \"Ain\u0027t you got no churchin\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say they are.\" Calhoun turned to the nun and the dead folks and yelled, \"Ya\u0027ll know any Hank Williams?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun did not turn and the dead folks did not quit their toneless singing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess not,\" Calhoun said. \"Seems like all the good music\u0027s been forgotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise in the back of the bus ceased and the nun came over to look at Wayne and Calhoun. She was nice in front too. The outfit was cut from throat to crotch, laced with a ribbon, and it showed a lot of tit and some tight, thin, black panties that couldn\u0027t quite hold in her escaping pubic hair, which grew as thick and wild as kudzu. When Wayne managed to work his eyes up from that and look at her face, he saw she was dark-complected with eyes the color of coffee and lips made to chew on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun never made it to the face. He didn\u0027t care about faces. He sniffed, said into her crotch, \"Nice snatch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun\u0027s left hand came around and smacked Calhoun on the side of the head. He grabbed her wrist, said, \"Nice arm, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun did a magic act with her right hand; it went behind her back and hiked up her outfit and came back with a double-barreled derringer. She pressed it against Calhoun\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne bent forward, hoping she wouldn\u0027t shoot. At that range the bullet might go through Calhoun\u0027s head and hit him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t miss,\" the nun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun smiled. \"No you can\u0027t,\" he said, and let go of her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat down across from them, smiled, and crossed her legs high. Wayne felt his Levis snake swell and crawl against the inside of his thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey,\" Calhoun said, \"you\u0027re almost worth taking a bullet for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun didn\u0027t quit smiling. The bus cranked up. The sand blowers and wipers went to work, and the windshield turned blue, and a white dot moved on it between a series of smaller white dots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRadar. Wayne had seen that sort of thing on desert vehicles. If he lived through this and got his car back, maybe he\u0027d rig up something like that. And maybe not, he was sick of the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever, at the moment, future plans seemed a little out of place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something else occurred to him. Radar. That meant these bastards had known they were coming and had pulled out in front of them on purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned over the seat and checked where he figured the \u002757 hit the bus. He didn\u0027t see a single dent. Armored, most likely. Most school buses were these days, and that\u0027s what this had been. It probably had bullet-proof-glass and puncture-proof sand tires too. School buses had gone that way on account of the race riots and the sending of mutated calves to school just like they were humans. And because of the Codgers - old farts who believed kids ought to be fair game to adults for sexual purposes, or for knocking around when they wanted to let off some tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about unlocking this cuff?\" Calhoun said. \"It ain\u0027t for shit now anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked at the nun. \"I\u0027m going for the cuff key in my pants. Don\u0027t shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne fished it out, unlocked the cuff, and Calhoun let it slide to the floor. Wayne saw the nun was curious and he said, \"I\u0027m a bounty hunter. Help me get this man to Law Town and I could see you earn a little something for your troubles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the spirit,\" Calhoun said. \"I like a nun that minds her own business... You a real nun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always talk so much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne said, \"I\u0027ve never seen a nun like you. Not dressed like that and with a gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are a small and special order,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You some kind of Sunday school teacher for these dead folks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But with them dead, ain\u0027t it kind of pointless? They ain\u0027t got no souls now, do they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but their work adds to the glory of God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their work?\" Wayne looked at the dead folks sitting stiffly in their seats. He noted that one of them was about to lose a rotten ear. He sniffed. \"They may be adding to the glory of God, but they don\u0027t do much for the air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun reached into a pocket on her habit and took out two round objects. She tossed one to Calhoun, and one to Wayne. \"Menthol lozenges. They help you stand the smell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne unwrapped the lozenge and sucked on it. It did help overpower the smell, but the menthol wasn\u0027t all that great either. It reminded him of being sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What order are you?\" Wayne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Loved Mary,\" the nun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His mama?\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary Magdalene. We think he fucked her. They were lovers. There\u0027s evidence in the scriptures. She was a harlot and we have modeled ourselves on her. She gave up that life and became a harlot for Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hate to break it to you, sister,\" Calhoun said, \"but that do-gooder Jesus is as dead as a post. If you\u0027re waiting for him to slap the meat to you, that sweet thing of yours is going to dry up and blow away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the news,\" the nun said. \"But we don\u0027t fuck him in person. We fuck him in spirit. We let the spirit enter into men so they may take us in the fashion Jesus took Mary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I think I feel the old boy moving around inside me now. Why don\u0027t you shuck them drawers, honey, throw back in that seat there and let ole Calhoun give you a big load of Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun shifted in the nun\u0027s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed the derringer at him, said, \"Stay where you are. If it were so, if you were full of Jesus, I would let you have me in a moment. But you\u0027re full of the Devil, not Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, sister, give ole Devil a break. He\u0027s a fun kind of guy. Let\u0027s you and me mount up... Well, be like that. But if you change your mind, I can get religion at a moment\u0027s notice. I dearly love to fuck. I\u0027ve fucked everything I could get my hands on but a parakeet, and I\u0027d have fucked that little bitch if I could have found the hole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never known any dead folks to be trained,\" Wayne said, trying to get the nun talking in a direction that might help, a direction that would let him know what was going on and what sort of trouble he had fallen into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I said, we are a very special order. Brother Lazarus,\" she waved a hand at the bus driver, and without looking he lifted a hand in acknowledgement, \"is the founder. I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll mind if I tell his story, explain about us, what we do and why. It\u0027s important that we spread the word to the heathens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call me no fucking heathen,\" Calhoun said. \"This is heathen, riding around in a fucking bus with a bunch of stinking dead folks with funny hats on. Hell, they can\u0027t even carry a tune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun ignored him. \"Brother Lazarus was once known by another name, but that name no longer matters. He was a research scientist, and he was one of those who worked in the laboratory where the germs escaped into the air and made it so the dead could not truly die as long as they had an undamaged brain in their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brother Lazarus was carrying a dish of the experiment, the germs, and as a joke, one of the lab assistants pretended to trip him, and he, not knowing it was a joke, dodged the assistant\u0027s leg and dropped the dish. In a moment, the air conditioning system had blown the germs throughout the research center. Someone opened a door, and the germs were loose on the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brother Lazarus was consumed by guilt. Not only because he dropped the dish, but because he helped create it in the first place. He quit his job at the laboratory, took to wandering the country. He came out here with nothing more than basic food, water and books. Among these books was the Bible, and the lost books of the Bible: the Apocrypha and the many cast-out chapters of the New Testament. As he studied, it occurred to him that these cast out books actually belonged. He was able to interpret their higher meaning, and an angel came to him in a dream and told him of another book, and Brother Lazarus took up his pen and recorded the angel\u0027s words, direct from God, and in this book, all the mysteries were explained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like screwing Jesus,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like screwing Jesus, and not being afraid of words that mean sex. Not being afraid of seeing Jesus as both God and man. Seeing that sex, if meant for Christ and the opening of the mind, can be a thrilling and religious experience, not just the rutting of two savage animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brother Lazarus roamed the desert, the mountains, thinking of the things the Lord had revealed to him, and lo and behold, the Lord revealed yet another thing to him. Brother Lazarus found a great amusement park.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t know Jesus went in for rides and such,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was long deserted. It had once been part of a place called Disneyland. Brother Lazarus knew of it. There had been several of these Disneylands built about the country, and this one had been in the midst of the Chevy-Cadillac Wars, and had been destroyed and sand had covered most of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun held out her arms. \"And in this rubble, he saw a new beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool off, baby,\" Calhoun said, \"before you have a stroke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He gathered to him men and women of a like mind and taught the gospel to them. The Old Testament. The New Testament. The Lost Books. And his own Book of Lazarus, for he had begun to call himself Lazarus. A symbolic name signifying a new beginning, a rising from the dead and coming to life and seeing things as they really are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun moved her hands rapidly, expressively as she talked. Sweat beaded on her forehead and upper lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he returned to his skills as a scientist, but applied them to a higher purpose - God\u0027s purpose. And as Brother Lazarus, he realized the use of the dead. They could be taught to work and build a great monument to the glory of God. And this monument, this coed institution of monks and nuns, would be called Jesus Land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the word \"Jesus,\" the nun gave her voice an extra trill, and the dead folks, cued, said together, \"Eees num be prased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell did you train them dead folks?\" Calhoun said. \"Dog treats?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Science put to the use of our Lord Jesus Christ, that\u0027s how. Brother Lazarus made a special device he could insert directly into the brains of dead folks, through the tops of their heads, and the device controls certain cravings. Makes them passive and responsive - at least to simple commands. With the regulator, as Brother Lazarus calls the device, we have been able to do much positive work with the dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you find these dead folks?\" Wayne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We buy them from the Meat Boys. We save them from amoral purposes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They ought to be shot through the head and put in the goddamn ground,\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If our use of the regulator and the dead folks was merely to better ourselves, I would agree. But it is not. We do the Lord\u0027s work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do the monks fuck the sisters?\" Calhoun asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When possessed by the Spirit of Christ. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I bet they get possessed a lot. Not a bad setup. Dead folks to do the work on the amusement park - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t an amusement park now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - and plenty of free pussy. Sounds cozy. I like it. Old shithead up there\u0027s smarter than he looks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is nothing selfish about our motives or those of Brother Lazarus. In fact, as penance for loosing the germ on the world in the first place, Brother Lazarus injected a virus into his nose. It is rotting slowly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought that was quite a snorkel he had on him,\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take it back,\" Calhoun said. \"He isas dumb as he looks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do the dead folks wear those silly hats?\" Wayne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brother Lazarus found a storeroom of them at the site of the old amusement park. They are mouse ears. They represent some cartoon animal that was popular once and part of Disneyland. Mickey Mouse, he was called. This way we know which dead folks are ours, and which ones are not controlled by our regulators. From time to time, stray dead folks wander into our area. Murder victims. Children abandoned in the desert. People crossing the desert who died of heat or illness. We\u0027ve had some of the sisters and brothers attacked. The hats are a precaution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s the deal with us?\" Wayne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun smiled sweetly. \"You, my children, are to add to the glory of God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Children?\" Calhoun said. \"You call an alligator a lizard, bitch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun slid back in the seat and rested the derringer in her lap. She pulled her legs into a cocked position, causing her panties to crease in the valley of her vagina; it looked like a nice place to visit, that valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne turned from the beauty of it and put his head back and closed his eyes, pulled his hat down over them. There was nothing he could do at the moment, and since the nun was watching Calhoun for him, he\u0027d sleep, store up and figure what to do next. If anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drifted off to sleep wondering what the nun meant by, \"You, my children, are to add to the glory of God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a feeling that when he found out, he wasn\u0027t going to like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[5]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe awoke off and on and saw that the sunlight filtering through the storm had given everything a greenish color. Calhoun seeing he was awake, said, \"Ain\u0027t that a pretty color? I had a shirt that color once and liked it lots, but I got in a fight with this Mexican whore with a wooden leg over some money and she tore her. I punched that little bean bandit good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for sharing that,\" Wayne said, and went back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach time he awoke it was brighter, and finally he awoke to the sun going down and the storm having died out. But he didn\u0027t stay awake. He forced himself to close his eyes and store up more energy. To help him nod off he listened to the hum of the motor and thought about the wrecking yard and Pop and all the fun they could have, just drinking beer and playing cars and fucking the border women, and maybe some of those mutated cows they had over there for sell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNah. Nix the cows, or any of those genetically altered critters. A man had to draw the line somewhere, and he drew it at fucking critters, even if they had been bred so that they had human traits. You had to have some standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourse, those standards had a way of eroding. He remembered when he said he\u0027d only fuck the pretty ones. His last whore had been downright scary looking. If he didn\u0027t watch himself he\u0027d be as bad as Calhoun, trying to find the hole in a parakeet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe awoke to Calhoun\u0027s elbow in his ribs and the nun was standing beside their seat with the derringer. Wayne knew she hadn\u0027t slept, but she looked bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. She nodded toward their window, said, \"Jesus Land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had put that special touch in her voice again, and the dead folks responded with, \"Eees num be prased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was good and dark now, a crisp night with a big moon the color of hammered brass. The bus sailed across the white sand like a mystical schooner with a full wind in its sails. It went up an impossible hill toward what looked like an aurora borealis, then dove into an atomic rainbow of colors that filled the bus with fairy lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Wayne\u0027s eyes became accustomed to the lights, and the bus took a right turn along a precarious curve, he glanced down into the valley. An aerial view couldn\u0027t have been any better than the view from his window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown there was a universe of polished metal and twisted neon. In the center of the valley was a great statue of Jesus crucified that must have been twenty-five stories high. Most of the body was made of bright metals and multicolored neon, and much of the light was coming from that. There was a crown of barbed wire wound several times around a chromium plate of a forehead and some rust-colored strands of neon hair. The savior\u0027s eyes were huge, green strobes that swung left and right with the precision of an oscillating fan. There was an ear to ear smile on the savior\u0027s face and the teeth were slats of sparkling metal with wide cavity-black gaps between them. The statue was equipped with a massive dick of polished, interwoven cables and coils of neon; the dick was thicker and more solid looking than the arthritic steel-tube legs on either side of it; the head of it was made of an enormous spotlight that pulsed the color of irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bus went around and around the valley, descending like a dead roach going down a slow drain, and finally the road rolled out straight and took them into Jesus Land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed through the legs of Jesus, under the throbbing head of his cock, toward what looked like a small castle of polished gold bricks with an upright drawbridge interlayed with jewels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe castle was only one of several tall structures that appeared to be made of rare metals and precious stones: gold, silver, emeralds, rubies and sapphires. But the closer they got to the buildings, the less fine they looked and the more they looked like what they were: stucco, cardboard, phosphorescent paint, colored spotlights, and bands of neon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff to the left Wayne could see a long, open shed full of vehicles, most of them old school buses. And there were unlighted hovels made of tin and tar paper; homes for the dead, perhaps. Behind the shacks and the bus barn rose skeletal shapes that stretched tall and bleak against the sky and the candy-gem lights; shapes that looked like the bony remains of beached whales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the right, Wayne glimpsed a building with an open front that served as a stage. In front of the stage were chairs filled with monks and nuns. On the stage, six monks - one behind a drum set, one with a saxophone, the others with guitars - were blasting out a loud, rocking rhythm that made the bus shake. A nun with the front of her habit thrown open, her headpiece discarded, sang into a microphone with a voice like a suffering angel. The voice screeched out of the amplifiers and came in through the windows of the bus, crushing the sound of the engine. The nun crowed \"Jesus\" so long and hard it sounded like a plea from hell. Then she lept up and came down doing the splits, the impact driving her back to her feet as if her ass had been loaded with springs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bet that bitch can pick up a quarter with that thing,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Lazarus touched a button, the pseudo-jeweled drawbridge lowered over a narrow moat, and he drove them inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t as well lighted in there. The walls were bleak and gray. Brother Lazarus stopped the bus and got off, and another monk came on board. He was tall and thin and had crooked buck teeth that dented his bottom lip. He also had a twelve-gauge pump shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Brother Fred,\" the nun said. \"He will be your tour guide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Fred forced Wayne and Calhoun off the bus, away from the dead folks in their mouse-ear hats and the nun in her tight, black panties, jabbed them along a dark corridor, up a swirl of stairs and down a longer corridor with open doors on either side and rooms filled with dark and light and spoiled meat and guts on hooks and skulls and bones lying about like discarded walnut shells and broken sticks; rooms full of dead folks (truly dead) stacked neat as firewood, and rooms full of stone shelves stuffed with beakers of fiery-red and sewer green and sky blue and piss yellow liquids, as well as glass coils through which other colored fluids fled as if chased, smoked as if nervous, and ran into big flasks as if relieved; rooms with platforms and tables and boxes and stools and chairs covered with instruments or dead folks or dead-folk pieces or the asses of monks and nuns as they sat and held charts or tubes or body parts and frowned at them with concentration, lips pursed as if about to explode with some earth-shattering pronouncement; and finally they came to a little room with a tall, glassless window that looked out upon the bright, shiny mess that was Jesus Land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was simple. Table, two chairs, two beds - one on either side of the room. The walls were stone and unadorned. To the right was a little bathroom without a door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne walked to the window and looked out at Jesus Land pulsing and thumping like a desperate heart. He listened to the music a moment, leaned over and stuck his head outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were high up and there was nothing but a straight drop. If you jumped, you\u0027d wind up with the heels of your boots under your tonsils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne let out a whistle in appreciation of the drop. Brother Fred thought it was a compliment for Jesus Land. He said, \"It\u0027s a miracle, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miracle?\" Calhoun said. \"This goony light show? This ain\u0027t no miracle. This is for shit. Get that nun on the bus back there to bend over and shit a perfectly round turd through a hoop at twenty paces, and I\u0027ll call that a miracle, Mr. Fucked-up Teeth. But this Jesus Land crap is the dumbest, fucking idea since dog sweaters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And look at this place. You could use some knick-knacks or something in here. A picture of some ole naked gal doing a donkey, couple of pigs fucking. Anything. And a door on the shitter would be nice. I hate to be straining out a big one and know someone can look in on me. It ain\u0027t decent. A man ought to have his fucking grunts in private. This place reminds me of a motel I stayed at in Waco one night, and I made the goddamn manager give me my money back. The roaches in that shit hole were big enough to use the shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Fred listened to all this without blinking an eye, as if seeing Calhoun talk was as amazing as seeing a frog sing. He said, \"Sleep tight, don\u0027t let the bed bugs bite. Tomorrow you start to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want no fucking job,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodnight, children,\" Brother Fred said, and with that he closed the door and they heard it lock, loud and final as the clicking of the drop board on a gallows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt dawn, Wayne got up and took a leak, went to the window to look out. The stage where the monks had played and the nun had jumped was empty. The skeletal shapes he had seen last night were tracks and frames from rides long abandoned. He had a sudden vision of Jesus and his disciples riding a roller coaster, their long hair and robes flapping in the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large crucified Jesus looked unimpressive without its lights and night\u0027s mystery, like a whore in harsh sunlight with makeup gone and wig askew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got any ideas how we\u0027re gonna get out of here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked at Calhoun. He was sitting on the bed, pulling on his boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could use a smoke. You know, I think we ought to work together. Then we can try to kill each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnconsciously, Calhoun touched his ear where Wayne had bitten off the lobe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t trust you as far as I could kick you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear that. But I give my word. And my word\u0027s something you can count on. I won\u0027t twist it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne studied Calhoun, thought: Well, there wasn\u0027t anything to lose. He\u0027d just watch his ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Wayne said. \"Give me your word you\u0027ll work with me on getting us out of this mess, and when we\u0027re good and free, and you say your word has gone far enough, we can settle up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deal,\" Calhoun said, and offered his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This seals it,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne took Calhoun\u0027s hand and they shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[7]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later the door unlocked and a smiling monk with hair the color and texture of mold fuzz came in with Brother Fred, who still had his pump shotgun. There were two dead folks with them. A man and a woman. They wore torn clothes and the mouse-ear hats. Neither looked long dead or smelled particularly bad. Actually, the monks smelled worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the barrel of the shotgun, Brother Fred poked them down the hall to a room with metal tables and medical instruments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Lazarus was on the far side of one of the tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was smiling. His nose looked especially cancerous this morning. A white pustle the size of a thumb tip had taken up residence on the left side of his snout, and it looked like a pearl onion in a turd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby stood a nun. She was short with good, if skinny, legs, and she wore the same outfit as the nun on the bus. It looked more girlish on her, perhaps because she was thin and small-breasted. She had a nice face and eyes that were all pupil. Wisps of blond hair crawled out around the edges of her headgear. She looked pale and weak, as if wearied to the bone. There was a birthmark on her right cheek that looked like a distant view of a small bird in flight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning,\" Brother Lazarus said. \"I hope you gentlemen slept well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this about work?\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Work?\" Brother Lazarus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I described it to them that way,\" Brother Fred said. \"Perhaps an impulsive description.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll say,\" Brother Lazarus said. \"No work here, gentlemen. You have my word on that. We do all the work. Lie on these tables and we\u0027ll take a sampling of your blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Science,\" Brother Lazarus said. \"I intend to find a cure for this germ that makes the dead come back to life, and to do that, I need living human beings to study. Sounds kind of mad scientist, doesn\u0027t it? But I assure you, you\u0027ve nothing to lose but a few drops of blood. Well, maybe more than a few drops, but nothing serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use your own goddamn blood,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do. But we\u0027re always looking for fresh specimens. Little here, little there. And if you don\u0027t do it, we\u0027ll kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun spun and hit Brother Fred on the nose. It was a solid punch and Brother Fred hit the floor on his butt, but he hung on to the shotgun and pointed it up at Calhoun. \"Go on,\" he said, his nose streaming blood. \"Try that again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne flexed to help, but hesitated. He could kick Brother Fred in the head from where he was, but that might not keep him from shooting Calhoun, and there would go the extra reward money. And besides, he\u0027d given his word to the bastard that they\u0027d try and help each other survive until they got out of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other monk clasped his hands and swung them into the side of Calhoun\u0027s head, knocking him down. Brother Fred got up, and while Calhoun was trying to rise, he hit him with the stock of the shotgun in the back of the head, hit him so hard it drove Calhoun\u0027s forehead into the floor. Calhoun rolled over on his side and lay there, his eyes fluttering like moth wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brother Fred, you must learn to turn the other cheek,\" Brother Lazarus said. \"Now put this sack of shit on the table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Fred checked Wayne to see if he looked like trouble. Wayne put his hands in his pockets and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Fred called the two dead folks over and had them put Calhoun on the table. Brother Lazarus strapped him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun brought a tray of needles, syringes, cotton and bottles over, put it down on the table next to Calhoun\u0027s head. Brother Lazarus rolled up Calhoun\u0027s sleeve and fixed up a needle and stuck it in Calhoun\u0027s arm, drew it full of blood. He stuck the needle through the rubber top of one of the bottles and shot the blood into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Wayne and said, \"I hope you\u0027ll be less trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I get some orange juice and a little cracker afterwards?\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get to walk out without a knot on your head,\" Brother Lazarus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess that\u0027ll have to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne got on the table next to Calhoun and Brother Lazarus strapped him down. The nun brought the tray over and Brother Lazarus did to him what he had done to Calhoun. The nun stood over Wayne and looked down at his face. Wayne tried to read something in her features but couldn\u0027t find a clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Brother Lazarus was finished he took hold of Wayne\u0027s chin and shook it. \"My, but you two boys look healthy. But you can never be sure. We\u0027ll have to run the blood through some tests. Meantime, Sister Worth will run a few additional tests on you, and,\" he nodded at the unconscious Calhoun, \"I\u0027ll see to your friend here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s no friend of mine,\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took Wayne off the table, and Sister Worth and Brother Fred and his shotgun, directed him down the hall into another room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was lined with shelves that were lined with instruments and bottles. The lighting was poor, most of it coming through a slatted window, though there was an anemic yellow bulb overhead. Dust motes swam in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the center of the room on its rim was a great, spoked wheel. It had two straps well spaced at the top, and two more at the bottom. Beneath the bottom straps were blocks of wood. The wheel was attached in back to an upright metal bar that had switches and buttons all over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Fred made Wayne strip and get up on the wheel with his back to the hub and his feet on the blocks. Sister Worth strapped his ankles down tight, then he was made to put his hands up, and she strapped his wrists to the upper part of the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope this hurts a lot,\" Brother Fred said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wipe the blood off your face,\" Wayne said. \"It makes you look silly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Fred made a gesture with his middle finger that wasn\u0027t religious and left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[8]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Worth touched a switch and the wheel began to spin, slowly at first, and the bad light came through the windows and poked through the rungs and the dust swam before his eyes and the wheel and its spokes threw twisting shadows on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he went around, Wayne closed his eyes. It kept him from feeling so dizzy, especially on the down swings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a turn up, he opened his eyes and caught sight of Sister Worth standing in front of the wheel staring at him. He said, \"Why?\" and closed his eyes as the wheel dipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Brother Lazarus says so,\" came the answer after such a long time Wayne had almost forgotten the question. Actually, he hadn\u0027t expected a response. He was surprised that such a thing had come out of his mouth, and he felt a little diminished for having asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes on another swing up, and she was moving behind the wheel, out of his line of vision. He heard a snick like a switch being flipped and lightning jumped through him and he screamed in spite of himself. A little fork of electricity licked out of his mouth like a reptile tongue tasting air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaster spun the wheel and the jolts came more often and he screamed less loud, and finally not at all. He was too numb. He was adrift in space wearing only his cowboy hat and boots, moving away from earth very fast. Floating all around him were wrecked cars. He looked and saw that one of them was his \u002757, and behind the steering wheel was Pop. Sitting beside the old man was a Mexican whore. Two more were in the backseat. They looked a little drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the whores in back pulled up her dress and pressed her naked ass against the window, cocked it high up so he could see her pussy. It looked like a taco that needed a shave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and tried to go for it, but the \u002757 was moving away, swinging wide and turning its tail to him. He could see a face at the back window. Pop\u0027s face. He had crawled back there and was waving slowly and sadly. A whore pulled Pop from view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wrecked cars moved away too, as if caught in the vacuum of the \u002757\u0027s retreat. Wayne swam with his arms, kicked with his legs, trying to pursue the \u002757 and the wrecks. But he dangled where he was, like a moth pinned to a board. The cars moved out of sight and left him there with his arms and legs stretched out, spinning amidst an infinity of cold, uncaring stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...how the tests are run... marks everything about you... charts it... EKG, brain waves, liver... everything... it hurts because Brother Lazarus wants it to... thinks I don\u0027t know these things... that I\u0027m slow... I\u0027m slow, not stupid... smart really... used to be a scientist... before the accident... Brother Lazarus is not holy... he\u0027s mad... made the wheel because of the Holy Inquisition... knows a lot about the Inquisition... thinks we need it again... for the likes of men like you... the unholy, he says... But he just likes to hurt... I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne opened his eyes. The wheel had stopped. Sister Worth was talking in her monotone, explaining the wheel. He remembered asking her \"Why\" about three thousand years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Worth was staring at him again. She went away and he expected the wheel to start up, but when she returned, she had a long, narrow mirror under her arm. She put it against the wall across from him. She got on the wheel with him, her little feet on the wooden platforms beside his. She hiked up the bottom of her habit and pulled down her black panties. She put her face close to his, as if searching for something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He plans to take your body... piece by piece... blood, cells, brain, your cock... all of it... He wants to live forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had her panties in her hand, and she tossed them. Wayne watched them fly up and flutter to the floor like a dying bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took hold of his dick and pulled on it. Her palms was cold and he didn\u0027t feel his best, but he began to get hard. She put him between her legs and rubbed his dick between her thighs. They were as cold as her hands, and dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know him now... know what he\u0027s doing... the dead germ virus... he was trying to make something that would make him live forever... it made the dead come back... didn\u0027t keep the living alive, free of old age...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dick was throbbing now, in spite of the coolness of her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He cuts up dead folks to learn... experiments on them... but the secret of eternal life is with the living... that\u0027s why he wants you... you\u0027re an outsider... those who live here he can test... but he must keep them alive to do his bidding... not let them know how he really is... needs your insides and the other man\u0027s... he wants to be a God... flies high above us in a little plane and looks down... Likes to think he is the creator, I bet...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ultra-light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed his cock inside her, and it was cold and dry in there, like liver left overnight on a drainboard. Still, he found himself ready. At this point, he would have gouged a hole in a turnip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed him on the ear and alongside the neck; cold little kisses, dry as toast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...thinks I don\u0027t know... But I know he doesn\u0027t love Jesus... He loves himself, and power... He\u0027s sad about his nose...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did it in a moment of religious fever... before he lost the belief... Now he wants to be what he was... A scientist. He wants to grow a new nose... knows how... saw him grow a finger in a dish once... grew it from the skin off a knuckle of one of the brothers... He can do all kinds of things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was moving her hips now. He could see over her shoulder into the mirror against the wall. Could see her white ass rolling, the black habit hiked up above it, threatening to drop like a curtain. He began to thrust back, slowly, firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked over her shoulder into the mirror, watching herself fuck him. There was a look more of study than rapture on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to feel alive,\" she said. \"Feel a good, hard dick... Been too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing the best I can,\" Wayne said. \"This ain\u0027t the most romantic of spots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Push so I can feel it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice,\" Wayne said. He gave it everything he had. He was beginning to lose his erection. He felt as if he were auditioning for a job and not making the best of impressions. He felt like a knothole would be dissatisfied with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got off of him and climbed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t blame you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went behind the wheel and touched some things on the upright. She mounted him again, hooked her ankles behind his. The wheel began to turn. Short electrical shocks leaped through him. They weren\u0027t as powerful as before. They were invigorating. When he kissed her it was like touching his tongue to a battery. It felt as if electricity was racing through his veins and flying out the head of his dick; he felt as if he might fill her with lightning instead of come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wheel creaked to a stop; it must have had a timer on it. They were upside down and Wayne could see their reflection in the mirror; they looked like two lizards fucking on a window pane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t tell if she had finished or not, so he went ahead and got it over with. Without the electricity he was losing his desire. It hadn\u0027t been an A-one piece of ass, but hell, as Pop always said, \"Worse pussy I ever had was good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll be coming back,\" she said. \"Soon... Don\u0027t want them to find us like this... Other test to do yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want out of the order... Want out of this desert... I want to live... And I want you to help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m game, but the blood is rushing to my head and I\u0027m getting dizzy. Maybe you ought to get off me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter an eon she said, \"I have a plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe untwined from him and went behind the wheel and hit a switch that turned Wayne upright. She touched another switch and he began to spin slowly, and while he spun and while lightning played inside him, she told him her plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[9]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think ole Brother Fred wants to fuck me,\" Calhoun said. \"He keeps trying to get his finger up my asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were back in their room. Brother Fred had brought them back, making them carry their clothes, and now they were alone again, dressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re getting out of here,\" Wayne said. \"The nun, Sister Worth, she\u0027s going to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s her angle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She hates this place and wants my dick. Mostly, she hates this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne told him first what Brother Lazarus had planned. On the morrow he would have them brought to the room with the steel tables, and they would go on the tables, and if the tests had turned out good, they would be pronounced fit as fiddles and Brother Lazarus would strip the skin from their bodies, slowly, because according to Sister Worth he liked to do it that way, and he would drain their blood and percolate it into his formulas like coffee, cut their brains out and put them in vats and store their veins and organs in freezers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this would be done in the name of God and Jesus Christ (Eees num be prased) under the guise of finding a cure for the dead folks germ. But it would all instead be for Brother Lazarus who wanted to have a new nose, fly his ultra-light above Jesus Land and live forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Worth\u0027s plan was this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would be in the dissecting room. She would have guns hidden. She would make the first move, a distraction, then it was up to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This time,\" Wayne said, \"one of us has to get on top of that shotgun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had your finger up your ass in there today, or we\u0027d have had them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to have surprise on our side this time. Real surprise. They won\u0027t be expecting Sister Worth. We can get up there on the roof and take off in that ultra-light. When it runs out of gas we can walk, maybe get back to the \u002757 and hope it runs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll settle our score then. Who ever wins keeps the car and the split tail. As for tomorrow, I\u0027ve got a little ace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun pulled on his boots. He twisted the heel of one of them. It swung out and a little knife dropped into his hand. \"It\u0027s sharp,\" Calhoun said. \"I cut a Chinaman from gut to gill with it. It was easy as sliding a stick through fresh shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been nice if you\u0027d had that ready today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to scout things out first. And to tell the truth, I thought one pop to Brother Fred\u0027s mouth and he\u0027d be out of the picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hit him in the nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, goddammit, but I was aiming for his mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn and the room with the metal tables looked the same. No one had brought in a vase of flowers to brighten the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Lazarus\u0027s nose had changed however; there were two pearl onions nestled in it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Worth, looking only a little more animated than yesterday, stood nearby. She was holding the tray with the instruments. This time the tray was full of scalpels. The light caught their edges and made them wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Fred was standing behind Calhoun, and Brother Mold Fuzz was behind Wayne. They must have felt pretty confident today. They had dispensed with the dead folks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked at Sister Worth and thought maybe things were not good. Maybe she had lied to him in her slow talking way. Only wanted a little dick and wanted to keep it quiet. To do that, she might have promised anything. She might not care what Brother Lazarus did to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it looked like a double cross, Wayne was going to go for it. If he had to jump right into the mouth of Brother Fred\u0027s shotgun. That was a better way to go than having the hide peeled from your body. The idea of Brother Lazarus and his ugly nose leaning over him did not appeal at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s so nice to see you,\" Brother Lazarus said. \"I hope we\u0027ll have none of the unpleasantness of yesterday. Now, on the tables.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne looked at Sister Worth. Her expression showed nothing. The only thing about her that looked alive was the bent wings of the bird birthmark on her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, Wayne thought, I\u0027ll go as far as the table, then I\u0027m going to do something. Even if it\u0027s wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step forward, and Sister Worth flipped the contents of the tray into Brother Lazarus\u0027s face. A scalpel went into his nose and hung there. The tray and the rest of its contents hit the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Brother Lazarus could yelp, Calhoun dropped and wheeled. He was under Brother Fred\u0027s shotgun and he used his forearm to drive the barrel upwards. The gun went off and peppered the ceiling. Plaster sprinkled down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun had concealed the little knife in the palm of his hand and he brought it up and into Brother Fred\u0027s groin. The blade went through the robe and buried to the hilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant Calhoun made his move, Wayne brought his forearm back and around into Brother Mold Fuzz\u0027s throat, then turned and caught his head and jerked that down and kneed him a couple of times. He floored him by driving an elbow into the back of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun had the shotgun now, and Brother Fred was on the floor trying to pull the knife out of his balls. Calhoun blew Brother Fred\u0027s head off, then did the same for Brother Mold Fuzz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Lazarus, the scalpel still hanging from his nose, tried to run for it, but he stepped on the tray and that sent him flying. He landed on his stomach. Calhoun took two deep steps and kicked him in the throat. Brother Lazarus made a sound like he was gargling and tried to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne helped him. He grabbed Brother Lazarus by the back of his robe and pulled him up, slammed him back against a table. The scalpel still dangled from the monk\u0027s nose. Wayne grabbed it and jerked, taking away a chunk of nose as he did. Brother Lazarus screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun put the shotgun in Brother Lazarus\u0027s mouth and that made him stop screaming. Calhoun pumped the shotgun. He said, \"Eat it,\" and pulled the trigger. Brother Lazarus\u0027s brains went out the back of his head riding on a chunk of skull. The brains and skull hit the table and sailed onto the floor like a plate of scrambled eggs pushed the length of a cafe counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Worth had not moved. Wayne figured she had used all of her concentration to hit Brother Lazarus with the tray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you\u0027d have guns,\" Wayne said to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her back to him and lifted her habit. In a belt above her panties were two .38 revolvers. Wayne pulled them out and held one in each hand. \"Two-Gun Wayne,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the ultra-light?\" Calhoun said. \"We\u0027ve made enough noise for a prison riot. We need to move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Worth turned to the door at the back of the room, and before she could say anything or lead, Wayne and Calhoun snapped to it and grabbed her and pushed her toward it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were stairs on the other side of the door and they took them two at a time. They went through a trap door and onto the roof and there, tied down with bungie straps to metal hoops, was the ultra-light. It was blue-and-white canvas and metal rods, and strapped to either side of it was a twelve-gauge pump and a bag of food and a canteen of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey unsnapped the roof straps and got in the two seater and used the straps to fasten Sister Worth between them. It wasn\u0027t comfortable, but it was a ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat there. After a moment, Calhoun said, \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" Wayne said. \"I can\u0027t fly this thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked at Sister Worth. She was staring at the controls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say something, dammit,\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the switch,\" she said. \"That stick... forward is up, back brings the nose down... side to side...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well shoot this bastard over the side,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne cranked it, gave it the throttle. The machine rolled forward, wobbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too much weight,\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Throw the cunt over the side,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all or nothing,\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ultra-light continued to swing its tail left and right, but leveled off as they went over the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sailed for a hundred yards, made a mean curve Wayne couldn\u0027t fight, and fell straight away into the statue of Jesus, striking it in the head, right in the midst of the barbed wire crown. Spotlights shattered, metal groaned, the wire tangled in the nylon wings of the craft and held it. The head of Jesus nodded forward, popped off and shot out on the electric cables inside like a Jack-in-the-Box. The cables popped tight a hundred feet from the ground and worked the head and the craft like a yo-yo. Then the barbed wire crown unraveled and dropped the craft the rest of the way. It hit the ground with a crunch and a rip and a cloud of dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head of Jesus bobbed above the shattered craft like a bird preparing to peck a worm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[11]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne crawled out of the wreckage and tried his legs. They worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun was on his feet cussing, unstrapping the guns and supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Worth lay in the midst of the wreck, the nylon and aluminum supports folded around her like butterfly wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne started pulling the mess off of her. He saw that her leg was broken. A bone punched out of her thigh like a sharpened stick. There was no blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here comes the church social,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word was out about Brother Lazarus and the others. A horde of monks, nuns and dead folks, were rushing over the drawbridge. Some of the nuns and monks had guns. All of the dead folks had clubs. The clergy was yelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne nodded toward the bus barn, \"Let\u0027s get a bus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne picked up Sister Worth, cradled her in his arms, and made a run for it. Calhoun, carrying only the guns and the supplies, passed them. He jumped through the open doorway of a bus and dropped out of sight. Wayne knew he was jerking wires loose and trying to hotwire them a ride. Wayne hoped he was good at it, and fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Wayne got to the bus, he laid Sister Worth down beside it and pulled the .38 and stood in front of her. If he was going down he wanted to go like Wild Bill Hickok. A blazing gun in either fist and a woman to protect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, he\u0027d prefer the bus to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun jerked it in gear, backed it out and around in front of Wayne and Sister Worth. The monks and nuns had started firing and their rounds bounced off the side of the armored bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom inside Calhoun yelled, \"Get the hell on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne stuck the guns in his belt, grabbed up Sister Worth and lept inside. Calhoun jerked the bus forward and Wayne and Sister Worth went flying over a seat and into another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were leaving,\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to. But I gave my word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne stretched Sister Worth out on the seat and looked at her leg. After that tossing Calhoun had given them, the break was sticking out even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun closed the bus door and checked his wing-mirror. Nuns and monks and dead folks had piled into a couple of buses, and now the buses were pursuing them. One of them moved very fast, as if souped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I probably got the granny of the bunch,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey climbed over a ridge of sand, then they were on the narrow road that wound itself upwards. Behind them, one of the buses had fallen back, maybe some kind of mechanical trouble. The other was gaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road widened and Calhoun yelled, \"I think this is what the fucker\u0027s been waiting for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as Calhoun spoke, their pursuer put on a burst of speed and swung left and came up beside them, tried to swerve over and push them off the road, down into the deepening valley. But Calhoun fought the curves and didn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other bus swung its door open and a nun, the very one who had been on the bus that brought them to Jesus Land, stood there with her legs spread wide, showing the black-pantied mound of her crotch. She had one arm bent around a seat post and was holding in both hands the ever-popular clergy tool, the twelve-gauge pump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they made a curve, the nun fired a round into the window next to Calhoun. The window made a cracking noise and thin crooked lines spread in all directions, but the glass held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pumped a round into the chamber and fired again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBullet proof or not, this time the front sheet of glass fell away. Another well-placed round and the rest of the glass would go and Calhoun could wave his head good-bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne put his knees in a seat and got the window down. The nun saw him, whirled and fired. The shot was low and hit the bottom part of the window and starred it and pelleted the chassis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne stuck the .38 out the window and fired as the nun was jacking another load into position. His shot hit her in the head and her right eye went big and wet, and she swung around on the pole and lost the shotgun. It went out the door. She clung there by the bend of her elbow for a moment, then her arm straightened and she fell outside. The bus ran over her and she popped red and juicy at both ends like a stomped jelly roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waste of good pussy,\" Calhoun said. He edged into the other bus, and it pushed back. But Calhoun pushed harder and made it hit the wall with a screech like a panther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bus came back and shoved Calhoun to the side of the cliff and honked twice for Jesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun down-shifted, let off the gas, allowed the other bus to soar past by half a length. Then he jerked the wheel so that he caught the rear of it and knocked it across the road. He speared it in the side with the nose of his bus and the other started to spin. It clipped the front of Calhoun\u0027s bus and peeled the bumper back. Calhoun braked and the other bus kept spinning. It spun off the road and down into the valley amidst a chorus of cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes later they reached the top of the canyon and were in the desert. The bus began to throw up smoke from the front and make a noise like a dog strangling on a chicken bone. Calhoun pulled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[12]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamn bumper got twisted under there and it\u0027s shredded the tire some,\" Calhoun said. \"I think if we can peel the bumper off, there\u0027s enough of that tire to run on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne and Calhoun got hold of the bumper and pulled but it wouldn\u0027t come off. Not completely. Part of it had been creased, and that part finally gave way and broke off from the rest of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That ought to be enough to keep from rubbing the tire,\" Calhoun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Worth called from inside the bus. Wayne went to check on her. \"Take me off the bus,\" she said in her slow way. \"...I want to feel free air and sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There doesn\u0027t feel like there\u0027s any air out there,\" Wayne said. \"And the sun feels just like it always does. Hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked her up and carried her outside and found a ridge of sand and laid her down so her head was propped against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I need batteries,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say what?\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay looking straight into the sun. \"Brother Lazarus\u0027s greatest work... a dead folk that can think... has memory of the past... Was a scientist too...\" Her hand came up in stages, finally got hold of her head gear and pushed it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGleaming from the center of her tangled blond hair was a silver knob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He... was not a good man... I am a good woman... I want to feel alive... like before... batteries going... brought others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand fumbled at a snap pocket on her habit. Wayne opened it for her and got out what was inside. Four batteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uses two... simple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun was standing over them now. \"That explains some things,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look at me like that...\" Sister Worth said, and Wayne realized he had never told her his name and she had never asked. \"Unscrew... put the batteries in... Without them I\u0027ll be an eater... Can\u0027t wait too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Wayne said. He went behind her and propped her up on the sand drift and unscrewed the metal shaft from her skull. He thought about when she had fucked him on the wheel and how desperate she had been to feel something, and how she had been cold as flint and lustless. He remembered how she had looked in the mirror hoping to see something that wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped the batteries in the sand and took out one of the revolvers and put it close to the back of her head and pulled the trigger. Her body jerked slightly and fell over, her face turning toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bullet had come out where the bird had been on her cheek and had taken it completely away, leaving a bloodless hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best thing,\" Calhoun said. \"There\u0027s enough live pussy in the world without you pulling this broken-legged dead thing around after you on a board.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When a man gets sentimental over women and kids, he can count himself out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well boy,\" Calhoun said. \"I reckon it\u0027s time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reckon so,\" Wayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about we do this with some class? Give me one of your pistols and we\u0027ll get back-to-back and I\u0027ll count to ten, and when I get there, we\u0027ll turn and shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne gave Calhoun one of the pistols. Calhoun checked the chambers, said, \"I\u0027ve got four loads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne took two out of his pistol and tossed them on the ground. \"Even Steven,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey got back-to-back and held the guns by their legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess if you kill me you\u0027ll take me in,\" Calhoun said. \"So that means you\u0027ll put a bullet through my head if I need it. I don\u0027t want to come back as one of the dead folks. Got your word on that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do the same for you. Give my word. You know that\u0027s worth something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We gonna shoot or talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, boy, under different circumstances, I could have liked you. We might have been friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not likely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun started counting, and they started stepping. When he got to ten, they turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun\u0027s pistol barked first, and Wayne felt the bullet punch him low in the right side of his chest, spinning him slightly. He lifted his revolver and took his time and shot just as Calhoun fired again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun\u0027s second bullet whizzed by Wayne\u0027s head. Wayne\u0027s shot hit Calhoun in the stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalhoun went to his knees and had trouble drawing a breath. He tried to lift his revolver but couldn\u0027t; it was as if it had turned into an anvil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne shot him again. Hitting him in the middle of the chest this time and knocking him back so that his legs were curled beneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne walked over to Calhoun, dropped to one knee and took the revolver from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" Calhoun said. \"I wouldn\u0027t have thought that for nothing. You hit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scratched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne put the revolver to Calhoun\u0027s forehead and Calhoun closed his eyes and Wayne pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wound wasn\u0027t a scratch. Wayne knew he should leave Sister Worth where she was and load Calhoun on the bus and haul him in for bounty. But he didn\u0027t care about the bounty anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used the ragged piece of bumper to dig them a shallow side-by-side grave. When he finished, he stuck the fender fragment up between them and used the sight of one of the revolvers to scratch into it: HERE LIES SISTER WORTH AND CALHOUN WHO KEPT HIS WORD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou couldn\u0027t really read it good and he knew the first real wind would keel it over, but it made him feel better about something, even if he couldn\u0027t put his finger on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wound had opened up and the sun was very hot now, and since he had lost his hat he could feel his brain cooking in his skull like meat boiling in a pot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got on the bus, started it and drove through the day and the night and it was near morning when he came to the Cadillacs and turned down between them and drove until he came to the \u002757.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he stopped and tried to get off the bus, he found he could hardly move. The revolvers in his belt were stuck to his shirt and stomach because of the blood from his wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled himself up with the steering wheel, got one of the shotguns and used it for a crutch. He got the food and water and went out to inspect the \u002757.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was for shit. It had not only lost its windshield, the front end was mashed way back and one of the big sand tires was twisted at such an angle he knew the axle was shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned against the Chevy and tried to think. The bus was okay and there was still some gas in it, and he could get the hose out of the trunk of the \u002757 and siphon gas out of its tanks and put it in the bus. That would give him a few miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t feel as if he could walk twenty feet, let alone concentrate on driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of the shotgun, the food and water. He scooted onto the hood of the Chevy and managed himself to the roof. He lay there on his back and looked at the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a clear night and the stars were sharp with no fuzz around them. He felt cold. In a couple of hours the stars would fade and the sun would come up and the cool would give way to heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his head and looked at one of the Cadillacs and a skeleton face pressed to its windshield, forever looking down at the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was no way to end, looking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed his legs and stretched out his arms and studied the sky. It didn\u0027t feel so cold now, and the pain had almost stopped. He was more numb than anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled one of the revolvers and cocked it and put it to his temple and continued to look at the stars. Then he closed his eyes and found that he could still see them. He was once again hanging in the void between the stars wearing only his hat and cowboy boots, and floating about him were the junk cars and the \u002757, undamaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cars were moving toward him this time, not away. The \u002757 was in the lead, and as it grew closer he saw Pop behind the wheel and beside him was a Mexican puta, and in the back, two more. They were all smiling and Pop honked the horn and waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u002757 came alongside him and the back door opened. Sitting between the whores was Sister Worth. She had not been there a moment ago, but now she was. And he had never noticed how big the backseat of the \u002757 was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Worth smiled at him and the bird on her cheek lifted higher. Her hair was combed out long and straight and she looked pink-skinned and happy. On the floorboard at her feet was a chest of iced beer. Lone Star, by God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePop was leaning over the front seat, holding out his hand, and Sister Worth and the whores were beckoning him inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne worked his hands and feet, found this time that he could move. He swam through the open door, touched Pop\u0027s hand, and Pop said, \"It\u0027s good to see you, son,\" and at the moment Wayne pulled the trigger, Pop pulled him inside. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/book-of-the-dead/page-13.html","bookId":2562,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:58:46 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:58:46 AM"}
