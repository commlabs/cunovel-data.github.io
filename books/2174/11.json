He measured out his words: \u0027I... will... see... this... violence.\u0027 He looked at Allgood. \u0027Max?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood swallowed. This was a development he had not anticipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It happened,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027We know that, Schruille.\u0027 \u0027Of course it happened,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027I saw the mark where it was edited out of our channels. Violence. Now, I wish to bypass the safety valve which protects our sensitivities.\u0027 He snorted. \u0027Sensitivities!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNourse stared at him, noting that all traces of a whine had gone from Schruille\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSehruille looked up at the scanners, saw that many were winking off. He was disgusting even the Cynics, no doubt. A few remained, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill they stay through to the end? he wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Show the violence. Max,\u0027 Schruille ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNourse swiveled his throne around, putting his back to the screen, Calapine put her hands over her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027As you command,\u0027 Allgood said. His face vanished from the screen, was replaced by a high view looking down into a tiny square between windowless buildings. Two tiny figures walked around a fountain in the square. They stopped and a close-up showed the faces - Potter and an unknown, a strange-looking man with frighteningly cold eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the long view - two other men emerging from an alley carrying paper-wrapped packages. Behind them trooped a file of children with adult monitor in teacher\u0027s uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, Potter was lurching, pushing through the children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis companion was running the other way around the fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchruille risked a glance at Calapine, caught her peeking between her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shrill, piercing cry from the screen, brought his attention jerking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotters\u0027 companion had become a thing of horror, clothing fallen away, a milky bulb arising from his chest to flare with brilliant light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen went blank, came alive again to a view from a slightly different angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick glance showed that Calapine had dropped all pretense of hiding her eyes, was staring at the screen. Nourse, too, watched through his shoulder prism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother blaze of light leaped from the figure in the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the scene went blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s a Cyborg,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Know that as you watch.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the scene came alive from a different angle and this time from very high. The action in the plasmeld canyon was reduced to a movement of midges, but there was no difficulty in finding the center of violence. Lancets of blazing light leaped upward from a lurching figure in the square. Aircars exploded and fell from the sky in pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne Security vehicle plummeted in behind the Cyborg. A pulsing beam of coherent light emerged from it to cut a smoking furrow down the side of a building. The Cyborg whirled, lifted a hand from which a blinding blue finger seemed to extend into infinity. The finger met the diving car, split it in half., One half hit a building, ricocheted and smashed into the Cyborg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ball of yellow brilliance took shape in the square. In a second, a reverberating explosion shook the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchruille looked up to find the circle of watching scanners complete, every lensed eye blazing red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalapine cleared her throat. \u0027Potter went into that building on the right.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is that all you can say?\u0027 Schruille asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNourse swiveled his throne, glared at Schruille.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Was it not interesting?\u0027 Schruille asked. \u0027Interesting?\u0027 Nourse demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It is called warfare,\u0027 Schruille said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood\u0027s face reappeared on the screen, looking up at them with a veiled intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s naturally curious at our reaction, Schruille thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you know of our weapons. Max?\u0027 Schruille asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This talk of weapons and violence disgusts me,\u0027 Nourse said. \u0027What is the good of this?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why do we have weapons if they were not intended for use?\u0027 Schruille asked. \u0027Do you know the answer. Max?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know of your weapons,\u0027 Allgood said. They are the ultimate safeguard for your persons.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Of course we have weapons!\u0027 Nourse shouted. \u0027But why must we-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nourse, you demean yourself,\u0027 Calapine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNourse pushed himself back in his throne, hands gripping the arms. \u0027Demean myself!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Let us review this new development,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Cyborgs we knew existed. They have eluded us consistently. Thus, they control computer editing channels and have sympathy among the Folk. Thus, we see, they have an Action Arm which can sacrifice... I say sacrifice a member for the good of the whole.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNourse stared at him, wide-eyed, drinking the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And we,\u0027 Schruille said, \u0027we had forgotten how to be thoroughly brutal.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Aaaah!\u0027 Nourse barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If you injure a man with a weapon,\u0027 Schruille said, \u0027which is the responsible party - the weapon or the one who wields it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Explain yourself,\u0027 Calapine whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchruille pointed to Allgood in the screen. \u0027There is our weapon. We\u0027ve wielded it times without number until it learned to wield itself. We\u0027ve not forgotten how to be brutal, we\u0027ve merely forgotten that we are brutal.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What rot!\u0027 Nourse said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Look,\u0027 Schruille said. He pointed up to the watching scanners, every one of them alive. \u0027There\u0027s my evidence,\u0027 Schruille said.\u0027When have so many watched in the globe?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few of the lights began to wink out, but came back as the channels were taken over by other watchers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood watching from the screen felt the thrill of complete fascination. A tight sensation in his chest prevented deep breaths, but he ignored it. The Optimen facing violence! After a lifetime playing with euphemisms, Allgood found the thought of this almost unacceptable. It had been so swift. But then these were the liveforevers, the people who could not fail. He wondered then at the thoughts which raced through their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchruille, the usually silent and watchful, looked down at Allgood and said, \u0027Who else has eluded us. Max?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood found himself unable to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Durants are missing,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027Svengaard has not been found. Who else?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No one, Schruille. No one.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We want them captured,\u0027 Schruille said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Of course, Schruille.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Alive,\u0027 Calapine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Alive, Calapine?\u0027 Allgood asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If it\u0027s possible,\u0027 Schruille said. Allgood nodded. \u0027I obey, Schruille.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You may get back to your work now,\u0027 Schruille said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen went blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchruille busied himself with the controls in the arm of his throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027re you doing?\u0027 Nourse demanded and he heard the petulance in his own voice, despising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I remove the censors which excluded violence from our eyes except as a remote datum,\u0027 Schruille said. \u0027It is time we observed the reality of our land.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNourse sighed. \u0027If you feel it\u0027s necessary.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know it\u0027s necessary.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Most interesting,\u0027 Calapine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNourse looked at her. \u0027What do you find interesting in this obscenity?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis exhilaration I feel,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s most interesting.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNourse whirled away from her, glared at Schruille. He could see now that there definitely was a skin blemish on Schruille\u0027s face - beside his nose. Twelve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTO SVENGAARD, raised in the ordered world of the Optimen, the idea that they were fallible came as heresy. He tried to put it out of his mind and his ears. To be fallible was to be subject to death. Only the lower orders suffered thus. Not the Optimen. How could they be fallible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew the surgeon sitting across from him in the pale dawn light that filtered through narrow slots in a domed ceiling. The man was Toure Igan, one of Central\u0027s surgical elite, a person to whom only the most delicate genetico-medical problems were posed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room they occupied was a tight little space stolen between the walls of an air-system cap servicing the subterranean warrens of the Cascade Complex. Svengaard sat in a comfortable chair, but his arms and legs were bound. Other people were using the space, crowding past the little table where Igan sat. The people carried oddly shaped packages. For the most part they ignored Igan and his companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard studied the dark, intense features of the Central surgeon. Crease lines in the man\u0027s face betrayed the beginning of enzymic failure. He was starting to age. But the eyes were the blue of a summer sky and still young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You must choose sides,\u0027 Igan had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard allowed his attention to wander. A man passed carrying a golden metallic ball. From one of his pockets protruded a short silver chain on which dangled a breeder fetish in the shape of a lingam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You must answer,\u0027 Igan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard looked at the wall beside him - plasmeld, the inevitable plasmeld. The space stank of disinfectants and the ersatz-garden effect of air purifier perfumes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople continued to pass through the narrow room. The sameness of their garments began to weigh on Svengaard. Who were these people? That they were members of the Underground, that was obvious. But who were they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman touched him, crowding past. Svengaard looked up into a white smile in a black face, recognized a Zeek female, a face like Potter\u0027s but the skin darker... a surgical mistake. She wore a bracelet of human hair on her right wrist. It was blonde hair. Svengaard stared at the bracelet until the woman rounded the curve of the room out of his sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s open battle now,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027You must believe me. Your own life depends on it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own life? Svengaard wondered. He tried to think about his own life, identify it. He had a tertiary wife, little more than a playmate, a woman like himself whose every request for a breeder permit had been denied. For a moment, he couldn\u0027t picture her face, lost the shape of it in memories of previous wives and playmates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe isn\u0027t my life, he thought. Who is my life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was conscious of a fatigue that went to the bone, and a hangover from the narcotics his captors had administered during the night. He remembered the hands seizing him, that gasping look into a wall that could not be a door but was, the lighted space beyond. And he remembered awakening here with Igan across from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve held nothing back,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027I\u0027ve told you everything. Potter barely escaped with his life. The order\u0027s already out to get you. Your computer nurse is dead. Many people have died. More will die. They have to be sure, don\u0027t you understand? They can leave nothing to chance.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is my life? Svengaard asked himself. And he thought now about his comfortable apartment, the artifacts and entertainment reels, the reference works, his friends, the safely ordinary routine of his position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But where would I go?\u0027 Svengaard asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A place has been prepared.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No place is safe from them, Svengaard said. In saying this, he sensed for the first time the depth of his own resentment against the Optimen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Many places are safe,\u0027 Igan said. \u0027They merely pretend to supersensual perception. Their real powers lie in machines and instruments, the secret surveillance. But machines and instruments can be twisted to other purposes. And the Optimen depend on Folk to do their violence.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard shook his head. This is all nonsense.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Except for one thing,\u0027 Igan said, \u0027they are as we - variously human. We know this from experience.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But why would they do these things you accuse them of?\u0027 Svengaard protested. \u0027It\u0027s not sensible. They\u0027re good to us.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir sole interest is in maintaining themselves,\u0027 Igan said. They walk a tightrope. As long as there\u0027s no significant change in their environment, they\u0027ll continue living... indefinitely. Let significant change creep into their lives and they are like us - subject to the whims of nature. For them, you see, there can be no nature - no nature they don\u0027t control.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t believe it,\u0027 Svengaard said. They\u0027re the ones who love us and care for us. Look at all they\u0027ve done for us.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I have looked,\u0027 Igan shook his head. Svengaard was being more pig-headed than they\u0027d expected. He screened out contrary evidence and stuck to the old formulas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You want them to succumb,\u0027 Svengaard accused. \u0027Why do you want this?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Because they\u0027ve deprived us of evolution,\u0027 Igan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard stared at him. \u0027What?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-11.html","bookId":2174,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:55 PM"}
