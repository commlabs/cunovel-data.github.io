I’d long ago ceased to doubt myself or my abilities, thanks to the natural grace and confidence of a predator. As Auguste ushered me back to the elephant, I smoothed my hair and patted the sweat on my forehead. I could still feel the heat of the stage lights and the hot press of hundreds of drunk, lust-filled bodies. The men in the audience were so rabid for me that Charline had rearranged the finale so that all the other girls formed a tight, interlocking line of high kicks that no one dared to breach. That’s right—in Sang, the first true can-can line was invented just to shield me from my admirers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the elephant’s leg, Auguste paused and fussed with me for a moment, setting my hat at an angle and pinching my cheeks, although I didn’t know how he could see me in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t want to displease him, miss,” he said, his voice low and rich like coffee. When he opened the door and bowed, I went in alone, my nerves on fire and shining out my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom what I understood from the papers I’d read in Sangland and the few discussions I’d had in Franchia, Lenoir was an amalgamation of several Impressionist painters from my world. At the very least, his body of work included things I remembered as the work of Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Toulouse Lautrec, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. But the man himself was said to be a mystery and a wealthy man. He was the only artist in Sang who couldn’t be bought, who chose his own commissions and pursuits. And now he had chosen me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart was beating so loudly that I imagined it echoing against the copper as I took the winding stairs upward. Was Lenoir already here, waiting for me, or would it be like last night, when I had a few moments to compose myself? There was no way to know, although Auguste’s brief primping made me suspect that I was already being judged by the timbre of my footsteps. I was more nervous than I should have been, probably because while I had confidence in my skills as a contortionist and dancer, I had never felt glamorous or seductive. Lenoir painted only the most beautiful girls, the stars, and I felt a little like a fraud. But I quickly smothered that little voice of doubt in my heart and put on my best smile as I entered the chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was there on the couch, watching me with the sharp eyes of a hawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. That’s not true. Hawks have kind of stupid, round, golden eyes. Lenoir’s eyes were too smart, too dark, already narrowed as if measuring me for a frame. His Van Dyke and hair were ink-black, with one streak of distinguished white. But it didn’t lessen the man; quite the opposite. There was a confident, smooth stillness about him that drew me in like a vacuum. A sexy vacuum. I breathed in deep and barely held myself from hunching over into attack mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenoir smelled of Bludman, which meant I’d finally found my link to Cherie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tipped his head, just the tiniest gesture, and his mouth quirked up in a sly grin. I gasped when I saw his fangs, and with that gulp of air came the full power of his scent. Not Cherie, then; I had smelled his own blud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now you know my secret.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was butter and bourbon, sipped in a lightless room. The accent was mostly Sanglish but rich and royal. He stood, his shadow-gray suit as crisp as if he’d just had it starched for the first time. He was all angles and corners as he bent at the waist and reached for my hand. My bare fingers were dark against his white kidskin glove, and I shivered when his mustache and lips brushed the back of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bobbed my head and looked up through my eyelashes. “We’re all filled with secrets, monsieur. But you have surprised me, which is one point in your favor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned in a way that reminded me very much of Criminy Stain, except that a bit of playful good humor lurked always behind Crim’s wickedness. I suspected Lenoir held all of the danger and none of the amusement that made my mentor so very lovable. And yet I couldn’t help mimicking the smile. We were both dangerous things, weren’t we?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re saying you owe me, then, mademoiselle? Fine. I accept the debt. I wish to paint you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m flattered, monsieur.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be. You knew I’d come for you. They all do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All of whom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Coyness doesn’t become you, Demi. The girls I paint know I will come for them because that’s exactly what they want. After I paint you, you’ll be immortal, your name on every man’s tongue. You’re a rising star, but I will turn you into the sun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin widened, went darker, if that was possible. “Oh, little one. You have no idea.” He returned to the couch, taking up a sketchbook and leaning back. “Stand there, one hand on the table. Don’t look at me. Look at . . . oh, say, that painting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBemused, I did as I was told. He shook his head in annoyance and walked to me quickly, his gloved hands businesslike and cold as they posed my arms and changed the angle of my torso. I’d felt like an object ever since arriving in Paris, but under his posing, I felt less like a morsel or a doll and more like a vase of flowers that just wouldn’t cooperate. When he’d finally contorted me into the correct pose, he returned to the couch and began sketching, the pencil’s rasp harsh in the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought Bludmen weren’t allowed in Mortmartre,” I murmured through mostly closed lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And yet here we are, you and I. The thing is, once you’re in, it’s awfully hard to get you back out. And if you were here all along and have never taken off your gloves and can’t be seen to smile very often under your mustache, no one ever looks closely enough to tell. It’s the beauty of daimons; since we’re no danger to them, they don’t really notice the difference.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And none of your . . . subjects has ever noticed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped sketching to glare at me from under heavy brows. “You say subjects, but you mean lovers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am a student of history, monsieur, and I understand that an artist’s muse often finds his bed as well as his brush.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled as he made angry slashes with his lead. “A muse is a muse, and a portrait subject is a thing. One is more trouble than the other. Your head should be tilted, Demi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dutifully tilted it. Maybe he was gay? He certainly didn’t look upon me with lust, at least not the open, crass sort I’d grown accustomed to when performing. But there was something deeply sensual in his close scrutiny, in the calculations going on behind his eyes. Whatever he wanted, it wasn’t some giggling daimon dancer. And whatever path he chose, I suspected, would be thorough and purposeful and would allow no turning back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I shivered, he only murmured, “Hold still.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might have been ten seconds or ten minutes or ten hours later before the mad scritching stopped and he looked at me as if I was a person again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You may sit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretched and twisted, cracking my spine in four places. Odd parts of me were asleep, and my eyes were dry as if I’d held them open too long at the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tiring, isn’t it? Holding one attitude too long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged elegantly. “I’m a performer. I perform.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenoir nodded thoughtfully. “So you do.” I was about to sit and lure him deeper into conversation, hoping to discover more about his past and how he’d hidden so long in plain sight and if he knew any other Bludmen in Paris, but he stood abruptly and tucked his sketchbook under one arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll expect you tomorrow morning. Before nine, while the light is still good. Take extra blood, as I’ll want pink in your cheeks and lips. I’ll have a costume ready. I utterly defy you to be shy.” He slipped a card into my hand and turned for the door with a whirl of his gray coat. A breath of lavender and anise trailed him, and I took two steps toward his retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wouldn’t care to stay, monsieur? I could order up a teacup, perhaps a cigar?” Considering that he’d most likely paid through the nose for the privilege of my time, I didn’t want him to leave disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t turn back to me, merely shook his head as he put on his top hat. “Bonsoir, mademoiselle. I need you rested. Do not disappoint me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with a tip of his hat, he was gone, footsteps echoing against the copper as he hurried down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was one of the strangest men I’d ever met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd despite Vale’s dire warnings, I was riveted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night, I’d been anxious to flee the giant elephant and hide in my room. But tonight the door was locked from the outside, and no amount of banging on the metal brought any sort of help. With my patron gone under his own odd auspices and no use for the sleeping powder in my pocket, I settled into the plush circular bed in a huff to flip through racy postcards, pornographic playing cards, and books about sensual bootblacks and burly firefighters who caught and ravished swooning women. I’d found an elegant hatbox brimming with such gems sitting on a tuffet, and it felt more than a little surreal, reclining in a metal pachyderm and staring at photos that were currently the height of vulgar pornography but showed less than a geriatric lap swimmer’s bathing suit from my own world. If these guys saw my triangle bikini, they’d probably have an apoplexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that was one more thing I could “invent” in Sang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was grinning to myself and planning a cabaret-style version of Beach Blanket Bingo when the door opened far below and footsteps tapped up the circular stairs. I’d never moved as fast as I did then, tossing the photos and cards and books back into the hatbox and shoving it under the bed before the owner of the footsteps appeared. Even if it was just Auguste or one of the daimon girls, I didn’t want to be seen looking at porn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“La Demitasse?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned silently. It wasn’t a familiar voice, but it carried the same apologetic ownership as the duke’s had. Charline must have double-booked me, the greedy bitch. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wicked-after-midnight-blud-3/page-28.html","bookId":1599,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:51 PM"}
