More telling was the fact that he hadn’t even attempted to see his daughter, who until recently had lived in Seattle, as well. This was a blow, and Charlotte knew that Ben had taken it hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see,” Ben said after a moment. He’d made an obvious effort—a painful effort—to absorb the shock of this latest revelation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish I had better news,” Roy was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen shook his head. “Don’t worry. I’d rather deal with the truth now than uncover it later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte placed her free hand over Ben’s. She felt like weeping on his behalf. In only a few minutes, her husband looked as though he’d aged several years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there anything else I should know?” Ben asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy shrugged. “As I mentioned earlier, everything’s in the report. That’ll give you a clearer picture of your son’s life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean there’s more?” Ben cried. “If so, just tell me straight out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy sent Charlotte a questioning glance. “Ben needs the truth,” she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it drugs?” her husband asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. It seems that David has a gambling problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen closed his eyes briefly. “I feared as much. What about alcohol?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy winced. “I’m sorry to deliver so much bad news, especially on an important day like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Day?” Ben asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When the Victorian Tea Room is opening its doors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes,” he said, his voice waning. “It…slipped my mind. Charlotte and I were about to leave when you dropped by.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen sounded as if he were in a trance. He stood in the middle of the room, staring at nothing, as Charlotte walked Roy to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Charlotte. Is there anything I can do?” Roy whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but thank you for asking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLingering in the doorway, Charlotte watched Roy walk down the steps and across the street to his car. All the while, she tried to figure out how she could help her husband deal with yet another devastating blow from his youngest son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she turned around, Charlotte was surprised to find Ben standing behind her. His eyes met hers and he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to stay home?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen shook his head. “My son is on a path to self-destruction. As much as I hate to see him wreck his life, there’s nothing I can do to stop him.” He exhaled slowly and held out his arm. “I can’t allow David to drag me down and I can’t live his life for him. I’d hoped he was making better choices, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure you’re up to this?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis returning smile was gentle. “I’m not about to let David ruin this perfectly wonderful day. We’re meeting the others at the tearoom for Pastor Flemming’s blessing. Then you and I are going to be among Justine’s very first customers.” He looked at his watch. “We should be right on time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley Bliss sat in her workroom, which her children often referred to as the Dungeon. She’d been doing some preparatory work for her newest piece, and she’d lost track of the hours. Shadows crept across the daylight basement walls, telling her it was now late afternoon. Tanni would be home from school soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to read her. Anytime Shirley dared question Tanni regarding her whereabouts, her daughter grew argumentative and defensive. After a while Shirley had stopped asking. As best she could, she monitored Tanni’s comings and goings, and she tried to remain aware of her friends. At the moment, that was mostly Shaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the problems between Shirley and her daughter was that Tanni blamed her for the motorcycle accident that had claimed her father’s life. It might not be logical, but in Tanni’s adolescent view of the world Shirley was responsible. She’d been the one who’d finally capitulated and agreed that Jim could commute into Seattle on his Harley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni was convinced that if Shirley had held her ground, her father would still be alive. That question would be forever unanswered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, Shirley made her way up the stairs and realized she’d skipped lunch. That often happened when she started work on a new project. She’d spent the day selecting different fabrics and designing a quilt using suede, cotton prints, silk, linen and yarn, as well as ribbons and cords. When the creative mood overtook her, food didn’t enter her mind. In fact, it wasn’t unusual for her to work without a break. Her best pieces were created during long stretches of time that went far into the night. Jim and the children were accustomed to her strange schedule. Now there was only Tanni at home. Jim was gone and Nick away at college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Shirley, her art was a refuge and an escape. It had been for Tanni, too, although her daughter kept her drawings to herself these days. That was probably a good thing, because Shirley had been worried by the unrelenting anger and bitterness in Tanni’s sketches. She’d become introspective, shunned most of her friends and refused to talk to Shirley, to a counselor, their pastor, anybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings had changed when she started seeing Shaw, although the transition had been gradual. Despite her concerns, Shirley was grateful that in Shaw, Tanni had found someone to share her feelings with. Like her daughter, he was an artist. Unlike Tanni, Shaw had never had formal training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt about it, he was talented. Shirley had gone out of her way to help him get the schooling he’d need if he was going to make a living as an artist. She’d be the first to admit that her motives weren’t exactly unsullied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley was worried that the two teenagers, both burdened with a multitude of problems, were too close and would become sexually active. She was afraid Tanni might end up pregnant or, at the very least, brokenhearted, devastated by another great loss. The fact that Tanni and Shaw had discovered the skeleton in the cave outside town had only strengthened the bond between them. They’d become nearly inseparable ever since, and Shirley knew the dangers of that, knew where it could lead. She wanted to protect her daughter from the painful consequences of too intimate a relationship too young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an effort to smooth the way for Shaw, Shirley had agreed to go out with Will Jefferson. Fortunately she rather liked Will and he was definitely attractive, but she remained wary. More to the point, Will was friends with Larry Knight, an artist she greatly admired. At Shirley’s urging, Will had approached him in an effort to get Shaw a scholarship to a reputable art school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d tried to hide her relief when Shaw was accepted into the San Francisco Art Institute. He was scheduled to fly out there in two days; he’d be working for a friend of Larry Knight’s before the summer term started in May. Although they hadn’t discussed Shaw’s leaving, Shirley realized her daughter felt torn. This was a great opportunity and she was happy for Shaw; at the same time she was worried about what it would do to their relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door opened and Tanni came inside. She dropped her backpack on the carpet and kicked off her shoes. Without a glance in Shirley’s direction, she headed for her bedroom. A few seconds later, the sound of the bedroom door slamming shut echoed down the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley wanted to chastise her daughter—for her rudeness, for disregarding Shirley’s frequent requests that she take her backpack to her room, for being inconsiderate of anyone’s feelings but her own. She might as well be howling at the moon for all the response she’d get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the truth was, Shirley didn’t dare instigate a confrontation right now. She was too afraid Tanni would react by doing something impulsive, something foolish…. She opened the cupboard and chose a can of chicken noodle soup. Anything frozen or canned was quick and easy. Shirley didn’t have the patience to cook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the soup came out of the microwave, she sat down at the kitchen table. She’d eaten her first mouthful when her daughter walked in. Tanni looked around, saw her mother and then just as quickly turned around and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was typical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How was school?” Shirley called after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You hungry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I’m going to my room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” Tanni’s terse rejection wasn’t unexpected. Still, Shirley had to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she’d finished her soup, she set the bowl in the sink and turned on the evening news and picked up her needles and yarn. She’d started knitting lately, nothing creative or complicated. Everything she knit, mostly squares and scarves, was for charity. Knitting freed her mind. At the end of the day, the comforting, repetitive action relaxed her and allowed her to reflect on the events of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her astonishment, about fifteen minutes into the newscast, Tanni walked into the family room and sat in the chair next to hers. Shirley opened her mouth to utter a welcoming comment, but at the last second decided against it. If she spoke, Tanni might leave. No, it was best to let her daughter do the talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s going to meet other girls, you know,” Tanni finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley didn’t need Tanni to explain who she meant. “Yes, he probably will. Are you afraid of that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni shrugged, which said she was afraid. She knew she risked losing their relationship once Shaw left for art school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want him to stay in Cedar Cove?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni looked at Shirley and a half smile formed, as though the question had amused her. “No!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you don’t want him to leave either, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom, think about it! Shaw’s the only real friend I have. I’m going to miss him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you will.” Maybe, just maybe, that would force Tanni to find other friends—the friends she’d had before the accident, the friends she’d abandoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He says he loves me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you love him.” Shirley wasn’t about to discount the intensity of their feelings. The problem was, they were both so young and didn’t have the life experience to handle such a powerful emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love Shaw more than anything—more than my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver of fear ran through Shirley, which she worked hard to disguise. It took her a moment to realize that Tanni’s words had simply been a way to communicate the depth of her feelings for Shaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He says he’ll e-mail or phone me every day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure he will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but I wonder how long it’ll last.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo did Shirley, although it would’ve been foolish to admit that. “He’ll be back for visits.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/92-pacific-boulevard-cedar-cove-9/page-34.html","bookId":1951,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:11 AM"}
