He\u0027s holding a glass of champagne and hands it to the girl he\u0027s with - definite model type, thin, okay tits, no ass, high heels - and she\u0027s wearing a wool-crepe skirt and a wool and cashmere velour jacket and draped over her arm is a wool and cashmere velour coat, all by Louis Dell\u0027OliO. High-heeled shoes by Susan Bennis Warren Edwards. Sunglasses by Alain Mikli. Pressed-leather bag from Hermes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey fellas. How y\u0027all doin?\" Montgomery speaks in a thick Georgia twang. \"This is Nicki. Nicki, this is McDonald, Van Buren, Bateman - nice tan - and Mr. Price.\" He shakes only Timothy\u0027s hand and then takes the champagne glass from Nicki. Nicki smiles, politely, like a robot, probably doesn\u0027t speak English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Montgomery,\" Price says in a kindly, conversational tone, staring at Nicki. \"How have things been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, fellas,\" Montgomery says. \"See y\u0027all got the primo table. Get the check yet? Just kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Montgomery,\" Price says, staring at Nicki but still being unusually kind to someone I thought was a stranger. \"Squash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me,\" Montgomery says absently, looking over the room. \"Is that Tyson? Here\u0027s my card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" Price says, pocketing it. \"Thursday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t. Going to Dallas tomorrow but...\" Montgomery is already moving away from the table, hurrying toward someone else, snapping for Nicki. \"Yeah, next week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicki smiles at me, then looks at the floor - pink, blue, lime green tiles crisscrossing each other in triangular patterns - as if it had some kind of answer, held some sort of clue, offered a coherent reason as to why she was stuck with Montgomery. Idly I wonder if she\u0027s older than him, and then if she\u0027s flirting with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later,\" Price is saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later, fellas...\" Montgomery is already about halfway across the room.
