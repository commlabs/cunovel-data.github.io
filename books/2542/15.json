Its body throbbed with purrs as Florence stroked its neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she\u0027d come upstairs, she\u0027d found it cowering outside her door and, despite her wretchedness, had picked it up and carried it inside. She\u0027d held it in her lap until its trembling had stopped, then had put it on the bed and taken a hot shower. Now she was lying in her robe, the bedspread pulled across her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor puss,\" she murmured. \"What a place to bring you.\" She ran the edge of a finger along the front of its neck, and the cat raised its head with a languid movement, eyes still closed. Barrett had said that he needed it as an additional verification of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"presence\" in the house. It seemed a harsh measure, though, merely to acquire a slight scientific validation. Maybe she could get it taken away by the couple who brought their meals. She\u0027d ask Barrett to let her know the moment the cat had served its purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence closed her eyes again. She wished she could sleep, but things kept nagging at her mind. Mrs. Barrett\u0027s strained embarrassment - the way she\u0027d jerked around, as though someone were looking at her; Barrett\u0027s overzealous safeguards against fraud; the onset of physical mediumship in herself; her inability to go inside the chapel; her concern for Fischer; her feeling of dissatisfaction with herself; her fear that she was giving more importance to Belasco\u0027s son than he warranted. After all -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jolted, gasping, as the cat leaped from the bed. Sitting up, she saw it rushing to the door and crouching there, back arched, fur on end, its pupils expanded so completely that its eyes looked black. Hastily she stood and crossed to it. The instant she opened the door, it darted out into the corridor and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flapped behind her, and she whirled, to see the spread and blankets landing on the rug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something underneath the sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence stared at it. It was the figure of a man. She started toward the bed, tightening as she saw that the figure was nude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could make out every body contour, from the swelling broadness of the chest to the bulge of genitals. She felt a stir of sensual awareness in her body. No, she told herself; that\u0027s what he wants. \"If you\u0027re here only to impress me with your cleverness again, I\u0027m not interested,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure made no sound. It lay immobile underneath the sheet, chest expanding and contracting in a perfect simulation of breath. Florence peered at its face. \"Are you Emeric Belasco\u0027s son?\" she asked. She edged along the side of the bed. \"If you are, you said that nothing changes. Yet, with love, all things are possible. This is true of life, and true of life beyond life.\" She leaned across him, trying to make out his features. \"Tell me who you are,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boo!\" the figure shouted. Florence jumped back with a cry. Instantly the sheet collapsed, and there was nothing on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air began to ring with mocking laughter. Florence tightened with resentment. \"Very funny,\" she said. The laughter rose in pitch, taking on a frenzied quality. Florence clenched her hands. \"If practical jokes are all you\u0027re interested in, stay away from me!\" she ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor almost twenty seconds, it was deathly still inside the room. Florence felt her stomach muscles slowly tightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the Chinese lamp was pitched to the floor, shattering its bulb; only the light from the bathroom kept the room from total darkness. Florence twitched as footsteps thudded across the rug. The door to the corridor was flung open so hard that it crashed against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for a while before she crossed the room to shut the door. Switching on the overhead light, she moved to the fallen lamp and picked it up. Such anger, she thought. Yet it wasn\u0027t only anger; that was clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a plea as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:21 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence walked into the dining hall. \"Good evening,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer\u0027s smile was cursory. Florence sat down. \"Have you seen this couple yet?\" she asked, gesturing toward the table, which was set for supper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Funny if there wasn\u0027t any couple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer showed no sign of amusement. Florence glanced toward the great hall. \"I wonder where the Barretts are,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back at him. \"Well, what have you been doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scouting.\" Fischer lifted the cover from one of the serving dishes and eyed the heap of lamb chops. He replaced the cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should eat,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed the dish toward her. \"Maybe we should wait,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence waited a few more seconds. Then she said, \"I\u0027ll have some salad.\" She served her plate and looked at him. He shook his head. \"A little?\" Fischer shook his head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence ate some salad before she spoke again. \"Were you in contact with Belasco\u0027s son when you were here before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I was in contact with was a live wire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of footsteps made them look around. \"Good evening,\" Florence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening.\" Barrett smiled politely; Edith nodded. \"Are you feeling better?\" Barrett asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence nodded. \"Yes, I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Barrett and his wife sat down, served themselves, and started eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were talking about Belasco\u0027s son,\" Florence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes; Belasco\u0027s son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in Barrett\u0027s tone made Florence bristle. Suddenly the thought of having been subjected by him to the indignity of a physical examination galled her. The costume, those ridiculous precautions: ropes and nets and infrared lamps, hand and foot plates turning lights on, cameras. She tried to repress a mounting anger but couldn\u0027t. How dare Barrett treat her this way? Her position in this project was just as vital as his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will it never end?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others looked at her. \"Were you addressing me?\" inquired Barrett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was.\" Again she tried to quell her anger, but again the vision of the physical examination flashed across her mind, the costume, the absurd safeguards against fraud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will what never end?\" asked Barrett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This attitude of doubt. Distrust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Distrust?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should mediums be expected to produce phenomena only under conditions which science dictates?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not machines. We\u0027re human beings. These rigid, unyielding demands by science have done more harm than good to parapsychology.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Tanner - \" Barrett looked confused. \"What brought this on? Have I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a medium for the fun of it, you know.\" Florence cut him off. The more she spoke, the more infuriated she became.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s often painful, often unrewarding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just so happens I believe that mediumship is God\u0027s manifestation in man.\" She couldn\u0027t stop herself. \"\u0027When I speak with thee,\u0027\" she quoted angrily. \"\u0027I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Tanner - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is nothing in the Bible - not a single recorded phenomenon - which does not occur today, whether it be sights or sounds, shaking of the house, or coming through closed doors: rushing winds, levitations, automatic writing, or the speaking in tongues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a heavy silence. Florence glared at Barrett, conscious of Fischer and Edith staring at her. Somewhere, deep inside her mind, she heard a warning cry, but fury stilled it. She watched Barrett pour himself some coffee, watched him pick up his cup. He looked at her. \"Miss Tanner,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s bothering you, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke off as the cup exploded in his hand. Edith jerked back, gasping. Barrett, frozen, gaped at the shard of handle still in his fingers. Blood was starting to drip from the cut in his thumb. Florence felt a pounding at her temples. Fischer looked around in startlement. \"What in God\u0027s name - ?\" Barrett started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was drowned out as the glass beside his plate burst apart, its fragments scattering across the table. Edith jerked her hands back as her plate leaped from the table, flipping over rapidly and dumping food across the floor before it landed, shattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe recoiled as the top part of her glass broke off with a cracking noise and jumped across the table toward her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrett, pulling out a handkerchief, twisted to the side. The glass top thudded off his arm and tumbled to the floor. Fischer\u0027s glass exploded, and he lurched back, flinging an arm in front of his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence\u0027s plate somersaulted, scattering salad over the table. She reached out to grab it, then jolted back as the plate went flying across the table. Barrett jerked his head aside. The plate scaled past his ear and landed on its edge, rolling rapidly across the floor, to break against the wall. Edith cried out as a heavy serving dish began to slide across the table toward him. Barrett jumped up, toppling his chair. He almost fell, then leaned against the table. The serving dish slid off the table edge and crashed to the floor. Mashed potatoes splattered over his shoes and trouser cuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer was on his feet now. He tried to turn from the table, but was slammed against it as his chair lurched hard against his legs. He saw his cup go leaping from the table, gouting coffee over Barrett\u0027s shirt front as it struck him in the middle of the chest. Edith\u0027s scream choked off as Fischer\u0027s plate was catapulted from the tabletop, flying closely over her head. The chair slid back from Fischer, and he crumpled to his knees, his face a mask of shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrett tried to twist the handkerchief around his bleeding thumb. The silver pot fell over and began to spin across the table at him, spouting coffee. Barrett lurched aside to avoid it, slipped on the potatoes, flailed for balance, then went crashing onto his right side. The coffeepot fell off the table, bouncing off his left calf. He cried out at the burning impact. Edith tried to stand to help him, but her chair rocked backward, throwing her off balance. A knife and spoon went flying past her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence shrank into her chair as another serving dish began to skid across the table, headed for Barrett. Barrett scrabbled aside with a gasp. The serving dish crashed down beside him, the edge of its cover striking his shin. Edith struggled to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Under the table!\" Fischer cried. Florence slid from the chair, falling to her knees. Fischer flung himself beneath the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverhead, the hanging lamp began to pendulum, the length of its swings increasing rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were barely in the shelter of the table when the objects on the monastery table against the east wall came to life. A heavy silver chafing dish arced across the room and hit their table with a deafening impact. Edith cried out. Barrett started reaching for her automatically, then went back to wrapping his thumb. A silver bowl came hurtling at them, struck a table leg, and spun around in a blur of movement. Florence glanced at Fischer. He was on his knees, eyes staring, face a frozen mask of dread. She wanted to help him but felt too dazed. There was a churning coldness in her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of them looked up in shock as the dining table started rocking back and forth. The silver creamer landed nearby, contents splattering across the floor like a gout of ivory paint. The silver sugar bowl fell beside it as the table rocked with mounting violence, legs crashing down like pounding horse hooves. The table shifted suddenly, and Barrett had to jerk his hand away to keep from getting it crushed. The chairs began to overturn, banging one by one against the floor, the noise like rifle shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the table surged away from them, sliding fast across the polished floor. It smashed against the fire screen and bent it out of shape. Above them, all the sanctuary lamps were swinging violently. One of them tore loose and hurtled sideways, creating a shower of sparks as it collided violently with the stone mantel, then crashed to the tabletop. A silver candelabrum flew across the room and landed on the floor by Barrett, thudding against his side. He fell with a gasp of pain. Florence cried out. \" No! \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll movement ceased abruptly, except for the decreasing arcs of the remaining sanctuary lamps. Edith bent over Barrett anxiously. \"Lionel?\" She touched his shoulder. He managed to nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, you\u0027ve got to leave this house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer turned to Florence, startled by her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t up to it,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" What the hell are you talking about? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence turned to Barrett for support. \"Doctor - \" she began, then stopped, seeing how he looked at her as Edith helped him to his feet. \"Are you all right?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer, leaning against the table with a groan. Edith looked at him in fright. \"Lionel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be all right.\" He tightened the handkerchief around his thumb. The cut was deep; it stung. There were islands of pain all over his body - his arm, his chest, his shin, his ankle, mostly his side. His leg ached horhbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence stared at him. Why had he looked at her that way? Suddenly she thought she knew. \"I\u0027m sorry I spoke so angrily,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe said. \"But please support me in this. I think it\u0027s important that Ben - that Mr. Fischer leave the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrett clenched his teeth against the pain. \"Trying to get us both out now?\" he muttered. Florence looked at him in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me to our room, please?\" Barrett asked his wife. Edith nodded faintly, handed him his cane, and took his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence didn\u0027t understand. \"What do you mean, Doctor Barrett?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw a glance around the wreckage of the hall. \"I should think that was obvious,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned into silence, Florence watched the Barretts leave. After they were gone, she looked at Fischer. \"What is he saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe asked. \"That I - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer turned away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, it isn\u0027t true!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lurched away. Still moving, he glanced back at her. \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027d better leave,\" he said. \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s being used, not me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hell-house/page-15.html","bookId":2542,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:29 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:29 AM"}
