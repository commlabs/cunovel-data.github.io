again share with Stephanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt that if he could weep, the pain would fade, but no tears came, and he injected himself with morphine and collapsed on the counterpane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone woke him before daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Walter Goedel, Rommel\u0027s aide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroggily, Dieter said, \"Has the invasion begun?\" \"Not today,\" Goedel replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The weather is bad in the English Channel.\" Dieter sat upright and shook his head to clear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, then?\" \"The Resistance were clearly expecting something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOvernight, there has been an eruption of sabotage throughout northern France.\" Goedel\u0027s voice, already cool, descended to an arctic chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was supposed to be your job to prevent that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing in bed?\" Caught off guard, Dieter struggled to regain his usual poise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m right on the tail of the most important of all Resistance leaders,\" he said, trying hard not to sound as if he was making excuses for failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I almost caught her last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll arrest her today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t worry-by tomorrow morning we\u0027ll be rounding up terrorists by the hundreds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI promise you.\" He immediately regretted the pleading tone of the last three words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoedel was unmoved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After tomorrow, it will probably be too late.\" \"I know-\" Dieter stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoedel had hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter cradled the phone and looked at his wristwatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was four o\u0027clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis migraine had gone, but he felt queasy, either from the morphine or the unpleasant phone call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drank a glass of water and swallowed three aspirins, then began to shave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he lathered his face, he nervously ran over the events of the previous evening, asking himself if he had done everything possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving Lieutenant Hesse outside Chez Regis, he had followed Michel Clairet to the premises of Philippe Moulier, a supplier of fresh meat to restaurants and military kitchens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a storefront property with living quarters above and a yard at the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter bad watched the place for an hour, but no one had come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeciding that Michel intended to spend the night there, Dieter had found a bar and phoned Hans Hesse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans had got on a motorcycle and joined him outside the Moulier place at ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lieutenant told Dieter the story of the inexplicably empty room above Chez Regis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s some early-warning system,\" Dieter speculated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The barman downstairs is ready to sound the alarm if anyone comes looking.\" \"You think the Resistance were using the place?\" \"Probably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d guess the Communist Party used to hold meetings there, and the Resistance took over the system.\" \"But how did they get away last night?\" \"A trapdoor under the carpet, something like that- the communists would have been prepared for trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you arrest the barman?\" \"I arrested everyone in the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re at the chateau now.\" Dieter had left Hans watching the Moulier property and had driven to Sainte-Cecile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere he questioned the terrified proprietor, Alexandre Regis, and learned within minutes that his speculation had been off target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was neither a Resistance hideout nor a communist meeting place, but an illegal gambling club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, Alexandre confirmed that Michel Clairet had gone there last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, he said, Michel had met his wife there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was another maddeningly near miss for Dieter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had captured one Resistance member after another, but Flick always eluded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he finished shaving, wiped his face, and phoned the chateau to order a car with a driver and two Gestapo men to pick him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got dressed and went to the hotel kitchen to beg half a dozen warm croissants, which he wrapped in a linen napkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he went out into the cool of the early morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe towers of the cathedral were silvered by the breaking dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the fast Citroens favored by the Gestapo was waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave the driver the address of the Moulier place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found Hans lurking in a warehouse doorway fifty meters along the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had come or gone all night, Hans said, so Michel must still be inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter told his driver to wait around the next corner, then stood with Hans, sharing the croissants and watching the sun come up over the roofs of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had a long wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter fought to control his impatience as the minutes and hours ticked away uselessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loss of Stephanie weighed on his heart, but he had recovered from the immediate shock, and he had regained his interest in the war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of the Allied forces massing somewhere in the south or east of England, shiploads of men and tanks eager to turn the quiet seaside towns of northern France into battlefields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of the French saboteurs- armed to the teeth thanks to parachute drops of guns, ammunition, and explosives-ready to attack the German defenders from behind, to stab them in the back and fatally cramp Rommel\u0027s ability to maneuver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt foolish and impotent, standing in a doorway in Reims, waiting for an amateur terrorist to finish his breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, perhaps, he would be led into the very heart of the Resistance-but all he had was hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was after nine o\u0027clock when the front door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At last,\" Dieter breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved back from the sidewalk, making himself inconspicuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans put out his cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel came out of the building accompanied by a boy of about seventeen, who, Dieter guessed, might be a son of Moulier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lad keyed a padlock and opened the gates of the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the yard was a clean black van with white lettering on the side that read Moulier \u0026amp; Fils-Viandes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel got in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter was electrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel was borrowing a meat delivery van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be for the Jackdaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go!\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans hurried to his motorcycle, which was parked at the curb, and stood with his back to the road, pretending to fiddle with the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter ran to the corner, signaled the Gestapo driver to start the car, then watched Michel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel drove out of the yard and headed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans started his motorcycle and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter jumped into the car and ordered the driver to follow Hans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter, in the front passenger seat of the Gestapo\u0027s black Citroens looked ahead anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoulier\u0027s van was easy to follow, having a high roof with a vent on top like a chimney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat little vent will lead me to flick, Dieter thought optimistically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe van slowed in the chemin de La Carrire and pulled into the yard of a champagne house called Laperriere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans drove past and turned the next corner, and Dieter\u0027s driver followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pulled up and Dieter leaped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the Jackdaws hid out there overnight,\" Dieter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we raid the place?\" Hans said eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter pondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the dilemma he had faced yesterday, outside the cafeFlick might be in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if he moved too quickly, he might prematurely end Michel\u0027s usefulness as a stalking horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel was the only hope he had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too soon to risk losing that weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll wait.\" Dieter and Hans walked to the end of the street and watched the Laperriere place from the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a tall, elegant house, a courtyard full of empty barrels, and a low industrial building with a flat roof Dieter guessed the cellars ran beneath the flat-roofed building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoulier\u0027s van was parked in the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter\u0027s pulse was racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny moment now, Michel would reappear with Flick and the other Jackdaws, he guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would get into the van, ready to drive to their target-and Dieter and the Gestapo would move in and arrest them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they watched, Michel came out of the low building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore a frown and he stood indecisively in the yard, looking around him in a perplexed fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans said, \"What\u0027s the matter with him?\" Dieter\u0027s heart sank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something he didn\u0027t expect.\" Surely Flick had not evaded him again? After a minute, Michel climbed the short flight of steps to the door of the house and knocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA maid in a little white cap let him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came out again a few minutes later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still looked puzzled, but he was no longer indecisive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to the van, got in, and turned it around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter cursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed the Jackdaws were not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel appeared just as surprised as Dieter was, but that was small consolation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter had to find out what had happened here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to Hans, \"We\u0027ll do the same as last night, only this time you follow Michel and I\u0027ll raid the place.\" Hans started his motorcycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter watched Michel drive away in Moulier\u0027s van, followed at a discreet distance by Hans Hesse on his motorcycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were out of sight, he summoned the three Gestapo men with a wave and walked quickly to the Laperriere house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed at two of the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake sure no one leaves.\" Nodding at the third man, he said, \"You and I will search the winery.\" He led the way into the low building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ground floor there was a large grape press and three enormous vats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe press was pristine: the harvest was three or four months away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no one present but an old man sweeping the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter found the stairs and ran down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the cool underground chamber there was more activity: racked bottles were being turned by a handful of blue-coated workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped and stared at the intruders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter and the Gestapo man searched room after room of bottles of champagne, thousands of them, some stacked against the walls, others racked slantwise with the necks down in special A-shaped frames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were no women anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an alcove at the far end of the last tunnel, Dieter found crumbs of bread, cigarette ends, and a hair clip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis worst fears were dismally confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jackdaws had spent the night here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they had escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cast about for a focus for his anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe workers would probably know nothing about the Jackdaws, but the owner must have given permission for them to hide here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would suffer for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter returned to the ground floor, crossed the yard, and went to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Gestapo man opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all in the front room,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter entered a large, gracious room with elegant but shabby furnishings: heavy curtains that had not been cleaned for years, a worn carpet, a long dining table and a matching set of twelve chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terrified household staff were standing at the near end of the room: the maid who opened the door, an elderly man who looked like a butler in his threadbare black suit, and a plump woman wearing an apron who must have been the cook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Gestapo man held a pistol pointed at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the far end of the table sat a thin woman of about fifty, with red hair threaded with silver, dressed in a summer frock of pale yellow silk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had an air of calm superiority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter turned to the Gestapo man and said in a low voice, \"Where\u0027s the husband?\" \"He left the house at eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey don\u0027t know where he went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s expected home for lunch.\" Dieter gave the woman a hard look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madame Laperriere?\" She nodded gravely but did not deign to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter decided to puncture her dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome German officers behaved with deference to upper-class French people, but Dieter thought they were fools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would not pander to her by walking the length of the room to speak to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring her to me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men spoke to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she got up from her chair and approached Dieter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A group of terrorists from England escaped from me yesterday after killing two German officers and a French woman civilian.\" \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that,\" said Madame Laperriere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They tied the woman up and shot her in the back of the head at point-blank range,\" he went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her brains spilled out onto her dress.\" She closed her eyes and turned her head aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter went on, \"Last night your husband sheltered those terrorists in your cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you think of any reason why he should not be hanged?\" Behind him, the maid began to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Laperriere was shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face turned pale and
