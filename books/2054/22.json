{"id":110164,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"You faked it... faked being affected by me,\" I realized, shock making my words come out thick and faltering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill chuckling, he took a step toward me, and I cringed, frantically trying to find a way to run, to get out of my own apartment. What had moments ago seemed safe and inviting now became close and stifling. My apartment was too small, the door too far away. I couldn\u0027t breathe. The amusement on Roman\u0027s face shifted to astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter? What are you afraid of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think I\u0027m afraid of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked. \"Me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you. You kill immortals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yeah,\" he admitted, \"but I\u0027d never hurt you. Never. You know that, don\u0027t you?\" I didn\u0027t answer. \"Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backed up farther, not that I had anywhere to go. I was faced in such a way as to only keep moving toward my bedroom, not toward the front door. That wasn\u0027t likely to do any good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman still seemed floored at my reaction. \"Come on, I can\u0027t believe this. I would never do anything to you. I\u0027m half in love with you. Hell, do you know what a wrench you\u0027ve already thrown into this operation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? What have I done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you done? You\u0027ve wrapped my heart around your little finger, that\u0027s what you\u0027ve done. That day... when you solicited me at the bookstore? I couldn\u0027t believe my luck. I\u0027d been watching you all week, you know, trying to learn your habits. Christ, I\u0027ll never forget the first day I saw you. How feisty you where. How beautiful. I would have gone to the ends of the earth for you right then and there. And later... when you wouldn\u0027t go out with me after the signing? I couldn\u0027t believe it. You were originally going to be my first target, you know. But I couldn\u0027t do it. Not after I\u0027d talked to you. Not after I\u0027d realized what you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, curious in spite of myself. \"What - what am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step toward me, a rueful half-smile on his handsome face. \"A succubus who doesn\u0027t want to be a succubus. A succubus who wants to be human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that\u0027s not true...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it is. You\u0027re like me. You don\u0027t play by the rules. You\u0027re tired of the system. You don\u0027t let them push you into the role they\u0027ve dictated for you. God, I couldn\u0027t believe it, watching you. The more you seemed interested in me, the more you tried to back off. You think that\u0027s normal for a succubus? It was the most amazing thing I\u0027d ever seen - not to mention the most frustrating. That\u0027s why I finally decided to call you out today. I couldn\u0027t decide if you\u0027d really cut me off for my own good or were just interested in someone else now - like Mortensen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait - that\u0027s why you arranged that stupid little game today? For your own fucking ego gratification?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman shrugged haplessly, still looking self-satisfied. \"It sounds so shallow when you put it like that. I mean, okay, it was pretty stupid. And maybe a little childish. But I had to know where your affection stood. You can\u0027t imagine how touching it was to see you so worried about me - not to mention the fact that you checked on me first. That was the real kicker: I got priority over the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost protested that I\u0027d actually worried about Seth first, having only called Roman beforehand because I thought Seth was already accounted for. Fortunately, I had enough sense to keep my mouth shut on that issue. Better to let Roman think he\u0027d proven his point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have issues,\" I said instead, perhaps unwisely. \"Making me jump through hoops like that. Me and the other immortals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps. And I am sorry for any discomfort I caused you, but as for the others?\" He shook his head. \"It\u0027s good for them. They need it, Georgina. I mean, doesn\u0027t it piss you off? What they\u0027ve done to you? You\u0027re obviously not happy with your lot, but do you think the folks in charge are going to let you change things? No. No more than they\u0027re going to give me or my kind a break. The system is flawed. They\u0027re locked in their fucking \u0027this is good\u0027 and \u0027this is evil\u0027 mentality. No gray area. No mutability. That\u0027s why I go around and do what I do. They need the wake-up call. They need to know they aren\u0027t the be all and end all of sin and salvation. Some of us are still fighting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go around... How often do you do this? This killing thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, not that often. Every twenty to fifty years or so. Sometimes a century. Doing it sort of cleanses me for a while, and then, over the years, I\u0027ll start getting pissed off at the whole system again and stake out a new place, a new set of immortals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it always the same pattern?\" I remembered Jerome\u0027s symbols. \"The warning phase... then the main attack phase?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman brightened. \"Well, well, haven\u0027t you done your homework. Yes, it usually works that way. Take out a few lesser immortals first. They\u0027re easy targets, even if I always feel a little guilty about it. Really, they\u0027re as much victims of the system as you and I are. Still, messing with them freaks out the higher immortals, and then the stage is set to move on to the main attraction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerome,\" I stated grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerome... the local archdemon.\" I hesitated. \"Your father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that supposed to mean? You don\u0027t sound like he\u0027s a big deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the grand scheme of things, he\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah... but he\u0027s your father...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So? Our relationship - or lack thereof - doesn\u0027t really change anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerome had said almost the exact same thing about Roman. Baffled, I sat down on the arm of a nearby chair since it appeared my imminent destruction wasn\u0027t quite so imminent after all. \"But isn\u0027t he... isn\u0027t he the \u0027real target\u0027 - the higher immortal you\u0027re here to kill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman shook his head, face turning serious. \"No. That\u0027s not how the pattern works. After I move on from the lesser immortals, I focus in on the local bigwig. The real powerhouse in the area. That tends to unsettle people more. Better psychological effect, you know? If I can take out the big man on campus, then they worry no one is safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, that would be Jerome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not,\" he countered patiently. \" Archdemonor no, my illustrious father is not the ultimate power source around here. Don\u0027t get me wrong; I\u0027m getting a nice bit of satisfaction from pissing in his territory, so to speak, but there\u0027s someone else who dwarfs him. You probably don\u0027t know him. It\u0027s not like you\u0027d have reason to hang out with him or anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStronger than Jerome? That only left - \"Carter. You\u0027re going after Carter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that his name? The local angel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s stronger than Jerome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Considerably.\" Roman gave me a curious look. \"Do you know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... know of him,\" I lied. \"Like you said, I don\u0027t hang out with him or anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn reality, my mind raced. Carter was the target? Mild, sardonic Carter? I could hardly believe he was more powerful than Jerome, but then, I knew almost nothing about him. I didn\u0027t even know what he did, what his job or mission in Seattle was. Yet, one thing that was obvious to me - and only me, apparently - was that if the angel really did outclass Jerome, then Roman couldn\u0027t do anything to him, not if the rule about nephilim power not exceeding parental power held true. Roman shouldn\u0027t technically be able to harm either angel or demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chose not to mention this to him, however - or the fact that I knew Carter better than Roman believed. The more delusional he was, the more of a chance we had to do something about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I didn\u0027t really figure a succubus would be too friendly with an angel, but with you, it\u0027s hard to tell. You may have a sharp tongue, but you still manage to gather a lot of admirers.\" Relaxing slightly, Roman leaned against a wall, crossing his arms over his chest. \"God knows I\u0027ve already gone out of my way to avoid your friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger helped me overcome my fear. \"Oh really? What about Hugh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one\u0027s he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The imp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes. Well, I had to keep setting an example, didn\u0027t I? So, yeah, I messed with him a little. He\u0027d been impertinent to you. But I didn\u0027t kill him.\" He looked at me in what I supposed was meant to be an encouraging type of way. \"That was for your benefit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed silent. I recalled how Hugh had looked in the hospital. Impertinent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about the others?\" he pushed. \"That annoying angel? The vampire that threatened you? I wanted to break his neck on the spot. I got rid of them for you. I didn\u0027t have to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt ill. I wanted no deaths on my hands. \"Most considerate of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, give me a break here. I had to do something, and really, once I\u0027d met your vampire friend at the dance lesson, I couldn\u0027t bring myself to do anything to him at all. You put me in a really tight spot. I was running out of victims.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry for the inconvenience,\" I snapped, ire rising at his pathetic show of compassion. \"Is that why you took it easy on me that night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I mean!\" Thinking back to my attack, it all made perfect sense. It had occurred after I\u0027d been to Krystal Starz, the day after I\u0027d run out on Roman at the concert. A perfect excuse for him to be angry and seek retaliation. \"Remember? The day after Doug\u0027s concert? After I\u0027d been with Seth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding washed over Roman\u0027s features. \"Oh. That.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all you have to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a bit juvenile, I admit, but you can hardly blame me. It wasn\u0027t easy watching you cozy up to Mortensen after freaking out on me like that. I\u0027d watched you go home with him the night before. I had to do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sprang up from my seat, old apprehension returning. \"You had to do something? Like beat the crap out of me in an alley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman raised an eyebrow. \"What are you talking about? I told you I would never hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m talking about that ice cream place. I\u0027d followed you two around earlier in the day, and when I saw how cute you were getting over dessert, I got jealous and blew the door open. Juvenile, as I said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember that...\" I trailed off stupidly, recalling how the door had blown open at the parlor, letting the outside wind wreak havoc in the small store. Wind like that was certainly uncharacteristic here, yet I had never suspected supernatural influence. He was right; it had been juvenile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s the alley thing you\u0027re talking about?\" he prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snapped out of my memory. \"Later... that night. I\u0027d been running errands, and you... or someone... attacked me on the way home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman\u0027s face turned cold, his eyes sharpening to aqua steel. \"Tell me. Tell me everything. Exactly what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did, explaining my lead to the Harrington book, subsequent trip to Krystal Starz, and walk home in the dark. I edited the part about my rescuer, however. I didn\u0027t want Roman to know I had more than a casual acquaintance with Carter, lest the nephilim think I might be a deterrent to his plans. The more he thought I had no interest in the angel, the more likely I would be able to get out some kind of warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing his eyes, Roman leaned his head against the wall when I finished, sighing. Suddenly, he looked less like a dangerous killer and more like a tired version of the man I\u0027d come to know and nearly love. \"I knew it. I knew noninterference was too much to ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What... what do you mean?\" A strange feeling crawled down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. Forget it. Look, I\u0027m sorry about that. I should have taken precautions beforehand to protect you. I knew too... the next day? When I came by and you cut things off between us? I could tell you had been hurt, even through your shape-shifting. I could tell it was supernaturally inflicted too, but I never suspected... I thought it was some other immortal - one of your own circle - you\u0027d tangled with. You had sort of a residual effect on you... the faint traces of someone else\u0027s power... like a demon\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s not - oh. You mean Jerome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy dearest again? Don\u0027t tell me... don\u0027t tell me he did something to you too.\" Roman\u0027s brief lapse into mildness faded, replaced by something more sinister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" I said hastily, recalling Jerome\u0027s psychic slap, pinning me to the couch. \"It wasn\u0027t like that. It was more of a show of power that I caught the edge of. He wasn\u0027t the one who hurt me. He\u0027d never hurt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027m still not happy about what happened in the alley, mind you, but I\u0027ll have a little chat with the guilty party and make sure it never happens again. When I saw you that day, I had half a mind to take out all the immortals in the area. The thought of someone hurting you...\" Closer and closer he came to me. Hesitantly, he squeezed my arm. I didn\u0027t know whether to recoil or reach out to him. I didn\u0027t know how to reconcile my old attraction with this new terror. \"You have no idea how much I care about you, Georgina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how... in the alley - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could follow that thought to completion, another suddenly poked its head up at Roman\u0027s words. When I saw you that day. He had visited me the day after the attack, coming over while Carter investigated a nephilim signature. But that was impossible. I couldn\u0027t remember where that particular signature had occurred, but it had not been close by. Roman could not have flashed Carter and then made it over to my apartment so quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIknew noninterference was too much to ask for. I\u0027ll have a little chat with the guilty party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood then why Roman felt he could take on Carter, why having less power than the angel would pose no concern. The realization sank into me like lead, heavy and cold. I\u0027m not sure what look crossed my face, but Roman\u0027s suddenly softened with compassion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many?\" I whispered to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many nephilim are in the city?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-blues-georgina-kincaid-1/page-22.html","bookId":2054,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:16 PM"}
