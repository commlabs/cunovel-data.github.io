I will kill him first before I find a place to heal myself.” Thinking this, Huo Gong forcefully revolved his true essence, and wielded his saber. Above the saber, a vast swirl of rolling flames spread through the air. The land underneath his feet was instantly burned black, and a crimson heatwave spread out in all directions. In every place this heatwave touched, the vegetation would all wither and finally combust into fiery flames, turning into nothing but ash!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCompared to the flames on Lin Ming’s spear, whether it was horrifically scorching aura or the intensity of flames that spread out in a terrifying heat wave, the Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation was far superior!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e However, even facing the formidable Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation, the flames in Lin Ming’s spear seemed to contain their own strange aura, as if it were boiling.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was able to clearly feel the fluctuating flames and bursts of rolling heat transmitting from his heart; it was as if the Flame Essence was dancing in excitement!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hah!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen the spear and saber crossed each other, the twin energies of thunder and fire suddenly interwove – Thunderfire Annihilation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the seemingly weak flame met the seemingly weak lightning, a dominant power suddenly erupted!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor a time, it was as if all sound in the surroundings had been swallowed by some mystical force.

Instead, he took out a pure true essence stone, and began to revolve the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’ as he rapidly absorbed the true essence to restore his strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut at this moment, Huo Gong suddenly grinned. Under his blackened lips, he revealed a row of glowing white teeth. To Lin Ming, that gruesome smile caused his heart to go cold.

His body began to burn once again with the Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation. But this time, the Red Lotus Demonic Inflammation was much weaker.

Even though his physical body had been strengthened and he had the medium-grade human-step Purple Gold Flexible Armor bestowed by the Crown Prince, his internal organs were still impacted by the terrifying backlash and he vomited blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, Huo Gong was even more miserable.

Under the previous severe wounds he had taken, the true essence that protected his body was already weakened to the point that it couldn’t take a normal strike, so how could he possibly defend against such a violent explosion?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuo Gong’s chest had had been completely blown open into stringy pulp.

However, he didn’t have any particular feelings towards this. He had chosen to travel down the path of martial artists. Sooner or later, he would have encountered situations where he would have to kill others. Lin Ming had long since come to terms with this reality. Not only that, but in the Ten Thousand Killing Array, when he had killed the phantom martial artists inside, that feeling had been completely real.

In terms of power, the Thunderbolt Devilfire Bead was slightly weaker than his own Thunderfire Annihilation. However, this time, Huo Gong’s true essence protection had already been reduced to being no more defensive than paper, and thus was unable to block the fatal explosion from the Thunderbolt Devilfire Bead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter a martial artist reached the Pulse Condensation Period, their physical strength would not change too much.
