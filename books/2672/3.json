Perhaps that’s its right name because it’s the main road in from the south. You should not rely on any of my directions.) Maddie waited and waited on the edge of the simmering crowd, looking for a gap. After twenty minutes, she began to get annoyed. There were people pressing against her from behind now, as well. She tried to turn her motorbike round, walking it by the handlebars, and ran into someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oi! Mind where you’re pushing that bike!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sorry!’ Maddie looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a crowd of thugs, black-shirted for the rally even though they could get arrested for it, hair slicked back with Brylcreem like a bunch of airmen. They looked Maddie up and down gleefully, pretty sure she would be easy bait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nice bike.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nice legs!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them giggled through his nose. ‘Nice —.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used an ugly, unspeakable word, and I won’t bother to write it because I don’t think any of you would know what it means in English, and I certainly do not know the French or German for it. The thuggish lad used it like a goading stick and it worked. Maddie shoved the front wheel of the bike past the one she had hit in the first place, and knocked into him again, and he grabbed the handlebars with his own big fists between her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie held on. They struggled for a moment over the motorbike. The boy refused to let go, and his mates laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s a lass like you need with a big toy like this? Where’d you get it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘At the bike shop, where d’you think!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Brodatt’s,’ said one of them. There was only one on that side of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sells bikes to Jews, he does.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Maybe it’s a Jew’s bike.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou probably don’t know it, but Manchester and its smoky suburbs have got quite a large Jewish population and nobody minds. Well, obviously some idiot Fascists do mind, but I think you see what I mean. They came from Russia and Poland and later Roumania and Austria, all Eastern Europe, all through the nineteenth century. The bike shop whose customers were in question happened to be Maddie’s granddad’s bike shop that he’d had for the last thirty years. He’d done quite well out of it, well enough to keep Maddie’s stylish gran in the manner to which she is accustomed, and they live in a large old house in Grove Green on the edge of the city and have a gardener and a daily girl to do the housekeeping. Anyway when this lot started slinging venom at Maddie’s granddad’s shop, Maddie unwisely engaged in battle with them and said, ‘Does it always take all three of you to complete a thought? Or can you each do it without your mates if you have enough time to think it over first?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pushed the bike over. It took Maddie down with it. Because bullying is what idiot Fascists like best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was a swell of noisy outrage from other people in the crowded street, and the little gang of thugs laughed again and moved on. Maddie could hear the one lad’s distinctive nasal whinny even after his back had become anonymous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore people than had knocked her down came to her aid, a labourer and a girl with a pram and a kiddie and two women with shopping baskets. They hadn’t fought or interfered, but they helped Maddie up and dusted her off and the workman ran loving hands down the Silent Superb’s mudguard. ‘Tha’s not hurt, miss?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nice bike!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the kiddie. His mum said quickly, ‘Oi, you hush,’ because it was a perfect echo of the black-shirted youth who had pushed Maddie over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘’Tis nice,’ said the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s getting old,’ Maddie said modestly, but pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ruddy vandals.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tha wants to get those knees seen to, love,’ advised one of the ladies with baskets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie thought to herself, thinking about aeroplanes: Just you wait, you idiot Fascists. I am going to get me a bigger toy than this bike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie’s faith in humanity was restored and she pushed her way out of the crowd and set off down the cobbled back lanes of Stockport. There was no one here but kiddies playing street football in screaming bunches, and harassed big sisters with their hair tied up in dust cloths, ungraciously shaking out rugs and scrubbing front doorsteps while their mothers shopped. I swear I shall weep with envy if I keep thinking about them, bombed to bits or otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFräulein Engel has been looking over my shoulder once again and has asked me to stop writing ‘idiot Fascist’ because she thinks Hauptsturmführer von Linden will not like it. I think she is a bit scared of Capt. von Linden (who can blame her), and I think Scharführer Thibaut is scared of him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocation of British Airfields\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t really believe you need me to tell you that Catton Park Aerodrome is in Ilsmere Port because for the last ten years it has been just about the busiest airfield in the north of England. They build planes there. Before the war it had a posh civil flying club and it has also been a Royal Air Force base for years. The local Royal Air Force squadron has been flying bombers from that field since 1936. Your guess is as good as mine, and probably a lot better, as to what they are using it for now (I don’t doubt it’s surrounded with barrage balloons and anti-aircraft guns). When Maddie pulled up there that Saturday morning, she stood for a moment goggling gormlessly (her word), first at the car park, which contained the biggest collection of expensive cars she’d ever seen in one place, and then at the sky, which contained the biggest collection of aeroplanes. She leaned against the fence to watch. After a few minutes, she worked out that most of the planes seemed to fly to a kind of pattern, taking it in turns to land and roar away again. Half an hour later she was still watching, and could tell that one of the pilots was a beginner and his machine always bounced six feet in the air after touching down before properly connecting with the ground, and another one was practising absolutely insane aerobatic manoeuvres, and another one was giving rides to people – once round the airfield, five minutes in the air, back down, hand over your two shillings and swap your goggles with the next customer, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a very overwhelming place in that uneasy peacetime when military and civil pilots took it in turns to use the runway, but Maddie was determined, and followed the signs to the flying club. She found the person she was looking for by accident – easily really, because Dympna Wythenshawe was the only idle aviator on the field, lounging by herself in a long row of faded deckchairs lined up in front of the pilots’ clubhouse. Maddie did not recognise the pilot. She looked nothing like either the glamorous mugshot from the papers or the unconscious, helmeted casualty she had been when Maddie left her that Sunday past. Dympna didn’t recognise Maddie either, but she called out jovially, ‘Are you hoping for a spin?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke in a cultured accent of money and privilege. Rather like mine, without the Scottish burr. Probably not as privileged as mine, but more moneyed. Anyway it made Maddie instantly feel like a serving girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m looking for Dympna Wythenshawe,’ said Maddie. ‘I just wanted to see how she’s getting on after – after last week.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She’s fine.’ The elegant creature smiled pleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I found her,’ Maddie blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She’s right as rain,’ Dympna said, offering a languid, lily-white hand that had certainly never changed an oil filter (my lily-white hands have, I would like you to know, but only under strict supervision). ‘She’s right as rain. She’s me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie shook hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Take a pew,’ Dympna drawled (just imagine she’s me, raised in a castle and educated at a Swiss boarding school, only a lot taller and not snivelling all the time). She waved to the empty deckchairs. ‘There’s plenty of room.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was dressed as though she were going on safari, and contrived to be glamorous about it too. She gave private instruction as well as joyrides. She was the only woman pilot at the aerodrome, certainly the only woman instructor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When my darling Puss Moth’s mended, I’ll give you a ride,’ she offered Maddie, and Maddie, who is nothing if not calculating, asked if she could see the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had taken it to bits and carted it home from Highdown Rise and now a team of boys and men in greasy overalls were working at putting it back together in one of a long line of high workshop sheds. The Puss Moth’s lovely engine (this is Maddie talking; she is a bit mad) had only HALF THE POWER of Maddie’s motorbike. They had taken it apart and were cleaning the bits of turf out of it with wire brushes. It lay on a square of oilcloth in a thousand gleaming pieces. Maddie knew instantly she had come to the right place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, can I watch?’ she said. And Dympna, who never got her hands dirty, could nevertheless name every cylinder and valve that was lying on the floor, and let Maddie have a go painting the new fabric (over the fuselage she’d kicked in) with a mess of plastic goo that smelled like pickled onions. After an hour had gone by and Maddie was still there asking what all the parts of the plane were for and what they were called, the mechanics gave her a wire brush and let her help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie said she always felt very safe, after that, flying in Dympna’s Puss Moth, because she had helped to put its engine back together herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When are you coming back?’ Dympna asked her over oily mugs of tea, four hours later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s too far for me to visit very often,’ Maddie confessed sadly. ‘I live in Stockport. I help my granddad in his office in the week and he pays for my petrol, but I can’t come here every weekend.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are the luckiest girl alive,’ Dympna said. ‘As soon as the Puss Moth’s flying again I’m moving both my planes to the new airfield at Oakway. It’s right by Ladderal Mill, where your friend Beryl works. There’s a big gala at Oakway next Saturday, for the airfield’s official opening. I’ll come and collect you and you can watch the fun from the pilots’ stand. Beryl can come along too.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s two airfields I’ve located for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am getting a bit wobbly because no one has let me eat or drink since yesterday and I have been writing for nine hours. So now I am going to risk tossing this pencil across the table and have a good howl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrmaie 9.XI.43 JB-S\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis pen does nt work. Sorry ink blots. Is this test or punishmt I want my pencil back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Note to SS-Hauptsturmführer Amadeus von Linden, translated from the German:]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe English Flight Officer is telling the truth. The ink given her was too old/too thick to use and clotted badly in the pen nib. It has now been thinned and I am testing it here to affirm that it is acceptable for writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeil Hitler!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSS-Scharführer Etienne Thibaut\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou ignorant Quisling bastard, SS-Scharführer Etienne Thibaut, I AM SCOTTISH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe comedians Laurel and Hardy, I mean Underling-Sergeant Thibaut and On-Duty-Female-Guard Engel, have been very jolly at my expense over the inferior ink Thibaut found for me to write with. He ruddy well had to thin it with kerosene, didn’t he. He was annoyed when I made a fuss over the ink and he didn’t seem to believe me about the clogged pen, so I became rather upset when he went away and came back with a litre of kerosene. When he brought in the tin, I knew straight away what it was, and Miss E. had to throw a jug of water in my face to stop my hysterics. Now she is sitting across the table from me lighting and relighting her cigarette and flicking the matches in my direction to make me jump, but she is laughing as she does it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/code-name-verity-code-name-verity-1/page-3.html","bookId":2672,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:16 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:16 AM"}
