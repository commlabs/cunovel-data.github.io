I was the only person who\u0027d been told about him. Evanna had warned me not to speak of it to anybody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the cruel leader who will ruin the world after the War of the Scars,\" Mr Tall said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get it,\" Harkat grumbled. \"If we kill Steve, then there won\u0027t be a? Lord of the bloody Shadows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, but there will,\" Mr Tall said. \"The world is set to produce a monster of unimaginable power and fury. His coming is unavoidable. Only his identity is yet to be determined - and that will be decided shortly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wasteworld,\" Harkat said sickly. \"You mean, even if we kill Steve, that\u0027s what? the future will be? The desolate land where Darren and I found? out the truth about me - that\u0027s what lies? in store?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Tall hesitated, then nodded. \"I could not tell you before. I have never spoken of matters such as this in the past. But we are at the time where no harm can come of revealing it, since nothing can be done to avert it. is upon us - within twenty-four hours he will be born, and all the world will tremble at his coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long, stunned silence. Vancha, Harkat, Debbie and Alice were filled with confusion, especially the latter pair, who knew nothing of the wasteworld of the future.I was filled with fear. This was confirmation of all my worst nightmares. would rise regardless of what happened in the War of the Scars. And not only could I not prevent his coming - in one of the futures, I wouldbe him. Which meant, if we won the war, at some stage in the next fifty or sixty years, along with all the other lives I\u0027d ruin, I would kill Vancha too. It seemed impossible. It sounded like a sick joke. But Evanna and Mr Tall both had the gift of reading the future - and both had told me the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me get this straight,\" Vancha growled, breaking the silence and disrupting my train of thought. \"No matter what happens between us and Steve Leonard - or in the war with the vampaneze - a Lord of the Shadows is going to come along and destroy the world?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Mr Tall said. \"Humans are soon to lose control of this planet. The reins of power will be handed over. This is written. What remains to be seen is whether the reins pass to a vampaneze or? to a vampire.\" He didn\u0027t look at me when he said that. It might have been my imagination, but I got the feeling he had deliberately avoided making eye contact with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But regardless of who wins, I\u0027m for the chop?\" Vancha pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Mr Tall smiled. \"But do not fear death, Vancha, for it comes for us all.\" His smile dimmed. \"For some of us, it comes very soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Vancha snapped. \"You\u0027re not part of this. No vampire or vampaneze would raise a hand against you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That might be true,\" Mr Tall chuckled, \"but there are others in this world who do not hold me in such high esteem.\" He cocked his head sideways and his expression mellowed. \"And to prove my point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman screamed. We all sprang to our feet and rushed to the door, except Mr Tall, who slowly rose behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice was first to the door. Flinging it open, she dived out, drew a gun, rolled when she hit the ground, then came to her knees. Vancha was next. He leapt out, pulling a couple of shurikens free, jumping high to launch them from a height if he had to. I was third. I had no weapons, so I sprang over to where Alice was, guessing she\u0027d be able to supply me with something. Harkat and Debbie moved at the same time, Harkat brandishing his axe, Debbie pulling a pistol like Alice\u0027s. Behind them, Mr Tall stood in the doorway, gazing up at the sky. Then he stepped down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nobody in sight, but we heard another scream, this time a child\u0027s. Then a man gave a shout of panic - it was Evra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A weapon!\" I yelled at Alice as she got to her feet. With one hand she reached down and produced a short hunting knife from a pouch on her left leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay behind me,\" Alice commanded, homing in on the screams. \"Vancha to my left, Debbie and Harkat to my right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe obeyed the ex-chief inspector, fanned out and advanced. I could sense Mr Tall following, but I didn\u0027t look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman screamed again - Merla, Evra\u0027s wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople spilt out of the caravans and tents around us, performers and staff, eager to help. Mr Tall roared at them to keep out of this. His voice was thunderous and they quickly bolted back inside. I glanced over my shoulder, stunned by his fierceness. He smiled apologetically. \"This is our fight, not theirs,\" he said by way of explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"our\" surprised me - was Mr Tall finally abandoning his neutrality? - but I hadn\u0027t time to dwell upon it. Ahead of me, Alice had cleared the end of a tent and come into sight of the disturbance. A second later, I was on the scene too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vons - except Lilia, who wasn\u0027t present - were under attack. Their assailants - R.V., Morgan James and Steve Leopard\u0027s son, Darius! R.V. had killed Evra\u0027s snake and was in the process of chopping up Shancus\u0027s. Evra was fighting with the hook-handed madman, trying to drag him off. Shancus was in a wrestling lock with Darius. Merla had hold of Urcha, who was gripping his snake for dear life, sobbing pitifully. They were backing away from Morgan James. He was following slowly, smiling a jagged half-faced smile, red circles of blood highlighting his evil little eyes. The nose of his rifle was aimed at Merla\u0027s stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha reacted quickest. He sent a shuriken flying at Morgan James\u0027s rifle, knocking it off-target. James\u0027s finger tightened on the trigger at the contact and the rifle exploded - but the bullet shot wide. Before he could fire again, Merla released Urcha, ripped her right ear loose, and sent it flying at James\u0027s face. The ear struck him between the eyes and he fell back, grunting with surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlerted to our presence, R.V. knocked Evra out of the way and drove after Shancus. He grabbed him from Darius and held him up, laughing, daring us to risk the snake-boy\u0027s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have a clear shot!\" Alice yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got Morgan James covered!\" Debbie shouted back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then take him out!\" Alice roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boy dies if you hurt Morgan!\" R.V. retorted, pressing the three blades of his hookedleft hand up into the scaly flesh of Shancus\u0027s throat. Shancus either didn\u0027t realize the danger he was in, or didn\u0027t care, because he kept kicking and punching R.V. But we saw the killer\u0027s intent and paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him go, Hooky,\" Vancha snarled, moving ahead of the rest of us, hands spread wide. \"I\u0027ll fight you man to man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re no man,\" R.V. replied scornfully. \"You\u0027re scum, like all your race. Morgan! Are you OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh\u0027m fuhn,\" Morgan James groaned. He picked up his rifle and aimed it at Merla again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this time!\" Harkat shouted, stepping in front of Merla and swinging at James with his axe. James leapt clear of the deadly blade. Across from him, Darius drew a small arrow-gun and fired at Harkat. But he fired too hastily and the arrow flew high of its mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw myself at Darius, meaning to grab and hold him, as R.V. was holding Shancus. But Shancus\u0027s snake was thrashing wildly in its death throes, and I tripped over it before I could bring my hands together around Darius\u0027s throat. Flying forward, I crashed into Evra, who was rushing to his son\u0027s aid. We both fell over, wrapped in the dying snake\u0027s coils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the confusion, Morgan James and Darius regrouped around R.V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice, Debbie, Harkat and Vancha hung back, unable to pursue them for fear that R.V. would kill Shancus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him go!\" Merla screamed, eyes filled with tears of desperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make me!\" R.V. jeered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t get out of here,\" Vancha said as R.V. backed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s going to stop us?\" R.V. mocked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra was back on his feet and he made to run after the retreating trio. R.V. dug his hooks deeper into Shancus\u0027s throat. \"No you don\u0027t!\" he sang, and Evra froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" Debbie said, lowering her pistol. \"Release the boy and we\u0027ll let you leave unharmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in no position to make deals,\" R.V. laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" I shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The snake-boy,\" R.V. giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s no good to you.\" I took a determined step forward. \"Take me instead. I\u0027ll swap for Shancus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expected R.V. to leap at my offer, but he only shook his head slyly, red eyes shining. \"Stuff it, Shan,\" he said. \"We\u0027re taking the boy. If you get in our way, he dies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around at my allies - nobody was reacting. The vampaneze had us in a bind. Vancha could move with the speed of a full-vampire, and Debbie and Alice both had guns. But R.V. could kill Shancus before any of us could stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.V., Morgan James and Darius continued to back away. R.V. and James were grinning, but Darius looked the same way he\u0027d looked after shooting me - scared and slightly sickened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as the rest of us hesitated, Mr Tall spoke. \"I cannot allow this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.V. paused uncertainly. \"This is none of your business!\" he shouted. \"Keep your nose out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have made it my business,\" Mr Tall disagreed quietly. \"This is my home. These are my people. I must intervene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be a?\" R.V. yelled, but before he got any further, Mr Tall was upon him. He moved at a supernatural speed which even a vampire couldn\u0027t match. In less than a flash of an eye he was in front of R.V., his hands on the lunatic\u0027s hooks. He wrenched them away from Shancus\u0027s throat, tore two of the hooks off the left hand, and one off the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My hands!\" R.V. screamed in agony, as though the gold and silver hooks were part of his flesh. \"Leave my hands alone, you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever foul name he shouted was lost in the burst of a gun retort. Morgan James, who\u0027d been standing next to R.V., had jammed the tip of his rifle hard into Mr Tall\u0027s ribs and pulled the trigger. A bullet fired down the chamber of the rifle at a merciless speed - then ripped through the ribcage of the defenceless Hibernius Tall! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-of-the-shadows-the-saga-of-darren-shan-11/page-18.html","bookId":2447,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:20:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:20:12 PM"}
