It happened to other families; it could happen to hers, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, my mom and dad never bothered to get married. Does that shock you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” From what she knew about his mother, very little would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My daddy took off before I was born. The bastard.” Troy’s hoarse laughter followed. “My daddy was a bastard and he made me a bastard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the truth, so get used to it.” The humor left his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t imagine growing up without my dad,” Chrissie said, wanting to wrap Troy in her embrace and give him all the love he’d missed as a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, don’t go soft on me. There were plenty of men around,” he said with a measure of irony in his voice. “My mother saw to that. She married twice before I was fifteen and after that she provided me with a series of interesting uncles—none of whom stuck around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Troy, that’s terrible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Terrible? I’m a survivor because of it. No matter how bad things got, I landed on my feet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about your mother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced away. “She’s all right. Her life hasn’t been easy, but she’s made the best of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d like to meet her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy didn’t immediately respond. “Someday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why wait?” Chrissie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a bit too—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A bit too virginal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrissie elbowed him in the ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d like to change that,” he said suggestively. “Maybe you’ll let me before the end of the summer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I will.” Chrissie giggled. Troy made her see life in a completely different way. It was about surviving, and surviving meant not taking anything too seriously, not getting in too deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy late afternoon, Susannah was beside herself with worry. Chrissie had vanished without a word, without even leaving a note. The last time Susannah had seen her was while she was on the phone with Joe. She didn’t know where her daughter had gone or with whom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that it was hard to figure out. Chrissie was more than likely with Troy Nance. The very least the girl could’ve done was tell her. She had a cell phone. Why didn’t she call?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter an hour of pacing, she’d had it. She decided to escape the house. With a heavy heart, she drove to Altamira to visit her mother. Vivian was with friends, Sally Mansfield and two other women. Not wanting to interrupt her mother’s visit, Susannah only stayed for a few minutes. When she returned to the house, she phoned Carolyn, hoping for a chance to get together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sound upset,” her friend said barely a minute into the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am,” Susannah admitted. “I’ve had a horrible day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on over and I’ll commiserate with you. My day hasn’t been that wonderful, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later, Susannah pulled into the long driveway that led to Carolyn’s home. The scene was picturesque in the early-evening light; soon, the deer would venture down into the wide-open field next door. If she wasn’t so agitated, she’d stop and appreciate the beauty of the countryside, with the surrounding hills standing guard. She envied Carolyn the tranquility of this lovely place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door stood ajar, and after a courtesy knock, Susannah pushed open the screen door and let herself in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I poured the wine,” Carolyn announced from the kitchen. “After the day I’ve had, I need something stronger than iced tea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah echoed that sentiment. They sat down in the family room, where the air conditioner blew cool air from the vent overhead. The afternoon had grown unpleasantly warm and it felt good to relax. Had she been in Seattle, she would’ve been preparing for a party to celebrate the holiday weekend. As it was, she’d probably join her mother at Altamira for a barbecue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn sat at one end of the sofa and Susannah the other. After a sip of wine, Susannah gestured to her friend. “You go first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn gave a weak shrug. “With me, it’s a bunch of small things that added up to one disastrous day. I didn’t set my alarm, so I overslept, which I almost never do. Consequently I was late getting into the office. My entire day was off-kilter. I was rude to Jim although I didn’t mean to be and after that, everyone avoided me. I often stay late at the office, but not today. I wanted out of there the minute the whistle blew and frankly I think everyone was just as glad to be rid of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah could sympathize. “I hate it when my day gets off to a bad start.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be checking my alarm clock from now on.” Carolyn tucked her bare feet beneath her as she made herself comfortable on the couch. “All right, it’s your turn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn closed her eyes. “Okay, okay, I took the plunge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and Dave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t tell you, but we made…sort of a date. For today.” Carolyn sighed. “I ruined everything, though. He was weeding the flower beds this afternoon and I snapped at him and when I left work, I found a note on my windshield that said perhaps we should meet another night instead. Oh, Susannah,” she moaned, “I’m so disappointed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing that her friend had acted on her desires was encouraging news. “You actually approached him? Is that how you made your sort-of date?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn blushed. It was so wonderful to see Carolyn this excited that Susannah had to hold back a giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dave and I…ran into each other,” Carolyn explained. “At He’s Not Here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not much…We danced one dance and talked a bit. We decided to meet here tonight and then I had to make a complete mess of things.” She picked up her wineglass. “Enough about me. It’s your turn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah wasn’t sure what to tell her first. The most current crisis was her daughter, so she started there. “Chrissie took off…again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With Troy Nance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s my guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you considered talking to Sharon about him?” Carolyn asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrissie would hate it if she went to Troy’s mother, but Susannah was beyond caring. “I saw her earlier today at Safeway. She says she has Jake’s phone number and that the two of them got back together after I left for France.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you believe her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah didn’t have any choice. She nodded. “She knew about the St. Christopher medal I gave Jake. I’d forgotten about it, but she hadn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you really think she’s telling the truth?” Carolyn asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah shrugged. “I have to assume she is. Although she didn’t seem to know that Troy’s seeing Chrissie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She knows,” Carolyn muttered. “Trust me, she keeps close tabs on her boy. If you want to find out where Troy and Chrissie are, she’ll be able to tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as Susannah hated talking to Sharon twice in the same day, she had to do it. This ridiculous situation with Troy and Chrissie had gone on long enough. “How old is Troy, anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He must be around thirty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah frowned. Not only was this guy completely unsuitable, he was far too old for Chrissie. Sooner or later, she’d have to confront Chrissie about her relationship with Troy. When she did, she wanted her facts straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chrissie’s got you down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah ran her fingers down the stem of her wineglass and lifted one shoulder. “She’s only part of the problem. Joe and I had an argument this afternoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any particular reason?” Carolyn asked, then rushed to add, “If it’s none of my business, just say so, but if you want to talk, then I’m here to listen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling as wretched as she did, Susannah needed to share her dilemmas. “I didn’t tell him I’d hired a private eye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah sighed. “I know it’s crazy. You can imagine how Joe felt when he heard what I’d done—from Chrissie, by the way, which just infuriated me. And yet it’s my own fault for keeping it a secret. Joe was really angry with me, but he was at the office and couldn’t very well vent with his entire staff listening in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He doesn’t understand why it’s so important for you to find Jake, does he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t completely understand it myself. I wish I could just leave everything the way it is, but Carolyn, I can’t. It’s too late.” She bent her head, eyes closed. “Joe is my life raft, so why do I keep pushing him away? I can’t seem to help it. I’m risking everything for this, and when I consider what’s at stake, I have to admit it’s crazy. I can’t undo the past.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what happens next?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah wished she knew. “I have an appointment with the P.I. on Tuesday afternoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So she didn’t tell you anything yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not really. She mentioned putting out some feelers in Canada. I don’t have a clue what that’s all about. She said she’d tell me on Tuesday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She must have some news, otherwise she wouldn’t have asked for an appointment,” Carolyn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m hoping she does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If she has found him, what will you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah hadn’t decided. Yes, she wanted to talk to Jake and apologize for her father’s actions. But that could be done over the phone. Seeing him again was something else entirely. Despite herself, her heart raced with excitement at the prospect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was wrong, so wrong. She reminded herself forcefully that she was married. Joe was her husband and he was a good man who deserved better than to have his wife hungering after some high school boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet Susannah no longer felt in control of what she’d set in motion. She couldn’t stop the search for Jake now, even if she wanted to. And she didn’t….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Susannah?” Carolyn’s voice broke into her reverie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What will I do?” Susannah repeated. “I’m not sure.” She took another sip of her merlot. “Chrissie, Jake, Sharon, Joe—that’s not the end of my hellish day, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean there’s more?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup,” Susannah said, trying to sound lighthearted without much success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go on. You might as well tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I found out something about my brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn straightened and leaned toward her. “Doug? What did you learn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I went out to see Patricia Carney. Her name’s Anderson now. You remember her, don’t you? She and Doug were seeing each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarolyn nodded, setting her wineglass aside. “I remember the two of them were dating, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right, but Patricia seemed to think there might’ve been someone else in his life.” She stared down at her wine. “In fact, the night he was killed, Patricia was going to confront him and then at the last minute he broke their date.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/susannah-s-garden-blossom-street-3/page-32.html","bookId":1935,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:42 AM"}
