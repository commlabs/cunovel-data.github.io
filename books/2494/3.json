By accident, and under duress,\" I added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, that using this power in the reverse can bring things to the surface that might have stayed in their graves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, but it was more and maybe I hadn\u0027t been clear enough. \"It is also like a dinner bell to other AFTDs. By doing this, I\u0027m alerting the C-Ms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde frowned, the skin between his brows staying in a frozen ripple of flesh between his eyes. I was so ready to fix my zombie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no big deal if a dead chicken starts pecking in your front yard here,\" I said and her eyes strayed to the grim day, the rain pounding her grandfathered lawn into a sodden swamp as her equally illegal fire spewed fumes into our atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow, that\u0027s not a comfort,\" she said and Clyde actually covered his mouth with his hand. I laughed, he was so on board with the chicken humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay... listen, it\u0027s just a precaution. Me using this power might or might not alert the undead media. I\u0027m just sayin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Bobbi cocked her head and palmed the soft point of her triangular face. \"Other Cadaver-Manipulators might know you\u0027re doing something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said, relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it was rare to be a five-point, it\u0027d almost not been worth mentioning. I liked to think that the potential for bullshit happening was as far out as a Hail Mary pass on the football field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough, I\u0027d caught far more Hail Marys than sheer chance allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well Parker is not a problem, so who cares?\" she said, lifting her shoulders in a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, Parker wasn\u0027t a problem. Clyde and I shared a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I wasn\u0027t trying to be insensitive....\" she said, looking between the two of us. \"I know you\u0027re worried about him, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the height of irony that my nemesis was now someone that might need a hero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamely, me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, ducking my head to hide my expression. There were too many mixed emotions for me to engage any of them. Instead, I ignored the whole tamale and concentrated at the task at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker would know I was using.\" I looked at both of them. \"And so would anyone that was say, a four-point or greater. That is the concern. That I would call another C-M to our location.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s so bad about that?\" Gale asked but it was Clyde that answered. \"It is not good that another as powerful as our Caleb make an appearance whilst I am vulnerable and we are tied in this...\" He waved his shriveled, vaguely mummy looking hand and I finished, \"reverse Life-Transference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to try anyway,\" Gale said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I want to but I just had to let you guys in on it. What could happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The potential for evil will always lurk at the edges of what is good... what is wholesome,\" Clyde mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is right,\" Bobbi finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded in agreement, they were correct on all counts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I laid hands on Clyde. Everything receded to a pinpoint of consciousness and the only noise was a warm rushing in my ears like blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath came like a wave to shore, sweeping me away and with it, my bearings were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that mattered was the corpse under my hands, his flesh called to mine. My death power that was only barely held in check came online. I released it and, with a sigh, it slipped out of its prison and swam through the conduit of our union.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt crashed into Clyde and his mouth dropped open, slack with the crush of it and my hands involuntarily convulsed against his. Our grips tightened, my hands bleeding to white with his hold and I watched as color came back to skin that had been ashen moments before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his eyes filled in, losing their glittering obsidian velvet to brown. Finally the flecks of green that made them what they were flickered to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was done he let go of my hands. \"Now show me your mouth, Clyde,\" I requested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and like an amateur dentist I was happy to report that all his teeth remained perfect, whole and white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue was pink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my shudder of relief to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale and I smiled at each other and Clyde sat up, his clothes magically restored to order. I wasn\u0027t sure how I had wardrobe control but that was for a different day. Right now, my Clyde was a guy again. Gone was the rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel like a new creature!\" he sang in his rich timbre, running perfect and whole hands over his restored figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all grinning like fools when Gale said hesitantly, \"Is that what I think it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at where she was pointing through the window, the hand-rolled glass added to the disquieting image that wavered and rippled in our line of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a chicken in the yard. A quite obviously dead chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur smiles faded. None of us were diggin\u0027 on the coincidence of the very thing I had joked about manifesting so neatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked to the door and opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped out onto the stoop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a million chickens. Or at least about fifty. They were real creepers too. They came to stand on the lawn and stared at me expectantly. A few dove and pecked, tearing earthworms out of the wet ground and slurping them down with unnervingly disgusting consumptive noises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb,\" Gale said in a shaky voice. \"God, I can feel them... they\u0027re so...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vacant,\" I supplied in a flat voice. These dead were different. I didn\u0027t like it. At. All.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbi nodded in tacit agreement. Clyde stood behind her, a head taller and wrapped a beefy (and perfect) forearm around her waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hissed at the flock and the one who had appeared first cawed like a crow, its rotting eyes fixing on Clyde, recognizing him. The sound of it thrummed deeply within that power still roiling underneath the surface of my being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a rooster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, the Js rolled up to the front door. The birds, instead of acting like live birds and getting out of the way stood there staring at the approaching car and stayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy plowed over one, feathers and chicken zombie guts getting in the spokes of his wheels like plaque in teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027ll be flossing that out of there for forever, I thought, my gaze coming to rest on the chickens standing like feathered sentinels in my zombie\u0027s yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow... just wow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy cranked open his door and gave a look of profound disgust. \"What is this trumped up shit, Hart?\" He looked at me like I\u0027d lost my mind. \"I mean, what?\" he began, flailing his hands around as John came around the front of the car to inspect the entrails now wrapped in the grill and tire wells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been done with probation for three and a half seconds and you raise goddamned chickens?\" he asked incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn clucked at me. \"I expected more, really,\" he said with a small Mona Lisa smile. Straightening, he plucked a feather out of the grill and sent it flying like a small spear into the air. It stabbed the ground directly in front of the original chicken... that I now knew was a rooster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey look, Terran,\" Jonesy began and waggled his eyebrows and John frowned. We both knew something inappropriate was going to happen but Jonesy was too unpredictable to fathom so we waited for the bomb to drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got a cock in your front yard!\" he yelled into the still neighborhood, bent over at the waist and laughing until tears streamed out of his eyes at the lone rooster surrounded by hens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn\u0027s small smile became a grin and Clyde frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not see the source of your amusement,\" Clyde said in his droll way, giving me a look that said is he really saying this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, yes he was, I thought and Clyde sighed in annoyance. Jonesy sorta got old Clyde riled up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think, young sir, you\u0027re missing the greater point,\" Clyde said, trying for logic. That only made Jonesy whoop harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knock it off ya pudwacker,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn rolled his eyes, shoving Jonesy into the side of his car and the pulsealarm started to wail. \"Hey Terran, ya dick!\" Jonesy said, fumbling his thumb onto the pad and disabling the alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn stepped forward, keeping a wide berth around the chickens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" he said, then added, \"I mean... besides the basic fact you have a couple coops\u0027 worth of zombie chickens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help it, I gave a snicker at that and Jonesy said, \"See?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Clyde looked at me, giving a deserving frown my way. I sharpened up, telling the Js what happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah... okay, Hart. You\u0027re off the hook. I thought you\u0027d become an imbecile and started raising barn animals.\" Jonesy looked around dramatically. \"Speaking of which, where the hell\u0027s Alex to razz about that happy crap?\" Seeing no one else to abuse with his sarcasm he huffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, you need a ride and now you have to clean up the farm, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"I think I can handle a few chickens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy looked at the roaming fowl, getting a look of distaste again. \"They\u0027re freakin\u0027 creepy Hart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd zombies were so normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn laughed and then mumbled \"Sorry\" to Clyde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s quite alright, young man. I am willing to be magnanimous this day as I have been restored.\" He graced me with a grin of pride and gratitude and I felt a little heat rise to my face. Clyde\u0027s pride in me mattered. I know it was weird, him being a zombie and all but Clyde had become like... family. Truthfully, he was in a way I hadn\u0027t gotten straight. Too many issues, not enough time to solve all the mysteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah man, you look a buttload better,\" Jonesy said. John tried to soften the horror of Jonesy\u0027s compliment. \"You look good, Clyde.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you Mr. Terran.\" His eyes swiveled to Jonesy\u0027s. \"And I think... thank you as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You betcha! You\u0027re our number one zombie, Clyde. We can\u0027t have you running around rotting. Makes Caleb look bad.\" He was so earnest but I could tell Bobbi had reached her end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks Jonesy, why don\u0027t you wait in the car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I being dismissed?\" Jonesy asked in surprise, his dark hand splayed against his muscular chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale appeared to ponder her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor like four seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" she said and Clyde gave a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well damn! Okay, ingrates. I was the chauffeur and...\" he looked over at my car. \"Hey! You didn\u0027t even need a ride.\" Jonesy turned accusing eyes to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking we could meet here, Jones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes rolled in his head, just two spots of white in his black face. \"Whatever,\" he said, giving a subtle adjust of his package and John about died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy was so him. There was no stopping him, he was like a force or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about these stupid chickens?\" he said and went to kick out toward the rooster for emphasis and Gale yelled, \"Jonesy, watch it! The yard is slick...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy was graceful. More than anyone I knew but even he couldn\u0027t correct himself on the saturated lawn. His foot slipped from underneath him and he did what everyone does, he tried to break his fall with his arm, the sidewalk roaring up to greet him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t break his fall, but the sidewalk broke his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it had been an okay day. Kinda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerran and I rushed over there and Jonesy was groaning about his arm, holding the elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of my dead chickens came over and pecked him right on the hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" Jonesy hollered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and the rooster backed off, its eyes meeting mine, then with a slurping noise that was disgusting even to me it sucked the one drop of blood it had managed to rob Jonesy of into its beak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde\u0027s eyes met mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese weren\u0027t just regular zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pulse the ambulance,\" Gale said, running into her old-fashioned house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn looked at the chickens then at a writhing Jonesy and said, \"He would have to break his arm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut your pie hole Terran!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe smiled at each other, sirens becoming gradually louder as they drew nearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Clyde and he was slightly green around the gills at the sight of bone protruding from Jonesy\u0027s forearm. I thought that was the height of irony, Clyde was a little squeamish. Nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered what the EMTs would think when they came on the scene. Fifty zombie chickens, a kid with a busted arm and chicken guts in the grill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother day in the life of Caleb Hart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy\u0027s sour look stayed on his face while the rest of us kept laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very uncool, chumps. I mean, it was a spiral, ya doofuses. I could have been Maimed. For. Life,\" Jonesy said, folding two good arms in front of himself, one in the soft cast that he still had to wear. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unrequited-death-death-6/page-3.html","bookId":2494,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:49:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:49:25 PM"}
