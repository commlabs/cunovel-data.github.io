In his eyes, the Concept of the 33 Layered Heavens represented the peak of the universe. Besides the Divine Realm there were 32 other Heavens, but these Heavens only stood on equal ground to the Divine Realm, not dominating it. The Concept of the 33 Layered Heavens was also the highest supreme Concept formed by gathering together essence, energy, and divine. The supreme being who created the Asura Road was absolutely someone who had reached the pinnacle of this aspect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, there were 36 golden-armored martial artists in front of Lin Ming, three more than he thought there would be.

At the same time, an invisible force covered Lin Ming, surrounding him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis is… a domain?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s mind turned cold. This was not just a domain – it was an extremely high rank domain. This domain consisted of three different kinds of power – spirit essence, true essence, and astral essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese three powers perfectly fused with each other and flooded the surrounding space. At this time, the 36 golden-armored warriors split up into three groups, each group consisting of 12 of them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor each group of 12 there was a leader, with the other 11 standing in different positions around this person.

A trial challenger had to complete these checkpoints one after another in order to fully complete this trial.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the last 100 million years, only the saints’ Good Fortune Saint Son and the spiritas’ young genius girl were able to surpass 80% in completing these checkpoints.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd now, this trial challenger game in front of Lin Ming was definitely the first checkpoint that branched out from the previous difficulty.

Thus, he didn’t fear that his opponent was skilled in the essence gathering system. If his opponent used the Laws, he could use his own Laws to counter. Attacking the group of essence gathering system warriors was the easiest as well as fastest route.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for the body transformation system warriors, their defensive ability was formidable. Even three rounds of attacks might not result in any true damage done to them. As for the soul forging system warriors, there was no need to speak of them. Their mysterious and strange soul attacks held too many unknown variables for Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHah - !\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe phantom of the Heretical God Tree appeared behind Lin Ming. The massive Heretical God Tree rose straight into the skies. The wild power of thunder and fire raged down it, pouring into Lin Ming’s Phoenix Blood Spear. For a time, a purple and red sun seemed to appear within the void.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming thrust his spear out and a divine light swept over the world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s attack was far too strong. Even though 12 golden-armored warriors united together, they still found it difficult to withstand the impact of this spear strike.

He shouted out loud, galvanizing the grandmist space to the peak. At the same time, he opened the Eight Inner Hidden Gates, increasing his defensive power to the limit. He actually planned to forcefully resist the attacks of the two other groups of golden-armored warriors and then quickly exterminate the essence gathering system group. If he could do this then their array formation would be broken!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKa ka ka!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTwo beams of energy fiercely collided with the grandmist space. This placed a great pressure on Lin Ming, but he didn’t care at all. Instead, he thrust out his spear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThree Essences As One, Eternal Darkness!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that instant, essence, energy, and divine strength fused within Lin Ming. The Phoenix Blood Spear emitted a clarion cry as an absolute dark black hole seed was shot out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA black hole seed could absorb all matter and energy. Now that Lin Ming was using the grandmist space to suppress the movements of the 12 golden-armored warriors in front of him, he could only use this strike.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA horrifying explosion of energy rang out. The black hole seed caused a massive black vortex to appear.

In that attack just now he had been forced to make a quick decision and as a result he had withstood the strikes of two other attacks, leaving him with some wounds. But to his powerful mortal body, this degree of injury wasn’t anything at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s over.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow that two of the 36 golden-armored warriors were gone, the array formation was no longer in balance.

He grasped the Phoenix Blood Spear and hurtled forwards like a tiger rushing into a flock of sheep. An essence gathering system golden-warrior bore the brunt of this attack and was sent flying away by Lin Ming, losing all contact with the postcelestial dao diagram beneath him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe golden-armored warrior tried to use the Space Laws to return to his position in the array diagram, but Lin Ming’s Space Laws were even more profound. In just a split second, he immediately teleported behind that golden-armored warrior and stabbed his spear through his chest, immediately killing him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t stop here.
