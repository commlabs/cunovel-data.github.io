You know I am not a prude, but all girls are not like you, Effie; and, in short, Sister137 Kate is in the right. Someone must have seen you walking back with Mr. Lawson, and must have told her, or hinted, at least, at the state of the case. Nothing else would have induced her to question you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She had no right to speak to me about acquaintances that I meet out of the hospital.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Strictly speaking, she has no right; that\u0027s why I say she must have got a hint.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, well, never mind her,\" said Effie. \"I won\u0027t speak to Mr. Lawson again, unless I meet him out of doors, where I can, and shall, whatever Sister Kate may say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Effie, you must be careful.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t want to think of myself at all. Can\u0027t you see how miserable I am about my mother and about George?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; it is a most wretched business. I am more sorry for you than I can say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, I wish something could be done,\" said Effie. \"I feel tired and fettered here—I feel almost wild. I cannot devote myself to my necessary duties.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Poor child,\" said Dorothy in her caressing voice. \"Let me think: I must help you in some way. Suppose I go to-day to see your mother? I had a chance of having the whole afternoon to myself, but, as I had nowhere in particular to go, was determining not to avail myself of it, but now I can be of use to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Dorothy! would you really go to see mother? It will be of the greatest possible use. You have such tact—you can say things that no one else would venture to say; and then if only you could see George!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll take the thing up somehow,\" said Dorothy; \"you shan\u0027t be dragged and worried to death, you dear, brave little girl. Give me a kiss, Effie, and go138 back to your work. Between Mr. Lawson and me, we will pull you through this trouble, see if we don\u0027t!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you know Mr. Lawson, Dorothy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Know him! Of course I do. He is one of the very nicest fellows here—as good as gold and as steady as a rock, and with such a beautiful enthusiasm for his profession—he\u0027ll make a splendid doctor by and by. Yes, Effie, don\u0027t mistake me: it is not the man I object to, it is the fact that he is a medical student, and that you are a nurse. So many bad things have been said about nurses and medical students that all nurses worthy of the name have to make up their minds to show the world that they can and will nurse without even the thought of flirtation coming into their head.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re right, of course,\" said Effie, with burning cheeks. \"But it\u0027s a shame, it\u0027s horrible! How can anyone think I wish to flirt?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She turned away—she was obliged to go back to her duties; but her heart felt much lighter after her conversation with Dorothy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That afternoon Sister Kate, watched Effie as she would, could find no fault with her. She was attentive, tactful, kind, and considerate; a little bit of her old pleasant cheerfulness had also returned to her—her face looked less careworn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fact is, she was leaning on Dorothy, and felt the comfort of Dorothy\u0027s strong support.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The patients were only too glad for Effie to do things for them; and No. 47, who was very weak and low, smiled whenever the girl approached her bedside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hold my hand, love, whenever you have a minute to spare,\" said the poor creature. \"I feel low like, awfully low; I am going down—down, and it139 supports me to hold your hand; you\u0027re a good girl, anyone can see that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I try to be,\" said Effie, tears springing to her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, it\u0027s well to be good,\" continued the woman. \"When we come to lie as I\u0027m lying now, we think a sight of goodness.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope you\u0027ll soon be better,\" said Effie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Never, my love, never again. I\u0027m going out—that\u0027s what is happening to me; it\u0027s a lonesome thing to die, but I don\u0027t feel so lonesome when I\u0027m holding your hand.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Effie came to the poor creature as often as she could. Once again the fascination of the life she so dearly loved drew her out of herself, and enabled her to forget the heavy home cares.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In her bedroom that night Sister Dorothy paid her a visit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, Effie,\" she said, \"I\u0027ve news for you. Mr. Lawson saw George last night. He spoke to him quite frankly, and said that, if he did not immediately give over this awful gambling, he\u0027d go and see his cousin, Mr. Gering.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what did George say?\" asked Effie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, he promised as faithfully as possible that he\u0027d give it up. Mr. Lawson seemed quite pleased with him, and said he didn\u0027t think he\u0027d have been so penitent and so easily influenced as he has been.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But will he give it up?\" questioned Effie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He promised to. Of course he is anxious at not being able to earn more money, for the foolish fellow encouraged your mother to be extravagant, and now there are several debts which must be met somehow. What\u0027s the matter with you, Effie? Why do you start?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How can I help it? Debts would kill mother.140 Perhaps I ought to tell you, Dorothy—you have been so good to me, and I trust you so much that I don\u0027t think it can be wrong to tell you any trouble which concerns me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, of course it isn\u0027t. Speak out what is in your mind, Effie.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, George was in trouble that time he came to see father—that time when father was dying. He owed Mr. Lawson—- I can\u0027t tell you how, I can\u0027t tell you why—￡250. He said that if the money were not paid back within six weeks, that he, George—oh, Dorothy, how can I say it?—that he\u0027d have to go to—to prison! He said he must have the money; I felt, too, that he must have the money; for our mother\u0027s sake. So I went to see Squire Harvey, and he—he lent it to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dorothy sat down on the side of the bed. Effie\u0027s story made her feel very grave. She paused for a moment, puzzled what to say.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He lent me the money,\" continued Effie, looking straight at her friend with her bright eyes. \"I know he never wants it back again, but he must have it back.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, yes! he must have it back,\" exclaimed Dorothy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, he lent it to me,\" continued Effie, with a sigh; \"and I thought, of course, that George would be all right after that, and I arranged that the Squire should have his interest regularly. I thought my own salary would nearly cover that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It can\u0027t be done,\" interrupted Dorothy. \"Your salary barely pays for your washing and your few out-of-pocket expenses. It\u0027s absolutely impossible that you can live here without a penny; the little you earn must go to yourself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then there\u0027s nothing for it,\" said Effie; \"I must go where I can earn more. I hate the thought beyond all words, but I must—I must do it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t mean to tell me that you would give up your life as a nurse?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think for a moment, Dorothy, that I\u0027d give it up willingly? It makes me sick to think of relinquishing what has been my dream ever since I was a little girl; but I see plainly that I must do something to earn money to help mother; and then, if George does keep straight, perhaps we may all be happy some day.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tears choked Effie\u0027s voice, her eyes grew dim.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you think of doing, dear?\" said Dorothy in a gentle voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll go to the Harveys and ask them to take me as a governess for Freda. I fancy, somehow, that they might be induced to give me a good salary—something like fifty or sixty pounds a year, and I can teach a child like Freda very well indeed, for her father saw that I was well educated. There\u0027s nothing else for it, I can see that; but it breaks my heart all the same.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1497/44734.html","bookId":662,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:45:08 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:45:08 AM"}
