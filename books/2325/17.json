I guess she had been dancing, practicing steps or something. She looked at me, and her eyes widened when she placed me. She took an involuntary step backward and I followed her into the room. She started to say something, then stopped and went to turn off the music. She turned back to me, and she looked scared and guilty. I didn\u0027t think she had much cause for either emotion, but I decided to press.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You\u0027re from Tallahassee, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Price is a stage name. Your real name is Prysocki.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a phone here when you moved in. It hadn\u0027t been disconnected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know I wasn\u0027t supposed to use it. I thought the phone came with the room, like a hotel or something. I didn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you called home, and you called your father at his store.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. She looked terribly young, and scared to death. \"I\u0027ll pay for the calls,\" she said. \"I didn\u0027t realize, I thought I would get a bill or something. And then I couldn\u0027t get a phone installed right away, they couldn\u0027t send someone to connect it until Monday, so I waited until then to have it disconnected. When the installer came he just hooked the same phone up, but with a different number so I wouldn\u0027t get any of her calls. I swear I didn\u0027t mean to do anything wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t do anything wrong,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be happy to pay for the calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about the calls. You were the one who ordered the phone disconnected?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, was that wrong? I mean, she wasn\u0027t living here, so-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was the right thing for you to do,\" I told her. \"I\u0027m not concerned about a couple of free phone calls. I\u0027m just trying to find a girl who dropped out of sight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you don\u0027t have to be afraid of anything. You\u0027re not going to get in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I didn\u0027t exactly think I was going to get in trouble, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was there an answering machine hooked up to the phone, Georgia? A telephone answering machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes darted involuntarily to the bedside table, where an answering machine stood alongside a telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have given it back when you were here before,\" she said. \"If I even thought of it. But you just asked me a couple of quick questions, what was in the room and did I know Paula and did anybody come looking for her after I moved in, and by the time I remembered the machine you were gone. I didn\u0027t mean to keep it, only I didn\u0027t know what else to do with it. It was here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I used it. I was going to have to buy one, and this one was already here. I was just going to use it until I could afford to buy one of my own. I want to get one with a remote, so you can call from another phone and get your messages off it. This one doesn\u0027t have that feature. But for the time being it\u0027s okay. Do you want to take it with you? It won\u0027t take me a minute to disconnect it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want the machine,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t come here to pick up answering machines, or to collect money for calls to Tallahassee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to ask you a few questions about the phone, that\u0027s all. And about the machine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You moved in on the eighteenth and the phone was on until the twentieth. Did Paula get any calls during that time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The phone didn\u0027t ring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It rang once or twice but it was for me. I called my friend and gave her the number here, and she called me once or twice over the weekend. That was a local call so it didn\u0027t cost anything, or if it did all it cost was a quarter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care if you called Alaska,\" I told her. \"If it\u0027ll put your mind at rest, the calls you did make didn\u0027t cost anybody anything. Paula\u0027s deposit came to more than her final bill, so the calls were paid for out of money that would have been refunded to her, and she\u0027s not around to claim the refund anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I\u0027m being silly about this,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right. The only calls that came in were for you. How about when you were out? Were there any messages on her machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not after I moved in. I know because the last message was from her mother, all about how they were going to be out of town, and that message must have been left a day or two before I moved in. See, as soon as I figured out it was her phone and not one that came with the room, I unplugged the answering machine. Then about a week later I decided she wasn\u0027t coming back for it and I might as well use it, because I needed one. When I hooked it up again I played her messages before I set the tape to record.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were there messages besides the ones from her parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you still have them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I erased the tape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember anything about the other messages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gee, I don\u0027t. There were some that were just hangups. I just played the tape once through trying to figure out how to erase it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the other tape, the one that says nobody\u0027s home but you can leave a message? Paula must have had one of those on the machine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you erase it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It erases automatically when you record a new message over it. And I did that so I could leave a message in my own voice when I started using the machine.\" She chewed at her lip. \"Was that wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would it have been important? It was just the usual thing. \u0027Hello, this is Paula. I can\u0027t talk to you right now but you can leave a message at the sound of the tone.\u0027 Or something like that, that\u0027s not word-for-word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not important,\" I said. And it wasn\u0027t. I just would have liked a chance to hear her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised you\u0027re still on it,\" Durkin said. \"What did you do, call Indiana and shake some more dough out of the money tree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I probably should, I\u0027m putting in a lot of hours, but I\u0027m not getting much in the way of results. I think her disappearance is a criminal matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She never officially moved out. She paid her rent one day, and ten days later her landlady cracked the door and the room was empty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Happens all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that. The room was empty except for three things. Whoever cleaned it out left the phone, the answering machine, and the bed linens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what does that tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That somebody else packed the stuff and carried it off. A lot of rooming houses furnish bed linen. This one didn\u0027t. Paula Hoeldtke had to supply her own linen, so she would have known to take it with her when she left. Someone else who didn\u0027t know might have assumed it was supposed to stay with the room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all you\u0027ve got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The answering machine was left behind, and it was hooked up to continue answering the phone and telling people to leave their messages. If she\u0027d left on her own she\u0027d have called and had the phone disconnected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if she left in a hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She probably would have called in somewhere along the line. But let\u0027s say she didn\u0027t, let\u0027s say she was enough of an airhead to forget it altogether. Why would she leave the machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same thing. She forgot it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The room was left empty. No clothes in the drawers, nothing in the closet. There wasn\u0027t a whole lot of clutter around for things to get lost in. All that was left was the bed linen, the phone, and the answering machine. She couldn\u0027t have not noticed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure she could. Lots of people leave the phone when they move. I think you\u0027re supposed to leave the phone, unless it\u0027s one that you bought outright. Anyway, people leave them. So she\u0027s gonna leave her phone. So the answering machine- where is it, it\u0027s next to the phone, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she looks over there and she doesn\u0027t see something separate, an answering machine, a household appliance, keeps you in touch with your friends and associates, ends your worry of missing calls, di dah di dah di dah. What she sees is part of the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. \"Maybe,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s part of the phone, it goes with the phone. And, since the phone stays, it stays with the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why doesn\u0027t she come back for it when she realizes it\u0027s missing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she\u0027s in Greenland,\" he said, \"and it\u0027s cheaper to buy a new machine than to get on a plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Joe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know either, but I\u0027ll tell you this, it makes as much sense as looking at a phone and an answering machine and two sheets and a blanket and trying to make a kidnapping case out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t forget the bedspread.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right. Maybe she moved somewhere that she couldn\u0027t use the linen. What was it, a single bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Larger than that, somewhere between a single and a double. I think they call it a three-quarter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she moved in with some slick dude with a king-size water bed and a twelve-inch cock, and what does she need with some old sheets and pillowcases? What does she even need with a phone, as far as that goes, if she\u0027s gonna be spending all her time on her back with her knees up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think somebody moved her out,\" I said. \"I think somebody took her keys and let himself into her room and packed up all her things and slipped out of there with them. I think-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anybody see a stranger leave the building with a couple of suitcases?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t even know each other, so how would they spot a stranger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did anybody see anybody toting some bags around that time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too long ago, you know that. I asked the question of people on the same floor with her, but how can you remember a commonplace event that might have taken place two months ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the whole point, Matt. If anybody left a trail, it\u0027s ice-cold by now.\" He picked up a Lucite photo cube, turned it in his hands and looked at a picture of two children and a dog, all three beaming at the camera. \"Go on with your script,\" he said. \"Somebody moves her stuff out. He leaves the linen because he doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s hers. Why does he leave the answering machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So anybody who calls her won\u0027t know she\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why doesn\u0027t he leave everything, and even the landlady won\u0027t know she\u0027s gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because eventually the landlady will figure out that she\u0027s not coming back, and the matter might get reported to the police. Cleaning out the room tidies a potential loose end. Leaving the answering machine buys a little time, gives the illusion she\u0027s still there to anybody at a distance, and makes it impossible to know exactly when she moved. She paid her rent on the sixth and her room was found to be vacant ten days later, so that\u0027s the best I can narrow down the time of her disappearance, and that\u0027s because he left the machine on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you figure that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her parents called a couple of times and left messages. If the machine hadn\u0027t picked up they would have kept calling until they reached her, and when they didn\u0027t reach her no matter what time they called, they would have been alarmed, they would have thought something happened to her. In all likelihood her father would have come to see you two months earlier than he did.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/out-on-the-cutting-edge-matthew-scudder-7/page-17.html","bookId":2325,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:22 AM"}
