Unlike the uniquely shaped Dark Red Castle, Sunset Castle that gave off an antique feeling, as well as the manor style Arthur family castle, Bevulas’ castle trumped them all in space alone. This castle formed from countless square meter blocks of stones was three hundred meters tall just from the oceanfront side alone! Between each block of stone were framework structures made of superalloys to support it, and that was why they could support this type of weight.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThroughout the years, what Bevulas liked to do the most was stand at the summit of the castle and gaze into the deep great sea.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn two days, the emergency meeting would commence, as well as the day when he would directly confront the Spider Empress. Great figures with noble status, powerful abilities, or enormous powers backing them were currently heading towards this Rhodes Island that was extremely close to the main continent. There were some among them who belonged to the centrist faction, but Bevulas believed that after seeing the current state of things clearly, these intelligent individuals would understand what to do. Unfortunately, if they were smart enough and could take action decisively ahead of time, they wouldn’t be a part of the centrist faction. Bevulas never liked those that liked to add flowers to brocades, and the Spider Empress was no different.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was reasonable to assume that nothing unusual should happen in the emergency meeting this time, but Bevulas wasn’t against making even more preparations.

He turned around and saw that the one that appeared in the study was a seemingly eleven or twelve year old boy. He had medium length black hair and rather strange golden eyes. His fine white skin was a bit unusual. What was rather eye-catching was that he was extremely pretty, and if he wore women’s clothes, he would be a beautiful princess.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Haydn?

That’s why she decided to go after Persephone and woke me up to serve your distinguished self.

Only after a while did he mumble, “I wanted… to capture Madeline back and see between me and her, who was the true battle genius.

I never had that thought before,I \u0026nbsp;just wanted to research her body a bit. Henry is your distinguished self’s only son, and he also has your bloodline, so that’s why he dared to compete with you over Madeline’s body. If I dared to do something like that, I will immediately be drowned out by your rage!

The feeling he gave off now was that of a completely different person. In the past, even though O’Brien displayed talent in almost every field, the immaturity and impulsiveness of his age was still impossible to completely remove. However, after just these three days of adjustment from the mother tree, there was suddenly a sense of calmness and great changes exuding from O’Brien’s body.
