Emma stared at the branches, noting that it was the same tree she’d used the night she snuck out with Ethan, and the same tree Thayer had used to break into Sutton’s bedroom. Suddenly, she jolted up with a start. The window was wide open. And a hulking figure stood in the corner of the room, his breath coming in jagged rasps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you really think it’d be that easy to get rid of me?” his voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he was in the shadows, Emma recognized him immediately. “Thayer?” she squeaked, the name barely escaping her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scrambled back against the headboard, but it was too late. Thayer launched forward, his hands closing around her neck, his lips inches from hers. “You betrayed me, Emma,” he whispered, his hands tightening around her throat. His bottom lip grazed hers. “And now it’s time for your reunion with Sutton to become a reality.” Emma dug her nails into Thayer’s skin as her oxygen supply dwindled and her life seeped slowly from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, no!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goodbye, Emma,” Thayer sneered. His hands squeezed and squeezed … seemingly to the tune of Kelly Clarkson’s “Mr. Know It All.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma shot up in bed. The same Kelly Clarkson song blared in her ears. She looked around. She was in Sutton’s bedroom, Sutton’s sheets clinging to her wet skin. Sunlight streamed through the window—it was, indeed, open. But the corner was empty. She touched her neck, and she didn’t feel any evidence that she’d been strangled. Her skin felt smooth. Nothing hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dream. It was just a dream. But it had felt so real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt all too real to me, too. I looked hard at the corner, startled that Thayer wasn’t really there. It still shook me that I was carried along with Emma everywhere she went, even into her dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma’s fingers trembled as she tugged her light blue pajama top down over her stomach and glanced around Sutton’s bedroom once more. The computer screen glowed with familiar images of Sutton and her best friends\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—this particular photo was taken after a tennis team victory. The girls had their arms slung around each other and flashed peace signs at the camera. A German textbook lay open on Sutton’s desk along with a small book of poetry Ethan had given Emma the week before. There were no stuffed animals anywhere—the real Sutton had been too mature for toys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was that open window again. Emma could have sworn she shut and locked it the night before. She pushed back the covers, walked to it, and peered out. The Mercers’ impeccable lawn stretched in waves of green before her, not a white wicker lawn chair or potted plant out of place. The Tucson sun was a ball of fire above the Catalina Mountains and the sound of birds chattering filtered into the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBzz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma jumped and turned around. Something was sounding from underneath Sutton’s bed. She realized almost immediately that it was her BlackBerry from her old life. She dove for it and checked the screen. It was Alex, her best friend from Henderson. Clearing her throat, she pressed the green answer button. “Hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey. Everything okay? You sound weird.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma flinched. But Alex couldn’t know what Emma had just dreamed about. She didn’t even know Emma was in danger—as far as she was concerned, Sutton was still alive, and Emma was experiencing a foster-girl’s dream life with her long-lost sister. “Of course everything’s fine,” she croaked. “I was just sleeping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, get up, sleepyhead,” Alex giggled. “I haven’t heard from you in ages. I wanted to see how things are going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everything’s fine,” Emma said, forcing herself to sound upbeat. “Great, in fact. Sutton’s family rocks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe you’ve been given this instant new life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should be on Oprah or something. Want me to submit your story?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Emma said, perhaps too forcefully. She padded into Sutton’s closet, partly to select an outfit for the day, but partly because it was more private in there—there was less chance of Laurel hearing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, okay! How’s school? Do you like Sutton’s friends?” Alex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma paused in front of a blue silk tank top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honestly, things with them are a little tense right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How come? Can’t they handle two of you?” Alex’s voice was momentarily muffled, and Emma could picture her getting dressed for school, brushing her hair, and shoving a cinnamon bun in her mouth. Alex was the queen of multitasking and had a wicked sweet tooth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re just a pretty tight-knit group,” Emma said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They have so much history that I can’t even begin to understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex chewed and swallowed. “History is just that—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehistory. Plan something fun and create your own stories with them, maybe even apart from Sutton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, maybe,” Emma said, realizing that she barely ever hung out with any of Sutton’s friends one-on-one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake let out a low bark downstairs, and Emma heard Mrs. Mercer shush him. “Listen, I should go—I promised Sutton I’d help her with homework before classes start.” She disconnected the call after promising she’d keep in better touch, then wandered out of Sutton’s closet and flopped back on her bed, her head suddenly throbbing. It was awful to lie to Alex. She thought of all the afternoons she’d spent in Alex’s bedroom, finding new music on Pandora and predicting each other’s futures. They’d shared a mauve-colored journal, taking turns updating it with new entries every few days. They’d stashed it in a trapdoor cut into the carpet below Alex’s bed so no one would find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had secrets they kept from the world, but not from each other—until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma sat up. If Thayer had kept Sutton’s notes, maybe she’d kept his, too. But where did she hide them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma swung her legs over the side of Sutton’s bed and ducked beneath the folds of the comforter. Two shoeboxes were shoved up against the wall, but she’d already gone through them weeks ago. She pulled them out anyway, dumping the contents onto the bed, in case she’d missed something. Old tests and graded papers scattered across the sheets along with a neon green rubber band and concert ticket stubs for Lady Gaga. A Barbie doll with vacant blue eyes stared back at Emma, her tangled blonde hair cascading over an elaborate silk prom dress. This wasn’t E, the doll Sutton had perhaps named after Emma—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was in a hope chest in the Mercers’ bedroom. But Emma had seen all this stuff before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma moved to Sutton’s dresser and yanked each drawer open one by one, tossing the contents onto the floor. There had to be something she was missing. She rifled through T-shirts and shorts and stuck her hands into tennis socks. She skimmed every page of three worn notebooks filled with history notes and algebra equations, and sorted through tubes of lip gloss, half a dozen chandelier earrings, and a small pot of moisturizer whose label promised to revitalize tired skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she’d searched the drawers of Sutton’s desk as well, she slumped against the wall, scanning old photos to make sure there wasn’t something she had missed the first dozen times. But what would that be? A figure lurking in the background at a tennis match? Someone holding a sign s a yi ng I KILLED YOUR SISTER at her birthday party?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone holding a knife to her back at prom?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma’s spine straightened and her head snapped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProm Queen Barbie. She didn’t fit with everything else Sutton had stashed under the bed and inside the drawers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma yanked the doll from where she’d dropped her in a tangle of light blue blankets and flipped her upside down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe folds of fabric fell away, exposing a tiny pouch sewn into the innermost layer of the ball gown. Bingo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice work. Even I wouldn’t have thought to check the doll —and presumably I was the one who’d put that pouch there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma plunged her index finger inside the pouch and touched cold metal. It was a tiny, tarnished silver key. She held it up to the light. It looked like the kind of key that could open a journal or a jewelry box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded and Sutton’s door swung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel stood in the doorway in a cloud of tuberose perfume, her hands on her hips. There was a sour look on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom wants you downstairs for breakfast.” Then she glanced around at the clutter strewn across the floor. “What in the world are you doing in here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma looked around at the mess. “Um, nothing. Just looking for an earring.” She held up a silver star stud she’d just found under the bed. “Found it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that?” Laurel pointed accusingly at the key in Emma’s palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma stared at it, too, cursing herself. If only she’d thought to hide it before Laurel saw it. “Oh, just some old thing,” she said vaguely, dropping the key on Sutton’s bedside table like she didn’t have a care in the world. Only when Laurel turned away did she scoop it back up again and shove it into the pocket of Sutton’s jeans. If the key had been important enough to hide, maybe it led to some huge secret. And Emma wasn’t going to rest until she found out what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich meant, no doubt, that I wouldn’t rest either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePROJECT: RUN AWAY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThursday afternoon, Emma sat in Fashion Design, Sutton’s last class of the day. Headless mannequins covered in draped muslin bordered the room. A makeshift runway shot through the center. Students sat at worktables, fabric, scissors, buttons, zippers, and thread strewn around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoll ier’s one and only fashion design teacher, Mr. Salinas, paced the room, wearing slim-cut trousers and a pale blue scarf tied around his neck. He looked like Tim Gunn’s younger brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Today’s presentation will push the boundaries of form versus function,” he announced in a pinched voice. He tapped a long, skinny finger on the glossy cover of French Vogue, which he had more than once called his “Bible.” “It’s the question on the tip of every editor’s tongue,” he mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How does fashion translate from the runway to real life?” Emma glanced at her mannequin. Her creation wasn’t exactly translating, per se. Plaid flannel crossed the midsection, pinned awkwardly at the waist where Emma had attempted to make the outfit A-line. A black chiffon top hung crookedly with ruffles that sagged at the collar. The worst part was the pin: Emma had tried to make a flower-shaped brooch out of the excess plaid fabric. Add that to the red pen marks that dotted the mannequin’s bare arms, and the whole thing looked like a drunken schoolgirl-gone-goth with a bad case of the chicken pox. Although Emma loved fashion—she scoured thrift stores and made a lot of on-the-cheap outfits look expensive—sewing clothes wasn’t really her thing. She suspected Sutton took this class for the same reason she took a lot of the electives in her schedule—because they were fairly easy As and didn’t require much reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does the artist within have to say?” Mr. Salinas blathered on. “This is what we must ask ourselves.” Emma ducked down, hoping Mr. Salinas didn’t call on her—she hadn’t exactly been trying to say anything. She had bigger things to worry about than pushing the boundaries of form versus function, like figuring out if Thayer had killed her sister before he got out of jail and came after her again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/two-truths-and-a-lie-the-lying-game-3/page-17.html","bookId":2395,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:29 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:29 AM"}
