{"id":79228,"no":71,"title":"Page 71","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" Eugene seemed to relax. He took one of the cups of punch. \"Dwayne and me figured it was about time we educated ourselves about art, y\u0027know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" She gestured toward the buffet table. \"Help yourselves to cookies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Dwayne, they\u0027ve got free food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started toward the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent.\" Dwayne downed the contents of his punch cup and set off in Eugene\u0027s wide wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick sauntered through the door at that moment. His gaze tracked Eugene and Dwayne\u0027s progress. \"Everything okay in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, indeed,\" she said. \"I was just welcoming a couple of other legitimate members of the community.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his eyebrows. \"Do I detect a trace of irony here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\" She glanced at Carson, who stood with Anne in front of the picture of Zeb. The two children appeared to be deep in conversation. A couple of miniature art connoisseurs, she thought. \"Tell me the truth, Nick. Would you say that I\u0027m a real member of this community?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? You\u0027ve got everyone from Mean Eugene and Dickhead Dwayne to the wife of the future mayor here tonight. You\u0027ve also got representatives of both the Harte and Madison clans. Trust me, in Eclipse Bay, it doesn\u0027t get any more legitimate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re teasing me, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m dealing the truth here. And there\u0027s another thing that guarantees you a place of honor in our fair town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You broke the curse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a face. \"If you mention that stupid curse one more time, I swear, I\u0027llâ€”\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d appreciate it if you would not refer to the condition of my former sex life as stupid,\" he said with grave dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least you had a previous sex life. When I look back, I\u0027ve got to wonder if I was the one under a spell. Two years is a long time to go between dates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a smile that curled her toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it was worth the wait, right?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not going to respond to such a leading question. Not in public, at any rate. Now, you\u0027ll have to excuse me, I\u0027m trying to host a show here.\" She made to move off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the way,\" he added, lowering his voice, \"there is one more thing I wanted to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused and looked at him inquiringly. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced around, apparently checking to see if there was anyone within earshot. Then he grasped her arm and urged her into a quiet corner of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mitch and Sullivan and I think we\u0027ve got a lead on the Upsall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned, she just stared at him for a couple of seconds. He was standing very close, one hand braced against the wall behind her. There was something utterly, dangerously masculine in the way he leaned into her slightly, cutting off her view of the room with his broad shoulders. His body language spoke of possession and a silent claim that she knew every other man in the room could probably read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sense of deja vu swept through her. This was the way he had stood with her at Lillian\u0027s gallery show, she thought. He had put himself between her and the crowd that evening, too, cutting her out of the herd, making her intensely aware of him and then asking her out on a date. She had known in her heart where a date with Nick would lead and her nerve had failed her that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, sure, later she had come up with lots of really good reasons for avoiding the risk of getting involved with him, but the stark truth was that her courage had failed at crunch time that first night. She had run from him that evening and several more times after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut tonight was different. Tonight, because she had finally taken the risk, she knew him far more intimately and deeply and she could see what lay beneath the surface. In addition to the intensely sensual threat he posed, there was strength and honor and integrity. Dear God, I\u0027m in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomatically she lowered her own voice to a whisper. \"Who? What? Where? Tell me what\u0027s going on here, Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her very steadily. \"No one\u0027s got more of a right to answers than you do. But this afternoon Sullivan and Mitchell asked me to ask you to give them until noon tomorrow to confirm our hunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the delay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to be sure. We\u0027re talking about someone with deep ties throughout the community. People are going to be hurt. We can\u0027t afford to be wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe searched his face. He was genuinely concerned about what might happen when it all came undone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if you\u0027re right?\" she asked gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There will be a lot of fallout. And it won\u0027t all come down on the person who took the painting. There is someone else who will probably get dumped on, too. An innocent bystander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Collateral damage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered. \"I hate those words. Translated, they mean that real people will get burned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said again. But this time his eyes went cold. \"I told Sullivan and Mitch that, although I\u0027m willing to give them some time, I\u0027m not going to let this thing get hushed up or swept under a rug. One way or the other, by tomorrow afternoon, your name will be cleared, no matter who gets hurt. I\u0027m not going to let you take the rap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe meant every word, she thought. He was making it blazingly clear that she was his first priority. The realization gave her an odd feeling. No one had ever fought any battles for her and now, in the space of less than a week, Nick had gotten involved in a barroom brawl and was about to expose an upstanding member of the community as a thief. All in her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" she said. \"Tell Mitch and Sullivan I\u0027ll wait until tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. They\u0027ll be grateful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I owe them that much,\" she said. \"For Aunt Claudia\u0027s sake, if nothing else.\" She peeked around his shoulder. \"I\u0027d better go. This crowd is getting bigger and it looks like the cookies have disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made to slide around the broad shield of his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more thing I wanted to tell you before you run off,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back at him, her mind on the cookie supply issue. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something I should have said that first night at Lillian\u0027s show. Something I knew at the time. Something I\u0027ve known all along. Just didn\u0027t quite recognize it until recently. Probably because I\u0027m a little out of practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, open-mouthed. Bereft of speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a sexy, knowing smile. \"Better go check on the cookies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed himself away from the wall and strolled off into the crowd. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-71.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
