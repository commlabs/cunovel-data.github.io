He seeks a man who is on the ordinary road, and the Divine fire leaps out at his feet. The mystic ladder can rise from the market place to Heaven. It can connect the realm of drudgery with the realms of grace. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMy Father God, help me to expect Thee on the ordinary road. I do not ask for sensational happenings.

Those spiritual visits to high places, and that wonderful intercourse with the unseen world, are not in the promises; the daily life of communion is. And it is enough. We shall have the exceptional revelation if it be right for us. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere were but three disciples allowed to see the transfiguration, and those three entered the gloom of Gethsemane. No one can stay on the mount of privilege. There are duties in the valley. Christ found His life━work, not in the glory, but in the valley and was there truly and fully the Messiah. The value of the vision and glory is but their gift of fitness for work and endurance. ━Selected \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e十月二十二日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群，一日领羊群往野外去，到了上帝的山，就是何烈山。耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。」（出三:1-2）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e我们普通总以为异象必须在特别环境中纔能看见，在这里我们看见我们的理想错了：异象是在日常生活中看见的，神喜欢在我们日常生活中启示祂自己。祂常到顶普通的路上去寻找一个人，忽然向他显现。 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e我的父神阿，求祢教导我怎样在日常生活中等待祢。我并不求甚么超然的感觉；我只求祢在日常生活中与我交通，求祢在我日常的道路上作我的伴侣，让这卑贱的人生因着祢的同在得着变化。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e有些基督人喜欢常有特别的喜乐和启示；但是这并不是神的方法。那些魂游象外，与看不见的世界有奇异的接触，并不是神所给我们的应许；神所给我们的应许乃是日常生活上的交通。其实这也已经够了。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e门徒中间，看见耶稣在高山上变形的，只有三个人；这三个人也就是同尝客西马尼苦味的。没有一个人能一直留在山上，因为山下还有许多工作等待我们去做。━选\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5530.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:50:17 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:50:17 AM"}
