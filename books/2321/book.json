And the more \"clients, \" he figured, the more money - and more people eager to see him dead. So no one is surprised when the pigeon is found floating in the East River with his skull bashed in. And what\u0027s worse, no one cares - except Matthew Scudder. The ex-cop-turned-private-eye is no conscientious avenging angel. But he\u0027s willing to risk his own life and limb to confront Spinner\u0027s most murderously aggressive marks. A job\u0027s a job after all - and Scudder\u0027s been paid to find a killer - by the victim...in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:31 PM"}
