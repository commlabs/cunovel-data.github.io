David made his way up the marble stairs. As he reached for the door, it magically opened, and a bellhop ushered him inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baggage, senor? May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks. I need to see the concierge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bellhop looked hurt, as if something in their two-second encounter had not been satisfactory. \"Por aqui, senor.\" He led Becker into the lobby, pointed to the concierge, and hurried off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lobby was exquisite, small and elegantly appointed. Spain\u0027s Golden Age had long since passed, but for a while in the mid-1600s, this small nation had ruled the world. The room was a proud reminder of that era-suits of armor, military etchings, and a display case of gold ingots from the New World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHovering behind the counter marked conserje was a trim, well-groomed man smiling so eagerly that it appeared he\u0027d waited his entire life to be of assistance. \"En que puedo servirle, senor? How may I serve you?\" He spoke with an affected lisp and ran his eyes up and down Becker\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker responded in Spanish. \"I need to speak to Manuel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s well-tanned face smiled even wider. \"Si, si, senor. I am Manuel. What is it you desire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Senor Roldan at Escortes Belen told me you would-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concierge silenced Becker with a wave and glanced nervously around the lobby. \"Why don\u0027t you step over here?\" He led Becker to the end of the counter. \"Now,\" he continued, practically in a whisper. \"How may I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker began again, lowering his voice. \"I need to speak to one of his escorts whom I believe is dining here. Her name is Rocio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concierge let out his breath as though overwhelmed. \"Aaah, Rocio-a beautiful creature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see her immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, senor, she is with a client.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker nodded apologetically. \"It\u0027s important.\" A matter of national security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concierge shook his head. \"Impossible. Perhaps if you left a-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will only take a moment. Is she in the dining room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concierge shook his head. \"Our dining room closed half an hour ago. I\u0027m afraid Rocio and her guest have retired for the evening. If you\u0027d like to leave me a message, I can give it to her in the morning.\" He motioned to the bank of numbered message boxes behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I could just call her room and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" the concierge said, his politeness evaporating. \"The Alfonso XIII has strict policies regarding client privacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker had no intention of waiting ten hours for a fat man and a prostitute to wander down for breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Becker said. \"Sorry to bother you.\" He turned and walked back into the lobby. He strode directly to a cherry roll-top desk that had caught his eye on his way in. It held a generous supply of Alfonso XIII postcards and stationery as well as pens and envelopes. Becker sealed a blank piece of paper in an envelope and wrote one word on the envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eROCIO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he went back to the concierge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to trouble you again,\" Becker said approaching sheepishly. \"I\u0027m being a bit of a fool, I know. I was hoping to tell Rocio personally how much I enjoyed our time together the other day. But I\u0027m leaving town tonight. Perhaps I\u0027ll just leave her a note after all.\" Becker laid the envelope on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concierge looked down at the envelope and clucked sadly to himself. Another lovesick heterosexual, he thought. What a waste. He looked up and smiled. \"But of course, Mr....?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buisan,\" Becker said. \"Miguel Buisan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I\u0027ll be sure Rocio gets this in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Becker smiled and turned to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concierge, after discreetly checking out Becker\u0027s backside, scooped up the envelope off the counter and turned to the bank of numbered slots on the wall behind him. Just as the man slipped the envelope into one of the slots, Becker spun with one final inquiry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where might I call a taxi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concierge turned from the wall of cubbyholes and answered. But Becker did not hear his response. The timing had been perfect. The concierge\u0027s hand was just emerging from a box marked Suite 301.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker thanked the concierge and slowly wandered off looking for the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn and out, he repeated to himself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-31.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM"}
