Which brings me to the question, what are you doing here? It ain’t safe, wherever we’re going.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Shadowthrone’s children,’ she said. ‘Those that survived, I mean. I couldn’t look them in the eye, not after what happened. I couldn’t bear it any longer. And I could see – Cotillion and Shadowthrone, they were up to something. But mostly,’ she seemed to shudder, ‘the children, and what happened outside the throne room. I’ll grant you, Quick Ben didn’t hesitate, even when it looked like he was going to die. He didn’t hesitate.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Icarium,’ Kalam muttered. ‘Maybe one day I’ll face off against him, and we’ll see.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinala snorted. ‘That’d put a quick end to your arrogance, Kalam Mekhar.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA signaller waved a banner, and it was time to ride down to join the vanguard. Kalam thought about Minala’s last words, and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey kicked their horses into motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Kalam asked, ‘Love, tell me again, about that Tiste Edur with the spear …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Erekala of the Grey Helms entered the tent to find Brother Serenity standing in a corner at the back, draped in shadows and facing the canvas wall. There was no one else present and Erekala was brought up short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Pure?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerenity slowly turned. ‘Have you ever been buried alive, Erekala? No, I would imagine not. Perhaps, in the occasional nightmare … no matter. Earlier this day I felt the murder of Sister Belie. And every one of her officers – all dead. The siege has been shattered, and our enemy is now loose within our demesne.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErekala blinked, but said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Take off your helm,’ Serenity said. ‘Do you see, over there? A carafe. Foreign wine. I admit to having acquired a taste for it. It serves well in easing my … misgivings.’ And he went over to pour himself a goblet. He poured a second goblet and gestured to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelm now unstrapped and under one arm, Erekala shook his head and said, ‘Misgivings, Pure? Is not the cause just?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh indeed, Erekala, there will be justice in our tide of retribution. But there will also be crime. We do not spare the children. We do not ask them to remake their world, to fashion a new place of humility, respect and compassion. We give them no chance to do better.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Pure,’ said Erekala, ‘as the teachings of the Wolves make plain, each and every generation is given a new chance. And each time, they but perpetuate the crimes of their fathers and mothers. “From the blow that strikes the innocent child to the one that lays waste to a forest, while the magnitude of the gesture may vary, the desire behind the hand does not.” So the Wild would say, if it but had the words to speak.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerenity’s eyes glittered in the shadows. ‘And you see no presumption?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErekala cocked his head. ‘Pure, the presumptions of the Perish Grey Helms are unending. Yet if we refuse or are unable to comprehend the suffering of the innocent – be it babe or beast – what do our words replace, if not all that we would not hear, would not countenance, lest it force us to change our ways, which we will never do. If we would speak for the Wild, we must begin with the voice of human conscience. And when conscience is not heeded, or is discarded, then what choice remains to us?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How clearly you enjoy such debate, Erekala. You remind me of better days … peaceful days. Very well, I will consider what the world would be like, for all within it, if conscience was more than just a whispering voice. If, indeed, it could raise a hand in anger. And, when even a sound beating is not enough, it might then close that hand about a throat and take the life from the transgressor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is our greatest presumption, Pure,’ said Erekala, ‘that we be the hand of conscience.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Holding a sword.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And finally driven to use it, yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerenity drained his goblet and replaced it with the other one. ‘Yet your fellow humans – your victims – could not but see you as evil, as terrible murderers of the innocent – in fact, the very notion of guilt or innocence would be without relevance, in their eyes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If we are to be evil, then we but balance the evil that opposes us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Seeking … negation.’ And Serenity smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sister Reverence made us kneel, Pure. But we are not so naïve as to have come to you expecting anything but the opportunity to give our lives in the name of that which we believe to be right. You will use us, until none of us are left. She did not need to compel the Perish.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-323.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
