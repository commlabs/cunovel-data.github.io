However, what excites it more than anything is not lightning, but the electricity within the human body!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The electricity contained within the Dao Pillars of hundreds of Cultivators, as well as the power of their Cultivation bases, has been combined into the Hundred Spirits Tower. This thing has never encountered such immense, intangible aura as that which emanates from this tower!” He stared at the meat jelly, which was currently backing away slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to Patriarch Violet Sieve, the beautiful middle-aged woman was also staring at the meat jelly. Both of them rotated their Cultivation bases. They seemed ready to spring into action at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanting, Patriarch Violet Sieve used Divine Sense to communicate with the beautiful woman: “Wait just a bit longer. This thing is fast, and if it wishes to flee, even a Sect Patriarch wouldn’t be able to capture it alive. It has an incredible aura, and if captured, may detonate itself and wait to be reincarnated. If that happens, who knows how many thousands of years will pass before it reappears….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We must wait for it to consume the Hundred Spirits Tower. Inside is a seal, which, combined with magic cast by the three Patriarchs on the outside, will strip it of its power of self-detonation. Then, the two of us will be be able to capture it alive!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s brow furrowed as he looked at the meat jelly. In his estimation it was a very inauspicious item. Inside the cauldron, it had caused the death of several people. In the end, it had even spoken, which left Meng Hao with a very strange feeling. He really disliked the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, that thing is what the Black Sieve Sect came into this place for.” He was lost in thought for the space of about ten breaths. The good luck charm was almost activated and would be usable at any moment. Meng Hao’s expression was calm as he observed the proceedings. In his heart, he was ready to leave at a moment’s notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp above, the meat jelly suddenly let out another menacing howl. The Hundred Spirits Tower trembled as if it were about to collapse. Arcs of electricity sparked off of it, as did a fatally enticing aura that Cultivators couldn’t sense, but the meat jelly could. Its nose twitched and its eyes grew wide. Patriarch Violet Sieve watched excitedly as it shot forward, approaching the Hundred Spirits Tower. Its mouth opened wide and it took a giant bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it took more bites, the magical face on the meat jelly looked more and more happy. It even began to emit contented humming sounds. It swallowed bite after bite, and soon the Hundred Spirits Tower was more than half consumed. Suddenly, what remained of the tower exploded!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom resonated out as the tower collapsed in upon itself and then shot toward the meat jelly. The meat jelly was clearly frightened half to death. The crumbling tower transformed into an enormous chain that moved with incredible speed as it encircled the meat jelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meat jelly let out a frightened screech. It quickly tried to hop backward through the air, but couldn’t, as if it were being held down. At this very moment, outside the Blessed Land, next to the black door, the statue that had been carried to this place by the Black Sieve Sect began to emanate a mysterious glow. Within the dark glow were three figures sitting cross-legged in meditation atop the ragged hide, controlling it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the Blessed Land, ear-splitting shrieks filled the air. Meng Hao looked at the meat jelly floating in mid-air, bound by the chain. The magical face looked panic stricken. It wanted to flee, but was held tight by the chain. As it tried to jump away, the chain stretched back behind it like a long tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Patriarch Violet Sieve’s eyes flashed. He took a step forward, and then his body disappeared. He reappeared next to the meat jelly. He lifted up his hand to grab it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimultaneously, the beautiful women also moved, appearing on the other side of the meat jelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fear on the meat jelly’s magical face grew more intense, and it let out a miserable cry. Its body suddenly began to shake, and lightning crackled off of it in waves. Heaven and earth shook, and Patriarch Violet Sieve’s face flickered. He retreated a pace. The beautiful woman’s eyes narrowed, and she too retreated, not daring to touch the lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two retreated, the chained meat jelly rushed forward, its face filled with helplessness and despair. With the chain restricting it, it couldn’t move very fast. Behind it, Patriarch Violet Sieve’s eyes gleamed, and he let out a cold harrumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t escape,” he said, his voice filling the air. “Today, the Black Sieve Sect has come for you!” He took a step forward, reaching his hand out. The beautiful woman gave a cold snort and lifted her hand up as well. In the blink of an eye, her body seemed to be surrounded by stars, which then transformed into a multicolored beam that shot up to surround the meat jelly on all sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meat jelly quivered, and flew forward. The magical face spoke, its voice archaic, like that of an old man’s: “You people can’t do this….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they heard the words, shock filled the faces of the surrounding thousand Black Sieve Sect Disciples. They had never imagined that this object would be able to speak with the voice of a human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you truly are Ultimate Vexation,” said Patriarch Violet Sieve, laughing. He shot forward along with the beautiful woman. Their eyes glowed mysteriously as their bodies transformed into beams of light as which surrounded the meat jelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that were all to it, it wouldn’t be a big deal. But next, the eight Core Formation Cultivators among the Black Sieve Sect disciples all let out a shout. The rest of the disciples began to chant a scripture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time as the scripture droned out from the mouths of the thousand disciples, far away in the Southern Domain, tens of thousands of Black Sieve Sect Cultivators sat cross-legged, also chanting a scripture. Above the Ten Thousand Mountains of the Black Sieve Sect, an enormous vortex circulated in the air. It sucked in the scriptures chanted by the tens of thousands of Cultivators and transmitted them into the Blessed Land via the mouths of the thousand Cultivators there. The power of the scripture caused everything to shake and tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA concerned look appeared on the meat jelly’s magical face. “You people are immoral. You should be converting that bird, you shouldn’t be trying to convert me….” Its voice sounded frightened, and it let out another shriek. Suddenly, a huge bluish aura began to emanate off of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreaming miserably, the meat jelly shot forward, its expression desperate. It wanted to flee. At this moment, a massive roaring sound filled the sky. Up above, an enormous cage appeared in mid-air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was composed of pitch black iron bars which were inscribed with countless magical sealing symbols. It emanated a shocking pressure which caused large amounts of fissures to split the earth below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cage glittered as it shot toward the meat jelly, preparing to capture it alive and lock it tight. A black aura emanated out from the cage’s bars, within which could be seen countless faces whose features were filled with excited avarice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this takes a long time to describe, but actually happened in an instant. Meng Hao was not very close, yet was still shaken to the core. The good luck charm was almost ready to activate. Although everything that was happening was shocking, he didn’t really care too much about it, and was mostly focused on getting away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut… suddenly, he leaped up and began to retreat backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That damned meat jelly, why is it coming toward me?” He retreated unhesitatingly, eyeing the meat jelly as it changed direction and for no apparent reason shot toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao couldn’t make himself believe that the meat jelly would pass him by. Having seen the destruction left in its wake within the cauldron, he was certain that the thing was coming directly toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s scalp went numb. He thought about the two Nascent Soul eccentrics, about the bizarre sound of the scripture being chanted, and about the massive cage descending from above. His annoyance with the meat jelly grew more and more intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was merely a Foundation Establishment Cultivator. No matter how fast he moved, there was no way he could evade an item which was currently being chased by two Nascent Soul eccentrics and, in fact, the entire Black Sieve Sect. The meat jelly was chained, but its speed was still impossible to describe. One breath, it was off in the distance, and the next breath, it was directly in front of Meng Hao. It slowly descended onto his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of shock covered Meng Hao’s face. He reached up, grabbed it, and threw it away as far as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant it was thrown away, it hopped back toward Meng Hao, opened its mouth and then bit his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I can’t escape,” it wailed, “then neither can you, you immoral fellow….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Violet Sieve and the beautiful woman approached in pursuit, and when they saw what was happening, their eyes went wide with intense rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doth thou dare!” raged the violet-robed Patriarch. His roar reached to the Heavens, and the entire land began to quake. His speed was incredible, and within moments, was in front of Meng Hao, a look of indescribable rage on his face. His palm descended toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the boom echoed out, a twinkling shield appeared around Meng Hao. It wasn’t being emitted by Meng Hao, but rather the meat jelly. Furthermore, as Meng Hao retreated, it wasn’t under his own power, but rather because the meat jelly was pulling him along by the arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had his arm firmly gripped in its mouth, which caused blood to seep out. Its body trembled, and was no longer translucent. Now it looked somewhat muddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So disgusting, so disgusting, so disgusting…. gross, gross, gross….” it cried. Patriarch Violet Sieve and the beautiful woman stood by, their expressions mixtures of rage and disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bonding… it… it’s bonding a master?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve bonded a master,” cried the meat jelly, hopping up onto Meng Hao’s head and transforming into the shape of a hat. “I bond this guy as my master. Useless! It’s useless to capture me now. You immoral people, I’ve already bonded a master! I have no more powers of flight and no more shield. I’m crippled, I’m going to die! You bunch of foolish fools, you’re too evil! I, I, I, I….” It suddenly turned its shocked attention to Meng Hao. “Hey, why haven’t you teleported away yet?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-2-chapter-165\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-2-chapter-167\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-2-chapter-166","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM"}
