So he said we\u0027d take these two Con-5s, him controlling one, me the other. It was a touch match in the bay, first nose-hit the winner. You know, I took --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, all right,\" said Bonnett. \"I\u0027m just trying to make a point. I don\u0027t want a blow by blow. That\u0027s a young man\u0027s game, or at least a school game. We\u0027ve been a long time out of school. You haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett chuckled. \"I used to be pretty good at it, too. Tell you what: when we get back let\u0027s hunt up a fish school and I\u0027ll challenge you to a snag match. There\u0027s the fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey sobered. \"The skipper doesn\u0027t make mistakes, does he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not about people,\" said Bonnett. \"Or about machines, either.\" He stopped to correct the setting on the bow planes. \"And when we get back home they\u0027ll have him on the carpet for wasting too many fish. And what about all those spare parts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey thought: A first-year psych man knows the leader of a group is the integrative force . . . the logos. Of course this crew has the top rating. Sparrow is -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes my blood boil when I think about it,\" said Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow came through the doorway onto the control deck. \"What makes your blood boil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the stupid red tape back at base.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s supposed to make your blood boil. That\u0027s why it exists. How far to that seamount?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Johnny. Let\u0027s see how good you are at Con-tag.\" Sparrow gestured toward the torpedo board at Bonnett\u0027s left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Joe?\" asked Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just shot him full of de-carb. If that hot stuff settled in his bones, he\u0027s a cooked engineer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey approached the torpedo board slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett said, \"We caught him in time. He\u0027ll be as good as new in a couple of days. No calcium, no carbonate, no --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just call him rubber bones,\" said Ramsey. \"Now how about a little quiet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The maestro is about to perform,\" said Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey stared up at the banks of red-handled switches, the guide screens, arming triggers. And there in front of him was the little blue stick that made a Con-5 perform. He chose one off the top of the rack, keyed it to the controls, said, \"Standing by. How far is down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-two hundred feet,\" said Bonnett. \"You can go any time now. It\u0027s directly under us.\" He slowed the engines until they were barely moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have hose to spare,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I make a recon down to that bottom to see if I can get some muck for our hull snooper?\" asked Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We have to make this one fast. An EP may pick up our control pulse. If the bottom\u0027s hot, then we\u0027ll have hot oil and they can use it to lube atomic engines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now?\" asked Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take her away,\" said Sparrow. \"Les, put the side lights on that hose reel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re already on,\" said Bonnett\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey turned the guide screen to the nose eye in his Con-5, activated the multi-wave projector beside the nose eye. The screen showed a pattern outline for the hull of the Ram, picked up in waves beyond the normally visible spectrum. Superimposed was the faint glow of the side light illuminating the hose reel. A second super-imposition showed the relative positions of the Ram and the tiny Con-5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little more ship speed, please,\" said Ramsey. \"It\u0027ll steady us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett moved the throttle bar forward a fractional notch and the Ram picked up speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey brought the deadly torpedo in closer. He could not see the fin prongs on his torpedo, but he knew where they were -- forward projecting edges of the stabilizing fins, designed for hydrostatic balance and set just back of the needle curve of the torpedo\u0027s nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blink the side light,\" said Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett winked the light switch off, on, off, on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glow on Ramsey\u0027s guide screen went on and off to the movement of the switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanted to make sure that was the correct light,\" said Ramsey. He flashed the Con-5 in close and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehovered it over the light. The hose projection was visible ahead, jutting at a forty-five-degree angle from the reel base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said. \"Here goes.\" He dropped the Con-5 back ten feet, threw full power into the torpedo\u0027s drive. It surged ahead, swooped down onto the hose, seemed to hesitate, then ranged away from the Ram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got it,\" said Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else?\" asked Ramsey. He slacked off the speed of his torpedo, looked at the counter dial which showed how fast the hose was unreeling. Abruptly, the dial showed a showling down, slacked off to zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lost it,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey brought the Con-5 around in a sweeping curve. The snaky line of the hose was the superimposed outline now. He brought the little torpedo in fast, tipped it at the last minute like a hungry shark and again had the hose in tow. \"Got a better hold on it that time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m bringing us around on that seamount,\" said Bonnett. \"I have you on the search board. I\u0027ll warn you one hundred feet from bottom. You can take it in visually from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I picked up the hose about ten feet from the end that last time,\" said Ramsey. \"Get the pump going the minute I touch the nozzle into the muck; that\u0027ll hold her there. I don\u0027t want to hold that firing pin any closer to a target any longer than I have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pump ready,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey glanced sideways, saw Sparrow at the tow board. Sparrow\u0027s hands moved over the controls. \"Line checks clear to the ballast compartment,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey visualized the ballast connections running aft, through the tow controls and into the web mesh which linked Ram and slug. If that linkage remained sound . . . if he could plug that hose end into ballast muck . . . if . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One hundred feet,\" said Bonnett. \"You\u0027re bearing along the east face of the seamount.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have its outline,\" said Ramsey, eyes on screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe maneuvered the torpedo closer to the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ledge,\" he said. \"That\u0027ll have muck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pray it\u0027s cool,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pray it\u0027s ballast,\" said Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe edged the torpedo and its hose end closer to the bottom, closer, closer . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s in!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pump on and . . . holding,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey tipped the Con-5, freed it from the hose, brought it up away from the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand by with that thing,\" said Sparrow. \"We may have to move the hose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The slug\u0027s bow is coming down,\" said Sparrow. He hit the switch of a ballast snooper. \"It\u0027s cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, as the Ram circled over the seamount, the slug came to hydrostatic balance. Presently, Sparrow said, \"Okay, Johnny, find some deep bottom for that Con-5, set it down, disengage and leave it. Don\u0027t let it blow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.\" Ramsey took the little torpedo down along the flank of the seamount, found a deep ledge and set the deadly metal fish down. He shut down the remote-control system, stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hose coming in,\" said Sparrow. \"Take us down into that thermal, Les. Course 260. Johnny, how about looking in on Joe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, Skipper.\" He felt suddenly exhausted, but buoyed by an inner nervous exhilaration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then get some rest,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey turned aft, went to the door, stepped through, and went to the rec room-sick bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia lay on the sun-lamp cot clad only in a pair of shorts. He was on his back, one brown arm thrown across his eyes. Dots of perspiration glistened on his dark skin. As Ramsey entered the room, Garcia lifted the arm from his eyes, peered from under it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027s you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027d you expect? The surgeon general?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t we funny!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey put the back of his hand against Garcia\u0027s forehead. \"Fever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia cleared his throat. \"Some. Those damned de-calcification shots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey glanced at the chart Sparrow had taped to the bulkhead above the cot. \"You\u0027re due for another shot right now. De-carb and de-phos. Another de-sulf in an hour.\" He turned away, went to the pharmacy locker across the room, saw that Sparrow had set out the hypodermics in sterile seals, labeled them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have we been doing?\" asked Garcia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey turned with the hypo for the shot, said, \"Getting a new cargo of ballast for the slug. Turn over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one in the left arm,\" said Garcia. He held out the arm, watched while Ramsey swabbed the area, administered the injection, returned the hypo to the pharmacy rack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia spoke behind him. \"Have you and your little black box finally got the skipper figured out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey\u0027s muscles locked. He took a deep breath to quiet his nerves, turned. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia\u0027s face bore a twisted smile. \"Don\u0027t play it innocent, Johnny. Remember me? I\u0027m the guy who\u0027s capable of taking over the electronics shack if you crock out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My hobby is breaking and entering,\" said Garcia. He put his hands under his head, winced as he moved his left arm. \"You\u0027ve heard about Pandora\u0027s box?\" He managed a shrug by lifting his eyebrows and making the slightest movement of shoulders. \"You shouldn\u0027t put temptation like that in front of a guy like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey wet his lips with his tongue. \"You mean the test equipment for the long-range --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, old boy, don\u0027t you know when the jig\u0027s up?\" He stared at Ramsey, a calculating look. \"The gear in that box is tied to the skipper someway. I don\u0027t know how, but --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come off that,\" said Ramsey. \"You --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I put it to the acid test,\" said Garcia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Acid test?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a deuced reluctant type, Johnny. If I didn\u0027t --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Start at the beginning,\" said Ramsey, tiredly. \"I want to know what you think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough,\" said Garcia. He wriggled into a more comfortable position on the cot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey brought up a stool, sat down. \"In the first place,\" said Garcia, \"you didn\u0027t offer to introduce me to the intricacies of your little black box. That was a mistake. Any normal E-man would\u0027ve been all eager to share his gadget with another man aboard who could talk shop.\" The smile tugged at the corners of Garcia\u0027s mouth. \"You, by the way, don\u0027t talk shop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So there\u0027s nobody else aboard who talks your particular brand of shop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that when you figured me for a spy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia shook his head. \"I\u0027ve never figured you for a spy.\" He frowned. \"Sorry about that. Maybe I could\u0027ve saved you a bad time with Les. I\u0027ve been certain all along that you weren\u0027t a spy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too inept.\" Garcia hesitated. \"And besides, my wife is a cousin of Commander Gadsen of the Dolphin. Gad was very impressed by a fellow named Long John Ramsey from BuPsych who pulled them out of a nasty spot when their oxy system went sour. He says this man Ramsey improvised a special vampire gauge and pulled some stunts with anhydrase that weren\u0027t in the books. Seemed to think this Ramsey saved their lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you figured me for this same Ramsey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gad was extremely impressed by this Long John Ramsey except one thing: he said the redheaded bastard got on your nerves with his know-it-all attitude!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The world\u0027s full of redheaded --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, uh!\" Garcia shook his head. \"You\u0027re BuPsych. Two things on this floating sewer pipe interest you more than anything else: the skipper and the black box in your room. So I opened the box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey forced himself to remain impassive. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn enigmatic grin captured Garcia\u0027s features. \"There\u0027s a separate set of recording instruments in it keyed to the timelog. I copied four of your tapes, checked back on what we\u0027d been doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d that prove?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whenever the skipper\u0027s asleep, your graphs flatten. Every time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey shrugged, remained silent. \"But I needed the clincher,\" said Garcia. \"Two times when the skipper hurt himself -- a barked shin and one electric shock -- I logged the exact time. The squiggles on a couple of your tapes go wild at exactly those moments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey recalled the tape gyrations, his own cautious questioning to elicit the reasons. \"Clever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, old chap. I thought so myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s all this prove?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia raised his eyebrows. \"It proves you\u0027re making some kind of record of the skipper\u0027s internal chemistry. Only one type of fellow is that interested in why people tick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s vulgarly referred to as a head thumper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of himself, Ramsey grinned. So I\u0027m all washed up, he thought. So I\u0027m in good company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe I\u0027m going to give you away yet,\" said Garcia. \"This show hasn\u0027t played itself out. I must remember to thank BuPsych, too, for one of the most entertaining cruises I\u0027ve ever had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose you want into the act,\" said Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good heavens, no! I already have my part to play. Just one thing, old fellow. Don\u0027t sell our Captain Savvy Sparrow short.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the director of this show. Whether you know it or not, he controls the script.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey fought down the vague tuggings of disquiet. \"Is that why you\u0027re not giving me away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You obviously mean well,\" said Garcia. His voice went lower, more harsh. \"Now, give me my other shot and get the hell out of here! Your air of superiority is beginning to wear on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey felt the hot blood suffusing his features.
