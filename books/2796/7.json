Like my bear fable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could,\" said Gooney Bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about this?\" Mrs. Pidgeon said. \"Could it be Sometimes what you already have is the best thing? Like my panda fable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could,\" Gooney Bird said, and all of the second-graders nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or my kangaroo story!\" Keiko said. \"There\u0027s no place like home!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any one of the morals fits just fine,\" Gooney Bird pointed out. \"Chelsea? What did you have in mind for the moral of your Chihuahua fable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChelsea fingered the leather rhinestone-trimmed collar that was still buckled around her neck. \"Here is the moral of my fable,\" she announced. \"Rich is good. If you have a mink coat, you should stay put.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe classroom was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Pidgeon looked at her watch. \"You know what?\" she said. \"It\u0027s lunchtime.

She bit into the chicken wing. \"Nobody would eat a Chihuahua,\" she said. \"None of our fable animals are edible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bear is,\" Beanie pointed out. \"Some people eat bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yuck. Well, not panda, though, or kangaroo, or—what others did we have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bunny, and tortoise,\" Tricia said. \"People eat those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And bison,\" Barry added. \"Bison is a very healthful food. You should eat bisonburgers instead of hamburgers. Less cholesterol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody would eat a flamingo,\" Felicia Ann said. \"I think it would make you thick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about T. rex?\" asked Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyrone, whose mouth was full of tuna fish sandwich, began to wiggle rhythmically in his seat.\"Teee rex, Teee rex,\" he murmured. \"See my muscles flex, if I munch on ol\u0027 T. rex...\" He lifted his arm and tried to demonstrate the muscle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about Malcolm?\" Tyrone asked suddenly, interrupting his own performance. \"You didn\u0027t do your fable yet, Malcolm. Want me to make you up a rap? What animal you gonna do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm grinned. \"Not telling,\" he said. \"Secret. Surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Gooney Bird pointed out, \"your turn comes right after lunch, Malcolm, so it won\u0027t be a surprise for long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about Nicholas? Want a rap, Nicholas?\" Tyrone was shifting back and forth in his chair, eager to dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going last,\" Nicholas said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t!

The day go fast, and Gooney Bird be last—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nicholas and I are doing our fable together,\" Gooney Bird explained. \"Look what I have for dessert! A kumquat!\" She held it up, and the other children examined it with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kumquats are native to China,\" Barry announced, \"although they are now cultivated in the United States. The kumquat tree is slow-growing and compact. Because of their thick rind, kumquats keep well and are easy to ship long distances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you only read up through D in the encyclopedia, Barry,\" Gooney Bird said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I peeked into the K,\" he explained, \"because I\u0027m interested in kites.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re amazing.\" Gooney Bird bit into her kumquat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t do your fable with Gooney Bird, Nicholas,\" Ben said. \"You\u0027re an N and she\u0027s a G.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True,\" Gooney Bird replied. She grinned at Nicholas and Nicholas grinned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me and Gooney Bird have a surprise,\" Nicholas said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooney Bird, imitating Mrs. Pidgeon, held up a grammar finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gooney Bird and I,\" Nicholas said. Then, to everyone\u0027s surprise, he chanted,\"You and I, me and you, we gotta surprise, oh yes we do ... He collected his crumpled paper napkin and an empty plastic cup. Then he shuffled over to the trash can, still chanting. Bruno, the Saint Bernard, lay dozing nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But first,\" Malcolm announced, rising from the table, \"ME! My turn! I\u0027m doing my fable next!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Malcolm eagerly leading the way, the second-graders walked back to the classroom. Bruno yawned, stood up slowly, and followed behind, hoping not to miss anything. His antlers were a little tilted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the class was settled at their desks and Gooney Bird had announced that it was his turn to present his fable, Malcolm picked up a thick red marker and colored his own nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A clown?\" Keiko murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Malcolm stood and attached something to his belt, twisting it around to the back. The children all watched, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to the front of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, with his back turned to the class, he began to write on the board. The children were all still puzzled by the costume: his bright red nose and the sheet of purple construction paper dangling from his belt in the rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is your nose red?\" called Tricia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is your backside all purple?\" asked Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhhh!\" Mrs. Pidgeon said, holding up her quiet-please finger. \"Let\u0027s see Malcolm\u0027s animal, and then maybe we\u0027ll understand his costume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully Malcolm wrote an uppercase M. Then an A. Then an N.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"NO FAIR!\" Tyrone called. \"He can\u0027t be a man!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to be an animal, Malcolm!\" Barry said loudly. \"Remember you thought I was Thomas Jefferson and it wasn\u0027t an animal? Isn\u0027t that right, Mrs. Pidgeon? Isn\u0027t that right, Gooney Bird?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm had turned around and was looking impatiently at the second-graders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Gooney Bird said, \"a man is a mammal. Maybe a fable can be about any mammal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But mine wathn\u0027t a mammal,\" Felicia Ann pointed out. \"Flamingo ith a bird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither was mine!\" Tricia announced. \"I was a tortoise. That\u0027s not a mammal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right.\" Gooney Bird looked as if she were thinking. \"I don\u0027t know if there is a rule about fables. If we can have a bird, or a tortoise, or a T. rex, as the main character, maybe we could have a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder what Aesop would say,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And anyway, what\u0027s that purple thing on your backside, Malcolm?\" Chelsea asked. \"It\u0027s weird. So is your nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm grinned. He wrinkled his nose and wiggled his bottom. Then, when the class grew quiet, he turned and added some more letters on the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDRILL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to the class, wiggled his bottom again, then lifted one arm and scratched with the other. \"Oooh, oooh, oooh,\" Malcolm said, making an odd hooting sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mandrill!\" Gooney Bird announced. \"Malcolm is a mandrill!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s acting like a chimp, or a monkey,\" Beanie pointed out. Now Malcolm was leaping about, his legs bent, still making the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mandrill is a kind of monkey, sort of,\" Gooney Bird explained. \"Like a baboon, I think. I\u0027ve seen them at the zoo. They\u0027re the ones with red noses and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no!\" Keiko squealed. \"The ones with the yucky bright blue and pink bottoms! I hate those!\" She made a face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm stopped jumping around. He announced his fable\u0027s title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mandrill and Its Young\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce there was a female mandrill who was expecting a baby. She got very fat. Then one day her baby was born. It was pretty cute. She liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, suddenly, she had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, suddenly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell. That was pretty surprising. Now she had three mandrill babies. They were very noisy. They wanted to be fed every minute. They made a big mess. They threw things and broke things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe father mandrill was never home. Sometimes the mother was so nervous and tired that she screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the worst thing was, the mother mandrill didn\u0027t have any time to take care of her older mandrill child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I wish I could get rid of a couple of these babies,\" she said. \"Maybe I can sell them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked all around the jungle, but no one wanted to buy a baby mandrill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe I can give them away,\" she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no one wanted those babies, even as a gift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t figure out what to do. She sat on the jungle floor, thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly one of the babies smiled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the next one did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the third. All three baby mandrills were smiling for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, look!\" the mother said to her older mandrill child. He was up in a tree, hiding, because he hated the babies. But he came down when his mom called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the smiles. He reached over and tickled one of the babies. It laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother one puckered up its mouth and blew him a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third one climbed into his lap, curled up, and began to sleep very quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older mandrill child was surprised at how much, suddenly, he had begun to like the babies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s keep them,\" he said to his mother. \"They\u0027re cute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they did. After that, when the babies cried, the mother mandrill and her older mandrill child just covered their ears. They knew it wouldn\u0027t last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I love that fable,\" Keiko said with a sigh. \"It was so sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeth,\" said Felicia Ann. \"Tho thweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did the babies have purple bums?\" asked Tyrone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm shrugged. \"I guess so,\" he said. \"They were mandrills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooney Bird went to the front of the class. \"There is nothing whatsoever wrong with a purple bottom,\" she said. \"Colorful is always good. I\u0027m planning on dyeing part of my hair purple sometime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for your fable, Malcolm. Do you want to tell us the moral?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. It\u0027s this,\" Malcolm said. \"Things get better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They do indeed,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said, smiling. \"And it sounds as if things are getting better at your house, Malcolm.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gooney-the-fabulous-gooney-bird-greene-3/page-7.html","bookId":2796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:52 PM"}
