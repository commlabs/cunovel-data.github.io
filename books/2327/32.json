You\u0027re meeting him at four? I wish it was earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got appointments until then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And business is business, right? I\u0027ll see you here at three.\" He stood up. \"Meantime I got appointments myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked across town to Elaine\u0027s, stopping en route for flowers and a bag of Jaffa oranges. She put the flowers in water and the oranges in a large blue glass bowl and told me she was feeling a lot better. \"Weak,\" she said, \"but definitely on the mend. What about you? Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look drawn. Were you up again last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I didn\u0027t sleep very well. The case is breaking. It ought to wrap up in a couple more hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did all that happen? It\u0027s Wednesday, isn\u0027t it? Or did I get delirious and miss a couple of days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thurman needed a confidant and I managed to be it. He was feeling pressured, partly by me, I suppose, but mostly by Stettner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Stettner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rubber Man,\" I said. I gave her an abridged version of our conversation last night at Grogan\u0027s. \"I was in the right place at the right time,\" I said. \"I was lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unlike Amanda Thurman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a whole lot of other people, from the sound of it. But Amanda\u0027s the one they\u0027ll all go away for. Between Thurman\u0027s testimony and whatever physical evidence they can put together, they ought to be able to build a nice solid case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why so glum, chum? Shouldn\u0027t you be strutting around like a bantam rooster? Whatever happened to enjoying the moment of triumph?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I\u0027m tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I spent a couple of hours with Thurman last night. It didn\u0027t make me like the little prick but it didn\u0027t leave me ready to rejoice in his downfall, either. A week ago he looked to be some kind of cold criminal genius, and now it turns out he\u0027s just a dimwit. A couple of manipulative perverts led him around by his cock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel sorry for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t feel sorry for him. I think he\u0027s a manipulative bastard himself, he just ran into a better one in Stettner. And I\u0027m not buying everything he told me last night. I don\u0027t think he fed me any outright lies, but I think he made himself look better than he had any right to. For one thing, I\u0027ll bet anything Amanda wasn\u0027t the first person he killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Stettner\u0027s not stupid. He knew the cops would grill Thurman up one side and down the other if his wife was murdered under that sort of circumstances. Even if they didn\u0027t suspect he was involved, they\u0027d question him repeatedly in order to get a line on the killers and not overlook any possible clue. So Stettner would have tempered him first by getting him accustomed to killing. He was there when Leveque was killed, he was an accessory, and I think there must have been times when he and one or both of the Stettners did a number on a woman and she wound up dead. That\u0027s what I would have done if I were Stettner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m not sure how much I buy of his attack of conscience,\" I said. \"I think he\u0027s scared, I think that part\u0027s true enough. Once Stettner gets the last hundred grand from him he\u0027s got no reason to keep him alive. Unless he wants to try for the rest of the money, which is always a possibility. Maybe that\u0027s Thurman\u0027s real fear. He doesn\u0027t want to give up the rest of the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t keep it anyway, can he? If he confesses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t intend to confess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I thought you said you were going to bring him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to try. I\u0027m hoping I can manipulate him the way Stettner did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to come along and blow him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027ll be necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See,\" I said, \"I think he\u0027s trying to manipulate me. Maybe he wants me to kill Stettner for him. That seems farfetched, but it\u0027s not out of the question. He may want my help in arranging some sort of Mexican standoff, whereby he leaves evidence and testimony that will nail Stettner in the event of his own death. If he sets that up right and Stettner knows it, then he\u0027s home free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But any evidence he gives you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goes straight to Joe Durkin. Damn it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s eleven-thirty and I\u0027m not seeing him until four. I should have kept pressing him last night instead of giving him time to think it over. The problem was that he was exhausted and so was I. I thought we\u0027d do it this morning but he went into this song and dance about his business appointments. I wanted to tell him he could afford to cancel, that he was out of business, but I couldn\u0027t do that. You know, he called me a few times yesterday afternoon and wouldn\u0027t talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I could have got together with him then it might be wrapped up by now. Of course I wouldn\u0027t have talked to Danny Boy and I wouldn\u0027t have gone in knowing about Stettner.\" I sighed. \"I guess it\u0027ll all work out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It always does, baby. Why don\u0027t you lie down for an hour or two? Take the bed, or I\u0027ll make up the couch for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t hurt you. And I\u0027ll wake you in plenty of time to go see Joe and get wired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m already wired. In a manner of speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught a noon meeting and walked back to my hotel, stopping for a stand-up lunch at a pizza parlor. I had pepperoni on it to make sure I covered the four basic food groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe the meeting relaxed me, or maybe it was the result of good nutrition, but when I got back to my room I felt tired enough to lie down for an hour. I set my alarm for two-thirty and left a call at the desk for that time as a backup. I kicked my shoes off and stretched out in my clothes, and I must have been out before my eyes were completely shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing I knew the phone was ringing. I sat up and looked at my clock and it was only two, and I picked up the phone prepared to snarl at the desk clerk. TJ said, \"Man, why is it you ain\u0027t never home? How I gone tell you what I find if I can\u0027t even find where you at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boy\u0027s name. The young one. I met this kid who knows him, says his name be Bobby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you learn his last name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There ain\u0027t a lot of last names on the Deuce, Matt. Ain\u0027t too many first names, either. Mostly it\u0027s street names, you know? Cool Fool and Hats and Dagwood. Bobby, he too new on the block to have hisself a street name. Kid I talked to say he just got here around Christmastime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t lasted long. I wanted to tell TJ that it didn\u0027t matter, that the man who\u0027d been with Bobby was about to go away for something else, something that would keep him away from kids for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know where he came from,\" TJ was saying. \"Got off a bus one day is all. Musta come from some place where they had men who liked young boys, \u0027cause that what he was lookin\u0027 for from the jump. \u0027Fore he knew it one of the pimps scooped him up an\u0027 started sellin\u0027 his white ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What pimp?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want for me to find out? I most likely could, but the meter already run to the twenty-dollar mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas there any point? The easy case against Stettner was the murder of Amanda Thurman. There was a body and a witness and, in all likelihood, some kind of physical evidence, all of them lacking in the disappearance and probably murder of the boy called Bobby. Why bother to chase some pimp?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See what you can find out,\" I heard myself say. \"I\u0027ll cover the meter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAT three I presented myself at Midtown North and took off my jacket and shirt. A police officer named Westerberg wired me for sound. \"You\u0027ve worn one of these before,\" Durkin said. \"With that landlady, one the papers called the Angel of Death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you know how it works. You shouldn\u0027t have any trouble with Thurman. If he wants you to go to bed with him just make sure you keep your shirt on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t want me to. He doesn\u0027t like homosexuals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, nothing queer about Richard. You want a vest? I think you ought to wear one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On top of the wire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Kevlar, it shouldn\u0027t interfere with the pickup. The only thing it\u0027s supposed to stop is a bullet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There won\u0027t be any bullets, Joe. Nobody\u0027s used a gun in this so far. The vest won\u0027t stop a blade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes it will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or a pair of panty hose around the neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess,\" he said. \"I just don\u0027t like the idea of sending you in without backup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not sending me in. I\u0027m not under your command. I\u0027m a private citizen wearing a wire out of a sense of civic responsibility. I\u0027m cooperating with you, but you\u0027re not responsible for my safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll remember to tell them that at the hearing after you wind up in a body bag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not going to happen,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say Thurman woke up this morning and realized he talked too much, and now you\u0027re the loose end he has to get rid of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I\u0027m his ace in the hole,\" I said. \"I\u0027m his backup, I\u0027m the man who can make sure Stettner won\u0027t take a chance on killing him. Hell, he hired me, Joe. He\u0027s not going to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He hired you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night. He gave me a retainer, insisted I take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he give you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hundred dollars. A nice crisp hundred-dollar bill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, every little bit helps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t keep it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, you didn\u0027t keep it? You gave it back to him, how\u0027s he gonna trust you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t give it back to him. I got rid of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Money\u0027s money. It doesn\u0027t know where it came from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Money knows no owner. Basic principle of law. How\u0027d you get rid of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Walking home,\" I said. \"We walked as far as Ninth Avenue and Fifty-second Street and then he went one way and I went the other. The first guy who staggered out of a doorway looking for a handout, I wadded up Thurman\u0027s money and stuck it in his cup. They all have cups now, Styrofoam coffee cups that they hold out at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s so people won\u0027t have to touch them. You gave some bum on the street a hundred-dollar bill? How\u0027s he gonna spend it? Who\u0027s gonna change it for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I said, \"that\u0027s not my problem, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over to where Richard Thurman lived and stood in a doorway across from his building. I got there ten minutes early for our four o\u0027clock appointment and I spent the time watching the sidewalk traffic. I couldn\u0027t tell whether or not there was a light on in his apartment. His building was on the uptown side of the block and the windows on the upper floors caught the sunlight and reflected it back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited until four, and then I waited another two minutes or so before I crossed the street and entered the vestibule next door to Radicchio\u0027s entrance. I pressed the button for Thurman and waited to be buzzed in. Nothing happened. I rang again and waited and again nothing happened. I went next door and checked the restaurant bar. He wasn\u0027t there. I went back to my station across the street, and after ten more minutes I walked to the corner and found a working pay phone. I called his apartment and the machine answered, and at the tone I said, \"Richard, are you there? Pick up the phone if you are.\" He didn\u0027t pick up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-32.html","bookId":2327,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM"}
