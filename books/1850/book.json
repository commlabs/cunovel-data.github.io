He\u0027s hot, he\u0027s sexy, and what started as a no-names-exchanged night of passion has blossomed into a year and a half-long pleasure fest. Sure, it\u0027s a little strange that he only appears in her bed at night, but Gwen is so sure he\u0027s the one, she just can\u0027t turn him away... \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eHawk Delgado knows more about Gwen than she could ever imagine.
