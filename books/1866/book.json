That includes dealing with headstrong TV producer Taryn Quinn. Cole may not like her idea for a travel show, but Taryn intrigues him. Enough for Cole to join her on a location-scouting trip to an isolated Pacific island, despite the family drama at home. Soon the tantalizing Taryn makes Cole forget about everything...except making love to her in the moonlight. But once reality intrudes, will he risk losing all he\u0027s worked for to keep this woman in his life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/losing-control-the-hunter-pact-1.jpg","author":"Robyn Grady","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/losing-control-the-hunter-pact-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:42:36 PM"}
