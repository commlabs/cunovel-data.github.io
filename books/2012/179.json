Three dragons, and then a fourth. So eager. Iparth Erule. I think you want that throne. I think you mean to take it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Liosan! Seventh Legion, level spears!’ He turned, moved to the right. Gaelar was ready. They were all ready, bristling, straining for the signal, desperate to lunge forward. Burst through the wall of corpses, burst out on to the Shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd begin the slaughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilent, Aparal Forge swung down the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandalath Drukorlat, Queen of High House Dark, ruler of Kharkanas, walked alone in the palace, wondering where all the ghosts had gone. They should be crowding these ancient halls, whispering along the corridors and passages, lurking in recesses and doorways. Struggling to recall what needed doing, calling out for loved ones in faint, echoing voices. She ran her hand along a wall as she walked, feeling the hard, polished stone. She was far beyond the rounds of the paltry staff now resident in the palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunting ghosts. Stone like skin, but the skin is cold .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could remember when it was different. Alive. Guards and guests, petitioners and servants, priestesses and midwives, retainers and scholars. Hostages. Swirling in their own precious currents, each and every one of them, like blood in a beating heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer worn boots echoed as she made her way down a narrow corridor. Smaller now, this passage, and the steps she reached were shallow and worn, wending up in a tight spiral. She halted, gasping as a faint draught came down from above. I remember this. The downdraught. I remember it. Against my face, my neck. Down round my bared ankles – I used to run – when was that? I must have been a child. Yes, a child. When was that? Her right shoulder brushed against the wall again and again as she climbed. The sloped stone over her head felt oppressively close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I run?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps some inkling of the future. But for that child, there was no refuge. How could there be? Here she was, and the centuries upon centuries in between were now carved solid as this stone. Stop running, child. It’s done. Stop running, even the memory hurts .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandalath reached the top floor, a small flagstone landing, a blackwood door set into an archway. The iron handle was shaped from three lengths of linked chains entwined, stiff enough to form a ring. She stared at it, remembering how at first she’d had to reach up to grasp it, and tug hard to swing back the door. Hostage Room. Born into it, imprisoned within it, until the day you are sent away. The day someone comes and takes you. Hostage Room, child. You didn’t even know what that meant. No, it was your home .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching out, she grasped the ring. A single tug and something broke on the other side, fell with a clunk. Oh … no, no, no —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bed had partially collapsed. Insects had chewed the covers until they fell to dust. Thousands of generations of those insects had dwelt in the mattress, until it too crumbled to nothing. The creatures had eaten the wax candles in the silver sticks still standing on the solid blackwood dresser. Above the dresser, the polished mirror was mottled with midnight stains. The broad windows had been shuttered tight; now little of that remained but heaps of fittings on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandalath stepped inside. She could not see it yet, but she knew it was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocked from the inside .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the passageway leading to the Tutor Chamber she found the small, frail bones of this room’s last hostage. The mice had eaten most of the child, until little more than grey stains marked its position – a body sprawled between the two chambers. Teeth lay scattered like the beads of a broken necklace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know how it was for you. I know . Slaughter in the citadel, screams rising from below, the smell of smoke. The world was ending. Mother Dark turned away. Anomander’s dreams of unification fell like dust through his fingers. The people were fleeing – fleeing Kurald Galain itself. The end of the world .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crouched down in the narrow corridor, stared down at the remnants. Child? Are you me? No. I was long gone from here by then. Sent off to serve my purpose, but that purpose failed. I was among a mass of refugees on Gallan’s Road. Blind Gallan shall lead us to freedom. We need only follow the sightless seer. We need only trust in his vision. Oh yes, child, the madness of that was, well, plain to see. But Darkness was never so cold as on that day .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd on that day, we were all blind .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child hostage would not have left this room. She had learned obedience before all else. Told to stay, she had set the flimsy lock that she had believed would bar the outer door – we all believed it, each in our turn. It was our comfort. Our symbol of independence. It was a lock a grown Andii could break in one hand . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-179.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
