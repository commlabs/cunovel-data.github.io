The passage earned its name from the toothy spears of rock that pierced the surface of the water and connected the dots between Trinidad\u0027s Chaguara Peninsula and the coastal range of the Venezuelan mainland. Many a ship\u0027s hull had been chewed by those teeth when her captain didn\u0027t know the waters, or he was caught by a storm. Given that history, why would Frik think it surprising that some parts of the Dragon\u0027s Mouth were also believed by the locals to be haunted or cursed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry to pull you out of the lab,\" Frik shouted over the slowing thump of the blades as he reached up and helped Paul out of the chopper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch courtesy, Paul thought. Must be something mighty important. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sent a couple of divers down. Only one of them came back, and he died kicking and screaming on the deck before he could tell us a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like a bad case of the bends.\" Must have shot straight to the surface without a decompression stop. What could spook a diver enough to do that? Paul winced at the thought of nitrogen bubbles fizzing through his bloodstream, ending in an air embolism to the brain. \"No sign of the other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrik shot him a look. \"I told you. Only one came back. And the other\u0027s tank would have run out long ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul always felt an uncomfortable sense of obligation around Frikkie, to whom he owed a great deal of money, borrowed for his daughter\u0027s long years of schooling. The debt forced him to stick around, but it didn\u0027t change the fact that he neither liked nor trusted his boss. What\u0027s more, Frik always made Paul, younger by a decade, feel like the older of the two. Somehow the older man had maintained the toned body of a man twenty years younger. Piercing blue eyes and even white teeth gleaming from a perpetually tanned face, dark hair just beginning to gray at the temples. Paul was shorter, darker, heavier, and, in the looks department, somewhat further down the evolutionary tree. All the way back to Amphibia class, he thought. A newt - no, a frog...waiting in vain for the princess\u0027s kiss that would turn him into a Frik. Tough. Single-minded. An expert manipulator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul was sorry about the men, but that was hardly a reason for Frik to demand his immediate presence. \"You brought me down here because of the missing diver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly. I need your help with these lazy bastards who are refusing to go on working.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027rea damn Trini. You tell me. They were bringing up a core sample and found some strange fragments,\" Frik said. \"That seems to be what spooked the hell out of them. Blaine here thinks the men may believe they are fetishes - Obeah - and that if we mess with them the Obeahman will hurt us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it you think I can do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get someone to dive down and see if he can find Abdul.\" Frik pointed at four objects lying atop a pile of silt. \"Then take those back to the lab and examine them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul walked over to the objects and hunkered down to take a closer look. Though he was far more educated than his average countryman, he was born and bred a Trini. He knew the power of local superstitions. There was nothing he could do about the workers or about Abdul. As a scientist, a chemist, he dealt in atoms and molecules and exchanges of electrons - an unseen realm, but vastly predictable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something different about the objects. He wouldn\u0027t go so far as to say \"wrong,\" because that was a moral or ethical judgment, and in his world, morals or ethics didn\u0027t apply to lumps of matter. But he had to admit, if lumps of matter could be \"wrong,\" these four were pretty damn close. In the eyes of many of the Trinidadians working for Frikkie, these trinkets would be a sure sign of wrongness. The Trinis - whose heritage embraced both Africa and India - were an innately superstitious group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe, on the other hand, was not. As far as he was concerned, what he sawwas...what he saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo him, the pieces looked like the stones he\u0027d seen embedded in Native American jewelry in the States...asymmetrical matchbox-size lumps of bicolored turquoise from the Kingman Mine in Arizona, or something very much like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked one up. It didn\u0027t feel like turquoise or any other kind of stone. More like a rather strange form of plastic. There was no specific design to the lumps, but they were definitely not naturally occurring shapes. These were fashioned objects, products of intelligence, though he could not guess what kind of intelligence could have made them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, Paul decided, was what had spooked the workers. No one had ever seen shapes like these before, so they automatically shied away from them. As far as he was concerned, it was a typical islanders\u0027 response to the new and different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t consider himself a typical islander, however, and while he couldn\u0027t help Frik with his divers, he wanted very badly to take a closer look at these trinkets.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/artifact/page-3.html","bookId":1691,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM"}
