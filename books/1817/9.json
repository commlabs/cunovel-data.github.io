It’s good to be back home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked over to my dad and gave him a passionate kiss; a long kiss that wouldn’t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh, will you two knock it off already or take it upstairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trust me, son; we are right now.” My dad winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and grabbed my bags and went to my room. I heard my mom giggling behind me. I threw my bag on the bed and pulled out my phone, noticing a text message from Aiden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, bro, are you back in town yet? We have some serious partying to do tonight at Tina Brian’s house. Everyone is going to be there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, I just got back. What time is the party?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eight o’clock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll meet you there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScore. That party was exactly what I needed. Tina was a good friend. We occasionally hooked up and enjoyed each other’s company. She wasn’t my type, though. Don’t get me wrong, she was a very nice and sexy girl, but there wasn’t that spark there that Hailey and I had. A spark that I never thought would go away. I sat down on my bed and pulled out a picture of me and Hailey that I hid in my nightstand. Memories of our greatest times together flooded my mind and hurt me like hell. I picked up my phone and pulled up her name. Fuck it! I sent her a text message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, how are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Collin. I’m good. How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished I could tell her that I was good too, but I couldn’t lie to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not good, Hailey. I miss you like hell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t start with that again. You need to move on, Collin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMove on? Was she fucking serious?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you moved on, Hailey?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I have. I’m sorry if it hurts you, but I’ve met someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach felt sick when I read that and my heart began to ache something fierce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good for you. I won’t ever bother you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, but I believe that we weren’t meant to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she be such a heartless bitch? It was like one morning she woke up a completely different person. I didn’t even know who she was anymore. She was not the girl I fell in love with all those years ago. I didn’t respond to her last message. If she believed we weren’t meant to be and she found someone else, then so be it. I wouldn’t lie and say that I wasn’t completely devastated, because I was – all over again. Her words hurt me more than I ever imagined they would. If she wanted me to move on, then that was what I would do, but I could promise you that I would never allow myself to hurt like that again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand on the doorknob and, as I turned it and opened the door, I was startled when I saw Julia standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome back.” She smiled as she hugged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus, Julia, you scared me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, but you’re the one who opened the door. I was just getting ready to knock. Where are Mom and Dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do you think?” I said as I walked out of my room, shut the door, and looked down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” she said as she followed me down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went into the kitchen and Julia sat down at the table. “How are you feeling?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m feeling okay. How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m great, Julia!” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, okay. That’s not going to work on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes as I poured some juice for us in a glass and sat down across from her. I slid the glass across the table. “Juice?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. Now tell me what’s going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing is going on, Julia. Why do you keep insisting something is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her elbows on the table as she slid the glass of juice back to me. “Because, I know you and I know the look on your face when something happens. You can’t fool me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. “Fine. I sent a text to Hailey and she told me to move on and that she’s met someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aw, Collin, I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry about what?” my dad asked as he strolled into the kitchen with a big smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Julia and discreetly shook my head. “Oh, nothing, Dad. I was just telling him that I was sorry about Jacob’s illness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, yes. It’s a terrible thing. It’s good to see you, princess.” He smiled as he kissed her head. “Are you two almost ready to go to dinner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him in confusion. “Dinner? I have plans tonight, Dad,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell that to your mother, son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what?” my mom asked as she walked into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Collin has something he’d like to tell you.” My dad smiled as he raised his eyebrow at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it. I could never say no when it came to her. “Nothing’s wrong, Mom. I was just telling Dad that I can’t wait for all of us to go and have a nice dinner. It’s been a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh good. I was afraid you had already had plans for tonight.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I do, but not until later. Is Jake coming with us?” I asked Julia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, he had to go help his dad with something at the dealership.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my watch. “Great, let’s go. I’m starving.” I smiled, trying to hurry them up so I could go the party after. I didn’t want to be too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you in some sort of a hurry, son?” my dad smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, no. I’m just really hungry.” I smiled as we walked onto the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed Julia and my mom goodbye before leaving the restaurant. Since my dad brought the Range Rover, I had to take a cab to Tina’s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s about time, man.” Aiden smiled as we high-fived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry. I had to have dinner with my family. You know how my parents are about family dinners.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I sure do. Come on; let’s get our drink on and party!” he screeched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked inside and straight to the kitchen, where Tina and a few of our friends were gathered around the table doing lemon drops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Collin, get your sweet ass over here and do some shots with us!” Tina exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed to forget about Hailey once and for all. Okay, I probably wouldn’t forget about her for good, but at least for tonight, I would after I got rip-roaring drunk. I picked up a lemon drop and held it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck relationships!” I said as I threw the shot down the back of my throat. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-9.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
