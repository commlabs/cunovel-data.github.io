Just a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cringes and says, “Too soon, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and shrug. He sighs and pulls me into him. I’m wrapped in a Nik blanket and it feels great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew soon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my head a little so our lips touch. I hold his jaw with my fingertips and peck at his lips one- two- three times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere goes nothin’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and whisper against his lips, “I love you more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel his smile against my lips and he wraps me up tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarmth washes over my body. I forgot what being in love with someone felt like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stay tangled together until Max and Ceecee got home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Ceecee comes through the door she yells out, “Tina! Tina! Tina!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik and I laugh into each other’s necks before separating. We both stand and watch Ceecee come towards us wearing the most beautiful crooked smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks happy. That makes me happy. I lean down and give her a big hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push her hair behind her ear and tell her, “We were waiting for you to get home. I cooked breakfast for all of us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax looks to the ceiling, throws his arms in the air and whoops. He walks toward me and kisses me on the cheek and says, “I knew there was a reason I liked you, T.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeecee’s face has dropped. She replies quietly, “I already ate breakfast with grandma.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax peeks in the oven and yells out, “French toast and bacon? You’re a goddess, Tina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeecee’s face lifts a little. She whispers to me, “I love French toast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at her and offer, “Well how about this, you go ahead and get yourself a piece and whatever you can’t eat, I’ll eat for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles shyly and responds, “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring the food over to the dining table and go back into the kitchen. I peek out and see Max cutting Ceecee’s food for her. Ceecee doesn’t look happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI call Max into the kitchen and say, “Max, honey, Ceecee is nine years old. She doesn’t need you to cut her food for her anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns and returns petulantly, “I like cutting her food for her. I’m her daddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there were dirt on the floor, he would’ve kicked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cup his cheek and ask, “You want her to be independent, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, “Right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss his cheek and say, “Help her by allowing her to help herself.” I hand him the syrup and butter to take to the table and he skulks away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all sit and I look over to see Ceecee cutting a strip of bacon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles big at Max and tells him, “See, daddy? I can do it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoot him a smothered smile. He smiles and shakes his head at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe responds ,“I know, angel. You’re not a baby anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik looks at us through narrowed eyes then winks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe eat and when we finish the boys clear the plates. Ceecee and I go to watch some TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeecee sits next the sofa in her chair and I sit on the edge of the sofa with an arm around my little friend stroking her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill watching the TV, she says softly, “Is this what it’s like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m immediately confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask, “What what’s like, angel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leans her head on my shoulder and whispers, “To have a family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCue waterworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat to steady my voice and turn my misty eyes away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say shakily, “Yes, angel. We are a family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll good Bear’s go to heaven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday morning at Safira is busy for the first time in…ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had a new shipment come in. It included a popular blazer worn by one of Hollywood’s elite actresses and there is a crush of women calling and showing up to the store to place orders or buy them. This price of each blazer is close to two hundred dollars and I ordered twenty of them so even though we’re extremely busy, I’m mentally doing the nutbush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make my way over to Winnie’s and place a coffee order. I chat to the young girl at the counter for a minute before making my way back to the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRawr Raaawr\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap. Damn. Poop! I forgot to change the batteries in the doorbell sensor which is slowly dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare up at it and turn and look to the counter and freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is another expensive flower arrangement on the counter. Nat stands there glaring because on the opposite side of the counter stands Omarr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Crudsickles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe delivered them by hand this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentally prepare myself then walk over. He turns and shoots me a beautiful smile. There is no malice in his eyes like the last time I saw him. He looks like a different man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat disappears from the counter. I force a small smile and greet, “Hello, Omarr.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks good. He’s wearing black jeans, sneakers and a polo shirt. His hair still styled in short neat dreadlocks. He walks over to me and surprises me when he kisses my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says, “Hi Tina, how are you beautiful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m confused. Why is he here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI respond quietly, “I’m fine thanks. How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles and says, “I’m good but I’d be better if you’d come to dinner with me tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face falls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the heck? Didn’t he get the delivery of crushed flowers the last time he tried this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a hand on his arm and reply, “Omarr. I’m sorry. I’m with Nik. We’re together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flash hatred and I’m immediately panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gently removes my hand from him and says, “You made the wrong choice, mami.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I’m getting pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo I didn’t. Nik is good to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand taller and state, “No, Omarr. I made the best choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, looks up with sad eyes and replies “Tina, you don’t know your man. He isn’t right. You should be with me. I’d treat you like a princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m fuming now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spit, “Why would I be with you and get treated like a princess when Nik treats me like a queen. And like in a game of chess, the queen protects her king.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake that, Omarr!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh oh…he’s pissed now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoots me an acid smile, “Wrong choice, babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m on the verge of tears now. My neck is red and itchy as hell and all I want to do is scratch it to death with a pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper, “I could never be with you. You have hatred seeping out of your pores.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flash pain and he responds, “Maybe there’s a reason for my hatred. Maybe you should ask your boy about Marcus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus? Who is Marcus?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there a problem here?” This sounds terribly bored and coming from the store entry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere stands Ghost leaning in the door frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says to Omarr, “You lost?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmarr replies, “Naw, man. Just catchin’ up with a friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost looks my way than back at Omarr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says, “Friends don’t make each other look like Tina looks right now.” He steps closer to Omarr and whispers, “Do I need to take this to Uncle Jerm or are you going to let it go with some dignity?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmarr stands taller, forces a smile, and responds “Naw, man. No problems here. Just visiting.” Omarr turns to me and says, “Sorry I upset you, Tina. Won’t happen again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he’s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk backwards to the wall, put a hand on the wall, and place the other on my chest. I think I’m having a panic attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost walks towards me, puts his hands on my cheeks, and forces my face to look into his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalmly he instructs me, “Breathe, Tina. Just breathe. Nice and easy. There you go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try control my breathing as Nat appears with an ice pack for my flushed face and neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost takes the ice pack from Nat and gently runs it along my neck and cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at her and says, “Thanks for calling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods but remains focused on me. I haven’t had a panic attack in a year. I don’t feel like I’m in control of my own body and that sucks. I definitely did not miss these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat puts a hand on my forehead and whispers, “You’re safe. You’re grounded. Calm yourself, babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and close my eyes. My heart won’t stop racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat comes closer to my ear and whispers, “Remember how Mia always said My instead of I so when she would ask for something it would come out My want to watch a movie or My want candy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at the memory. I nod and my breathing slows slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe goes on, “Or how she couldn’t say the letter L properly so she would say Mia wants yunch instead of lunch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle. I’m sweating like a pig but I can breathe deeply now. I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat chuckles quietly, “Remember when she emptied a whole container of baby powder on the couch and was throwing it around like snow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI burst into laughter but it quickly dissolves into silent sobs. I slide down the wall and sink to the floor. My body is boneless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia is gone. My precious baby. All I have are those memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat sits down next to me and holds my limp, shaking body. I feel her body shake with mine. Mourning my daughter together. A true friend feels your pain and knows nothing they say can compose you, but a simple embrace can be worth more than any words ever could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout warning I stand, take the flower arrangement, and walk out the door. My blood boils and my breathing heavies. I shriek as I throw into the street and watch as a car runs over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a two hundred dollar gift. Now it’s nothing but trash. Just like the person who gave them to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn on the sidewalk to see Ghost and Natalie standing in Safira’s entry smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and breathe deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter gathering back what is left of my mind, I walk over to Ghost and kiss his cheek. I kiss Nat’s right after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk right into the stock room, close the door, sit on my desk and sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What exactly did he say to her?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost replies, “I don’t know, Nik. She was wound up tight when I got there. She had tears in her eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart clenches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks uneasy as he continues, “That’s nothing compared to what happened after he left. Your girl had a meltdown. Shaking like a leaf, flushed, sweatin’ like a fountain, out of control panic attack. Had to cool her down with an ice pack. Nat said a few things to her I couldn’t hear but whatever she was saying seemed to be working. They both ended up in tears.” He smirks. “Then Tina gets the flowers, walks out of the store and throws it into oncoming traffic. Beautiful, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just can’t bring myself to think about anything other than Tina having a breakdown. This is why I got out of Chaos. It affects your family. Now, I’m not even a part of the brotherhood anymore and it’s still affecting my girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNope. I don’t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many thoughts are running through my head. I ask, “You think this is the last we see of Omarr?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost furrows his brow and responds, “They call him unpredictable for a reason, brother. I just hope Tina didn’t diss him. He’ll take it as a personal insult.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina is sweet as pie. No way she dissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and point out, “This is Tina we’re talking about. She hates confrontation. No way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost nods his head in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why do I still have a bad feeling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone pings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check it and see I’ve received a text from Nik asking me if I’m okay. He called a few times but I didn’t have it in me to pretend I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m feeling a little better now. I’ve drowned my sorrows in coffee and candy. I decide to go see him. I leave Nat in charge and she waves me out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably look like death warmed over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk into his office. Nik’s sitting behind his desk on the phone. He spots me and his face softens. He waves me over. I reach him and he pulls me down sideways onto his lap. He tucks me deeper into him and continues to talk on the phone all the while rubbing my back and planting whisper-soft kisses on the side of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m suddenly relaxed. Nothing compares to this. Nik is my personal form of stress relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body becomes lax and I feel sleepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik ends his phone call, puts his phone on the desk and wraps me up tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asks, “You okay, baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod into his chest. I don’t trust myself to speak. It’s been an emotional day and I’ve been known to cry at the drop of a hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel his breath on my ear as he sighs and continues to hold me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide to break the silence with, “Who’s Marcus?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik’s body stiffens. And there it is. Not good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe softens his body and explains, “Marcus was Omarr’s older brother. He was killed years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t believe that. There’s more to this and, gosh darn it, I want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper, “How did he die, Nik?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs and tightens his hold on me as if he thinks I’m about to go berserk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts the story, “Marcus broke into our family home when I was fifteen. He tried to get into my dad’s office to steal something. Dad heard someone in the house. Dad shot Marcus and he died later that night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasp and grip him tight. I’m not sure how I feel about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik continues, “When the police arrived to take statements and asked who took the first shot, I said it was me. Omarr thinks I shot his brother dead. I was just a kid and protecting my dad, babe. I got a suspended sentence and a few months later my dad was dead. So it didn’t make any difference anyway. Omarr is a part of the Sixes. Uncle Jerm leads them and he knows I didn’t do it. That’s all that matters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stay silent while I process this. It explains a lot of the tension between Omarr and Nik. Maybe Omarr just wanted to use me to get back at Nik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry baby, this is all my fault,” he whispers on a shoulder squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper back, “No, it’s not. Your dad was protecting your family and you were protecting your dad. I would do the same for my dad, Nik. Really, I would.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/friend-zoned-friend-zoned-1/page-29.html","bookId":2798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM"}
