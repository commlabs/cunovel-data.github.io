{"id":23050,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. OLD PEGGY.","content":"Tim Roach was not only selfish, but liked to make mischief. He resolved to be revenged upon Johnny for declining to \"treat\" him to a dinner, and having plenty of time on his hands, took pains to seek out the humble home tenanted by old Peggy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was on the third floor of a tall, shabby brick house, not far from the Chicago and Alton depot. Tim had been there before, and didn\u0027t require directions. He ascended the rickety staircase, nearly treading on two dirty faced children belonging to a neighbor of Peggy\u0027s, who were playing on the landing. As a third child, older, made her appearance, Tim stopped long enough to inquire, \"Is Peggy at home?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" answered the girl. \"She\u0027s home, but, oh my, ain\u0027t she tight!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s nothin\u0027 new,\" said Tim, composedly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He knocked at Peggy\u0027s door, and receiving no answer, opened it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The old woman had thrown herself on a truckle bed at one corner of the room, and was breathing noisily with her eyes half closed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is it you, Johnny!\" she asked, without turning her head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, it\u0027s me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who\u0027s me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tim Roach.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you want?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve just seed Johnny, Peggy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Has he sold many matches? Where is he?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I seed him in an eatin\u0027 house. He was eatin\u0027 a bully dinner.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What!\" exclaimed Peggy, now thoroughly roused, raising herself on her elbow. \"What\u0027s that you say, Tim Roach?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tim, quite enjoying the commotion he had raised, repeated his information.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So he\u0027s spendin\u0027 my money in fillin\u0027 his stomach, the little wretch!\" exclaimed Peggy. \"That\u0027s why he brings home so little money. The ungrateful little imp that I\u0027ve slaved and slaved for these last six years, takin\u0027 advantage of a poor old woman when her back\u0027s turned! Where was it, Tim, dear?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tim mentioned the restaurant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what was he eatin\u0027, Tim?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He ordered a cup o\u0027 coffee and beefsteak—I don\u0027t know what else he had.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll learn him to chate and decave me!\" said the old woman, angrily. \"He only brought home twenty-five cents yesterday, and I takin\u0027 care of him, and buyin\u0027 him close and vittles.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I guess he buys some dinner every day,\" said Tim.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I never to suspect it! Tim, dear, you\u0027re a good boy to come and tell me. You wouldn\u0027t treat your best friend that way?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I wouldn\u0027t!\" said Tim, virtuously. \"What are you goin\u0027 to do to him, Peggy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where\u0027s my stick, Tim? Do you see it anywhere?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I don\u0027t,\" answered Tim, after a search.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Some of them children downstairs must have carried it off.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can buy you a cane for ten cents.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And where would the ten cents come from I would like to know. I\u0027ll bate him wid my fists, the ongrateful young kid.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What are you goin\u0027 to give me for tellin\u0027 you, Peggy?\" asked Tim.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll give you a penny the next time I see you,\" said Peggy, vaguely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That isn\u0027t enough. Give me a nickel to buy a glass of beer?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I haven\u0027t got it, Tim. I wish I had, for I\u0027m awful dhry myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wouldn\u0027t have come all the way to tell you if I\u0027d know\u0027d that,\" said Tim, discontentedly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just then a noise was heard on the stairs, and Tim, opening the door wider, looked out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here\u0027s Johnny now, Peggy!\" he said in excitement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come home the middle of the afternoon, too, the young rascal!\" ejaculated the old woman. \"I\u0027ll fix him!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So here you are, you young——,\" commenced Peggy, as Johnny made his appearance, but the threat with which she was about to conclude, died in the utterance, when she saw that Johnny was closely followed by a tall man of middle age.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who are you, sir?\" she asked irritably, \"and what brings you here? If you\u0027re the agent, I haven\u0027t got any money for you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you remember me, Peggy?\" asked Lyman, sinking with rare courage into a chair which cracked under his weight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, sir, I don\u0027t. If I had my glasses, perhaps——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I see you\u0027ve got company, Peggy,\" continued Lyman, with a significant look at Tim. \"I would like to speak to you alone. It\u0027ll be to your advantage, mind,\" he added, detecting a suspicious look on the old woman\u0027s face. \"Just send the two boys out to play, and we\u0027ll speak together.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"First, hand over what money you\u0027ve got, Jack,\" said Peggy. \"I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to have you wastin\u0027 it outside. Let me see your matches! How many boxes did you sell?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Five,\" answered Johnny.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Only five!\" exclaimed the old woman, holding up her hands. \"You were playin\u0027 in the strates, I\u0027ll be bound!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I wasn\u0027t, Aunt Peggy. I tried to sell more, but——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, yes, I understand! And you\u0027d done so well you thought you\u0027d buy yourself a dinner off my money. Come here and let me shake you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tim told you!\" said the little boy, with a reproachful look at his betrayer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, he told me, and he was a good bye for doin\u0027 it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He said he\u0027d tell if I didn\u0027t buy him some, too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is that threu?\" asked Peggy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hark to him!\" said Tim, with virtuous indignation. \"It\u0027s a lie, and he knows it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you spend all the money, Jack?\" demanded Peggy. \"If you did——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I didn\u0027t, Aunt Peggy. Some good people gave me some money, and——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was for me, then. How dared you spind it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve brought most of it home, Peggy. See here!\" and Johnny took out a handful of small silver coins and pennies, and poured them into the old woman\u0027s lap.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peggy was agreeably surprised. She saw that there was nearly a dollar, much more than Johnny generally brought home, and it put her in a good humor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ve done well, Jack!\" she said. \"I won\u0027t grudge the money you spent for a bit of dinner. Now go out and play wid Tim.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t want to play with him. He told on me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My lad,\" said Lyman, \"can\u0027t you bring a bottle of beer for your good aunt and myself. Here\u0027s money; you can bring back the change.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You go, Jack, for the gentleman,\" said Peggy, quite restored to good humor. \"I don\u0027t mind sayin\u0027 that my throat is just parched with bein\u0027 so dhry.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Johnny went out, and soon returned, for he had not far to go. In spite of his company being so unwelcome, Tim went and returned with him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Won\u0027t you give me a little, Peggy,\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I won\u0027t. You wanted Jack to trate you on my money. Now clear out, and never let me see your ugly face here ag\u0027in.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s the thanks I get for tellin\u0027 you!\" complained Tim. \"And after runnin\u0027 myself out of breath, too!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Clear out wid you! And you, Jack, go back and see if you can\u0027t sell some more matches. It\u0027s only the middle of the afternoon, and there\u0027s plenty of time before sunset to sell half-a-dozen boxes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Johnny obeyed, not unwillingly, for he was not partial to home, nor did he enjoy Peggy\u0027s company. Tim accompanied him, but Johnny, gentle as he was, refused to have anything to say to him. Tim felt that he was badly treated. Johnny turned his back on him, and Peggy had utterly failed to acknowledge the service he had rendered her. Tim was of opinion that it was a cold world, and that there was little encouragement to be virtuous.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1828/53049.html","bookId":1019,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM"}
