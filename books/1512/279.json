Zheng woke up on the platform in God’s dimension. Xuan, Kampa, and WangXia were still lying on the stretchers. The three newbies were nowhere to be seen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng sighed. He didn’t have the extra attention for the newbies once he learned of the limited time these three people had. Instead of letting the newbies complete the bonus mission and risk losing Xuan and the others due to the time constraint, he chose his comrades. He wouldn’t let his mercy burden the team.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “God, repair everyone. Deduct points from themselves.” Zheng yelled. Several beams immediately surrounded the four people and lifted them up in the air. The beam on Zheng quickly dissipated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was when he realized the young dragon was still in his arms. He hesitated before entering the warehouse. What if the dragon couldn’t be brought back? Then the government would get a hold of it. There was no way to retrieve it from the government in a reasonable amount of time even if they were to return to the Jurassic Park’s world. However, he didn’t have any means of hiding the dragon at the time. He was under surveillance the whole time. Handing it to the blonde man was of no help either. So he carried the dragon along as a test of his luck. It seemed like they won this bet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While Xuan, Kampa, and WangXia were still repairing, the door to his room opened. Lori ran out with a teary laughter and jumped onto him. Zheng didn’t even get to throw the dragon off before she was in his arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lori bit his shoulder but then a series of barking caught her attention. She looked at Zheng in surprise. The young dragon squeezed up from them and barked loudly like a puppy as tear flowed down its eyes. Lori instantly grabbed it into her arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Poor little puppy. Just a little ugly. Well, you will be called Ugly from this day on.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The dragon didn’t like Lori’s cuddle. When she tried to pat its head, it bit her hand. Though its teeth weren’t even developed at this point and just made Lori giggle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng felt peaceful looking at the scene. A kind of peace that calmed him down from the tension that built up during the movies. He walked over to Lori and kissed her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the same time, the swelling on the other three people were subsiding and the fester gone. They landed on the floor in perfect condition. Kampa swung his arms around. His strength looked much higher. So God repaired their body but didn’t take away the enhanced stats from the dragon’s blood. Then their profit was much higher. 100 points in four stats equal to 4000 points.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng let go of Lori. He turned to the three people with a smile. “How are you feeling?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa laughed. “Great. Can’t believe how good this repair is. My body was swollen and itchy but the repair brought it back to normal. Haha.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e WangXia also laughed. “Yeah. I could smell the rotten liquid from my body when my body even moved a bit on the stretcher. It was rotten like a long dead corpse. I’d rather die than experience that horrifying sensation again.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng patted them on the shoulder. He saw Xuan was already under God with his eyes close so he yelled. “Xuan, take a rest today. We will discuss things tomorrow.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan replied in his usual tone. “You go ahead. I discovered something interesting. Also, the two books are in WangXia’s hands. It’s better to put them back into the Na ring. We can’t afford to damage these two books.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e WangXia ripped an opening on his jacket and pulled out the books. “We tried to protect these books as much as possible in case we have to revive you. Haha. You will have to tell us about how you lived under that condition.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa punched Zheng and also laughed. “Right. How dare you try to be a hero. We were in terrible moods for a few days. You will have to tell us tomorrow.” Then he walked next to Xuan and closed his eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng and WangXia were confused until a beam shone down on Kampa then a blonde woman appeared in his arms. She wasn’t tall but her proportions were perfect with legs that was at least 60% of her height.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng felt a sense of familiarity when he looked at the woman then recognized her as a famous movie star in the real world. She was also the daughter of a billionaire, the dream of countless men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa kissed her then shouted. “Anyone that knocks on my door tomorrow can’t get an erection for half a year. Haha.” He carried her running to his room. The door was shut with a loud bang.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng and WangXia smiled bitterly at each other. Zheng couldn’t make any more woman since he already had Lori. Xuan didn’t have such desires to create a woman. So he was curious at WangXia. “Why don’t you create a partner? Or do you have a special interest?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e WangXia smiled. “No. I also want to relax like this after the tension but I will feel sorry for her. She’s still alive. Just forget it. When I become powerful enough to go back, I won’t be ashamed of myself looking at her. Based on our current progressions, it shouldn’t take too long to return.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng was touched. WangXia was a real man. A man wasn’t just someone that succumb to his sexual desires but actually be able to restrain himself and not cross the bottom line for his lover.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng smiled. “Don’t worry. We will return one day. Maybe it is just one or two years in the real world. You won’t make her wait too long. Haha. Never thought you are devoted to love.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e WangXia chuckled then walked to his room. His steps were determined with no trace of the suffering that he had just gone through.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng hugged Lori then headed for his room. Xuan’s voice came from behind. “Thanks for your hard work.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng waved his hand without turning around. Xuan was still standing under God.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both;\"\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-13-chapter-3-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-13-chapter-4-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-13-chapter-4-01","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
