In the next instant, a large purple symbol appeared on Shangguan Tianyue’s head, and the Holy Light Dragon Possession effect was dispelled.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a seemingly simple strike, yet the effect was remarkably different. Why was this so? Tang Xian, Shangguan Bing’er and Zhan LingTian could only stare in shock with jaws agape. They could not understand what had actually happened to allow the\u0026nbsp;Demonic Dragon Lady that Zhou Weiqing had summoned to breakthrough the defense of a Heavenly God Tier Skill.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Shangguan Tianyang was able to see through some of it. After the blow, the body of the\u0026nbsp;Demonic Dragon Lady instantly turned illusory once more, slowly vanishing into the air. It was without question that with the single blow of its Dragon Silencing Seal, it had already unleashed all of its power. However, that was not the key. The critical key was in the powerful Demonic Attribute aura that Zhou Weiqing had given off. Not only did it deter Shangguan Tianyue, it had also boosted the Demonic Dragon Lady’s power in that instant.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Skill to boost another Skill? Furthermore, it was boosting an already powerful that had already stepped into the realm of the Heavenly God Tier. What kind of insanely terrifying Demonic Attribute power was required to do that?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as the audience were surprised, the wings behind the floating Zhou Weiqing’s back flapped abruptly. His entire body shot forward towards Shangguan Tianyue like a rocket. As he flew along in midair, ray after ray of dark gold light continued appearing around his body. From the start of the fight until now, he had finally summoned his Consolidated Equipment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis little rascal was just too cunning. This was the single shared thought amongst the entire audience.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, he had not used any Consolidated Equipment at all, and without a doubt it was because he was afraid that if he used any, it would give Shangguan Tianyue an excuse to use his own as well. Now that Shangguan Tianyue was temporarily sealed by his Dragon Silencing Seal, and was unable to use his Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills, he no longer hesitated to summon it all, boosting himself to the maximum.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was not the only thing. The giant grey illusory figure behind Zhou Weiqing’s back had also charged along with him. As it chased him in midair, it somehow warped into a bout of grey light, streaming directly into Zhou Weiqing’s body. In that instant, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body, even his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set, all turned into a crystalline grey colour, glittering and translucent.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis Dual Legendary Hammers raised up, slamming directly towards Shangguan Tianyue’s head. At the same time, ray after ray of lights lit up around Shangguan Tianyue without any pause.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsolute Delay. Fetters of Wind. Curse of Doom. Spatial Collapse. All focused on control and restriction, as well as powerful single target Skills. It could be said that in this very moment, Zhou Weiqing was tantamount to six or seven Heavenly King powerhouses unleashing all their Skill simultaneously, the density of fire so high that one could only sigh in admiration. Even Shangguan Tianyue had to admit to himself that he could not accomplish this.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, Shangguan Tianyue’s body actually turned ‘multi-coloured’, each colour representing various restrictions, boosts, causing him to be unable to dodge anything at all despite having the full power of a Heavenly Emperor. In the end, he could only forcefully lift his arms, circulating his Heavenly Energy with all his might in an attempt to block Zhou Weiqing’s attacks.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s eyes had turned grey and overcast, filling the entire area with the ice cold demonic aura, causing the temperature to drop by at least several dozen degrees.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*BANG*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dual Legendary Hammers slammed directly into Shangguan Tianyue, without any flourishes. To everyone’s surprise, even with Shangguan Tianyue’s powerful physique and thick Heavenly Energy, he was actually sent flying by the hammer blows of Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s right foot stomped down hard on the ground, his entire body charging towards Shanguan Tianyue’s flying body in an unforgiving chase. At the same time, his right leg was swirling in the air in an illusory figure, and over a hundred crystalline energy pearls appeared all around Shangguan Tianyue. In the next instant, they all plastered themselves onto him, exploding with a terrifying accompaniment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not so simple as mere Lightning Pearls! Each and every single pearl was glowing with Blue, Black and Grey. It was the Dark Demon God Lightning that he had not used for such a long time. In the past, he had used this Dark Demon God Lightning to defeat Shen Little Demon for the first time, when he was only at the three-Jeweled stage. Currently, more than a hundred of these pearls had appeared, and with his Heavenly King stage cultivation, one could just imagine the collective power of these Dark Demon God Lightning pearls.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Tianyue’s body was still flying in midair, giving a muffled grunt. His clothes were already torn in many areas, and current Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Legendary Hammers were once again reaching him, slamming into his chest once more.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*PENG*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Shangguan Tianyue was slammed directly into the ground. The drill grounds existed in another small spatial existence, but even so, his tall and large figure was drilled into the ground. A mouth of blood spurted out from his mouth.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tianyue!” Tang Xian cried sorrowfully. She no longer cared about any rules, charging towards him in a flash. While in midair, she did not forget to give a savage kick towards Zhou Weiqing, who had just completed his attack.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, Zhou Weiqing did not dodge, even purposely moving his hammers away, allowing his mother in law to kick him in the chest. With his insane defense, how could that swift quick even injure him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Xian did not have the time to care about Zhou Weiqing, she had already reached Shangguan Tianyue. Currently, her face was pale, the pain in her eyes was clear despite the tears flowing out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er could only stand there, struck silly, her hands covering her mouth in horror.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything had happened just too quickly. From the time that Zhou Weiqing had given a warning, to Shangguan Tianyue falling on the ground critically wounded. All of it had happened in the barely the time it took for a few breaths.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Xian’s hand was carressing Shangguan Tianyue’s chest where it had caved in slightly. Turning her head around to glare at Zhou Weiqing savagely, she snarled: “You bastard, how could you treat your father in law like that, to strike him so brutally. You…”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said with an innocent look on his face: “Isn’t that what you taught me? When I first met you, you taught me to learn as many Control Skills as I could. Earlier, you also told me to beat up Father in Law. I was afraid that if I did not exert myself, you would not allow Xue’er, Fei’er and Bing’er to marry me. You can’t blame me for this!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Xian was instantly struck speechless. Since Shangguan Tianyue was injured so seriously, she did not bother caring about Zhou Weiqing any longer. Turning back, she carefully carried Shangguan Tianyue out of the hole he was stuck in.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling Tang Xian’s warmth and gentleness, as well as how careful she was treating him, the pale face of Shangguan Tianyue forcefully squeezed out a smile. “Xian’er, I am alright. I lost fair and square, it is just that I never expected I would lose to that little brat. That brat Weiqing, to be able to have such power at such a young age, it looks like we can set our minds at ease to leave our daughters to him. Don’t blame him, what he said was right… you were the one who asked him to beat me up. Now, is your anger assuaged? All these years, you know I really wanted to say sorry to you, to repent sincerely in front of you. However, you never gave me the chance…”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t speak anymore. How are your wounds?” Tang Xian’s eyes were complicated, but it was without question, the majority of her feelings shown was worry and concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Tianyue shook his head, holding onto her hands. “My injuries are not important to me at all. Xian’er, do you know? Those years you left me, I was in so much more pain than I am now… every single day, suffering. It was only until you returned that it got better. However, you still continued ignoring me, and I continued suffering everyday. If you do not forgive me, then I will just stay here and refuse treatment, I might as well just die now. I really cannot endure this emotional and mental torture any longer. I really miss my gentle, loving Xian’er!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke up to this point, Shangguan Tianyue began weeping bitterly. Such an age, he was actually crying so bitterly, and he was still coughing out blood at times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I forgive you, I forgive you, I won’t ignore you any longer. Tianyue, don’t scare me.” Tang Xian held onto Shangguan Tianyue tightly, the emotions she had kept bottled up for so long finally exploded out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, Shangguan Bing’er finally broke out of her reverie, and she was just about to charge forward to examine her father’s injuries, but Zhou Weiqing grabbed hold of her.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let go of me.” Shangguan Bing’er said angrily.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Zhou Weiqing just held on tighter, giving her a silencing gesture as he winked at her.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er started momentarily. Although she was extremely worried about her father’s injuries, when she saw Zhou Weiqing’s wink, her mind suddenly cleared up. Indeed! No matter how reckless Little Fatty was, for her sake, he would never hurt her father! Could it be… there was some secret issue?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the time she was thinking, Zhou Weiqing had turned to Shangguan Tianyang. Looking at the sandalwood incense that hadn’t even burned to a half point, he smiled faintly and said: “Uncle, I think there is no need to continue with this competition right? I think I should have the victory.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile also crossed Shangguan Tianyang’s face, and he nodded, saying: “A girl has to marry out of the family eventually, since I have already spoken the words, I will definitely hold up my end of it. Today, let us settle the betrothal matters.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding beside Shangguan Tianyang, Zhan LingTian was unable to say anything to stop it. Looking at Zhou Weiqing, his eyes were filled with disbelief. It was not too long ago when he was far above Zhou Weiqing, and he had felt a strong sense of superiority. Yet… now? Zhou Weiqing was no longer even on the same level as he was.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust the fact he had already reached the Heavenly King stage was shocking enough, but now he had even used his Heavenly King stage powers to defeat a Heavenly Emperor Shangguan Tianyue in actual combat. Although he had also resorted to some trickeries to do so, for example manipulating Shangguan Tianyue into not using his Legendary Set, but the power and strength he had displayed was obvious to everyone’s eyes. What else could he say? Could he even say that he deserved Shangguan Xue’er more?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Zhan LingTian was extremely proud, but his character was honest and upright, a real man. He would not speak out in such a way out of character, and could only sigh inwardly as he lowered his head. He knew he had finally lost forever to this fellow in front of him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon hearing Shangguan Tianyang’s words, he bowed respectfully. “Thank you Uncle for fulfilling our wishes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Tianyang glanced at the couple of Shangguan Tianyue before he said with a sweep of his sleeves. “Come, let us move to another place to speak.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flash of light, under the aid of Shangguan Tianyang, the rest of them disappeared from the drill grounds. Of course, this did not include Shangguan Tianyue and Tang Xian.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they returned to the grand meeting hall, Zhan LingTian did not follow them, instead leaving silently. At this point, there were only the three remaining, Shangguan Tianyang, Zhou Weiqing and Bing’er.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-260-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-261-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-261-01","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
