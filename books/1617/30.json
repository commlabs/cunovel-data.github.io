Faced her father, watched his mouth moving, hearing sounds yet not registering words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men talked of battle, always battle. She expected more from them. More from Alasdair, especially. He was smarter, more level-headed than the rest. The only man in her family who knew how to read. Who was a visionary. A leader of men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered precisely what it was her husband had died for that day, at the battle of Auldearn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been MacColla\u0027s great victory. So great, the bard Iain Lorn MacDonald sang a song to praise him. “Health and joy to the valiant Alasdair,” he\u0027d written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiped her damp palms along her skirts. She should be relieved, she thought. She loved her brother, and he still lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when others slept, and she knew none could hear her in the darkness, Jean wept. She mourned her loss. Resented her brother his warring ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shut her eyes, hearing the men speaking as if from a distance. Her hands were clenched, clammy, the nails that burrowed into her palms the only things that kept her tears at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a hand snake onto her lap. Warm and firm, fingers twined with hers. Giving her a squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnclenching, Jean opened her eyes. Glanced to Scrymgeour, stalwart by her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she knew then that he wasn\u0027t simply biding his time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat he would be by her side to stay, if she wished it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought gave her strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tuned back into Colkitto, who roared on. “Campbell vows to take back this very land Clan Iain Mor so dauntonly only just carved back for ourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u0027Twas Alasdair who did the carving, father,” Jean said quietly. She savored her anger now, and it brought frost to her words. She would will the family to moderation, if it killed her. “And I trust he\u0027ll soon return safe,” she added evenly, “with this Haley in hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColkitto glared at his daughter, silent. Tensing, Scrymgeour eased his hand from hers, nearer to the dirk hanging at his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean shot him a quick, reassuring glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Och,” Colkitto growled. “At ease, lad. My daughter\u0027s in no danger from me. \u0027Tis my son who needs a fair clouting.” His eyes lit at the prospect. He and his sons sparred and tussled at every opportunity, and if Jean knew her father, he\u0027d not miss this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe feared her father was forgetting what he was about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grew old, well past seventy now, but he\u0027d been a warrior in his day and considered himself a warrior still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t his body that worried her. His skin fell slack, but it hung on muscles that remained as firm as bands of iron at his arms. It was his mind that Jean had been spending more time concerned about. His wits weren\u0027t as fast or as fit as they once were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColkitto increasingly spent the days in his cups, bored. Lately she\u0027d had the grim thought that he\u0027d as soon die in battle than spend one more day in their company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve already negotiated surrender of Dunyveg. I\u0027ll not ”-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was before we were born, father. Thirty years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MacDonalds once again hold Dunyve g.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man let out a slow hiss. Not moving his eyes from his daughter, he shouted for his wife. “Mary! More ale!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean finally let herself flinch. Would he not show a little decorum? She stole a look in Scrymgeour\u0027s direction, shame keeping her chin cast low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother glided into the room, and Jean was reminded of what a beauty she\u0027d once been. MacColla was an unusually large man, all her brothers were, and it was a trait they could only have inherited from their mother. Though Colkitto was tall, her mother was almost of a like height, still ramrod straight and strong despite her years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, husband, we\u0027ve ale to hand.” Mary smiled, and Jean was thankful for the elegant nod she gave Scrymgeour as she refilled his cup. “There is no need to bellow like a bull. I\u0027m only just in the other room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to stand behind her husband\u0027s chair and placed a calm hand on his shoulder. “You may fashion yourself a king among men, my love,” she said, taking in the unadorned walls of the humble two -bedroom cottage, “but this home is a far cry from a castle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFace otherwise completely still, her eyes locked on Jean and she gave a sly wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrymgeour stifled a laugh, clearly shocked by Mary\u0027s impertinence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColkitto erupted into laughter, a thunderous sound echoing off the cold, stone walls. Her father had a broad, open-mouthed laugh, revealing teeth yellowed with age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To my Mary!” He lifted his newly filled cup. “Never have I known her to speak with forked tongue.” He craned his head to look up at her. “You\u0027 re as bonny as the day we met, beanag.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a brusque nod before taking a deep pull of ale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you, an duine agam” Mary replied. Reaching down, she took the cup from his lips for a sip. “I find you just as irascible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, we drink now.” Chuckling, Colkitto reached up to pat his wife on the cheek, then turned his attention back to the table. “But soon we fight. The MacDonalds have reclaimed Kintyre, and Campbell will not let it stand. Mark me, he will come at us, with blood on his mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood and more blood. It was time for the fighting to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father\u0027s bitterness grew with each passing day. As acrid as the accursed ale that he could no longer live without.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Alasdair. Her brother was no longer a young man. It was time for him to think on other things. A home. A wife. He had nearly four decades behind him and still no life of his own to speak of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d seemed captivated by that peculiar woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean wrapped her hands around her cup. The metal was cool on her hot skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow of a smile flickered for an instant. Perhaps the stranger named Haley would be just the one to finally turn her brother\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell cut his eyes to the right, discretely studying the man riding beside him. He congratulated himself on a wise decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMajor Nicholas Purdon was a solid soldier. He received orders without question and appeared to relish the slaughtering of papists and fools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell gave the young man a rare smile and urged his horse into a trot. The flat grazing lands skirting the castle was pleasant terrain, and made for an easy approach. A peculiar spot to build a fortress, to say the least. But someone else\u0027s folly was his triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriumph. He allowed himself a smile. Campbell had wanted victory. He\u0027d tried for it with a witch, but he\u0027d finally found it with a soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Purdon at his right and one General Leslie at his left, he had mopped the countryside of MacDonalds. Together they\u0027d chased MacColla and his family into a corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd together they\u0027d slaughtere d MacColla once and for all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re certain he\u0027s dead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye,” Purdon replied, “the big man is dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be true? MacColla, dead. Campbell beamed. No MacDonald was a match for sixteen hundred of his best soldiers. Not even MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Skipness was a rout,” Purdon continued, referring to the battle Campbell\u0027s men had just fought at Skipness Castle, on the upper reaches of the Kintyre peninsula. “\u0027Twas a long siege, but Skipness is yours.” He nodded to the structure looming before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I care not for the castle.” Campbell pulled back on his reins and looked up. Skipness was a stout, rectangular fortress, constructed of red and yellow stone. “A dour pile of rock, is it not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t give the major a chance to answer. He\u0027d noticed a knot of men, studying something on the ground. And then he spotted the black boots, sticking out in an unnatural sprawl on the grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell quickly dismounted, leaving his reins dangling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen surrounded the body, but Campbell could tell by the silhouette that it was a large man who lay dead on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePurdon caught up to him as Campbell muttered gleefully, “I care not for castles, Major, when MacColla\u0027s head is for the taking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so you have it.” Purdon smiled. The throng parted and the soldier gestured to the body with a flourish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You fool.” Campbell\u0027s low curse was a snake\u0027s hiss. “This is not MacColla.” He nudged the man\u0027s head with his boot, turning it side to side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a tall man, with black hair, and MacColla\u0027s arrogant nose. A man who looked like MacColla. “This is his brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well… ” Purdon began, treading very carefully. “Isn\u0027t one son of Coll Ciotach the same as another?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell answered with his silence. His hand went to the sword at his side, and he was gratified to see a few of the men flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe needle-thin steel made a satisfying whistle as he swept his blade diagonally before him. Then, in a single downward stroke, he knelt to plunge the sword in the throat of the dead MacDonald.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood once more, needing to wriggle his blade loose from the soil under the dead man\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last Campbell turned to the major. “No,” he replied. “Not the same. Now you will find MacColla. The real MacColla, and you will kill him. And you will kill his father. And you will kill his woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell gazed to the southwest. Shut his eyes to the sun, low in the sky. MacColla was out there. He\u0027d have traveled further south. He\u0027d be in sight of Ireland, and it would call to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell would catch him before he could answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We head south,” he said, “bleeding the country of MacDonalds as we ride.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch lay naked in the dirt, hands stretched over her head, her body an offering to the moon. She was dimly aware of the brambles and rocks that dug into her skin. Dimly aware of her thirst. But the concerns of her body were not what drove her now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger thrummed through Finola\u0027s veins. She\u0027d depleted herself, doing the Campbell\u0027s dirty work. He\u0027d taken her energy, her time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of all, he\u0027d taken her for granted. Feeding off her with the whimsy of a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t a child\u0027s game he played at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if Campbell didn\u0027t know that yet, she\u0027d be the one to show him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Two \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-30.html","bookId":1617,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM"}
