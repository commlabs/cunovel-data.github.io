But then, he looks like his momma.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus just chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDewayne looked over at me and stopped. His gaze shifted from me to where I knew Amanda and Preston stood behind me. A slow grin stretched across his face. “Hell yeah. This should be a shit ton of fun. Preston, you gonna play nice with Jason?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadie’s eyes went wide, and everyone went quiet. I decided now was a good time to turn and address them and get this over with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda was glaring at Dewayne like she was about to take a swing at him, but Preston had an amused grin on his face. “I always play nice,” Preston said with a lazy drawl that went well with his surfer-boy appearance. “I got no problem with Jason. At least not anymore.” He dropped his arm from around Amanda’s waist, stepped forward, and held out his hand to me. “No hard feelings,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy was hard to dislike. I shook his hand. “Not at all,” I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” he said, stepping back to put his hand back on Amanda. “See, dickhead? We’re all good,” Preston said to Dewayne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDewayne just chuckled and shook his head. “Sure you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, Dewayne, don’t go getting everyone all stirred up. We’re at the Stones’ house,” Marcus said, trying to sound diplomatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDewayne shrugged and glanced back at Marcus. “Just having some fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorway was filled again, this time with the massive brick wall that was Rock. A little girl with a head full of curls ran around his legs, squealing Preston’s name. I turned to see Preston reach down and grab her just as she flung herself into his arms. Rock and his wife, Trisha, had adopted Preston’s little sister and brothers when their mother passed away, making this group of friends even tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I missed you,” the little girl said, planting a loud, smacking kiss on Preston’s cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I missed you, too,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry we’re late,” Rock said. “Trisha is bringing the boys after football practice. I had to go get Daisy. Jess was watching her at the house while we were at the boys’ practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head snapped around at the name Jess. The name of the girl I’d rescued the other night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re letting Jess watch Daisy?” Willow asked, sounding surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRock looked over at her and frowned. “She’s my cousin. I know you aren’t a fan of Jess’s, but she’s good with Daisy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s really not so bad, Low, Amanda piped up. “I know you had a bad experience with her, but Jess is loyal to a fault and she loves those kids.” That made me even more curious. If this was the same Jess who beat the hell out of her boyfriend’s truck, then I could understand Low’s concern. She didn’t seem like the babysitter type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She seems so flighty,” Willow said, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDewayne walked back into the room with a handful of chips. “You’re just worried because Jess had her sexy ass set on Marcus. Don’t mean she’s a bad girl. Just a little misguided at times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda shot an annoyed glare Dewayne’s way. “Don’t bring that up. It’s old news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t, dude.” Marcus’s voice sounded pleading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jess does some things that are not well thought out, and she’s impulsive, but she’s still good with Daisy,” Rock said defensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She bashed in Hank’s truck the other night,” Marcus pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis group had just won my complete and total attention. I couldn’t keep from grinning. I had to rub my hand over my mouth so no one noticed. They were talking about the hot blonde I’d helped escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She did what?” Sadie asked in shocked horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillow sighed and shook her head. “Her on-again, off-again boyfriend was cheating on her, and she took a bat or something and shattered his truck’s windows and apparently got a few dents in the side before she took off running.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreston let out an amused laugh. “Sorry. But it’s funny as hell. Every time I hear it, I can’t stop myself from laughing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRock shook his head. “Crazy girl. Hank had it coming, but I still can’t believe she did it. Although, she’s claiming she didn’t, and the only proof is Hank saying he saw her running and chased her down. Then he says she jumped into a Porsche and took off. That right there is a lie. Ain’t no one in town with a Porsche. Then, when the cops got to her house, her momma said Jess had been with her all day and was in the shower. Cop said the hood of her truck was cool, so he couldn’t argue with Starla.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Jax’s eyes on me, but I didn’t turn around. I could almost hear his thoughts. He knew who owned a Porsche in Sea Breeze—he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Knowing Hank, he was drunk or high. But it sure sounds like something Jess would do. No one else had motive. And we all know Starla probably entertains more than one of the cops in Sea Breeze at Jugs,” Preston said, still amused and grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJugs? What’s Jugs? I didn’t ask. Instead I stayed quiet. Luckily, Jax never mentioned the Porsche that he left parked in the garage here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJESS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had lain low for a week. I was tired of staying at home. Keeping Rock’s little girl, Daisy May, earlier this week had been a fun distraction, but I needed some action. Thinking about Hank and all that wasted time just drove me crazy. It was almost if I was begging to end up like my momma. Not that I didn’t love my momma—I just knew her life was hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, as much as I liked dressing to draw a guy’s attention, I did not ever want to think I had to strip for men to make ends meet. My momma seemed to take it in stride. I just didn’t think I ever could. I liked my body just fine. I just preferred to choose who I took my clothes off for. Balding, fat policemen were not gonna get to pay to see me naked. So help me God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid my feet into my red cowboy boots and tugged my short black leather skirt down until it covered my butt cheeks. Apparently, leather was back in this season. I loved leather, so that made me happy. I reached for one of my Jackdown T-shirts. I was going to go listen to Krit and his band tonight at Live Bay. Krit loved it when I wore one of the band’s shirts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrit had also loved it when I took it off for him. But those days were over. His sister, Trisha, married my cousin. We were family now, even if he preferred to say that didn’t count. Besides, Krit was not gonna be the guy to save me from my momma’s life. He was just like me: born into a low-class situation and trying to find a way out. We also enjoyed trouble just a little too much. The two of us together had proved to be dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMomma had already left for work tonight, so I went to her room to spray a little of her Chanel on my cleavage. She used it sparingly, and I wasn’t supposed to touch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was sure I was ready, I grabbed my truck keys and opened the front door. In my driveway sat a completely loaded black Hummer with dark-tinted windows. Who the hell was that? That wasn’t your average Hummer. It was the kind that was special-ordered. I closed the door behind me and walked down the two cinder block steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver’s door opened, and out stepped Mr. Porsche. In his hand was a baseball bat. Rock’s baseball bat. Oh damn, I’d forgotten it. Smiling in relief because Rock would’ve killed me had I lost it, I walked over to meet him halfway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You forgot something,” he said by way of greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” I replied, taking it from him and sticking it behind my back in case someone drove by and caught me with a baseball bat. That was the last thing I needed after this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I trust you with it? Or should I be available for any escape plans?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Porsche had a dimple in his right cheek. I hadn’t noticed it before. “I think I’m hanging up my bat. Too much trouble,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good to hear. Stories of your truck bashing made it all around town this week,” he said with an amused look. “Since the talk is that your escape vehicle was a Porsche, and no one believes Hank because they’re saying no one has a Porsche around here, I decided I’d better drive something else if I was coming over here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did he know that? Sea Breeze was a small town, but it wasn’t that small. Locals didn’t share that kind of stuff with the summer people. He had to know someone with an in. “Who are you?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My name’s Jason,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason. I didn’t know any Jasons. Other than Jason Condoy, who overdosed last year. I tilted my head and studied him a minute. “So, Jason, who do you know in Sea Breeze? I could have sworn you were right off the island. The Porsche and all gave that away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin grew and his dimple got deeper. I liked that dimple a lot. “My secret,” he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down at his designer clothing and reminded myself that guys like him were so out of my league. I was looking for a local with some potential. That was as good as I was going to get. This guy looked like he would fit in perfectly in Beverly Hills. “Yeah, well, thanks for this and for the other night. I appreciate it,” I said, deciding that prolonging this conversation was pointless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You headed somewhere?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I’m going out. A friend of mine is in a band,” I explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason didn’t make a move to leave. What was he doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re playing at a bar,” I continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You meeting someone there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUm . . . what? Was he actually about to ask to go too? No. I had to be reading this wrong. “Uh, friends will be there, I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But no guy? Or is the friend in the band the guy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was asking me if I had a date. Wow. For the first time in my life I felt at a loss for words. I just stood there, awkwardly staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay. Really. Don’t look so panicked. I’ll see you around,” he said, then turned and started back toward his Hummer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was leaving. I had to say something. “No, wait. I’m not . . . There isn’t a guy. I’m just going to listen to the band and see some friends. If you want to come . . .” I trailed off, still having a hard time believing he wanted to be seen with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and glanced back at me. “You sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! I managed to nod and not act like an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin was back. “I’ll drive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a steadying breath, I walked toward him and realized I still had the baseball bat in my hand. “Oh.” I stopped and held it up. “I need to put this away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can put it in the Hummer until we get back,” he said, walking over to open my door for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a first. No one had ever opened a car door for me. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” I said, looking up at him and deciding that I could get used to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what?” he asked with a confused look on his face. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/misbehaving-sea-breeze-6/page-4.html","bookId":1990,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:43 AM"}
