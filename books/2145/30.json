Matt and Trevor and all the other jocks were off preparing for a pep rally, so I wasn\u0027t going to have to face Trevor. Unfortunately, that was the only thing that madeschool exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hoping you can give the papers to your partners,\" Mrs.Naper said to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sure will,\" Becky said, excited. \"We got an A.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No surprise,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you get?\" Becky asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened Trevor\u0027sDullsvilleHigh School folder and saw the scarlet A next to his name. \"Well, Trevor got an A of course.\" I designed my folder like it was the cover of a gothic magazine, complete with pasted headlines, gothic fashions, and teasers. I opened it and hoped for a good letter in the alphabet. \"So didI !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school, I biked over to Oakley Woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Mitchell answered the door. \"Hello, Raven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Mrs. Mitchell.Is-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was quite a surprise to learn that the European artist was actually Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited. Maybe we had embarrassed her at the auction. It was as if at any moment the Wicked Witch of the West would point her broom at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must say your boyfriend is truly talented. What a wonderful surprise to know that we had such a fine artist among us. It\u0027s a shame he\u0027ll be moving. We\u0027d love to have his work in the auction next year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... thanks, Mrs. Mitchell,\" I said, relieved. \"Is Trevor home? We got our grades back from our English assignment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on in. Trevor\u0027s upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly raced up the main staircase and found Trevor\u0027s bedroom door ajar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tapped it. \"Hello.Soccer Boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have waited in the hallway, but that wouldn\u0027t have been any fun at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor\u0027s room was still a shrine to himself. I nosed around his awards and trophies and framed soccer jerseys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed something large was covered in the corner. Maybe it was a mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuck over to it and pulled back the cloth so I could take a peek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring back at me was me -the final painting of Alexander\u0027s sold at the auction. I was shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the door begin to creak open and quickly recovered the painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" Trevor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... I wanted to tell you we got an A.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just thought you\u0027d like to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else would we have gotten? You\u0027re not used to getting good grades.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had done my duty and there was nothing left to say. I started for the door when he blocked my escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was alone with Trevor in his room-a dangerous place to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything else you\u0027d like to do?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to say,Get that picture back, but I sensed Trevor wanted a stolen kiss-a treasure that was far more valuable than an A..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never let myself succumb to that. Even if I wasn\u0027t dating Alexander, nothing would ever be sacred or special with Trevor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t mention seeing the painting. I was too touched and slightly bothered that he\u0027d spent his money on a picture of me. It was ironic that Trevor would be the one to help Alexander buy back the Mansion and divert his father from his plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be awesome to throw it in his face. But I didn\u0027t dare do that to my partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offered my hand instead. I figured I was safe with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held it like he didn\u0027t want to let it go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis golden hair was perfect against his suntanned face. I knew he wanted to kiss me-and I wasn\u0027t sure whether it was love or lust or just because I was a girl alone in his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know there\u0027s a part of you that wonders what it would be like,\" Trevor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already know,\" I said. \"The cheerleaders have it written on the bathroom walls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI withdrew my hand and left his room before he tried to hold any other part of me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-30.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
