They stabbed out my eyes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoot awake. Start to struggle up from my bed. An arm hits the side of my head. Knocks me down. A man screams, \"My eyes! Who took my eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dervish!\" I roar, rolling off the bed, landing beside the feet of my frantic uncle. \"It\u0027s only a dream! Wake up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My eyes!\" Dervish yells again. I can see his face now, illuminated by a three-quarters full moon. Eyes wide open, but seeing nothing. Fear scribbled into every line of his features. He lifts his right foot. Brings it down towards my head-hard. I make like a turtle and only just avoid having my nose smashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You took them!\" he hisses, sensing my presence, fear turning to hate. He bends and grabs my throat. His fingers tighten. Dervish is thin, doesn\u0027t look like much, but his appearance is deceptive. He could crush my throat, easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swipe at his hand, yanking my neck away at the same time. Break free. Scrabble backwards. Halted by the bed. Dervish lunges after me. I kick at his head, both feet. No time to worry about hurting him. Connect firmly. Drive him back. He grunts, shakes his head, loses focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dervish!\" I shout. \"It\u0027s me, Grubbs! Wake up! It\u0027s only a nightmare! You have to stop before you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The master,\" Dervish cuts in, fear filling his face again. He\u0027s staring at the ceiling-rather, that\u0027s where his eyes are fixed. \"Lord Loss.\" He starts to cry. \"Don\u0027t... please... not again. My eyes. Leave them alone. Please...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dervish,\" I say, softly this time, rising, rubbing the side of my head where he hit me, approaching him cautiously. \"Dervish. Derv the perv-where\u0027s your nerve?\" Knowing from past nights that rhymes draw his attention. \"Derv on the floor-where\u0027s the door? Derv without eyes- what\u0027s the surprise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinks. His head lowers a fraction. Sight returns gradually. His pupils were black holes. Now they look quasi-normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s OK,\" I tell him, moving closer, wary in case the nightmare suddenly fires up again. \"You\u0027re home. With me. Lord Loss can\u0027t get you here. Your eyes are fine. It was just a nightmare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grubbs?\" Dervish wheezes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s really you? You\u0027re not an illusion? He hasn\u0027t created an image of you, to torment me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be stupid. Not even Michelangelo could sculpt a face this perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish smiles. The last of the nightmare passes. He sits on the floor and looks at me through watery globes. \"How you doing, big guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coolio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I hurt you?\" he asks quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t if you tried,\" I smirk, not telling him about the hit to the head, the hand on my throat, the foot at my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit beside him. Drape an arm around his shoulders. He hugs me tight. Murmurs, \"It was so real. I thought I was back there. I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he weeps, sobbing like a child. And I hold him, talking softly as the moon descends, telling him it\u0027s OK, he\u0027s home, he\u0027s safe-he\u0027s no longer in the universe of demons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever trust fairy tales. Any story that ends with \"They all lived happily ever after\" is a crock. There are no happy endings. No endings, full stop. Life goes on. There\u0027s always something new around the corner. You can overcome major obstacles, face great danger, look evil in the eye and live to tell the tale-but that\u0027s not the end. Life sweeps you forward, swings you round, bruises and batters you, drops some new drama or tragedy in your lap, never lets go until you get to the one true end-death. As long as you\u0027re breathing, your story\u0027s still going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the rules of fairy-tales did work, my story would have ended on a high four months ago. That\u0027s when Dervish regained his senses and everything seemed set to return to normal. But that was a false ending. A misleading happy pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to write a short autobiography for an English assignment recently. A snappy, zappy summing-up of my life. I had to discard my first effort-it was too close to the bone, and would have only led to trouble if I\u0027d handed it in. I wrote an edited, watered-down version and submitted that instead. (I got a B minus.) But I kept the original. It\u0027s hidden under a pile of clothes in my wardrobe. I dig it out now to read, to pass some time. I\u0027ve read through it a lot these past few weeks, usually early in the morning, after an interrupted night, when I can\u0027t sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was born Grubitsch Grady. One sister, Gretelda. Grubbs and Gret for short. Normal, boring lives for a long time. Then Gret turned into a werewolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a genetic flaw in my family. Lots of my ancestors have turned into werewolves. It hits in your teens, if you\u0027re one of the unlucky ones. You lose your mind. Your body alters. You become a blood-crazed beast. And spend the rest of your life locked up in a cage-unless your relatives kill you. There\u0027s no cure. Except one. But that can be even worse than the curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee, demons are real. Gross, misshapen, magical beings, with a hatred of humans matched only by their taste for human flesh. They live in their own universe, but some can cross into our world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the Demonata-that\u0027s the proper term-is called Lord Loss. A real charmer. No nose or heart-a hole in his chest full of snakes. Eight arms. Horrible pale red flesh. Loads of cuts on his body from which blood flows in a never-ending stream. He\u0027s big on misery. Feeds off the unhappiness, terror and grief of humans. Moves among us silently when he crosses into our universe, invisible to normal eyes, dropping in on funerals the way you or I would pop into a cafe, dining on our despair, savouring our sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Loss is a powerful demon master. Most masters can\u0027t cross from their universe to ours, but he\u0027s an exception. He has the power to cure Lycanthropy. He can lift the curse from infected Grady teenagers, rid them of their werewolf genes, return them to humanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept, y\u0027know, he\u0027s a demon, so why the hell should he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you reading?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s Dervish, standing in the doorway of my room, mug of coffee in one hand, eyes still wide and freaky from his nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My autobiography,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to publish my memoirs. I\u0027m thinking of Life with Demons as a title. Or maybe Hairy Boys and Girls of the Grady Clan. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish stares at me uneasily. \"You\u0027re weird,\" he mutters, then trudges away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonder where I get that from?\" I retort, then shake my head and return to the autobiography.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily for us, Lord Loss is a chess addict. Chess is the one thing he enjoys almost as much as a weeping human. But he doesn\u0027t get to play very often. None of his demonic buddies know the rules, and humans aren\u0027t inclined to test their skills against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of my more cunning ancestors was Bartholomew Garadex, a magician. (Not a guy who pulls rabbits out of a hat-a full-on, Merlin- and Gandalf-class master of magic.) He figured out a way to cash in on Lord Loss\u0027 love of chess. He challenged the demon master to a series of games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor every match Bartholomew won, Lord Loss would cure a member of the family. If old Bart lost, Lord Loss would get to torture and kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBartholomew won all their matches, but future members of the family-those with a flair for magic who made contact with Lord Loss-weren\u0027t so fortunate. Some triumphed, but most lost. The rules altered over the years. Now, if a parent wants to challenge Lord Loss, they need a partner. The pair face not only the master, but two of his familiars as well. One plays chess with the big guy, while the other battles his servants. If either loses, both are slaughtered, along with the affected teen. If they win, one travels to Lord Loss\u0027 realm and fights him there. The other returns home with the cured kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime works differently in the universe of the Demonata. A year of our time can be a day there, a decade or a century. When the partner goes off with Lord Loss to do battle, their body remains in our world-only their soul crosses over. They become a mindless zombie. And they stay that way unless their soul triumphs. If that happens, their mind returns and they resume their normal life. If they don\u0027t fare so well, they stay a zombie until the day they die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you coming down for breakfast?\" Dervish yells from the bottom of the giant staircase which links the floors of the mansion where we live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a minute!\" I yell back. \"I\u0027ve just come to the bit when you zombied out on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop messing about!\" he roars. \"I\u0027m scrambling eggs and if you\u0027re not down in sixty seconds, too bad!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. He knows all my weaknesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coming!\" I shout, getting up and reaching for my clothes, tossing the bio aside for later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish does a mean scrambled egg. Best I\u0027ve ever tasted. I finish off a plateful without stopping for breath, then eagerly go for seconds. I\u0027m built on the big side-a mammoth compared to most of my schoolmates-with an appetite to match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish is wearing a pair of tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt. No shoes or socks. His grey hair is frizzled, except on top, where he\u0027s bald as a snooker ball. Hasn\u0027t shaved (he used to have a beard, but got rid of it recently). Doesn\u0027t smell good-sweaty and stale. He\u0027s this way most days. Has been ever since he came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You eating that or not?\" I ask. He looks over blankly from where he\u0027s standing, close to the hob. He\u0027s been staring out the window at the grey autumn sky, not touching his food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks down at his plate. Smiles weakly. Sticks his fork into the eggs, stirs them, then gazes out of the window again. \"I remember the nightmare,\" he says. \"They cut my eyes out. They were circling me, tormenting me, using my empty sockets as-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I stop him, \"I\u0027m a kid. I shouldn\u0027t be hearing this. You\u0027ll scar me for life with stories like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish grins, warmth in it this time. \"Take more than a scary story to scar you,\" he grunts, then starts to eat. I help myself to thirds, then return to the autobiography, not needing the sheet of paper to finish, able to recall it perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a younger half-brother, Bill-E Spleen. He doesn\u0027t know we\u0027re brothers. Thinks Dervish is his father. I met him when I came to live with Dervish, after my parents died trying to save Gret. (I spent a while in a loony asylum first.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E and I became friends. I thought he was an oddball, but harmless. Then he changed into a werewolf. Dervish explained the situation to me, told me Bill-E was my brother, laid out the family history and our link to Lord Loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t keen to get involved, but Dervish thought I had what it takes to kick demon ass. I told him he was mad as a moose, but... hell, I don\u0027t want to come across all heroic... but Bill-E was my brother. Mum and Dad put their lives on the line for Gret. I figured I owed Bill-E the same sort of commitment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we faced Lord Loss and his familiars, Artery and Vein, a vicious, bloodthirsty pair. I got the better of Lord Loss at chess, more by luck than plan. The demon master was furious, but rules are rules. So I got to return to reality along with the cured Bill-E. And Dervish won himself a ticket to Demonata hell, to go toe to toe with the big double L on his home turf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure what happened there, how they fought, what sort of a mess Dervish went through, how time passed for him, the manner of his victory over Lord Loss. For more than a year I guarded his body, helped by a team of lawyers (my uncle-he mucho reeeech) and Meera Flame, one of Dervish\u0027s best friends. I went back to school, rebuilt my life and babysat Dervish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, without warning, he returned. I woke up one morning and the zombie was gone. He was his old self talking, laughing, brain intact. We celebrated for days, us, Bill-E and Meera. And we all lived happily after. The end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept, of course, it wasn\u0027t. Life isn\u0027t a fairy tale. Stories don\u0027t end. Before she left, Meera took me aside and warned me to be careful. She said there was no way to predict Dervish\u0027s state of mind. According to the recorded accounts of the few who\u0027d gone through the same ordeal as him, it often took a person a long time to settle after a one-on-one encounter with Lord Loss. Sometimes they never properly recovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on inside his head,\" she whispered. \"He looks fine, but that could change. Watch him, Grubbs. Be prepared for mood-swings. Try and help. Do what you can. But don\u0027t be afraid to call me for help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did call when the nightmares started, when Dervish first attacked me in his sleep, mistook me for a demon and tried to cut my heart out. (Luckily, in his delirium, he picked up a spoon instead of a knife.) But there was nothing Meera could do, short of cast a few calming spells and recommend he visit a psychiatrist. Dervish rejected that idea, but she threatened to take me away from him if he didn\u0027t. So he went to see one, a guy who knew about demons, who Dervish could be honest with. After the second session, the psychiatrist rang Meera and said he never wanted to see Dervish again-he found their sessions too upsetting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeera discussed the possibility of having Dervish committed, or hiring bodyguards to look after him, but I rejected both suggestions. So, against her wishes, we carried on living by ourselves in this spooky old mansion. It hasn\u0027t been too bad. Dervish rarely gets the nightmares more than two or three times a week. I\u0027ve grown used to them. Waking up in the middle of the night to screams is no worse than being disturbed by a baby\u0027s cries. Really it isn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he\u0027s not that much of a threat. We keep the knives locked away and have bolted the other weapons in the mansion-it\u0027s dotted with axes, maces, spears, swords, all sorts of cool stuff-to the walls. I usually keep my door locked too, to be safe. The only reason it was open last night was that Dervish had thrown a fit both nights before and it\u0027s rare for him to fall prey to the nightmares three times in a row. I thought I was safe. That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t bother with the lock. It was my fault, not Dervish\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will kill him for you, master,\" Dervish says softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lower my fork. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns, blank-faced, looking like he did when his soul was fighting Lord Loss. My heart rate quickens. Then he grins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asshole!\" I snap. Dervish has a sick sense of humour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get back to wolfing down my breakfast and Dervish tucks into his, not caring that the scrambled eggs are cold. We\u0027re an odd couple, a big lump of a teenager like me playing nursemaid to a balding, mentally disturbed adult like Dervish. And yeah, there are nights when he really frightens me, when I feel like I can\u0027t take it any more, when I cry. It\u0027s not fair. Dervish fought the good fight and won. That should have been the end of it. Happily ever after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut stories don\u0027t end. They continue as long as you\u0027re alive. You just have to get on with things. Turn the page, start a new chapter, find out what\u0027s in store for you next, and keep your fingers crossed that it\u0027s not too awful. Even if you know in your heart and soul that it most probably will be. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slawter-the-demonata-3/page-1.html","bookId":2177,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:31 PM"}
