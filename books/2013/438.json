To return home.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Home,’ mused Senior Assessor. ‘Your tribe, there to right all your wrongs, to mend all the wounds you delivered in your zealous youth. You will come to them with wizened eyes, with slowed heart and a gentling hand. And one night, as you lie sleeping in your furs in the hut where you were born, someone will slip in and slide a blade across your throat. Because the world within your mind is not the world beyond. You are named Taralack Veed and they have taken of its power. From the name, the face. From the name, the self, and with it all the history, and so by your own power-so freely given away long, long ago-you are slain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed stared, the scimitar trembling in his hands. ‘And this, then, is why you are known only as Senior Assessor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cabalhii shrugged. ‘The Nameless Ones are fools for the most part. Said proof to be found in your presence here, with your Jhag companion. Even so, we share certain understandings, which is not too surprising, since we both came from the same civilization. From the First Empire of Dessimbelackis.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It was a common joke in Seven Cities,’ the Gral said, sneering. ‘One day the sun will die and one day there will be no civil war in the Cabal Isles.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Peace has at long last been won,’ Senior Assessor replied, folding his hands together on his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then why does every conversation I have with you of late make me want to throttle you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cabalhii sighed. ‘Perhaps I have been away from home too long.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrimacing, Taralack Veed slammed the scimitar back in its scabbard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the corridor beyond a door thumped open and the two men in the room stiffened, their gazes meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoft footsteps, passing the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a curse Taralack began strapping on his weapons. Senior Assessor rose, adjusting his robe before heading to the door and opening it just enough to peer outside. Then he ducked back in. ‘He is on his way,’ he said in a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, Taralack joined the monk who opened the door a second time. They went out into the corridor, even as they heard the sound of a momentary scuffle, then a grunt, after which something crunched on the stone floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed in the lead, they padded quickly down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the threshold of the practice yard’s door was a crumpled heap-the guard. From the compound beyond there was a startled shout, a scuffle, then the sound of the outer gate opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed hurried out into the darkness. His mouth was dry. His heart pounded heavy in his chest. Senior Assessor had said that Icarium would not wait. That Icarium was a god and no-one could hold back a god, when it had set out to do what it would do. They will find him gone. Will they search the city? No, they do not even dare unbar the palace gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium? Lifestealer, what do you seek?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill you return to stand before the Emperor and his cursed sword?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monk had told Taralack to be ready, to not sleep this night. And this is why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the gate, stepped over the bodies of two guards, then edged outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd saw him, standing motionless forty paces down the street, in its very centre. A group of four figures, wielding clubs, were converging on him. At ten paces away they halted, then began backing away. Then they whirled about and ran, one of the clubs clattering on the cobbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium stared up at the night sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere to the north, three buildings were burning, reflecting lurid crimson on the bellies of the clouds of smoke seething overhead. Distant screams lifted into the air. Taralack Veed, his breath coming in gasps, drew out his sword. Thugs and murderers might run from Icarium, but that was no assurance that they would do the same for himself and the monk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium lowered his gaze, then looked about, as if only now discovering where he was. Another moment’s pause, then he set out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilent, the Gral and the Cabalhii followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamar Dev licked dry lips. He was lying on his bed, apparently asleep. And come the dawn, he would take his flint sword, strap on his armour, and walk in the midst of Letherii soldiers to the Imperial Arena. And he would walk, alone, out onto the sand, the few hundred onlookers on the marble benches raising desultory hooting and catcalls. There would be no bet-takers, no frenzied shouting of odds. Because this game always ended the same. And now, did anyone even care?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her mind she watched him stride to the centre of the arena. Would he be looking at the Emperor? Studying Rhulad Sengar as he emerged from the far gate? The lightness of his step, the unconscious patterns the sword made at the end of his hands, patterns that whispered of all that muscles and bones had learned and were wont to do? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-438.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
