And he forced himself to inner stillness, opened the eyes of his vision to this moment. Yes - it was still here. Chani\u0027s body lay on a pallet within a ring of light. Someone had straightened her white robe, smoothed it trying to hide the blood from the birth. No matter; he could not turn his awareness from the vision of her face: such a mirror of eternity in the still features!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away, but the vision moved with him. She was gone... never to return. The air, the universe, all vacant - everywhere vacant. Was this the essence of his penance? he wondered. He wanted tears, but they would not come. Had he lived too long a Fremen? This death demanded its moisture!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, a baby cried and was hushed. The sound pulled a curtain on his vision. Paul welcomed the darkness. This is another world, he thought. Two children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought came out of some lost oracular trance. He tried to recapture the timeless mind-dilation of the melange, but awareness fell short. No burst of the future came into this new consciousness. He felt himself rejecting the future - any future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodbye, my Sihaya,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia\u0027s voice, harsh and demanding, came from somewhere behind him. \"I\u0027ve brought Lichna!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul turned. \"That\u0027s not Lichna,\" he said. \"That\u0027s a Face Dancer. Lichna\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But hear what she says,\" Alia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Paul moved toward his sister\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not surprised to find you alive, Atreides.\" The voice was like Lichna\u0027s, but with subtle differences, as though the speaker used Lichna\u0027s vocal cords, but no longer bothered to control them sufficiently. Paul found himself struck by an odd note of honesty in the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not surprised?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Scytale, a Tleilaxu of the Face Dancers, and I would know a thing before we bargain. Is that a ghola I see behind you, or Duncan Idaho?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Duncan Idaho,\" Paul said. \"And I will not bargain with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ll bargain,\" Scytale said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan,\" Paul said, speaking over his shoulder, \"will you kill this Tleilaxu if I ask it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, m\u0027Lord.\" There was the suppressed rage of a berserker in Idaho\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" Alia said. \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re rejecting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I do know,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s truly Duncan Idaho of the Atreides,\" Scytale said. \"We found the lever! A ghola can regain his past.\" Paul heard footsteps. Someone brushed past him on the left. Scytale\u0027s voice came from behind him now. \"What do you remember of your past, Duncan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything. From my childhood on. I even remember you at the tank when they removed me from it,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful,\" Scytale breathed. \"Wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul heard the voice moving. I need a vision, he thought. Darkness frustrated him. Bene Gesserit training warned him of terrifying menace in Scytale, yet the creature remained a voice, a shadow of movement - entirely beyond him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are these the Atreides babies?\" Scytale asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harah!\" Paul cried. \"Get her away from there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay where you are!\" Scytale shouted. \"All of you! I warn you, a Face Dancer can move faster than you suspect. My knife can have both these lives before you touch me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul felt someone touch his right arm, then move off to the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s far enough, Alia,\" Scytale said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alia,\" Paul said. \"Don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my fault,\" Alia groaned. \"My fault!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Atreides,\" Scytale said, \"shall we bargain now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, Paul heard a single hoarse curse. His throat constricted at the suppressed violence in Idaho\u0027s voice. Idaho must not break! Scytale would kill the babies!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To strike a bargain, one requires a thing to sell,\" Scytale said. \"Not so, Atreides? Will you have your Chani back? We can restore her to you. A ghola, Atreides. A ghola with full memory! But we must hurry. Call your friends to bring a cryologic tank to preserve the flesh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo hear Chani\u0027s voice once more, Paul thought. To feel her presence beside me. Ahhh, that\u0027s why they gave me Idaho as a ghola, to let me discover how much the re-creation is like the original. But now - full restoration... at their price. I\u0027d be a Tleilaxu tool forevermore. And Chani... chained to the same fate by a threat to our children, exposed once more to the Qizarate\u0027s plotting...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What pressures would you use to restore Chani\u0027s memory to her?\" Paul asked, fighting to keep his voice calm. \"Would you condition her to... to kill one of her own children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We use whatever pressures we need,\" Scytale said. \"What say you, Atreides?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alia,\" Paul said, \"bargain with this thing. I cannot bargain with what I cannot see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wise choice,\" Scytale gloated. \"Well, Alia, what do you offer me as your brother\u0027s agent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul lowered his head, bringing himself to stillness within stillness. He\u0027d glimpsed something just then - like a vision, but not a vision. It had been a knife close to him. There!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a moment to think,\" Alia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My knife is patient,\" Scytale said, \"but Chani\u0027s flesh is not. Take a reasonable amount of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul felt himself blinking. It could not be... but it was! He felt eyes! Their vantage point was odd and they moved in an erratic way. There! The knife swam into his view. With a breath-stilling shock, Paul recognized the viewpoint. It was that of one of his children! He was seeing Scytale\u0027s knife hand from within the creche! It glittered only inches from him. Yes - and he could see himself across the room, as well - head down, standing quietly, a figure of no menace, ignored by the others in this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To begin, you might assign us all your CHOAM holdings,\" Scytale suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of them?\" Alia protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching himself through the eyes in the creche, Paul slipped his crysknife from its belt sheath. The movement produced a strange sensation of duality. He measured the distance, the angle. There\u0027d be no second chance. He prepared his body then in the Bene Gesserit way, armed himself like a cocked spring for a single concentrated movement, a prajna thing requiring all his muscles balanced in one exquisite unity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crysknife leaped from his hand. The milky blur of it flashed into Scytale\u0027s right eye, jerked the Face Dancer\u0027s head back. Scytale threw both hands up and staggered backward against the wall. His knife clattered off the ceiling, to hit the floor. Scytale rebounded from the wall; he fell face forward, dead before he touched the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill through the eyes in the creche, Paul watched the faces in the room turn toward his eyeless figure, read the combined shock. Then Alia rushed to the creche, bent over it and hid the view from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they\u0027re safe,\" Alia said. \"They\u0027re safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"M\u0027Lord,\" Idaho whispered, \"was that part of your vision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He waved a hand in Idaho\u0027s direction. \"Let it be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me, Paul,\" Alia said. \"But when that creature said they could... revive... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are some prices an Atreides cannot pay,\" Paul said. \"You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she sighed. \"But I was tempted... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was not tempted?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away from them, groped his way to a wall, leaned against it and tried to understand what he had done. How? How? The eyes in the creche! He felt poised on the brink of terrifying revelation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My eyes, father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word-shapings shimmered before his sightless vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My son!\" Paul whispered, too low for any to hear. \"You\u0027re... aware.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, father. Look!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul sagged against the wall in a spasm of dizziness. He felt that he\u0027d been upended and drained. His own life whipped past him. He saw his father. He was his father. And the grandfather, and the grandfathers before that. His awareness tumbled through a mind-shattering corridor of his whole male line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" he asked silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaint word-shapings appeared, faded and were gone, as though the strain was too great. Paul wiped saliva from the corner of his mouth. He remembered the awakening of Alia in the Lady Jessica\u0027s womb. But there had been no Water of Life, no overdose of melange this time... or had there? Had Chani\u0027s hunger been for that? Or was this somehow the genetic product of his line, foreseen by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul felt himself in the creche then, with Alia cooing over him. Her hands soothed him. Her face loomed, a giant thing directly over him. She turned him then and he saw his creche companion - a girl with that bony-ribbed look of strength which came from a desert heritage. She had a full head of tawny red hair. As he stared, she opened her eyes. Those eyes! Chani peered out of her eyes... and the Lady Jessica. A multitude peered out of those eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at that,\" Alia said. \"They\u0027re staring at each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Babies can\u0027t focus at this age,\" Harah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could,\" Alia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Paul felt himself being disengaged from that endless awareness. He was back at his own wailing wall then, leaning against it. Idaho shook his shoulder gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"M\u0027Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let my son be called Leto for my father,\" Paul said, straightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the time of naming,\" Harah said, \"I will stand beside you as a friend of the mother and give that name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my daughter,\" Paul said. \"Let her be called Ghanima.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Usul!\" Harah objected. \"Ghanima\u0027s an ill-omened name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It saved your life,\" Paul said. \"What matter that Alia made fun of you with that name? My daughter is Ghanima, a spoil of war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul heard wheels squeak behind him then - the pallet with Chani\u0027s body being moved. The chant of the Water Rite began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hal yawm!\" Harah said. \"I must leave now if I am to be the observer of the holy truth and stand beside my friend for the last time. Her water belongs to the tribe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her water belongs to the tribe,\" Paul murmured. He heard Harah leave. He groped outward and found Idaho\u0027s sleeve. \"Take me to my quarters, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside his quarters, he shook himself free gently. It was a time to be alone. But before Idaho could leave there was a disturbance at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master!\" It was Bijaz calling from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan,\" Paul said, \"let him come two paces forward. Kill him if he comes farther.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ayyah,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan is it?\" Bijaz asked. \"Is it truly Duncan Idaho?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" Idaho said. \"I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then Scytale\u0027s plan succeeded!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scytale is dead,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I am not and the plan is not,\" Bijaz said. \"By the tank in which I grew! It can be done! I shall have my pasts - all of them. It needs only the right trigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trigger?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The compulsion to kill you,\" Idaho said, rage thick in his voice. \"Mentat computation: They found that I thought of you as the son I never had. Rather than slay you, the true Duncan Idaho would take over the ghola body. But... it might have failed. Tell me, dwarf, if your plan had failed, if I\u0027d killed him, what then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... then we\u0027d have bargained with the sister to save her brother. But this way the bargaining is better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul took a shuddering breath. He could hear the mourners moving down the last passage now toward the deep rooms and the water stills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not too late, m\u0027Lord,\" Bijaz said. \"Will you have your love back? We can restore her to you. A ghola, yes. But now - we hold out the full restoration. Shall we summon servants with a cryological tank, preserve the flesh of your beloved... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was harder now, Paul found. He had exhausted his powers in the first Tleilaxu temptation. And now all that was for nothing! To feel Chani\u0027s presence once more...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silence him,\" Paul told Idaho, speaking in Atreides battle tongue. He heard Idaho move toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master!\" Bijaz squeaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you love me,\" Paul said, still in battle tongue, \"do me this favor: Kill him before I succumb!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noooooo... \" Bijaz screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound stopped abruptly with a frightened grunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did him the kindness,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul bent his head, listening. He no longer could hear the mourners. He thought of the ancient Fremen rite being performed now deep in the sietch, far down in the room of the death-still where the tribe recovered its water. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dune-messiah-dune-chronicles-2/page-25.html","bookId":2154,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:19 PM"}
