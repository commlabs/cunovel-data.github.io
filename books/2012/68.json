Sister Calm and Sister Equity, we cannot discount the possibility of those in the keep simply leaving the way they came, should matters prove too precipitous. In which case, when and where will they reappear?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A valid point,’ said Diligence. ‘For as long as they are held in place, they are no threat to us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Even so,’ countered Calm, ‘your presence and command of our besieging army will ensure that you can respond to anything unexpected. There will come a time – there must come a time – when it is expedient to drive them from the keep and, if possible, annihilate them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed there will,’ agreed Reverence. ‘But as Brother Abide has noted before, we are not yet certain that we have accounted for all the threats assembling against us.’ She gestured. ‘The Great Spire, the Altar of Judgement, this is where we remain the most vulnerable. Diligence in command of the Spire Army ensures the Spire and the Heart hold inviolate.’ She paused, fixed her single eye upon Sister Calm. ‘Our remaining Pures command the outlying armies inland. Do you suggest that, in the end, they shall prove unequal to the task? Sister Belie? Sister Freedom? Brothers Grave, Serenity and Aloft? Which of them falters in your regard?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalm glanced away. ‘I hold that it is best to eliminate each threat as it arises, Sister Reverence.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverence frowned. ‘And should the enemy in the keep vanish as mysteriously as it arrived? Only to, perhaps, reappear here, at the very foot of the Great Spire? With Brother Diligence stranded at the far end of Estobanse Valley? What then?’ she asked. Yes, best we argue here, alone, beyond the hearing of our Watered and Shriven servants . She resumed, this time taking in all the others. ‘All of Kolanse has been cleansed – how could we have done otherwise, when, upon reaching these shores, we witnessed the terrible damage done to this land? Estobanse remains, because for the moment we require that it do so. To feed the Shriven and Watered. When the Heart is sacrificed upon this altar, brothers and sisters, even our need for human armies will be at an end. The end of the human world begins here – we must protect this place above all others, even Estobanse. Do any of you deny this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverence met Calm’s gaze. ‘Sister Calm, in the name of your ancestors, patience.’ At that there was finally a response. Calm’s face tightened, and she rocked as if struck. Satisfied, Reverence blithely continued. ‘All that is required is in motion, even as we speak. There will be rain before the storm. There must be. I ask that you set out once more, upon the dead lands, that you be our eyes so set as to forewarn us should any threat emerge from an unexpected quarter.’ She gestured. ‘Indeed, take Sister Equity with you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sound tactic,’ said Brother Diligence, with a dry smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalm bowed stiffly. ‘As you wish, Sister Reverence.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching something avid in the younger woman’s eyes, Reverence frowned, suddenly uneasy. Ah, have I been anticipated here? Have I stepped blind into a trap? You wish to be sent out into the Wastes, Calm. Why? What am I unleashing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Our disposition, Sister Reverence?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, she nodded. ‘As you desire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sister Equity shall take the south lands, then, while I journey into the west.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain? And what did you do there the first time out? What did you find? ‘Very well,’ Reverence said. ‘Now, we stand upon the Altar of Judgement, once more united in our endeavours. With humility—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Blessed Pures!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shout came from the edge of the stairs, and they turned to see Watered Amiss, his face flame-flashed with exertion. They had left him at the Third Landing, against the eastern flank of the Spire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverence strode towards him. ‘Brother, what word do you bring us with such haste?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stumbled on to the altar and pointed to the east. ‘Blessed Pures! In the harbour – ships ! Many, many ships!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverence noted the alarm and consternation in the faces of her kin, and felt a surge of satisfaction. Yes, unseen threats assail you all now . ‘Brother Diligence, assemble the Defenders and awaken our warren in the Watered sub-commanders. Akhrast Korvalain shall be our bristling wall this day.’ And Sister Reverence? Ah, well, perhaps she will be the Gate .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalm and Equity had rushed to the eastern edge of the altar. Both stared for a moment before Equity turned round. ‘Ships of war, kin. Grey as wolves upon the water.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-68.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
