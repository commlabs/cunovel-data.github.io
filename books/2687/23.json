I want to be what you need, Cam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced himself from the temptation of her pliant body only long enough to grab the bottle of oil. His hand shook as he poured the golden liquid into his cupped palm and coated his cock and his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heels rested against the wooden footboard and he tapped her butt as a signal to lift her hips and he placed a pillow beneath her. The long expanse of her belly tempted him to lick and kiss until he reached those sweet, tasty little breasts. As he sucked on a peaked nipple, he lightly circled her anus. He worked his middle finger in a little at a time until it was imbedded to the webbing of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tense up, relax those muscles. There, just like that.” Cam knew it’d take more than just one finger to prepare her, so he slipped another finger inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught Domini’s gasp of surprise in a hungry kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squirmed as he scissored his fingers. Curling, twisting and stroking inside that tight channel, pushing her toward the sharp bite of pain that would turn into pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam slipped his fingers from her loosened hole and nipped at her bottom lip. He stood, hoping like hell he didn’t look as unsteady on his feet as he felt. Goddamn he wanted this from her. Needed it. He circled her ankles in his hands and positioned her feet on either side of his shoulders. He stepped between her thighs, poising his cockhead at that enticing pucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomini frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swept his hand across her belly. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought we’d do this…from behind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. As you’ve pointed out, we’ve done it from behind enough times. I want to see your face as I’m taking you this way. I want to touch your clit when I’m buried balls deep in your ass.” Cam pressed the tip to the rosette and slid his hand beneath her butt cheeks, opening her ass fully. He pushed until the head of his cock disappeared inside the first ring of muscle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomini hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Breathe out, princess, come on, lemme make you feel good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It burns.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing slow wouldn’t make a difference now, so he shoved until his cock was lodged completely inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh fuck. She was so tight. And hot. And tight. And goddamn he had the urge to rut on her. Slam into that vise-like heat. Feel that snug channel gripping his cock as he eased out slowly, so she felt every inch scraping against those tight tissues. Then he’d ram back in over and over. Hard and fast and deep. Relishing the loud slapping of his balls as he fucked her until she screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGritting his teeth, he held off on that raunchy scenario, allowing her untried channel to adjust around his impatient dick. Once he’d controlled his urge to pound into her without mercy, he glanced at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer chest rose and fell rapidly. Her eyes were closed and her teeth were biting into her bottom lip so hard he expected to see blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Domini. Look at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Touch me. I want your hands on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you lean closer will that put too much pressure on your leg?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeg? What leg? Cam froze. For the first time, he’d forgotten about his stump. He’d forgotten he wore a prosthesis. He’d forgotten to be self-conscious. He was so lost in her and all she brought to him he’d simply…forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did this for him. To him. Domini made the world melt away. His vision wavered at the sudden rush of emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cam? You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze zoomed to hers. Hell. He sure as fuck hoped she hadn’t seen him tear up. During sex. Yeah. That’d be sexy as shit. Bawling on her. While he fucked her in the ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat actually brought a smile to his face. Cam angled his head and kissed the inside of her left ankle, and then he kissed the right. He slid her feet down his biceps until they were braced in the crooks of his arms. He eased out, feeling the sphincter muscle surround just the fat head of his cock. He leaned forward and thrust into her ass to the hilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomini gasped, pressing her palms against his pectorals, as if trying to push him back. “Dammit, Cam, I wasn’t ready for that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped his hand between their bodies and murmured, “Sorry, baby. Lemme make it up to you.” He stroked her clit in the lazy way he’d discovered she liked best. “Better?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam let the natural rhythm of their bodies take over. He flicked her clit with each thrust into her ass; she raked her nails down his chest, grinding her pussy into his groin on every upstroke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat tight tingling in his balls indicated he couldn’t last much longer. When the buzzing sensation brushed his fingers, his eyes flipped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomini positioned the vibrator directly over her clit. “Let me see you lose that last bit of control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he did. He hammered into her without caution, without finesse, his head thrown back, sweat trickled down his throat and not into his eyes. Almost there. Almost…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContractions from her orgasm tightened her cunt muscles with enough force he felt them in her bowels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holy fuck.” Cam shoved into her ass and went still. He groaned, hell, he howled when those rigid anal muscles clamped his cock and milked every drop of seed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bunch of nonsensical words filled the air and then she flopped back on the mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam slipped out of her ass and pressed his lips to her throat. “You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm. Tired. Worn out.” She cracked an eye open. “Sore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll refrain from swatting your ass tomorrow night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swatting? I don’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not into spanking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you ever tried it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Have you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. There’s something sexy about seeing a handprint—my handprint—on your ass. Then the skin feels hot to the touch. Just think how good my tongue would feel cooling you down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What would you do if I demanded you let me spank you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes held a rare challenge. “I’d let you…but I’d demand equal time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll keep that in mind. In fact, the thought of you smacking my ass turns me on. Everything about you turns me on, princess.” He nuzzled her hairline and just breathed her in. “Stay put. I’ll get stuff to clean up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomini stretched with that sated, smug expression of a well-fucked woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeh heh. His well-fucked woman. If he had that cock-of-the-walk swagger, he’d earned it. About damn time too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam washed up in the bathroom before he dressed. He brought a warm washcloth and teased Domini with flirty kisses as he swabbed between her legs. He tucked her between the sheets, wondering if she’d have regrets about his rough behavior when she noticed the finger-shaped bruises on her thighs tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm-hmm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her forehead. “I must’ve done something right, because you were babbling in Ukrainian when you came that last time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at him sleepily. “I wish you could stay with me tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another time. Can I make it up to you tomorrow night? By taking you to supper? Someplace besides Dewey’s?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or I could cook for us here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Princess, we’d just end up in bed. And I don’t see how you cooking for me is a night off for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you asking me on a date, Deputy McKay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I guess I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat skeptical look returned to her icy blue eyes. “Why? You promised me this wouldn’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just say no if you don’t wanna have supper with me tomorrow night, Domini.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to say no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Then I’ll pick you up at six.” He kissed her softly and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eleven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going out with him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Nadia had a right to judge her on men. Domini sighed quietly. “Cameron McKay is a good man, Nadia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s also police,” Nadia retorted, reverting to Russian in case Anton was listening. “Don’t you remember what they’re capable of?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomini absentmindedly rubbed her shoulder where the German shepherd had taken his pound of flesh. “It’s not the same. He’s nothing like the men who were terrorizing and brutalizing innocents.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia muttered in Bosnian. Domini understood enough to realize she’d been called a fool. She let it slide and changed the subject. “So Anton likes school?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Being with kids his own age is better for him than being with the so-called ‘babies’ at Sky Blue daycare this summer.” Nadia smiled at Anton over her shoulder. “He wishes he could ride the bus home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is he making friends?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “He doesn’t say. He is disappointed he isn’t hanging out with you tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry I can’t watch him and you had to cancel.” Why had Rex insisted Nadia cancel their date? Wouldn’t he encourage Nadia to bring his son along? Even one time? Especially if he was serious about making them a family again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of Rex living in the same house with Nadia and Anton turned Domini’s stomach. She knew what Rex used to do to Nadia. She saw what he’d done to Anton and how that beating had finally forced Nadia into leaving the man for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr so she’d thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry too. Anton likes coming here. You spoil him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpending time with Anton didn’t equal spoiled in her book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton raced into the kitchen. “Any cookies left?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. You ate them all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s time to go home anyway. Get your stuff,” Nadia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we just got here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Domini has a life, Anton, don’t whine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chin fell to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” Domini tugged him until he was sitting on her lap. “You are part of my life too. You’ll see me again soon.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shoulda-been-a-cowboy-rough-riders-7/page-23.html","bookId":2687,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:55 AM"}
