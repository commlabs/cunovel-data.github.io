And I told him that\u0027s it, the well just ran dry. Next time you\u0027re in trouble, call somebody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"When was your mother\u0027s funeral? Two weeks ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He seemed the same as always. A little subdued, given the occasion, but not like somebody with this hanging over his head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was before his boss figured out what was going on. Andy never expects trouble until he\u0027s in it. So he was feeling fine, and then he got back to Tucson and the roof fell in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he called you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. Day before yesterday. I sat around all day trying to figure out what to tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you talk about it with June?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I called him and told him what I told you I told him, and I said he should call you for the other half of the money. And he said he didn\u0027t want to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re calling on his behalf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he didn\u0027t want me to call you. But I\u0027m calling you anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do you want me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do. You want me to kick in the other half.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even know if that\u0027s true,\" he said. \"Maybe that\u0027s what I want. Or maybe I want you to turn him down, so that I\u0027m not the only one turning him down, you know? I don\u0027t want my brother to go to jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or be- what was the phrase you used? A fugitive from justice? I don\u0027t want that either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Mike, can\u0027t he sell something? Didn\u0027t you say he just bought a new car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"He owed more on the old car than it was worth. He used a few thousand dollars of what he stole to swing a down payment. Now the old car\u0027s paid off and he owes more on the new car than it\u0027s worth, so he\u0027s got no equity in it whatsoever. If he sold everything he owns, he could maybe scrape up a thousand dollars. If that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A real American success story. I suppose he\u0027s run out of friends to borrow from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know Andy. He makes friends real easy. Then he throws \u0027em away and gets new ones. What do you want to do? I don\u0027t even know what your financial situation is. Could you come up with five thousand dollars in a hurry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could,\" I said. \"I want to sleep on it, Michael. How about if I call you tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow\u0027s okay,\" he said. \"He\u0027s got until the end of the month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d told him I wanted to sleep on it, but I didn\u0027t get all that much sleep. Elaine and I were up talking until late, and when she got up around seven she found me in the kitchen with a pot of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the money,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except in a funny way it is. The amount\u0027s a factor. If it was five hundred dollars, I\u0027d write out a check and put it in the mail. I wouldn\u0027t have to think twice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if it was fifty thousand dollars, well, I still wouldn\u0027t have to think twice, because it would be out of the question. But five thousand\u0027s right in the middle, small enough to manage but big enough to notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can afford it, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know we can afford it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wouldn\u0027t have to liquidate assets, or tighten our belts. We\u0027ve got it in the bank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then again, you just said it. It\u0027s not the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank some coffee. I said, \"He\u0027s the one that looks like me, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael takes after his mother. He\u0027s heavyset, too, like the men in her family. Andy looks like his father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could do worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he drinks like his old man, too. I wonder how many DUIs he\u0027s had, how many cars he\u0027s cracked up. I don\u0027t know what the hell I should do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe poured herself some coffee, sat down across the table from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he had to take after me,\" I said, \"it\u0027s a shame he didn\u0027t go all the way and get on the cops. Then he could steal with both hands and not worry about the consequences.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were never a thief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I took money that wasn\u0027t mine. I generally found a justification for it, but people generally do. Look at Andy. He was just borrowing it, he was going to pay it back. You know, all I do is keep going around in circles. I don\u0027t want him rotting in an Arizona jail, and I don\u0027t want to buy his way out of it, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s tricky,\" she said. \"But it\u0027s your call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if it were yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s hard,\" she said, \"because it\u0027s not, and it shouldn\u0027t be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would they tell you at Al-Anon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to be an enabler,\" she said without hesitation. \"That I\u0027d be doing him no favor by getting him out of a jam. That all I\u0027d really achieve would be to keep him from getting the lesson. That he\u0027d never be able to change his behavior until he experiences the consequences of it. That, wherever he was supposed to go, he\u0027d get there faster without my help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So there\u0027s your answer. You wouldn\u0027t send him the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027d send it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would? You just said- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what I said. But there\u0027s another principle, and that\u0027s that every dog gets one bite. He may have done this before, but this is the first time he\u0027s come to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t come to me. He told his brother- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told his brother not to call you, but at the same time he put his brother in a position where he had to call you. So in that sense he came to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you would send him the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027d tell him it was the last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll fuck up again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And next time you\u0027d turn him down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"No matter what. Whether he\u0027d go to jail or get his legs broken, I\u0027d turn him down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this time you\u0027d send the money.\" I drank some more coffee and said, \"You know, I think you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m right for me. What\u0027s right for me isn\u0027t necessarily right for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This time it is. I\u0027ll call Michael.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not just then; it was, as she pointed out, four in the morning in California. I didn\u0027t ask her what time it was in Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was relieved to have the decision made, but I felt less sanguine about the whole business as the morning wore on. My mind kept fussing with it like a kitten with a ball of yarn, and I had to remind myself over and over that I\u0027d made up my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was forever checking my watch, wishing it was time to make the call, anxious to get it over with. But I kept putting it off, first reluctant to chance waking him, then deciding against calling while they were at breakfast. It evidently wasn\u0027t something he wanted June to know about, so why make him take the call in another room? I could wait and reach him at the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT J came up around eleven, wearing khakis and a polo shirt but carrying yesterday\u0027s clipboard. He\u0027d made notes on his trip to Williamsburg and went over them with me. The house was a three-story brick rowhouse sheathed thirty or forty years ago in garish asphalt siding. \"Musta been some salesman,\" he said, \" \u0027cause everybody on the block went for it. Made it a real Neighborhood Uglification project.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe siding had been stripped from the lower two floors at 168 Meserole, and they were working on the top floor. The brick underneath was going to need repointing, and a good deal of repair work, but even in its present state it looked better than what had covered it. They were doing a similar kind of work inside, deleting the improvements of previous owners and tenants, tearing out the partitions that had divided the original floor-through apartments into smaller units, pulling off the pressboard paneling and dropped-ceiling tiles, taking up the worn linoleum. The plaster was scheduled for removal from the exterior walls, to expose the brick. The three apartments would be loftlike open-plan layouts, but some half-walls were planned, to hold bookshelves and display paintings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be nice when they finish it,\" he said. \"They artists, so they need their work space. They all workin\u0027 together. Time I got there, Peter was down on the first floor, scrapin\u0027 ugly wallpaper off one wall they fixin\u0027 to keep, an\u0027 two of the others was up in Peter\u0027s place on the third floor, workin\u0027 on the brick. They got these little masks over their mouths an\u0027 noses, keep the dust out of their lungs, an\u0027 they got plaster dust coverin\u0027 the rest of them. Looked pretty comical, but I figured a buildings inspector be seein\u0027 that all the time, so I held back and didn\u0027t laugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter had the third floor to himself, he said, and he wondered if they\u0027d put him up there because they figured he needed the exercise. He was fat, no question, but it didn\u0027t seem to slow him down any. He went up and down the stairs without getting out of breath, and he didn\u0027t have that apologetic manner that so many fat people seemed to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see him,\" he said, \"and you say to yourself, man, this is one fat dude. You around him a little while, an\u0027 what happens is you forget he\u0027s fat. It slips your mind. And then later on, like, you spendin\u0027 time with one of the others an\u0027 then you see Peter again, and you\u0027re like, Damn, he\u0027s fat! Like you never noticed it before, \u0027cept you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what he meant. I\u0027d observed the same phenomenon with several other people, not all of them overweight. One is blind, for example, another missing an arm. The common denominator, I think, is self-acceptance, and the result is as he described it. Because they accept it, whatever it is, you stop noticing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Meredith\u0027s therapist may not have been able to save his client\u0027s relationship with Kristin, or to trim him down to a size 42, but it sounded as though he could claim a certain degree of success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarsha Kittredge and Lucian Bemis had the second floor. She was a blond Wasp princess from Beaufort, South Carolina, and he was a tall gaunt black man from South Philadelphia. She was a painter, he a sculptor, and T J had decided that, once upon a time, her great-grandfather had owned his great-grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground floor\u0027s occupants were Ruth Ann Lipinsky, another painter, the only native New Yorker in the group, short and dark and intense, and Kieran Eklund, a painter and printmaker, who\u0027d been doing something unspecified in Manhattan during T J\u0027s visit. T J\u0027d thought he might stick around until Eklund got back, so he could get a look at him, but it turned out the others were going to meet Eklund in the city. They\u0027d been anxious to clean up and get out of there, which may have prompted Peter Meredith to give T J a hundred-dollar handshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Made me suspicious,\" he said. \"Man gives you money, you got to figure it\u0027s so you\u0027ll look the other way. Started to wonder what I wasn\u0027t meant to see. Then I remembered who I supposed to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A city employee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You right, Dwight. Man in my position, they got to pay you even if they ain\u0027t done nothin\u0027 wrong.\" He sighed. \"Good business to be in,\" he said, \"if only the uniforms wasn\u0027t so lame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally picked up the phone and called him, Michael was in the car, on his way to a client. \"I\u0027ll make the check out to you,\" I said, \"and put it in the mail this afternoon. For five thousand dollars. You write your own check to him, or better yet- \" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-25.html","bookId":2333,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM"}
