The Spear of Osiris from The Mummy was displayed within it. It wasn’t a limited item in God’s Realm, with even Zheng having one. Anyone who went through the movie would have a certain chance of obtaining the weapon. However, no one would expect it was the spear that could pierce through the soul and body, the Spear of Longinus. \u003csup\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Correct.

The Saints and Alchemists were afraid of their ruins being forgotten, or the item not being recoverable after the ruins were found. That’s why so many were made. Perhaps, the spear that pierced Christ in history was one that circulated from the realm.

At this point, Adam frankly didn’t care if they could discern his intentions. They couldn\u0027t stop him even if they guessed it. The Human Instrumentality Project needed enough time to adapt to the surroundings and those it would absorb. This was its greatest flaw. Compared to that, obtaining the Spear of Osiris or the user needing to be the fourth stage in strength wasn’t as important.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eAt the same time, this Human Instrumentality Project was something definitely terrifying as the ultimate creation of the white race. It was unstoppable after it began, apart from the initial beginning where enough ‘nutrients’ needed to be absorbed. It would be like the chain reaction between atoms in nuclear fission for the rest of the time. All lifeforms would become a part of this singular ‘Human’, from as small as germs and viruses, to as great as fourth stagers or even fifth stagers. Even having Light of the Soul far stronger than the one undergoing the Human Instrumentality Project wouldn\u0027t stop it. It would only swap out the one undergoing it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThis was the greatest weakness of Adam himself. He couldn\u0027t directly use the Human Instrumentality Project on the strongest like Zheng and his clone, or else he would become someone else’s nutrients and disappear. That was why he had to carefully first absorb the Light of the Soul from large quantities of weaker lifeforms. He could only face the apex of the realm after strengthening himself to a great magnitude. Song Tian and the Angel Alliance were the best prey for him. When the merge began, the absorption of these people would be amazingly easy as long as he let the Tree of Life familiarise itself with these people’s Light of the Soul and allowed it to slowly erode their Light of the Soul. Even if Song Tian was slightly stronger than him, it wouldn\u0027t affect him being the dominant one. That was why it was necessary to slowly wait in the early stages, f\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eor that final victory and Instrumentality!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eAdam continuously searched for clues from the scan as he fiddled with the magic formation. The missile’s explosion was too strange. It was definite that there was no warhead. If this warheadless missile was just to draw out the Angel Alliance’s latent power, wouldn\u0027t one with a warhead be easier? One missile was useless as well. If they fired over a hundred of them, some with warheads and some without, that would be much more threatening. In other words, something was definitely hidden within that missile.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e(There’s a sixty percent chance this missile has something hidden.

He muttered to Song Tian who was besides him, “Should I thank Xuan? The two Xuans didn\u0027t personally come to deal with me, but deployed their teams’ members to die and increase my power. I really do have to thank him. But this does make me feel slightly regretful. As someone who’s always considered him as my opponent, it seems he doesn\u0027t treat me as an opponent who can equal him even at the very end. It’s always about maximising benefits with him. He cares not one whit about the beauty in a battle of wits or a collision of schemes. He doesn\u0027t have an aesthetic bone in his body. I’ll be delighted to research how he escapes danger and reverses defeat into victory if he falls into my hands. If I landed in his hands, he’ll absolutely take out his gun and immediately shoot me dead.

I’m about to stand on the same level as Chu Xuan. No, it’s one far, far surpassing where he stands now. After Instrumentality, I’ll become a god, and he’ll no longer be able to call me a ‘mortal’s wisdom’. I really am weak.

When Adam was done, he said, “Walk down this path resolutely since it’s the one you’ve chosen. In this, you are not Chu Xuan’s equal. He does not hesitate the slightest in his heart, nor does he carry any burdens. Each and every action points to his intent. He only purely seeks a maximisation of benefits.

When this was done, he gave a smile to the various psyche force users around. “Do help. Infuse your psyche force into this alchemical formation. Those with higher mental capacities, do help as well.

When Sora Aoi walked past, Miyata Kuraki grabbed her hand. “Be careful. I don\u0027t know why, but I have a bad premonition. Something is about to happen.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSora Aoi nodded seriously. She was aware that Miyata Kuraki’s technique was quite unique. It was one of the few that allowed the user to experience Light of the Soul before the fourth stage. The user would rate as the strongest among those at the same level of genetic constraint and technique, if that regrettable imperfection of self harm was ignored. This technique was quite sensitive towards unknown danger, or in other words, had a strong sixth sense.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“You be careful too.” Sora Aoi said gently.

Anyone with a better mental capacity would have a particularly strong sixth sense. They could for the most part have some mental warning in the face of mortal danger.
