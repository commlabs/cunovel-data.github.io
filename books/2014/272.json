They are Soft Ones, but their skin is the color of the night sea and without clothing or adornment save spears and clubs spiked with iron they race toward the Rikin warriors shrieking and laughing like madmen. They plunge forward without fear, and in the instant before they fall upon his warriors, he sees robed humans walking among the trees with staffs upraised: sorcerers. His own staff he grips tightly, but their magic does not afflict his warriors, only their own, who hit the Rikin line with howls first of battle fever and then of agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Retreat!” he cries again, and this time he wrenches the horn from his standard bearer and blows the call himself, sharp, imperative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nay, nay,” his warriors cry, “let us slaughter them. They are weak as calves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he drives his troops forward. They know to obey him. They know he is more farsighted than they are. And by now, some of them can see that they have been tricked. With spears and fire they beat their way forward through the throng of naked men, headed for the ridge and the trees. Only the stupidest are left at the hall when Nokvi’s troops come racing out of the dark from the other direction. It’s a clever plan. Nokvi hoped to catch Rikin’s army from behind while it wasted itself killing ensorcelled men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a hard and humiliating run back up the ridge and down to his ships. Only four of the ships are burning so fiercely that the fires set on them can’t be stemmed. He kills one of the arsonists himself, a naked human man who gibbers and pokes ineffectually at him with a knife before the creature falls, doubled over, from a thrust to the guts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour ships lost, as well as a third of his men. One ship has to be scuttled in the sound, and ten more warriors dumped overboard when they die of their wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he counts himself lucky. He has underestimated Nokvi and his allies. It could have been much worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not in victory that you learn how strong you truly are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorrow licked him, and he startled up like a hare bolting and found himself weeping at Lavastine’s bier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not in victory that you learn how strong you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAi, God. He could not weep for himself, not truly. He was weeping for what they had done to his father’s hopes and dreams, shredded now. Thrown to the dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot my father any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNay, King Henry had not yet judged the case. Yet if Henry ruled in his favor, could he ever truly call himself Lavastine’s son again without wondering if it were a lie to say so? Couldn’t it be true, as Cook said, that Lavastine had lain with the young woman as well? Might he not have walked to the ruins one night and succumbed to temptation as Alain had almost done so long ago with that girl, Withi? How could they ever know one way or the other? How could one tell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had linked Lavastine and poor Lackling, who were so unlike that it seemed impossible they could be father and son, even after Cook’s testimony? Nothing had linked them, except blood, except perhaps the way the hounds had whined and whimpered at both their deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeoffrey’s blood claim to the count’s chair was stronger than Lackling’s merely by reason of competence. But if fitness was the only standard, then couldn’t he argue that he would be a better steward than Geoffrey? Under his rule, the people would do better than under Geoffrey’s rule. Was it pride to think so? No, it was truth. Lavastine had recognized that truth and he had made his decision based in part on sentiment and emotion, certainly, but in equal part on reason, because Lavastine took seriously his duty to the land and people under his rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was blood, anyway? It was everything, all that you had to mark kinship, and yet the bond he had shared with Lavastine was no less real whether or not blood had tied them together. He and Lavastine had been woven together in some way evident to them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved him still, and he had a bitter intuition that had Cook reluctantly brought her testimony before Lavastine, the count would have smiled in his terse way and told her that it made no difference to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNay, the failure had not been Lavastine’s. He had always known what he was about. He had known what would happen, and he had made every effort to prepare for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Tallia wasn’t pregnant. Alain had failed and, worse, he had lied to the man who trusted him most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knowledge lay in his heart as bitterly as the accusation that he might be nothing better than the ill-gotten child of a whore and her father, born out of incest and cruel poverty. Ai, Lady. No better than the poor beggars who had sheltered in hovels on his land and pleaded for food for their starving children. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-272.html","bookId":2014,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM"}
