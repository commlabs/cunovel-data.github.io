Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon hoisted his daybag higher onto his shoulder and laid his hand on top of it, as if somehow this might better hide the cube-shaped package he was carrying. He could feel his face had gone ashen. \"I\u0027m . . . just worried about Peter.\" Sato cocked her head, eyeing him askew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt a sudden wariness that Sato\u0027s involvement tonight might relate to this small package that Solomon had entrusted to him. Peter had warned Langdon: Powerful people want to steal this. It would be dangerous in the wrong hands. Langdon couldn\u0027t imagine why the CIA would want a little box containing a talisman . . . or even what the talisman could be. Ordo ab chao?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato stepped closer, her black eyes probing. \"I sense you\u0027ve had a revelation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt himself sweating now. \"No, not exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s on your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just . . .\" Langdon hesitated, having no idea what to say. He had no intention of revealing the existence of the package in his bag, and yet if Sato took him to the CIA, his bag most certainly would be searched on the way in. \"Actually . . .\" he fibbed, \"I have another idea about the numbers on Peter\u0027s hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato\u0027s expression revealed nothing. \"Yes?\" She glanced over at Anderson now, who was just arriving from greeting the forensics team that had finally arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon swallowed hard and crouched down beside the hand, wondering what he could possibly come up with to tell them. You\u0027re a teacher, Robert--improvise! He took one last look at the seven tiny symbols, hoping for some sort of inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing. Blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Langdon\u0027s eidetic memory skimmed through his mental encyclopedia of symbols, he could find only one possible point to make. It was something that had occurred to him initially, but had seemed unlikely. At the moment, however, he had to buy time to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he began, \"a symbologist\u0027s first clue that he\u0027s on the wrong track when deciphering symbols and codes is when he starts interpreting symbols using multiple symbolic languages. For example, when I told you this text was Roman and Arabic, that was a poor analysis because I used multiple symbolic systems. The same is true for Roman and runic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato crossed her arms and arched her eyebrows as if to say, \"Go on.\" \"In general, communications are made in one language, not multiple languages, and so a symbologist\u0027s first job with any text is to find a single consistent symbolic system that applies to the entire text.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you see a single system now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yes . . . and no.\" Langdon\u0027s experience with the rotational symmetry of ambigrams had taught him that symbols sometimes had meanings from multiple angles. In this case, he realized there was indeed a way to view all seven symbols in a single language. \"If we manipulated the hand slightly, the language will become consistent.\" Eerily, the manipulation Langdon was about to perform was one that seemed to have been suggested by Peter\u0027s captor already when he spoke the ancient Hermetic adage. As above, so below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt a chill as he reached out and grasped the wooden base on which Peter\u0027s hand was secured. Gently, he turned the base upside down so that Peter\u0027s extended fingers were now pointing straight down. The symbols on the palm instantly transformed themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From this angle,\" Langdon said, \"X-I-I-I becomes a valid Roman numeral--thirteen. Moreover, the rest of the characters can be interpreted using the Roman alphabet--SBB.\" Langdon assumed the analysis would elicit blank shrugs, but Anderson\u0027s expression immediately changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"SBB?\" the chief demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato turned to Anderson. \"If I\u0027m not mistaken, that sounds like a familiar numbering system here in the Capitol Building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson looked pale. \"It is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato gave a grim smile and nodded to Anderson. \"Chief, follow me, please. I\u0027d like a word in private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Director Sato led Chief Anderson out of earshot, Langdon stood alone in bewilderment. What the hell is going on here? And what is SBB XIII?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Anderson wondered how this night could possibly get any stranger. The hand says SBB13? He was amazed any outsider had even heard of SBB . . . much less SBB13. Peter Solomon\u0027s index finger, it seemed, was not directing them upward as it had appeared . . . but rather was pointing in quite the opposite direction. Director Sato led Anderson over to a quiet area near the bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson. \"Chief,\" she said, \"I trust you know exactly where SBB Thirteen is located?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know what\u0027s inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not without looking. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s been used in decades.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re going to open it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson did not appreciate being told what he would do in his own building. \"Ma\u0027am, that may be problematic. I\u0027ll have to check the assignment roster first. As you know, most of the lower levels are private offices or storage, and security protocol regarding private--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will unlock SBB Thirteen for me,\" Sato said, \"or I will call OS and send in a team with a battering ram.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson stared at her a long moment and then pulled out his radio, raising it to his lips. \"This is Anderson. I need someone to unlock the SBB. Have someone meet me there in five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice that replied sounded confused. \"Chief, confirming you said SBB?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct. SBB. Send someone immediately. And I\u0027ll need a flashlight.\" He stowed his radio. Anderson\u0027s heart was pounding as Sato stepped closer, lowering her voice even further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chief, time is short,\" she whispered, \"and I want you to get us down to SBB Thirteen as quickly as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also need something else from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to breaking and entering? Anderson was in no position to protest, and yet it had not gone unnoticed by him that Sato had arrived within minutes of Peter\u0027s hand appearing in the Rotunda, and that she now was using the situation to demand access to private sections of the U.S. Capitol. She seemed so far ahead of the curve tonight that she was practically defining it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato motioned across the room toward the professor. \"The duffel bag on Langdon\u0027s shoulder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson glanced over. \"What about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume your staff X-rayed that bag when Langdon entered the building?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. All bags are scanned.\" \"I want to see that X-ray. I want to know what\u0027s in his bag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson looked over at the bag Langdon had been carrying all evening. \"But . . . wouldn\u0027t it be easier just to ask him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What part of my request was unclear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson pulled out his radio again and called in her request. Sato gave Anderson her BlackBerry address and requested that his team e-mail her a digital copy of the X-ray as soon as they had located it. Reluctantly Anderson complied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForensics was now collecting the severed hand for the Capitol Police, but Sato ordered them to deliver it directly to her team at Langley. Anderson was too tired to protest. He had just been run over by a tiny Japanese steamroller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I want that ring,\" Sato called over to Forensics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chief technician seemed ready to question her but thought better of it. He removed the gold ring from Peter\u0027s hand, placed it in a clear specimen bag, and gave it to Sato. She slipped it into her jacket pocket, and then turned to Langdon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re leaving, Professor. Bring your things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" Langdon replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just follow Mr. Anderson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Anderson thought, and follow me closely. The SBB was a section of the Capitol that few ever visited. To reach it, they would pass through a sprawling labyrinth of tiny chambers and tight passages buried beneath the crypt. Abraham Lincoln\u0027s youngest son, Tad, had once gotten lost down there and almost perished. Anderson was starting to suspect that if Sato had her way, Robert Langdon might suffer a similar fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 27\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSystems security specialist Mark Zoubianis had always prided himself on his ability to multitask. At the moment, he was seated on his futon along with a TV remote, a cordless phone, a laptop, a PDA, and a large bowl of Pirate\u0027s Booty. With one eye on the muted Redskins game and one eye on his laptop, Zoubianis was speaking on his Bluetooth headset with a woman he had not heard from in over a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeave it to Trish Dunne to call on the night of a play-off game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfirming her social ineptitude yet again, his former colleague had chosen the Redskins game as a perfect moment to chat him up and request a favor. After some brief small talk about the old days and how she missed his great jokes, Trish had gotten to her point: she was trying to unmask a hidden IP address, probably that of a secure server in the D.C. area. The server contained a small text document, and she wanted access to it . . . or at the very least, some information about whose document it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight guy, wrong timing, he had told her. Trish then showered him with her finest geek flattery, most of which was true, and before Zoubianis knew it, he was typing a strange-looking IP address into his laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoubianis took one look at the number and immediately felt uneasy. \"Trish, this IP has a funky format. It\u0027s written in a protocol that isn\u0027t even publicly available yet. It\u0027s probably gov intel or military.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Military?\" Trish laughed. \"Believe me, I just pulled a redacted document off this server, and it was not military.\" Zoubianis pulled up his terminal window and tried a traceroute. \"You said your traceroute died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Twice. Same hop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine, too.\" He pulled up a diagnostic probe and launched it. \"And what\u0027s so interesting about this IP?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ran a delegator that tapped a search engine at this IP and pulled a redacted document. I need to see the rest of the document. I\u0027m happy to pay them for it, but I can\u0027t figure out who owns the IP or how to access it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoubianis frowned at his screen. \"Are you sure about this? I\u0027m running a diagnostic, and this firewall coding looks . . . pretty serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why you get the big bucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoubianis considered it. They\u0027d offered him a fortune for a job this easy. \"One question, Trish. Why are you so hot on this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrish paused. \"I\u0027m doing a favor for a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must be a special friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is.\" Zoubianis chuckled and held his tongue. I knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Trish said, sounding impatient. \"Are you good enough to unmask this IP? Yes or no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m good enough. And yes, I know you\u0027re playing me like a fiddle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long will it take you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not long,\" he said, typing as he spoke. \"I should be able to get into a machine on their network within ten minutes or so. Once I\u0027m in and know what I\u0027m looking at, I\u0027ll call you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate it. So, are you doing well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she asks? \"Trish, for God\u0027s sake, you called me on the night of a play-off game and now you want to chat? Do you want me to hack this IP or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Mark. I appreciate it. I\u0027ll be waiting for your call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifteen minutes.\" Zoubianis hung up, grabbed his bowl of Pirate\u0027s Booty, and unmuted the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 28\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere are they taking me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Langdon hurried with Anderson and Sato into the depths of the Capitol, he felt his heart rate increasing with each downward step. They had begun their journey through the west portico of the Rotunda, descending a marble staircase and then doubling back through a wide doorway into the famous chamber directly beneath the Rotunda floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Capitol Crypt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was heavier here, and Langdon was already feeling claustrophobic. The crypt\u0027s low ceiling and soft uplighting accentuated the robust girth of the forty Doric columns required to support the vast stone floor directly overhead. Relax, Robert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way,\" Anderson said, moving quickly as he angled to the left across the wide circular space. Thankfully, this particular crypt contained no bodies. Instead it contained several statues, a model of the Capitol, and a low storage area for the wooden catafalque on which coffins were laid for state funerals. The entourage hurried through, without even a glance at the four-pointed marble compass in the center of the floor where the Eternal Flame had once burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson seemed to be in a hurry, and Sato once again had her head buried in her BlackBerry. Cellular service, Langdon had heard, was boosted and broadcast to all corners of the Capitol Building to support the hundreds of government phone calls that took place here every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter diagonally crossing the crypt, the group entered a dimly lit foyer and began winding through a convoluted series of hallways and dead ends. The warren of passages contained numbered doorways, each of which bore an identification number. Langdon read the doors as they snaked their way around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS154 . . . S153 . . . S152 . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea what lay behind these doors, but at least one thing now seemed clear--the meaning of the tattoo on Peter Solomon\u0027s palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSBB13 appeared to be a numbered doorway somewhere in the bowels of the U.S. Capitol Building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are all these doorways?\" Langdon asked, clutching his daybag tightly to his ribs and wondering what Solomon\u0027s tiny package could possibly have to do with a door marked SBB13.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Offices and storage,\" Anderson said. \"Private offices and storage,\" he added, glancing back at Sato.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato did not even glance up from her BlackBerry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They look tiny,\" Langdon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glorified closets, most of them, but they\u0027re still some of the most sought-after real estate in D.C. This is the heart of the original Capitol, and the old Senate chamber is two stories above us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And SBB Thirteen?\" Langdon asked. \"Whose office is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s. The SBB is a private storage area, and I must say, I\u0027m puzzled how--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chief Anderson,\" Sato interrupted without looking up from her BlackBerry. \"Just take us there, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson clenched his jaw and guided them on in silence through what was now feeling like a hybrid self-storage facility and epic labyrinth. On almost every wall, directional signs pointed back and forth, apparently attempting to locate specific office blocks in this network of hallways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS142 to S152 . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eST1 to ST70 . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eH1 to H166 \u0026amp; HT1 to HT67 . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon doubted he could ever find his way out of here alone. This place is a maze. From all he could gather, office numbers began with either an S or an H depending on whether they were on the Senate side of the building or the House side. Areas designated ST and HT were apparently on a level that Anderson called Terrace Level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill no signs for SBB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally they arrived at a heavy steel security door with a key-card entry box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSB Level\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon sensed they were getting closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson reached for his key card but hesitated, looking uncomfortable with Sato\u0027s demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chief,\" Sato prompted. \"We don\u0027t have all night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson reluctantly inserted his key card. The steel door released. He pushed it open, and they stepped through into the foyer beyond. The heavy door clicked shut behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon wasn\u0027t sure what he had hoped to see in this foyer, but the sight in front of him was definitely not it. He was staring at a descending stairway. \"Down again?\" he said, stopping short. \"There\u0027s a level under the crypt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Anderson said. \"SB stands for `Senate Basement.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon groaned. Terrific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe headlights winding up the SMSC\u0027s wooded access road were the first the guard had seen in the last hour. Dutifully, he turned down the volume on his portable TV set and stashed his snacks beneath the counter. Lousy timing. The Redskins were completing their opening drive, and he didn\u0027t want to miss it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the car drew closer, the guard checked the name on the notepad in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Christopher Abaddon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine Solomon had just called to alert Security of this guest\u0027s imminent arrival. The guard had no idea who this doctor might be, but he was apparently very good at doctoring; he was arriving in a black stretch limousine. The long, sleek vehicle rolled to a stop beside the guardhouse, and the driver\u0027s tinted window lowered silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening,\" the chauffeur said, doffing his cap. He was a powerfully built man with a shaved head. He was listening to the football game on his radio. \"I have Dr. Christopher Abaddon for Ms. Katherine Solomon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard nodded. \"Identification, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chauffeur looked surprised. \"I\u0027m sorry, didn\u0027t Ms. Solomon call ahead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard nodded, stealing a glance at the television. \"I\u0027m still required to scan and log visitor identification. Sorry, regulations. I\u0027ll need to see the doctor\u0027s ID.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a problem.\" The chauffeur turned backward in his seat and spoke in hushed tones through the privacy screen. As he did, the guard stole another peek at the game. The Redskins were breaking from the huddle now, and he hoped to get this limo through before the next play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chauffeur turned forward again and held out the ID that he\u0027d apparently just received through the privacy screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard took the card and quickly scanned it into his system. The D.C. driver\u0027s license showed one Christopher Abaddon from Kalorama Heights. The photo depicted a handsome blond gentleman wearing a blue blazer, a necktie, and a satin pocket square. Who the hell wears a pocket square to the DMV?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muffled cheer went up from the television set, and the guard wheeled just in time to see a Redskins player dancing in the end zone, his finger pointed skyward. \"I missed it,\" the guard grumbled, returning to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said, returning the license to the chauffeur. \"You\u0027re all set.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the limo pulled through, the guard returned to his TV, hoping for a replay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Mal\u0027akh drove his limo up the winding access road, he couldn\u0027t help but smile. Peter Solomon\u0027s secret museum had been simple to breach. Sweeter still, tonight was the second time in twenty-four hours that Mal\u0027akh had broken into one of Solomon\u0027s private spaces. Last night, a similar visit had been made to Solomon\u0027s home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Peter Solomon had a magnificent country estate in Potomac, he spent much of his time in the city at his penthouse apartment at the exclusive Dorchester Arms. His building, like most that catered to the super-rich, was a veritable fortress. High walls. Guard gates. Guest lists. Secured underground parking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal\u0027akh had driven this very limousine up to the building\u0027s guardhouse, doffed his chauffeur\u0027s cap from his shaved head, and proclaimed, \"I have Dr. Christopher Abaddon. He is an invited guest of Mr. Peter Solomon.\" Mal\u0027akh spoke the words as if he were announcing the Duke of York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard checked a log and then Abaddon\u0027s ID. \"Yes, I see Mr. Solomon is expecting Dr. Abaddon.\" He pressed a button and the gate opened. \"Mr. Solomon is in the penthouse apartment. Have your guest use the last elevator on the right. It goes all the way up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Mal\u0027akh tipped his hat and drove through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he wound deep into the garage, he scanned for security cameras. Nothing. Apparently, those who lived here were neither the kind of people who broke into cars nor the kind of people who appreciated being watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal\u0027akh parked in a dark corner near the elevators, lowered the divider between the driver\u0027s compartment and the passenger compartment, and slithered through the opening into the back of the limo. Once in back, he got rid of his chauffeur\u0027s cap and donned his blond wig. Straightening his jacket and tie, he checked the mirror to make sure he had not smeared his makeup. Mal\u0027akh was not about to take any chances. Not tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have waited too long for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, Mal\u0027akh was stepping into the private elevator. The ride to the top was silent and smooth. When the door opened, he found himself in an elegant, private foyer. His host was already waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Abaddon, welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal\u0027akh looked into the man\u0027s famous gray eyes and felt his heart begin to race. \"Mr. Solomon, I appreciate your seeing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, call me Peter.\" The two men shook hands. As Mal\u0027akh gripped the older man\u0027s palm, he saw the gold Masonic ring on Solomon\u0027s hand . . . the same hand that had once aimed a gun at Mal\u0027akh. A voice whispered from Mal\u0027akh\u0027s distant past. If you pull that trigger, I will haunt you forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please come in,\" Solomon said, ushering Mal\u0027akh into an elegant living room whose expansive windows offered an astonishing view of the Washington skyline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I smell tea steeping?\" Mal\u0027akh asked as he entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolomon looked impressed. \"My parents always greeted guests with tea. I\u0027ve carried on that tradition.\" He led Mal\u0027akh into the living room, where a tea service was waiting in front of the fire. \"Cream and sugar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Black, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Solomon looked impressed. \"A purist.\" He poured them both a cup of black tea. \"You said you needed to discuss something with me that was sensitive in nature and could be discussed only in private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. I appreciate your time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and I are Masonic brothers now. We have a bond. Tell me how I can help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, I would like to thank you for the honor of the thirty-third degree a few months ago. This is deeply meaningful to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad, but please know that those decisions are not mine alone. They are by vote of the Supreme Council.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Mal\u0027akh suspected Peter Solomon had probably voted against him, but within the Masons, as with all things, money was power. Mal\u0027akh, after achieving the thirty-second degree in his own lodge, had waited only a month before making a multimillion-dollar donation to charity in the name of the Masonic Grand Lodge. The unsolicited act of selflessness, as Mal\u0027akh anticipated, was enough to earn him a quick invitation into the elite thirty-third degree. And yet I have learned no secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the age-old whispers--\"All is revealed at the thirty-third degree\"--Mal\u0027akh had been told nothing new, nothing of relevance to his quest. But he had never expected to be told. The inner circle of Freemasonry contained smaller circles still . . . circles Mal\u0027akh would not see for years, if ever. He didn\u0027t care. His initiation had served its purpose. Something unique had happened within that Temple Room, and it had given Mal\u0027akh power over all of them. I no longer play by your rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do realize,\" Mal\u0027akh said, sipping his tea, \"that you and I met many years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolomon looked surprised. \"Really? I don\u0027t recall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was quite a long time ago.\" And Christopher Abaddon is not my real name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry. My mind must be getting old. Remind me how I know you?\" Mal\u0027akh smiled one last time at the man he hated more than any other man on earth. \"It\u0027s unfortunate that you don\u0027t recall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one fluid motion, Mal\u0027akh pulled a small device from his pocket and extended it outward, driving it hard into the man\u0027s chest. There was a flash of blue light, the sharp sizzle of the stun- gun discharge, and a gasp of pain as one million volts of electricity coursed through Peter Solomon\u0027s body. His eyes went wide, and he slumped motionless in his chair. Mal\u0027akh stood up now, towering over the man, salivating like a lion about to consume his injured prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolomon was gasping, straining to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal\u0027akh saw fear in his victim\u0027s eyes and wondered how many people had ever seen the great Peter Solomon cower. Mal\u0027akh savored the scene for several long seconds. He took a sip of tea, waiting for the man to catch his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolomon was twitching, attempting to speak. \"Wh-why?\" he finally managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think?\" Mal\u0027akh demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolomon looked truly bewildered. \"You want . . . money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoney? Mal\u0027akh laughed and took another sip of tea. \"I gave the Masons millions of dollars; I have no need of wealth.\" I come for wisdom, and he offers me wealth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what . . . do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You possess a secret. You will share it with me tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolomon struggled to lift his chin so he could look Mal\u0027akh in the eye. \"I don\u0027t . . . understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more lies!\" Mal\u0027akh shouted, advancing to within inches of the paralyzed man. \"I know what is hidden here in Washington.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolomon\u0027s gray eyes were defiant. \"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal\u0027akh took another sip of tea and set the cup on a coaster. \"You spoke those same words to me ten years ago, on the night of your mother\u0027s death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolomon\u0027s eyes shot wide open. \"You . . . ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t have to die. If you had given me what I demanded . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older man\u0027s face contorted in a mask of horrified recognition . . . and disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I warned you,\" Mal\u0027akh said, \"if you pulled the trigger, I would haunt you forever.\" \"But you\u0027re--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal\u0027akh lunged, driving the Taser hard into Solomon\u0027s chest again. There was another flash of blue light, and Solomon went completely limp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal\u0027akh put the Taser back in his pocket and calmly finished his tea. When he was done, he dabbed his lips with a monogrammed linen napkin and peered down at his victim. \"Shall we go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolomon\u0027s body was motionless, but his eyes were wide and engaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal\u0027akh got down close and whispered in the man\u0027s ear. \"I\u0027m taking you to a place where only truth remains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word, Mal\u0027akh wadded up the monogrammed napkin and stuffed it into Solomon\u0027s mouth. Then he hoisted the limp man onto his broad shoulders and headed for the private elevator. On his way out, he picked up Solomon\u0027s iPhone and keys from the hall table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight you will tell me all your secrets, Mal\u0027akh thought. Including why you left me for dead all those years ago. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lost-symbol-robert-langdon-3/page-10.html","bookId":1515,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:38:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:38:41 AM"}
