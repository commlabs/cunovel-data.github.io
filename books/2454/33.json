{"id":80685,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"\u003cp\u003eMiller\u0027s mind reassembled slowly and with several false starts. In his dreams, he was fitting a puzzle together as the pieces kept changing shape, and each time, just as he was on the verge of slipping the whole mechanism together, the dream began again. The first thing he became aware of was the ache at the small of his back, then the heaviness of his arms and legs, then the nausea. The nearer he came to consciousness, the more he tried to postpone it. Imaginary fingers tried to complete the puzzle, and before he could make it all fit, his eyes opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t move his head. Something was in his neck: a thick bundle of black tubes reaching out of him and up past the limits of his vision. He tried to lift his arms, to push the invading, vampiric thing away, but he couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt got me, he thought with a thrill of fear. I\u0027m infected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman appeared from his left. He was surprised she wasn\u0027t Julie. Deep brown skin, dark eyes with just a hint of an epicanthic fold. She smiled at him. Black hair draped down the side of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown. There was a down. There was gravity. They were under thrust. That seemed very important, but he didn\u0027t know why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Detective,\" Naomi said. \"Welcome back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere am I? he tried to say. His throat felt solid. Crowded like too many people in a tube station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t try to get up or talk or anything,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve been under for about thirty-six hours. Good news is we have a sick bay with a military-grade expert system and supplies for fifteen Martian soldiers. I think we burned half of what we\u0027ve got on you and the captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain. Holden. That was right. They\u0027d been in a fight. There had been a corridor and people shooting. And someone had been sick. He remembered a woman, covered in brown vomit, with vacant eyes, but he didn\u0027t know whether it was part of a nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi was still talking. Something about full plasma flushes and cell damage. He tried to lift a hand, to reach out to her, but a strap restrained him. The ache in his back was his kidneys, and he wondered what exactly was getting filtered out of his blood. Miller closed his eyes, asleep before he could decide whether to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo dreams troubled him this time. He roused again when something deep in his throat shifted, pulled at his larynx, and retreated. Without opening his eyes, he rolled to his side, coughed, puked, and rolled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he woke, he was breathing on his own. His throat felt sore and abused, but his hands weren\u0027t tied down. Drainage tubes ran out of his belly and side, and there was a catheter the size of a pencil coming out his penis. Nothing particularly hurt, so he had to assume he was on pretty nearly all the narcotics there were. His clothes were gone, his modesty preserved only by a thin paper gown and a cast that held his left arm stony and immovable. Someone had put his hat on the next bed over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sick bay, now that he could see it, looked like a ward on a high-production entertainment feed. It wasn\u0027t a hospital; it was the matte-black-and-silver idea of what a hospital was supposed to be. The monitors hung suspended in the air on complex armatures, reporting his blood pressure, nucleic acid concentrations, oxygenation, fluid balance. There were two separate countdowns running, one to the next round of autophagics, the other for pain medication. And across the aisle, at another station, Holden\u0027s statistics looked more or less the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden looked like a ghost. His skin was pale and his sclera were red with a hundred little hemorrhages. His face was puffy from steroids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden lifted a hand, waving gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We made it,\" Miller said. His voice sounded like it had been dragged down an alley by its ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was ugly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller nodded. That had taken all the energy he had. He lay back down and fell, if not asleep, at least unconscious. Just before his mind flickered back into forgetfulness, he smiled. He\u0027d made it. He was on Holden\u0027s ship. And they were going to find whatever Julie had left behind for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoices woke him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you shouldn\u0027t, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the woman. Naomi. Part of Miller cursed her for disturbing him, but there was a buzz in her voice - not fear or anger, but close enough to be interesting. He didn\u0027t move, didn\u0027t even swim all the way back to awareness. But he listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to,\" Holden said. He sounded phlegmy, like someone who needed to cough. \"What happened on Eros... it\u0027s put a lot of things in perspective. I\u0027ve been a holding something back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, hear me out. When I was in there thinking that all I was going to have left was half an hour of rigged pachinko games and then death... when that happened, I knew what my regrets were. You know? I felt all the things that I wished I\u0027d done and never had the courage for. Now that I know, I can\u0027t just ignore it. I can\u0027t pretend it isn\u0027t there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain,\" Naomi said again, and the buzz in her voice was stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t say it, you poor bastard, Miller thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in love with you, Naomi,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pause lasted no longer than a heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir,\" she said. \"You aren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. I know what you\u0027re thinking. I\u0027ve been through this big traumatic experience and I\u0027m doing the whole thing where I want to affirm life and make connections, and maybe some of that\u0027s part of it. But you have to believe that I know what I feel. And when I was down there, I knew that the thing that I wanted the most was to get back to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain. How long have we served together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I don\u0027t know exactly... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ballpark estimate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight and a half runs makes it almost five years,\" Holden said. Miller could hear the confusion in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. And in that time, how many of the crew did you share bunks with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than a dozen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said, but he didn\u0027t sound sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s call it ten,\" Naomi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. But this is different. I\u0027m not talking about having a little shipboard romance to pass the time. Ever since - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller imagined the woman holding up her hand or taking Holden\u0027s or maybe just glaring at him. Something to stop the flow of words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And do you know when I fell for you, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorrow. That was what the strain in her voice was. Sorrow. Disappointment. Regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When... when you... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can tell you the day,\" Naomi said. \"You were about seven weeks into that first run. I was still smarting that some Earther had come in from out of the ecliptic and taken my XO job. I didn\u0027t like you much right at the start. You were too charming, too pretty, and too damn comfortable in my chair. But there was a poker game in the engine room. You and me and those two Luna boys out of engineering and Kamala Trask. You remember Trask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was the comm tech. The one who was... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Built like a refrigerator? Face like a bulldog puppy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had the biggest crush on you. Used to cry herself to sleep at night all through that run. She wasn\u0027t in that game because she cared about poker. She just wanted to breathe some of your air, and everyone knew it. Even you. And all that night, I watched you and her, and you never once led her along. You never gave her any reason to think she had a chance with you. And you still treated her with respect. That was the first time I thought you might be a decent XO, and it was the first time I wished that I could be the girl in your bunk at shift\u0027s end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of Trask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That and you\u0027ve got a great ass, sir. My point is we flew together for four years and more. And I would have come along with you any day of that if you\u0027d asked me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know,\" Holden said. He sounded a little strangled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t ask. You always had your sights set someplace else. And, honestly, I think Belter women just put you off. Until the Cant... Until it was just the five of us. I\u0027ve seen you looking at me. I know exactly what those looks mean, because I spent four years on the other side of them. But I only got your attention when I was the only female on board, and that\u0027s not good enough for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir, you don\u0027t. That\u0027s my point. I\u0027ve watched you seduce a lot of women, and I know how you do it. You get fixed on her, you get excited by her. Then you convince yourself that the two of you have some kind of special connection, and by the time you believe it, she usually thinks it\u0027s true too. And then you sleep together for a while, and the connection gets a little faded. One or the other of you says something like professional or appropriate boundaries or starts worrying what the crew will think, and the whole thing slides away. Afterwards they still like you. All of them. You do it all so well they don\u0027t even feel like they get to hate you for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is. And until you figure out that you don\u0027t have to love everyone you bed down with, I\u0027m never going to know whether you love me or just want to bed down. And I won\u0027t sleep with you until you know which it is. The smart money isn\u0027t on love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want to sleep with me,\" Naomi said, \"be honest. Respect me enough for that. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller coughed. He hadn\u0027t meant to, hadn\u0027t even been aware he was going to. His belly went tight, his throat clamped down, and he coughed wet and deep. Once he started, it was hard to stop. He sat up, eyes watering from the effort. Holden was lying back on his bed. Naomi sat on the next bed over, smiling like there had been nothing to overhear. Holden\u0027s monitors showed an elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Miller could only hope the poor bastard hadn\u0027t gotten an erection with the catheter still in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Detective,\" Naomi said. \"How\u0027re you feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve felt worse,\" he said. Then, a moment later: \"No. I haven\u0027t. But I\u0027m all right. How bad was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re both dead,\" Naomi said. \"Seriously, we had to override the triage filters on both of you more than once. The expert system kept clicking you over into hospice care and shooting you full of morphine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said it lightly, but he believed her. He tried to sit up. His body still felt terribly heavy, but he didn\u0027t know if it was from weakness or the ship thrust. Holden was quiet, jaw clamped tight. Miller pretended not to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long-term estimates?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re both going to need to be checked for new cancers every month for the rest of your lives. The captain has a new implant where his thyroid used to be, since his real one was pretty much cooked down. We had to take out about a foot and a half of your small bowel that wouldn\u0027t stop bleeding. You\u0027re both going to bruise easy for a while, and if you wanted kids, I hope you have some sperm in a bank someplace, because all your little soldiers have two heads now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller chuckled. His monitors blinked into alarm mode and then back out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like you trained as a med tech,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Engineer. But I\u0027ve been reading the printouts every day, so I\u0027ve got the lingo down. I wish Shed was still here,\" she said, and sounded sad for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the second time someone had mentioned Shed. There was a story there, but Miller let it drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hair going to fall out?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Naomi said. \"The system shot you full of the drugs that are supposed to stop that, but if the follicles die, they die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. Good thing I\u0027ve still got my hat. What about Eros?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi\u0027s false light tone failed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s dead,\" Holden said from his bed, turning to look at Miller. \"I think we were the last ship out. The station isn\u0027t answering calls, and all the automatic systems have it in a quarantine lockdown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rescue ships?\" Miller asked, and coughed again. His throat was still sore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not going to happen,\" Naomi said. \"There were a million and a half people on station. No one has the resources to put into that kind of rescue op.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After all,\" Holden said, \"there\u0027s a war on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship system dimmed the lights for night. Miller lay on his bed. The expert system had shifted his treatment regimen into a new phase, and for the past three hours, he\u0027d alternated between spiking fevers and teeth-chattering chills. His teeth and the nail beds of his fingers and toes ached. Sleep wasn\u0027t an option, so he lay in the gloom and tried to pull himself together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered what his old partners would have made of his behavior on Eros. Havelock. Muss. He tried to imagine them in his place. He\u0027d killed people, and he\u0027d done it cold. Eros had been a kill box, and when the people in charge of the law wanted you dead, the law didn\u0027t apply anymore. And some of the dead assholes had been the ones who\u0027d killed Julie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo. Revenge killing. Was he really down to revenge killing? That was a sad thought. He tried to imagine Julie sitting beside him the way Naomi had with Holden. It was like she\u0027d been waiting for the invitation. Julie Mao, who he\u0027d never really known. She raised a hand in greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what about us? he asked her as he looked into her dark, unreal eyes. Do I love you, or do I just want to love you so bad I can\u0027t tell the difference?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Miller,\" Holden said, and Julie vanished. \"You awake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Can\u0027t sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were silent for a moment. The expert system hummed. Miller\u0027s left arm itched under its cast as the tissue went through another round of forced regrowth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You doing okay?\" Miller asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wouldn\u0027t I be?\" Holden said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You killed that guy,\" Miller said. \"Back on the station. You shot him. I mean, I know you shot at guys before that. Back at the hotel. But right at the end there, you actually hit somebody in the face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You good with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Holden said, too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air recyclers hummed, and the blood pressure cuff on Miller\u0027s good arm squeezed him like a hand. Holden didn\u0027t speak, but when Miller squinted, he could see the elevated blood pressure and the uptick in brain activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They always made us take time off,\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we shot someone. Whether they died or not, they always made us take a leave of absence. Turn in our weapon. Go talk to the headshrinker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bureaucrats,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They had a point,\" Miller said. \"Shooting someone does something to you. Killing someone... that\u0027s even worse. Doesn\u0027t matter that they had it coming or you didn\u0027t have a choice. Or maybe a little difference. But it doesn\u0027t take it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems like you got over it, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Miller said. \"Look. All that I said back there about how you kill someone? About how leaving them alive wasn\u0027t doing them any favors? I\u0027m sorry that happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you were wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t. But I\u0027m still sorry it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus. Look, I\u0027m saying it\u0027s good that it bothers you. It\u0027s good that you can\u0027t stop seeing it or hearing it. That part where it haunts you some? That\u0027s the way it\u0027s supposed to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden was quiet for a moment. When he spoke again, his voice was gray as stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve killed people before, you know. But they were blips in a radar track. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the same, is it?\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it isn\u0027t,\" Holden replied. \"Does this go away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, Miller thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"Not if you\u0027ve still got a soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One other thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it\u0027s none of my business, but I really wouldn\u0027t let her put you off. So you don\u0027t understand sex and love and women. Just means you were born with a cock. And this girl? Naomi? She seems like she\u0027s worth putting a little effort into it. You know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Holden said. Then: \"Can we never talk about that again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship creaked and gravity shifted a degree to Miller\u0027s right. Course correction. Nothing interesting. Miller closed his eyes and tried to will himself to sleep. His mind was full of dead men and Julie and love and sex. There was something Holden had said about the war that was important, but he couldn\u0027t make the pieces fit. They kept changing.
