It was far larger than any of the preceding lightning bolts, and caused the entire sky to turn the color of gold as it sped toward Bai Xiaochun’s three-meter Gold Core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crushing pressure exuded by that lightning bolt was both the strongest and the final round!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun let out a long cry as he released all the power of his cultivation base. His Undying techniques were in full swing, and his will, soul, and everything else about him was completely and utterly focused. Nothing else in the world even existed at the moment. His mind was devolving into chaos, and yet, there was one thing that remained....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I must form this Gold Core! I want to live forever!!” Without even realizing what he was doing, he threw his head back and roared, then shot up into the air toward the Gold Core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUUUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance, it was just possible to see him arriving at the Gold Core at exactly the same time as the bolt of lightning!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, heaven and earth were turning blurry, the sky was shaking, and the land was being rocked back and forth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, so much golden light filled the world that it became the only color in existence!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, it was almost impossible to even distinguish Bai Xiaochun from the lightning, as both merged into the Gold Core!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, every person on the battlefield was completely focused on the events playing out above!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo longer was the lightning visible, nor Bai Xiaochun. Not even the Gold Core itself could be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing it was possible to see now was a field of endless gold!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one was able to determine whether Bai Xiaochun had succeeded. The ancient records didn’t contain detailed information about what could happen in a scenario like this. They only contained a general overview; currently, no one had any idea to judge what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing they could do now was wait!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heaven-Dao pressure slowly began to dissipate, and the golden light started to fade....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was looking anxiously up into the sky, countless thoughts running through their minds. However, all of them realized that this would likely be both the first and last time any of them ever saw someone reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same in both the River-Defying Sect and the Sky River Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the young man who had been fighting Bai Xiaochun earlier, he was shaking all over. The idea of Bai Xiaochun reaching Heaven-Dao Gold Core filled him with a level of dread he could never have even imagined before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no way he’s going to succeed!\" he shouted to himself, his expression distorting with rage. “There’s no way!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, even as the young man shouted to himself, the gold light faded away completely, and everyone caught sight of Bai Xiaochun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere he hovered, his eyes closed, his hair floating around him, his arms outstretched. Golden light shone from him, making him look like a celestial being. Everyone was completely shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when his eyes suddenly snapped open!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, rumblings like thunder echoed out in all directions, and at the same time, terrifying cultivation base fluctuations rolled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was something that a Foundation Establishment cultivator could not accomplish. That was something that came only with the power of a Gold Core!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Impossible!” the young man cried, his mind spinning. Cries of alarm rang out from the Sky River Court, whereas cheering could be heard from the River-Defying Sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did it work!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Junior Patriarch!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiaochun!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the cheers rang out, Bai Xiaochun hovered there, somewhat in a daze. He could sense the cultivation base power coursing through him, and felt his previous injuries and wounds vanishing. The power he was experiencing was not just from his fleshly body; it was a comprehensive power that gave him the feeling that a mere wave of his hand could crush everything around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, this is Gold Core, huh...?” he murmured. He could clearly sense that the nine spiritual seas inside of him were gone, and had been replaced by a spinning Gold Core!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was true Heaven-Dao Gold Core!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time the Gold Core spun, it released more power than the last time. As the cultivation base power poured through him, his body underwent a heaven-shaking, earth-toppling transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t just an addition to his longevity; he was ascending to a higher form of life. Everything around him now looked different than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were more colors, everything was more crisp and detailed, and he seemed closer to everything!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, a Heaven-Dao aura erupted out from him that far surpassed the aura from his days in Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment. It connected him to heaven and earth in such a way that he almost felt as if he had the power to summon heavenly lightning!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another indescribable feeling that existed inside of him, something like what he had experienced in the world of the Blood Ancestor. It was almost as if he were being doted upon by heaven and earth; when he looked up into the sky, it seemed strangely familiar to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gold Core!!” Clenching his hands into fists, he threw his head back and let loose a long cry. Everything around him shook, and the cultivators of the River-Defying Sect began to cheer even more loudly than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I can keep going!” he thought. Taking a deep breath, he sent his Undying Live Forever Technique into motion. Shockingly, an asura appeared behind him, then a second, a third, and a fourth....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne asura after another appeared, causing his energy to skyrocket. By this point, he was already far beyond the ordinary early Core Formation level. Everyone, especially the Chosen, were completely shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s... he\u0027s going to keep going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is this possible?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s fleshly body power. Don’t tell me he’s going to form a fleshly body Gold Core?!?!” Numerous onlookers were crying out in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping into Core Formation in the middle of a battlefield was a shocking thing in and of itself. But then he actually reached Heaven-Dao Gold Core, and after that, continued to increase his fleshly body power. The cultivators of both the River-Defying Sect and the Sky River Court were so shocked that they were going into a daze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as they went silent, a fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and finally, a ninth asura appeared behind him. Rumbling sounds filled heaven and earth as the energy of nine asuras caused everything to shake violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s breakthrough was not limited to his cultivation base; he was actually making progress with his Undying Asura Body!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nine asuras were like nine Dharma Idols, surrounding Bai Xiaochun and roaring into the heavens just like he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a sound that surpassed heavenly thunder, and caused everyone to be shaken to the core. Even the plants in the jungle were trembling, and all Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, and ordinary Core Formation cultivators felt their cultivation bases teetering unstably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasps and cries of astonishment could be heard everywhere!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, a tenth asura appeared next to the ninth one, and a massive tremor ran through Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in that moment that he could sense a shackle inside of him!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The five great shackles....” he murmured to himself. He had already broken through the first shackle back when he had mastered the Undying Skin. Now, the second shackle had appeared!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he couldn’t break through it at the moment, he could at least make contact!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo him, it felt as if four enormous mountains were weighing down onto him. It was something he couldn’t detect before, but now his senses were heightened, and the feeling couldn’t be clearer. He suddenly had the urge to destroy those mountains, to break free and truly rise up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m almost at the point of achieving the Undying Heavenly King Body. Once that happens, I can form an Undying Heavenly King Core!” As he thought back to the details of the second volume of the Undying Codex, his eyes shone with anticipation, and his heart thumped with excitement. At that point, he looked down at the young man he had been fighting before, who was now trembling with terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost as soon as their gazes met, the Heaven-Dao aura vanished, and the pressure faded away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man’s hair began to stand on end, and he started to back up. He really had no choice other than to give up on the fight; as of this moment, Bai Xiaochun filled him with indescribable terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that Bai Xiaochun was looking directly at him caused his heart to pound wildly. That gaze was like two sharp swords stabbing into his heart and mind, causing his Earth Core to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the same moment that the young man turned to flee, several streams of divine sense, as well as a group of cultivators, began to race toward him from the Sky River Court to save him. However, Bai Xiaochun was much closer to him than they were. He already had shocking speed back in Foundation Establishment, and now that he was in Heaven-Dao Gold Core, he was even faster!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not getting away!” he said, his voice as cold as ice. The young man had forced him to make the dangerous and potentially deadly choice of forcing Core Formation early. As a result, Bai Xiaochun’s killing intent surged with complete intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step forward, and wings sprouted behind him. The Mountain Shaking Bash gave him an explosive burst of speed, causing him to leave behind afterimages and a series of sonic booms. In the blink of an eye, he was right in front of the young Core Formation cultivator!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just hit me with a palm strike. Now it’s my turn!” His voice echoed out like the winter wind as he reached his hand back and then sent his palm flying toward the young man.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-338\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-340\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-339","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM"}
