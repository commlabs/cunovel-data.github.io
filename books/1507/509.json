The entirety of South Cleaving Pass seemed to be trembling. The sound of close-quarters fighting could be heard echoing about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more than ten thousand members of the Crow Divinity Tribe had bloodshot eyes as they fought with frenzied madness. Magical techniques were employed, as well as the explosive power of the five elements totem tattoos. Instantly, an indescribably shocking aura rose up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, a massacre began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Chen was no longer a youth. He looked like a grown man. However, this was not a change that happened because of the passage of time. Instead, it was the result of a baptism in the fires of war, a tempering that occurred within blood and gore. He looked far more mature than before, his face grave and stern. His eyes were filled with veins of blood and his body radiated killing intent and grim coldness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe attacked, Wood-type totems magically appeared. Glowing light rose up, surrounding his hands as he lifted the severed head of a Sea Demon Tribe Cultivator high up into the air. Blood dripped down his arm as he looked up to the sky and howled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround him, similar scenes played out with other Crow Divinity Tribe members. Whenever they killed someone, they would hold a severed head up to the sky. The auras they emanated were shocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo them, war was like breathing. Well, perhaps that is a bit of an exaggeration. In any case, they were long since accustomed to it. Years of campaigning and countless deaths made it so that all the members of the Crow Divinity Tribe did not pay too much attention to the difference between life and death. However, their determination to enter the Black Lands only continued to grow stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch determination caused them to be filled with the mad desire to slaughter anything that stood in their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir attacks were neat and tidy. They killed in the blink of an eye. The sight of blood spraying about did not cause them to tremble, but rather fueled their bloodthirsty desire to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill them!” It was hard to say who shouted it first. But soon, the voices of more than ten thousand Crow Divinity Tribe members joined together. The shocking roar of their shouts, filled with killing intents, rose up to the Heavens. The hearts of the Sea Demon Tribe Cultivators were instantly shaken. All of them felt their faces grow pale and their bravery drizzle away. The only thing they could do was fall back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a massacre, such a show by each and every member of the Crow Divinity Tribe, made it seem as if their Tribe were a tempest of slaughter, ready to sweep across South Cleaving Pass. After being engaged in a battle for only the space of a few breaths, the members of the Sea Demon Tribe had already lost several thousand Cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were incapable of withstanding even a single attack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This cannot be a Tribe from the North!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The North region doesn’t have any Tribes like this! Only great Tribes with Spirit Severing Patriarchs have Battle Tribes like this!!” Thoughts of disbelief filled the hearts and minds of the members of the Sea Demon Tribe. Such feelings turned into wellsprings of fear. They could not control the trembling they felt inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiserable screams could be heard, filled with despair and terror. Actually, for all of the members of the Sea Demon Tribe… it had been a very, very long time since they had experienced war. In the past, they had had their glories, but after the arrival of the Apocalypse, they had only encountered Tribes which would submit to them. This was the first time they had run into a Tribe which unexpectedly attacked with such savagery and fierceness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sea Demon Tribe had started out furious, but now, that fury had turned into dread. Dread, and screams that echoed out in all directions. The tens of thousands of other Tribe members down in the pass below watched on with wide eyes and gaping mouths. They panted, staring blankly at everything that was happening. The sounds of slaughter filled their ears, and any bit of courage in their hearts was washed away by the wailing and screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this made them feel as if what they were watching wasn’t even real. However, soon, all of the blood, all of the ruthlessness and slaughter on the battlefield, became incredibly clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is... the Crow Divinity Tribe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Crow Divinity Tribe… has become so powerful! In front of them, the Sea Demon Tribe is like dried up weeds and rotten wood, easily crushable!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe observing tens of thousands of Cultivators could only breath heavily, their hearts filled with intense shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance, the members of the Crow Divinity Tribe seemed like sharp arrows that could slash through anything that obstructed their way. They stabbed into South Cleaving Pass; there was not a Sea Demon Tribe Member they encountered who was capable of offering the least bit of resistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the course of their long campaign, the number of Nascent Soul Cultivators in the Crow Divinity Tribe had reached fourteen. Two were of the late Nascent Soul stage, five of the mid stage, and seven of the early stage. These fourteen Cultivators whistled through the air, slaughtering their way toward the Sea Demon Tribe’s Nascent soul Cultivators. The two forces slammed into each other with a bang, and deadly fighting broke out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooms echoed out, shaking the mountain peaks. The sound of the slaughter shook Heaven and Earth. As for Meng Hao, he floated in mid-air, looking around coldly. He did not need to attack; instead, his 150,000 neo-demons swept forth with crushing will. Any resistance was like trampling weeds and smashing rotten wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe neo-demons of the Sea Demon Tribe were instantly ripped into shreds, transformed into food. Meng Hao did nothing to gather them into his horde; after all… his neo-demons had been starving for months….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, Meng Hao’s neo-demon horde was enjoying a sumptuous feast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the Devil Spear in hand as his eyes swept over the battlefield. The air rippled as two old men appeared in front of him, having slipped past all obstructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cultivation bases of these two old men were not weak. Flames of fury raged in their eyes as divine abilities magically appeared. Totemic power exploded out like an ocean, transforming into the image of a Sea Demon that immediately shot toward Meng Hao, exuding massive pressure that weighed down on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s expression was the same as ever. He didn’t move other than to lift up the Devil Spear and stretch it out. Like a long dragon crossing a sea, devilish mist exploded out. Countless misty faces shot toward the two old men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao used none of his own power; this was purely the might of the Devil Spear. As of this moment, Meng Hao could sense that this spear would not last forever. After all, it was refined from a Devil Construct, and as time passed, the Devilish will inside would fade away. Before too much time passed, it would dissipate completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had nothing to do with whether or not Meng Hao used it. It would fade away either way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooming filled the air as the two old men shot backward, blood spraying from their mouths, faces filled with astonishment. Strands of Devilish mist bored into them, and ferocious mouths began to bite into them. The old men’s faces fell as they shot back. No longer did they harbor thoughts of attacking; unfortunately, they were immediately blocked by the Crow divinity Nascent Soul Cultivators who had been chasing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that ferocious roaring could suddenly be heard from within South Cleaving Pass. Suddenly, blue ripples appeared, shooting up into the air to form an expansive sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tens of thousands of Cultivators down below were panting. Some of them immediately recognized what these ripples were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sea Demon totem!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roaring and the spreading ripples seemed to cause the Sea Demon Tribe members, who were in the middle of being routed, to suddenly find hope within their despair. Their eyes instantly began to glow with wild joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the ground rumbled as an area within South Cleaving city suddenly collapsed. A blue beam of light shot up into the air. Ripples spread out like sea waves as it shot toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA creature appeared. Blue scales covered its body, giving it a bizarre appearance. It was shaped like a human, except that it had the tail of a fish, and four arms. Each of its four hands brandished a trident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour tridents all danced with lightning. The instant this creature appeared, a shocking aura exploded out. With a roar of fury, it shot toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore it could get close, a gust of wind blew through the air as the Outlander Beast appeared. As it slammed into the creature, the parrot also appeared, flapping its wings as it squawked:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No fur or feathers! Dammit! You also have no fur or feathers!! Beloved concubine, put it to death!” Amidst its high-pitched squawks, the parrot suddenly transformed into a spearhead which shot toward the totemic Sea Demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuge booms filled the air as vast quantities of Sea Demon Tribe members died. Blood rained down onto South Cleaving Pass. Even their souls were destroyed. The entire battlefield was a mass of redness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as if the Sea Demon Tribe was about to be completely exterminated. However, it was at this point that the Sea Demon Tribe Greatfather let out a miserable howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Main Tribe, save me!!” As his voice echoed out, South Cleaving Pass began to shake. Multiple fissures appeared on the surface of South Cleaving City and began to spread out rapidly, almost like lightning bolts. Many of the buildings within the city simply collapsed, causing dust to billow up into the air. A strange murmuring suddenly could be heard. It seemed as if this strange murmuring was a calling, a call to an enormous, ancient statue which existed beneath South Cleaving City. The statue slowly began to break out of the ground and rise up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was pitch black and had eight arms. At first, it seemed similar to the Sea Demon totem, however, the feeling it gave was one of complete ancientness. There also seemed to be some type of evil within the aura that emanated out from it. As it rose up, its closed eyes suddenly opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to be just a statue, however, in the blink of an eye, some sealing was apparently shattered and its soul suddenly awoke. Instantly, the power of this ancient statue’s soul exploded out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment its eyes opened, a tremor ran through Meng Hao’s body and a sense of profound deadly crisis filled him. Although his eyes went wide, he did not retreat in the slightest. His right hand lifted up and he hurled the Devil Spear toward the statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBZZZZZZ!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Devil Spear split the air, transforming into a beam of blackness that shot forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“South Cleaving Sentinel!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I… I read about that once in the ancient records! A total of one hundred were created in the Western Desert to defend against the great army of Southern Domain Cultivators. That’s a South Cleaving Sentinel!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Black-Armored Sentinel!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No wonder the Sea Demon Tribe could take over this area. Their totem is similar to this Black-Armored Sentinel. Don’t tell me… the Sea Demon Tribe is actually descended from this thing!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the tens of thousands of Cultivators below discussed the matter, the Devil Spear shredded through the air. In the blink of an eye, it was directly in front of the statue, heading toward its forehead, carrying with it a Devilish mist filled with countless vicious faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the statue completely ignored the Devil Spear. Its eyes glowed with a strange light as it stared at Meng Hao. In the exact moment that the Devil spear reached its head, its lips moved and it spoke a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Psyche.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only one word, but Meng Hao’s body trembled and blood sprayed from his mouth. He tumbled backward, face pale. It was as if his soul were about to be ripped into shreds. An intense pain suddenly stabbed out throughout his entire body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if this one word carried the power to cause anything the statue looked at to be destroyed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the three bandit Tribes on the other side of the pass exchanged glances. Suddenly, the three Greatfathers stepped forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They dared to attack the guardians of the pass, the Sea Demon Tribe!” they cried. “This is an opportunity we can’t pass up. We can’t just stand by and watch!” Hearing the voices of their Greatfathers, the members of the three bandit Tribes instantly shot toward South Cleaving Pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, they saw that Meng Hao had been injured, which changed the tide of the battle. Now was their chance to slaughter and plunder!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-505\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-507\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-506","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM"}
