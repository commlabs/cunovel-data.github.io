I made it to work, and then through most of my prelunch day in a kind of chilly fog. I couldn\u0027t get warm enough, despite wearing a cardigan over my blouse and a scarf that didn\u0027t match either one. It took me a few minutes longer to process requests than it should have, and I couldn\u0027t shake a feeling of dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon made no contact with me whatsoever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing on my smartphone or e-mail after my text last night. Nothing in my e-mail inbox. No interoffice note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence was excruciating. Especially when the day\u0027s Google alert hit my inbox and I saw the photos and phone videos of me and Gideon in Bryant Park. Seeing how we looked together - the passion and need, the painful longing on our faces, and the gratefulness of reconciliation - was bittersweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain twisted in my chest. Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we couldn\u0027t work this out, would I ever stop thinking about him and wishing we had?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled to pull myself together. Mark was meeting with Gideon today. Maybe that\u0027s why Gideon hadn\u0027t felt pressed to contact me. Or maybe he was just really busy. I knew he had to be, considering his business calendar. And as far as I knew, we still had plans to go to the gym after work. I exhaled in a rush and told myself that things would straighten out somehow. They just had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quarter to noon when my desk phone rang. Seeing from the readout that the call was coming from reception, I sighed with disappointment and answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Eva,\" Megumi said cheerily. \"You have a Magdalene Perez here to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I?\" I stared at my monitor, confused and irritated. Had the Bryant Park photos lured Magdalene out from under whatever troll bridge she called home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of the reason, I had no interest in talking to her. \"Keep her up there for me, will you? I have to take care of something first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I\u0027ll tell her to have a seat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up, then pulled out my smartphone and scrolled through the contact list until I found the number to Gideon\u0027s office. I dialed and was relieved when Scott answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Scott. It\u0027s Eva Tramell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Eva. Would you like to speak to Mr. Cross? He\u0027s in a meeting at the moment, but I can buzz him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No, don\u0027t bother him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a standing order. He won\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt soothed me immensely to hear that. \"I hate to throw this in your lap, but I have a request for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything you need. That\u0027s also a standing order.\" The amusement in his voice relaxed me further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Magdalene Perez is down here on the twentieth floor. Frankly, the only thing she and I have in common is Gideon, and that\u0027s not a good thing. If she has something to say, it\u0027s your boss she should be talking to. Could you please have someone escort her up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely. I\u0027ll take care of it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Scott. I appreciate you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my pleasure, Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up the phone and sagged back in my seat, feeling better already and proud of myself for not letting jealousy get the better of me. While I still really hated the idea of her having any of Gideon\u0027s time, I hadn\u0027t lied when I\u0027d said I trusted him. I believed he had strong, deep feelings for me. I just didn\u0027t know if they were enough to override his survival instinct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegumi called me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God,\" she said, laughing. \"You should\u0027ve seen her face when whoever that was came to get her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" I grinned. \"I figured she was up to no good. Is she gone, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" I crossed the narrow strip of hallway to Mark\u0027s door and poked my head in to see if he wanted me to pick him up some lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned, thinking about it. \"No, thanks. I\u0027ll be too nervous to eat until after the presentation with Cross. By then whatever you pick up will be hours old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about a protein smoothie, then? It\u0027ll give you some easy fuel until you can eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027d be great.\" His smile lit up his dark eyes. \"Something that goes good with vodka, just to get me in the mood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything you don\u0027t like? Any allergies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. See you in an hour.\" I knew just the place to go. The deli I had in mind was a couple blocks up and offered smoothies, salads, and a variety of made-to-order paninis with quick service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed downstairs and tried not to think about Gideon\u0027s radio silence. I\u0027d kind of expected to hear something after the Magdalene incident. Getting no reaction had me worrying all over again. I pushed out to the street through the revolving door and scarcely paid any attention to the man who climbed out of the back of a town car at the curb until he called my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, I found myself facing Christopher Vidal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh...Hi,\" I greeted him. \"How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better, now that I\u0027ve seen you. You look fantastic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I can say the same to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs different as he was from Gideon, he was gorgeous in his own way with his mahogany waves, grayish-green eyes, and charming smile. He was dressed in loose-fitting jeans and a cream V-neck sweater, a very sexy look for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you here to see your brother?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heading to lunch? I\u0027ll join you and explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was briefly reminded of Gideon\u0027s warning to stay away from Christopher, but by now I figured he trusted me. Especially with his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to a deli up the street,\" I said. \"If you\u0027re game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you want to see me about?\" I asked, too curious to wait. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-59.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
