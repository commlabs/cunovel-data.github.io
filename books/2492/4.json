We all stared at her and she shrugged nervously. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a cluster,\" Tiff said, wading into the conversational fray as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry shrugged. \"People need to go out with who they want. We can\u0027t pick who we\u0027re attracted to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff turned on him like a barracuda. \"Oh, and that worked out so well for you last year with Barbie,\" she voiced with dripping scorn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry flinched and Mia gave a small smile. I hadn\u0027t thought about Christi in a long time. I wonder what the skank was up to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo did Jonesy. \"Yeah, what\u0027s gorgeous bitch up to now?\" He looked around the group with interest. His focus was shifting to something more neutral. The whole group notched down. It was definitely a safer topic than Jonesy and Sophie\u0027s issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia shrugged and said, \"We\u0027re in the same grade and I see her around but...\" she looked down at her shoulder, deliberating. Her expression took on a made-up-her-mind look. \"I hear she still likes Bry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll our faces swung to Bry and John said, \"No way Weller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah man, what Terran said,\" Jonesy said and Bry narrowed his eyes on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t listen to you about chicks, Jones,\" Bry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s gives me butt-hurt ya know,\" Jonesy said with a small grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" Tiff said with a swift eye roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said, holding up my hands. They looked at me, Alex swiveling his neck to get the kinks out. I knew he was in pain from growing. His muscles and size were outstripping his energy and stamina. As if on cue he said, \"Did you remember the food, Caleb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"As I was saying, let\u0027s get in the hideaway and not stand out here for the world to notice...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn was already thumbing in the number combo of the great lock at the gate and pushing it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of us trooped after him with Jonesy and I carrying a great bundle of food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside the hideaway, we laid out the banquet and sat around on the milk crates, talking about everything when Sophie (Jonesy keeping a safe distance while covertly staring at her every other second) began talking about her AP class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, her zebra top undulating with the movement and Jonesy kept pace, yes indeedy. \"It\u0027s like I said, the drug will be tested on us Astral Projection peeps then it will go from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn palmed his chin thoughtfully. \"Has that been FDA-approved?\" He directed the question at Sophie but it was Alex that answered, \"Yes. All the right-wingers are freaking out about the \u0027sleep potential\u0027 for paranormals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy got a puzzled look and Alex gave an indulgent chuckle, hitching up his glasses, which didn\u0027t belong on that face anymore. Alex was an ugly duckling that had become a swan. It was just like the fairy tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jones, remember when we were talking about that drug they were going to shoot us up with to safeguard the mundanes when we slept?\" He quickly looked at John and clarified, \"Nulls excluded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn rolled his eyes. \"Right, thanks. I was really unclear on that point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex smiled. \"Anyway... it would stop the numbnuts of the world...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Carson,\" Tiff interjected helpfully. Alex nodded, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From torching people in their sleep...or...\" he shrugged his shoulders to his ears, momentarily looking like the Alex that I remembered from a year ago. Then he lowered them and the image was lost like smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about corpse-boy here?\" Jonesy asked, jerking a thumb toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Tiff yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy leveled a stare at her. \"Cool it, Tiff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry glowered. \"Knock it off Jones or I\u0027m gonna beat some manners into ya.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try it, Weller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was this shit? Testosterone Central?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy stood as well, his emotional net still poised to snap. \"I can\u0027t tell your sib to put a lid on it without you tearing another hole outta my ass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry thought about it. \"No. I can do it but you can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff said, \"I forgive you, Jonesy.\" She gave a look to Bry. \"Chill Bro, I\u0027ll live. I\u0027m just easily offended by Jonesy. He\u0027s always peeing in all the corners and I don\u0027t wanna clean up his mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, did Tiff have a way with words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade had a stunned look and Sophie began again in the middle of the tangled conversation. \"Anyway, there\u0027s a reason why they\u0027re beginning with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a Tone, Mom would\u0027ve spotted it a mile away. But her tone was different, edgy. I looked at Sophie, really looked at her. Beneath the careful artifice of her make-up lay circles under her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched as Jonesy recognized it too and struggled to appear indifferent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade walked over to Sophie and knelt down in front of her, she was careful not to touch bare skin. She rubbed a jean-clad knee. \"What\u0027s going on, Soph?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie had been looking down at Jade but lifted her face to the group and all of us sucked in a breath at the standing tears in her turquoise eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police are after a rapist,\" she whispered into the room and every guy tensed, our collective breath trapped in our lungs, the girls\u0027 eyes like saucers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade recovered first, \"That\u0027s terrible but, how does this affect you and what does it have to do with the drug?\" she asked, trying to make sense of the pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie looked at everyone and said something unexpected, \"I\u0027m really glad you guys came here today. I\u0027m glad that you have my back,\" her eyes avoided Jonesy\u0027s and he stood, striding over to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t hate you, Soph,\" he said, more serious than I\u0027d ever seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put a hand on her shoulder, so black against the zebra print of the shirt. \"Is someone trying to hurt you, Soph?\" he asked in a low voice. Every guy there heard the threat in his tone, the menace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buddy?\" he said, not able to rein in the clench of his free hand that didn\u0027t touch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u0027s eyes got wide and she looked at Jonesy. Somehow, even though she wasn\u0027t touching him he was leaking pretty good on her. I walked over and stood next to Jade where she still held onto Sophie\u0027s knee in a death-grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, her soft hair flying around her face. Jonesy unconsciously stroked her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what?\" he asked so softly everyone leaned in to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her head again. \"He\u0027s a teenager. He\u0027s going after the AP girls first, cuz it\u0027s easy. But the cops think he\u0027ll....\" she covered her face with her hands and Jade instinctively pulled her hands away from Sophie\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u0027s scream had me wrapped around her protectively in about three seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone rushed to Jade and she stared at Sophie in horror. \"We know him...\" Jade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie shook her head no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned Jade in my arms and shook her slightly. \"Who is this creep, Jade?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...I...think he\u0027s the same guy as the clairvoyance sample I worked on yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex came forward. \"What? You mean that one of your samples matches up with the AP attacker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, \"How would you know they\u0027re the same, Jade?\" He spread his hands out, like, explain please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pretty damn curious myself. It\u0027s not that I didn\u0027t care about Sophie. But Jade was my priority. I looked again at Sophie\u0027s dark circles and suddenly an idea occurred to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey...wait a sec...\" her face turned to me.\"You can\u0027t sleep, can you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn snapped his fingers as realization struck him between the eyes and Alex said, \"Of course. The perv uses his AP to attack the girls while they can\u0027t get away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, the AP girls could just get back into their bodies,\" Jonesy stated with his logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was damn fine as logic went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie said, \"No,\" she looked at him in despair. \"If the drug becomes mandatory, we\u0027ll be trapped there. With him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys looked at the girls assembled in the room and wondered how to fight something we couldn\u0027t see. Someone that could be everywhere at any time, harming girls we cared about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex\u0027s raging strength wouldn\u0027t help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy corpse-affinity wouldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy could light the world up like a strobe and it wouldn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy\u0027s eyes met mine. The raw emotion standing there for all of us to see, his hand left its spot on Sophie\u0027s shoulder and wound around the back of her neck, pressing her face against his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoulders trembled as she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls were trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeginning with Soph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked Jade to her Empath class first block. She\u0027d be there for an hour and a half while I was with Smith and Tiff \"learning\" about Life Transference in Theory. Dad told me I shouldn\u0027t say that I actually was the proof behind the theory. I\u0027d have to get into all the nastiness of sucking the life out of that assassin and all the explanations that would mean for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade twirled into my arms, giving me a quick peck, looking for Griswold or someone like her. Seeing we were in the clear, she brushed the softest velvet caress against my lips. We clung for a moment then I let her go, reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung onto her arm when she would have gone inside and her black eyebrows arched in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find that sample, Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered. \"I don\u0027t want to touch that again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her steady eyes. \"If you don\u0027t do this, he can go after Sophie... other girls. Eventually, he could get to you too. The sooner we get a handle on who he may be, the faster the cops can nab his sleazy ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed her hands up and down her arms, gooseflesh rising in aggressive bumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer luminous eyes met mine. \"It was so awful,\" she whispered, biting her lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited. I hated to press her about something that I knew was hurting or frightening her, but the alternative sucked ass so here it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she nodded. \"I\u0027ll try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" I said, relieved as I pressed her head underneath mine and met Tulle\u0027s angry eyes over her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for seeing Miss LeClerc off so thoroughly,\" she said with thinly veiled sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, letting Jade go. As Jade walked through the door I said, \"Why don\u0027t you tell Miss Tulle what\u0027s going on. Maybe she\u0027ll catch a clue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTulle stomped out into the hall, trying to look intimidating (she had nothing on Griswold) and said, \"You\u0027re so clever, Mr. Hart. Why don\u0027t you enlighten me about what was so important you had to stand out in the school hall pawing Miss LeClerc and making her tardy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about an expected response that wouldn\u0027t get my nuts in the cruncher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA safe answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I did a Jonesy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, that really isn\u0027t me pawing. Pawing is much more intimate, Ms. Tulle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade stood behind Tulle and rolled her eyes at me. She couldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d said that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t either. But, I was an okay student (okay, not stellar) and didn\u0027t cause trouble, so why get up my ass?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes shifted back and forth, gauging my expression. \"I think Ms. Chen needs a little visit from you, Mr. Hart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned. \"I\u0027ll miss AFTD.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike I cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tough, you should have considered that consequence when you got all mouthy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice. \"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed her finger in the direction of the principal\u0027s office and I stalked off, silently thanking her for the directional clue. I totally didn\u0027t know where the office was. Retarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Chen sat across from me in all her black sternness, leg swinging her stiletto pump back and forth, back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Hart... Caleb...\" she began, spreading her palms on either side of her, the width of them swallowed by the mondo desk that she sat behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" I asked, looking mild and innocent. Jonesy could have never pulled it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at her pulse and depressed her thumb, then lifted it, sliding it across the desk to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell me what you see there.\" She tapped a white-tipped fingernail on the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudia, Caleb Hart keeps jamming his tongue down the throat of my sophomore Empath, Jade LeClerc. Normally, I don\u0027t butt my nose in too much but he hovers around the girl so much that I think his powers of distraction linger even after the bell rings. Will you get him to cool it? They behave in a very mature way that is not becoming to the student body as a whole.- Tulle, Megan, KPH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid it back to Chen. Yeah, that was definitely Jade and I, dry humping in the hall. Couldn\u0027t Tulle gnaw on someone\u0027s ass that was really causing problems? Like Brett... or better yet, that creeper that was stalking the chicks. Yeah, him. I felt my blood start to boil and made a conscious effort to loosen my hands and wrap them on the armrests of the chair I was sprawled in. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-screams-death-4/page-4.html","bookId":2492,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM"}
