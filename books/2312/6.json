What he had learned was that Crowder rhymed with powder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter her departure, after his own shower, he paced back and forth trying to sort it all out. In the few hours since his arrival in Martingale, he’d slept with a woman who turned out to be the loving daughter of the target and, in all likelihood, the unloving wife of the client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, maybe not. Lyman Crowder was a rich man, lived north of town on a good-sized ranch that he ran pretty much as a hobby. He’d made his real money in oil, and nobody ever made a small amount of money that way. You either went broke or got rich. Rich men had enemies. People they’d crossed in business, people who stood to profit from their death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it figured that Yarnell was the client. There was a kind of poetic inevitability about it. She picks him up in the lounge, it’s not enough that she’s the target’s daughter. She also ought to be the client’s wife. Round things out, tie up all the loose ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing to do… well, he knew the thing to do. The thing to do was get a few hours’ sleep and then, bright and early, reverse the usual order of affairs by riding off into the sunrise. Get on a plane, get off in New York, and write off Martingale as a happy little romantic adventure. Men, after all, had been known to travel farther than that in the hope of getting laid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d tell the man in White Plains to find somebody else. Sometimes you had to do that. No blame attached, as long as you didn’t make a habit of it. He’d say he was blown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich, come to think of it, he was. Quite expertly, as a matter of fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning he got up and packed his carry-on. He’d call White Plains from the airport, or wait until he was back in New York. He didn’t want to phone from the room. When the real Dale Whitlock had a fit and called American Express, they’d look over things like the Holiday Inn statement. No sense leaving anything that led anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about June, and the memory made him playful. He checked the time. Eight o’clock, two hours later in the East, not an uncivil time to call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called Whitlock’s home in Rowayton, Connecticut. A woman answered. He identified himself as a representative of a political polling organization, using a name she would recognize. By asking questions that encouraged lengthy responses, he had no trouble keeping her on the phone. “Well, thank you very much,” he said at length. “And have a nice day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let Whitlock explain that one to American Express. He finished packing and was almost out the door when his eye caught the paperback western. Take it along? Leave it for the maid? What?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked it up, read the cover line, sighed. Was this what Randolph Scott would do? Or John Wayne, or Clint Eastwood? How about Jack Elam?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, of course not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause then there’d be no movie. A man rides into town, starts to have a look at the situation, meets a woman, gets it on with her, then just backs out and rides off? You put something like that on the screen, it wouldn’t even play in the art houses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, this wasn’t a movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the book and wanted to heave it across the room. But all he heaved was a sigh. Then he unpacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was having a cup of coffee in town when a pickup pulled up across the street and two men got out of it. One of them was Lyman Crowder. The other, not quite as tall, was twenty pounds lighter and twenty years younger. Crowder’s son, by the looks of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis son-in-law, as it turned out. Keller followed the two men into a store where the fellow behind the counter greeted them as Lyman and Hobie. Crowder had a lengthy shopping list composed largely of items Keller would have been hard put to find a use for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the owner filled the order, Keller had a look at the display of hand-tooled boots. The pointed toes would be handy in New York, he thought, for killing cockroaches in corners. The heels would add better than an inch to his height. He wondered if he’d feel awkward in the boots, like a teenager in her first pair of high heels. Lyman and Hobie looked comfortable enough in their boots, as pointy in the toes and as elevated in the heels as any on display, but they also looked comfortable in their string ties and ten-gallon hats, and Keller was sure he’d feel ridiculous dressed like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were a pair, he thought. They looked alike, they talked alike, they dressed alike, and they seemed uncommonly fond of one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in his room, Keller stood at the window and looked down at the parking lot, then across the way at a pair of mountains. A few years ago his work had taken him to Miami, where he’d met a Cuban who’d cautioned him against ever taking a hotel room above the second floor. “Suppose you got to leave in a hurry?” the man said. “Ground floor, no problem. Second floor, no problem. Third floor, break your fockeen leg.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe logic of this had impressed Keller, and for a while he had made a point of taking the man’s advice. Then he happened to learn that the Cuban not only shunned the higher floors of hotels but also refused to enter an elevator or fly in an airplane. What had looked like tradecraft now appeared to be nothing more than phobia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt struck Keller that he had never in his life had to leave a hotel room, or any other sort of room, by the window. This was not to say that it would never happen, but he’d decided it was a risk he was prepared to run. He liked high floors. Maybe he even liked running risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the phone, made a call. When she answered he said, “This is Tex. Would you believe my business appointment canceled? Left me with the whole afternoon to myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you where I left you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve barely moved since then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, don’t move now,” she said. “I’ll be right on over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround nine that night Keller wanted a drink, but he didn’t want to have it in the company of adulterers and their favorite music. He drove around in his palomino Caprice until he found a place on the edge of town that looked promising. It called itself Joe’s Bar. Outside it was nondescript. Inside it smelled of stale beer and casual plumbing. The lights were low. There was sawdust on the floor and the heads of dead animals on the walls. The clientele was exclusively male, and for a moment this gave Keller pause. There were gay bars in New York that tried hard to look like this place, though it was hard for Keller to imagine why. But Joe’s, he realized, was not a gay bar, not in any sense of the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on a wobbly stool and ordered a beer. The other drinkers left him alone, even as they left each other alone. The jukebox played intermittently, with men dropping in quarters when they could no longer bear the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe songs, Keller noted, ran to type. There were the tryin’-to-drink-that-woman-off-of-my-mind songs and the if-it-wasn’t-for-bad-luck-I-wouldn’t-have-no-luck-at-all songs. Nothing about Celia in the Jackson Park Inn, nothing about heaven being just a sin away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese songs were for drinking and feeling really rotten about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ ’Nother damn day,” said a voice at Keller’s elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew who it was without turning. He supposed he might have recognized the voice, but he didn’t think that was it. No, it was more a recognition of the inevitability of it all. Of course it would be Yarnell, making conversation with him in this bar where no one made conversation with anyone. Who else could it be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ ’Nother damn day,” Keller agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t believe I’ve seen you around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m just passing through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you got the right idea,” Yarnell said. “Name’s Bart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn for a pound, in for a ton. “Dale,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good to know you, Dale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Same here, Bart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender loomed before them. “Hey, Hobie,” he said. “The usual?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYarnell nodded. “And another of those for Dale here.” The bartender poured Yarnell’s usual, which turned out to be bourbon with water back, and uncapped another beer for Keller. Somebody broke down and fed the jukebox a quarter and played “There Stands the Glass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYarnell said, “You hear what he called me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t paying attention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Called me Hobie,” Yarnell said. “Everybody does. You’ll be doing the same, won’t be able to help yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The world is a terrible place,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By God, you got that right,” Yarnell said. “No one ever said it better. You a married man, Dale?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not at the moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ ‘Not at the moment.’ I swear I’d give a lot if I could say the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Troubles?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Married to one woman and in love with another one. I guess you could call that trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess you could.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sweetest, gentlest, darlingest, lovingest creature God ever made,” Yarnell said. “When she whispers ‘Bart’ it don’t matter if the whole rest of the world shouts ‘Hobie.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t your wife you’re talking about,” Keller guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, no! My wife’s a round-heeled, mean-spirited, hard-hearted tramp. I hate my damn wife. I love my girlfriend.” They were silent for a moment, and so was the whole room. Then someone played “The Last Word in Lonesome Is Me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They don’t write songs like that anymore,” Yarnell said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hell they didn’t. “I’m sure I’m not the first person to suggest this,” Keller said, “but have you thought about-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leaving June,” Yarnell said. “Running off with Edith. Getting a divorce.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never an hour that I don’t think about it, Dale. Night and goddam day I think about it. I think about it and I drink about it, but the one thing I can’t do is do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is a man,” Yarnell said, “who is a father and a best friend to me all rolled into one. Finest man I ever met in my life, and the only wrong thing he ever did in his life was have a daughter, and the biggest mistake I ever made was marrying her. And if there’s one thing that man believes in it’s the sanctity of marriage. Why, he thinksdivorce is the dirtiest word in the language.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Yarnell couldn’t even let on to his father-in-law that his marriage was hell on earth, let alone take steps to end it. He had to keep his affair with Edith very much Back Street. The only person he could talk to was Edith, and she was out of town for the next week or so, which left him dying of loneliness and ready to pour out his heart to the first stranger he could find. For which he apologized, but-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, that’s all right, Bart,” Keller said. “A man can’t keep it all locked up inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calling me Bart, I appreciate that. I truly do. Even Lyman calls me Hobie and he’s the best friend any man ever had. Hell, he can’t help it. Everybody calls me Hobie sooner or later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” Keller said. “I’ll hold out as long as I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone, Keller reviewed his options. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-man-keller-1/page-6.html","bookId":2312,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM"}
