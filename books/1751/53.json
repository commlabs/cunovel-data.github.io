Vernadsky, who had cooked for himself in his college days, was in charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the steaming stew off the Short-wave heater and said, \"Calories, anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ladled the stuff lavishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It smells very good,\" said Novee doubtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted a piece of meat with his fork. It was purplish and still felt tough despite internal heating. The shredded herbs that surrounded it seemed softer, but looked less edible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Vernadsky, \"eat it. Put it in your mouth. I\u0027ve tasted it and it\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crammed his mouth and chewed. He kept on chewing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tough, but good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFawkes said gloomily, \"It\"ll probably kill us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nuts,\" said Vemadsky. \"The rats have been living on it for two weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two weeks isn\u0027t much,\" said Noveee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRodriguez said, \"Well, one bite won\u0027t kill. Say, it is good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was. They all agreed eventually. So far, it seemed that whenever Junior\u0027s life could be eaten at all, it was good. The grains were almost impossible to grind into flour, but that done,\" a protein-high bread could be baked. There was some on the table now, dark and heavy. It wasn\u0027t bad, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFawkes had studied the herb life on Junior and come to the conclusion that an acre of Junior\u0027s surface, properly seeded and watered, could support ten times the number of grazing animals that an acre of Earthly alfalfa could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield had been impressed; had spoken of Junior as the granary of a hundred worlds, but Fawkes dismissed his own statements with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Sucker bait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a week earlier, the party had been agitated by the sudden refusal of the hamsters and white rats to touch certain new herbs Fawkes had brought in. Mixing small quantities with regular rations had resulted in the death of those that fed on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolution?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot quite. Vernadsky came in a few hours later and said calmly, \"Copper, lead, and mercury.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" said Cimon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those plants. They\u0027re high in heavy metals. Probably an evolutionary development to keep from being eaten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first settlers-\" began Cimon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, That\u0027s impossible. Most of the plants are perfectly all right. Just these, and no person would eat them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rats didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re just rats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was what Vernadsky was waiting for. He said dramatically, \"You may hail a modest martyr to science. I tasted the stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" yelled Novee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a lick. Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m the careful-type martyr. Anyway, the stuff is as bitter as strychnine. What do you expect? If a plant is going to fill itself with lead just to keep the animals off, what good does it do the plant to have the animal find out by dying after he\u0027s eaten it? A little bitter stuff in addition acts as a warning. The combination warning and punishment does the trick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" said Novee, \"it wasn\u0027t heavy metal poisoning that killed she settlers. The symptoms aren\u0027t right for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest knew the symptoms well enough. Some in lay terms and some in more technical language. Difficult and painful breathing that grew steadily worse. That\u0027s what it amounted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFawkes put down his fork. \"Look here, suppose this stuff contains some alkaloid that paralyzes the nerves that control the lung muscles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rats have lung muscles,\" said Vemadsky. \"It doesn\u0027t kill them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s a cumulative thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. All right. Any time your breathing gets painful go back to ship rations and see if you improve. But no fair counting psychosomatics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield grunted, \"That\u0027s my job. Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFawkes drew a deep breath, then another. Glumly he put another piece of meat into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one corner of the table, Mark Annuncio, eating more slowly than the rest, thought of Norris Vinograd\u0027s monograph on \"Taste and Smell.\" Vinograd had made a taste-smell classification based on enzyme inhibition patterns within the taste buds. Annuncio did not know what that meant exactly but he remembered the symbols, their values, and the descriptive definitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he placed the taste of the stew to three subclassifications, he finished his helping. His jaws ached faintly because of the difficult chewing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-53.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
