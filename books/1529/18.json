The raging fires hampered further investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only solid news was bad. The original med-van team had been discovered in an abandoned field, each shot in the head. He had four folders on his desk. He sank to his seat. On top of everything else, he had four hard calls to make before dawn. To their families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter\u0027s aide, Brant, wheeled into his doorway. \"Sorry, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter nodded to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have Dr. McKnight holding on your third line. He\u0027s available for phone or video conferencing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter pointed a thumb at the fiery screen. \"I\u0027ve seen enough of this for the moment. Patch Sean through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter peeled the headset out of his ear. He swore he might as well have one surgically implanted. He swung around to face the screen as the emergency scene dissolved away, replaced by the face of his boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean McKnight had founded Sigma but had since been promoted to the head of DARPA. Painter had placed a call to him as soon as Seichan had crashed into Gray\u0027s life. Both for his advice and expertise. But also for one more pressing reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the Guild is back on our doorstep,\" Sean said. He combed his fingers through his graying red hair. It was mussed, and it looked like he had been summoned directly from his bed. But his white shirt was creased and pressed. A navy pinstripe jacket lay over an arm of his chair. Ready for a long day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Guild may be more than on our doorstep,\" Painter said. \"Current in-tel suggests they may be through the door already.\" Painter tapped a folder behind him. \"You\u0027ve already read the sit-op.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nod answered him. \"Plainly the Guild knew about the safe house. Knew Gray was headed there with their AWOL operative. We have a leak somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid we have to assume that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. If true, it was disastrous. The Guild had infiltrated Sigma once before, but Painter would swear his organization was clean now. After the last mole had been exposed, Painter had burned Sigma to its roots and rebuilt it from the ground up, with hundreds of safeguards and countermeasures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll for nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there was still a leak, the very foundation of Sigma might be suspect. It could mean the dissolution of the organization. An internal audit was already under way, a cost-benefit analysis of Sigma\u0027s basic command structure, under the guise of unifying U.S. intelligence-gathering services within Homeland Security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut worst of all, there was a more intimate cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter had the four folders waiting on his desk to remind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean continued. \"It is not just our division that is plagued by this terrorist-for-hire network. Two months ago, MI6 cleared a cell that had infiltrated a British Aerospace\u0027s black-ops project outside of Glasgow. They lost five agents in the process. The Guild is everywhere and nowhere. Here at home, the NSA and the CIA are still trying to figure out who the Guild\u0027s Osama is. We know next to nothing about their leader or their main players. We don\u0027t even know if they are called the Guild. The derivation of that name came out of a nickname by an SAS officer, now deceased. Still, apparently the various cells have taken on the name as their own, at first mockingly, then perhaps more genuinely. We know that little about the network.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left this last hanging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter understood. \"And now we have a defector.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean sighed. \"We\u0027ve been trying to get a foothold in the organization for years. I\u0027ve proposed several scenarios. But nothing as efficient as having an operative, one of the Guild elite, drop into our laps. We must secure her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the Guild will try just as hard to stop that from happening. They\u0027ve made that plain. To eliminate her, they\u0027ve chosen to expose their own infiltration into Sigma. A costly choice. And to carry it out, they\u0027ve sent their best and most elusive operative. Another of their elite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the video of the man at the safe house. Read his dossier.\" Sean grimaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter had read the same. The Butcher of Calcutta. His true origin and allegience was unknown. Of mixed descent, he had posed in the past as Indian, Pakistani, Iraqi, Egyptian, and Libyan. If Seichan had a male counterpart, it would be this man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have one lead,\" Painter said. \"We were able to pick out his name off the video feed. Nasser. But that\u0027s the best we could manage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean waved a dismissive hand. \"His aliases are as numerous as his assassinations. He\u0027s left a bloody trail all around the world, mostly concentrating in North Africa and throughout the Middle and Near East. Though just recently he\u0027s extended deeper into the Mediterranean. The garroting of an archaeologist in Greece. The assassination of a museum curator in Italy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter\u0027s attention hardened back to the screen. \"In Italy? Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Venice. A curator found shot in the prisons below the Duke\u0027s Palace. Nasser—or whatever his real name is—was seen in surveillance footage of the piazza outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter rubbed his chin, hard enough to burn the stubble. \"I received a call earlier from Monsignor Verona at the Vatican. The details should be in the sit-op report. There is a good chance that Seichan was also attempting some action in Italy at around that time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean\u0027s eyes slowly narrowed. \"Interesting. It\u0027s a coincidence that bears further investigation. Both assassins in Italy. Now they\u0027re here. One hunting the other. Two master assassins, the best of the Guild. And if nothing else, Nasser has driven Seichan into our arms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr rather into Gray\u0027s arms, Painter added silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need that woman in custody. Immediately. To lose this chance is beyond acceptable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter understood the severity of the situation, but he also knew Gray, how his mind worked. If anyone had a level of paranoia equal to his own, it was Gray. Custody could prove to be a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, Commander Pierce is on the run. Ambushed at the safe house, he must suspect a leak like we do. He\u0027ll go into hiding with her. Lay low until he feels it\u0027s safe to come out of the cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We may not have that long to wait. Not with the Butcher of Calcutta hunting them both now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander Pierce must be found, brought back in with her. I have no choice but to expand the search, to contact local authorities and the FBI. I\u0027ve already ordered a search of all hospitals and medical facilities. We can\u0027t let him go to ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, 1 would prefer to give Commander Pierce some leeway to address the situation. The more light shone in his direction, the more likely it will draw the attention of Nasser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If so, then we attempt to apprehend two Guild operatives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter could not keep the shock from his voice. \"By using Gray as bait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean stared out of the monitor. Painter read the stiffness of his posture. He also noted again the pressed jacket and shirt. Painter suddenly realized he had not been the first one to have Sean\u0027s ear this night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This decision was made by Homeland. Signed by the president. There will be no countermanding it.\" Sean firmed his voice. \"Gray and this Guild agent must be found and brought in by whatever force necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter found no words to argue. There could be none. It was a new world. He slowly nodded. He would cooperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, in his heart, he knew Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the run, hunted by both sides, the man would prove formidable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would hide deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:04 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I spotted a Starbucks in the lobby downstairs,\" Kowalski mumbled. \"Maybe it\u0027s open now. Anyone want a cup of Joe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We stay put,\" Gray said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski shook his head. \"No fucking kidding. It was a joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring him, Gray continued to examine Seichan\u0027s broken obelisk. They were gathered in the small reception room of a dental office. At his elbow, a table lamp illuminated the cramped space, decorated in the typical cookie-cutter manner: months-old magazines, generic watercolors, an anemic potted ficus plant, and a dark wall-mounted television.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty minutes ago the group had followed the woodland trail to the edge of Glover-Archibold Park. It had ended at a street that separated the park from the Georgetown University campus. At that hour, there had been no cars, no traffic. They had hurried across the street, slipped between two darkened research buildings, and reached the university\u0027s Dental Annex. The hospital proper lay beyond, lit brightly. They had dared not go that far, risk that level of exposure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they made other arrangements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the dental-room reception, Kowalski swore quietly and folded his arms, plainly bored but still on edge. They all awaited word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s taking so goddamn long?\" Kowalski grumbled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had learned the man was a former seaman with the U.S. Navy. He\u0027d been recruited into Sigma following his assistance with a Sigma operation in Brazil, not as an agent, but as muscle. He had tried to show Gray his scars from that mission as they waited, but Gray declined. The man did not know how to shut up. No wonder he\u0027d been assigned to guard duty. Alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Kowalski\u0027s ongoing commentary had not fallen on deaf ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the room, Gray\u0027s father lay sprawled over three chairs, eyes closed but not sleeping. It took an effort to maintain that deep frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re some sort of science spy,\" his father had said earlier. figures. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray still didn\u0027t know what his father meant by that, but now was not the time to confront the issue. The sooner he could get Seichan patched up and away from his parents. . . the better for all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray continued his examination. He turned the obelisk around, studying every surface. The black stone was ancient, pitted and scored, but was otherwise nondescript. It looked Egyptian, but it was not his area of expertise. Even his assessment of origin might have been clouded by the failed assassin\u0027s Egyptian accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut one feature of the obelisk was definitely not natural to the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned the broken top section on end. Protruding from the bottom was a bar of silver, about the thickness of his smallest finger. He touched it. Gray knew it was the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Something had been hidden at the heart of the obelisk. Looking more carefully at the broken end, he was able to make out an old cemented seam in the stone, invisible from the outside. The obelisk was really two pieces of marble craftily glued together, hiding something within. Like carving out the pages of a book to hide a gun or valuables. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-18.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
