Why, have you forgot all I told you, already, about you know who? Why I never knew the like! Why he’ll be fit to kill himself! I’ll never tell you any thing again, if you beg me on your knees! so there’s the end to your knowing any more of my secrets! and you’ve nobody but yourself to thank, if it vexes you never so!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs Hart interrupted this murmuring, by enquiring who was the Sir that Miss Pierson expected; adding that, if it were the shop-man, it would be more proper Miss Pierson should go down stairs, than that she should let him come up to her room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘The shop-man?’ repeated Flora, simpering, and winking at Juliet; ‘no, indeed, Mrs Hart; you have not made a very good guess there! Has she, Miss Ellis? I don’t think a man of quality, and a baronet, is very like a shop-man! Do you, Miss Ellis?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This blundering simplicity of vanity was not lost upon Mrs Hart. ‘O ho!’ she cried, ‘you expect a baronet, do you, then, Miss Pierson? Why there were no less than two Baronets in the shop as I came through, just now; and there’s one of them this minute crossing the way, and turning the corner.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘O Me! is he gone, then?’ cried Flora, looking out of the window. ‘O Me! what shall I do? O Miss Ellis! this is all your fault! And now, perhaps, he’ll be so angry he’ll never speak to me again! And if he don’t, ten to one but it may break my heart! for that often happens when one’s crossed in love. And if it does, I sha’n’t thank you for it, I assure you! And it’s just as likely as not!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Juliet, though she sought to appease both her grief and her wrath, could not but rejoice that their unguarded redundance informed Mrs Hart of the whole history: and Mrs Hart, who, though a plain, appeared to be a very worthy woman, immediately endeavoured to save the poor young creature, from the snares into which she was rather wilfully jumping, than deludedly falling, by giving her a pressing invitation to her own house for the rest of the day. But to this, neither entreaty nor reproof could obtain consent. Flora, like many who seem gentle, was only simple; and had neither docility nor comprehension for being turned aside from the prosecution of her wishes. To be thwarted in any desire, she considered as cruelty, and resented as ill treatment. She refused, therefore, to leave the house, while hoping for the return of Sir Lyell; and continued her childish wailing and fretting, till accident led her eyes to a favourite little box; when, her tears suddenly stopping, and her face brightening, she started up, seized, opened it, and, displaying a very pretty pair of ear-rings, exclaimed, ‘Oh, I have never shewn you my presents, Miss Ellis! And now Mrs Hart may have a peep at them, too. So she’s in pretty good luck, I think!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then, with exulting pleasure, she produced all the costly trinkets that she had received from Sir Lyell; with some few, less valuable, which had been presented to her by Sir Jaspar; and all the baubles, however insignificant or babyish, that had been bestowed upon her by her friends and relatives, from her earliest youth. And these, with the important and separate history of each, occupied, unawares, her time, till the return of Miss Matson.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs Hart then descended, and, urged by Juliet, briefly and plainly communicated the situation and the danger of the young apprentice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Matson, affrighted for the credit of her shop, determined to send for the mother of Flora, who resided at Lewes, the next day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Relieved now from her troublesome and untoward charge, Juliet had her door opened, and re-took possession of her room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And there, a new view of her own helpless and distressed condition, filled and dejected her with new alarm. The licentiously declared purpose of Sir Lyell had been shocking to her ears; and the consciousness that he knew that she was informed of his intention added to its horrour, from her inability to shew her resentment, in the only way that suited her character or her disposition, that of positively seeing him no more. But how avoid him while she had no other means of subsistence than working in an open shop?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The following morning but too clearly justified her apprehensive prognostics, of the improprieties to which her defenceless state made her liable. At an early hour, Sir Lyell, gay, courteous, gallant, entered the shop, under pretence of enquiring for Sir Jaspar; whom he knew to be invisible, from his infirmities, to all but his own nurses and servants, till noon. Miss Matson was taciturn and watchful, though still, from the fear of making an enemy, respectful; while Flora, simpering and blushing, was ready to jump into his arms, in her eagerness to apologize for not having waited alone for him, according to his directions: but he did not look at Miss Matson, though he addressed her; nor address Flora, though, by a side glance, he saw her expectations; his attention, from the moment that he had asked, without listening to any answer, whether he could see Sir Jaspar, was all, and even publicly devoted to Juliet; whom he approached with an air of homage, and accosted with the most flattering compliments upon her good looks and her beauty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Juliet turned aside from him, with an indignant disgust, in which she hoped he would read her resentment of his scheme, and her abhorrence of his principles. But those who are deep in vice are commonly incredulous of virtue. Sir Lyell took her apparent displeasure, either for a timidity which flattery would banish, or an hypocrisy which boldness would conquer. He continued, therefore, his florid adulation to her charms; regarding the heightened colour of offended purity, but as an augmented attraction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Juliet perceived her failure to repress his assurance, with a disturbance that was soon encreased, by the visible jealousy manifested in the pouting lips and frowning brow of Flora; who, the moment that Sir Lyell, saying that he would call upon Sir Jaspar again, thought it prudent to retire, began a convulsive sobbing; averring that she saw why she had been betrayed; for that it was only to inveigle away her sweetheart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pity for the ignorant accuser, might have subdued the disdain due to the accusation, and have induced Juliet to comfort her by a self-defence; but for a look, strongly expressing a suspicion to the same effect, from Miss Matson; which was succeeded by a general tossing up of the chins of the young work-women, and a murmur of, ‘I wonder how she would like to be served so herself!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was too offensive to be supported, and she retired to her chamber.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If, already, the mingled frivolity and publicity of the business into which she had entered, had proved fatiguing to her spirits, and ungenial to her disposition; surmises, such as she now saw raised, of a petty and base rivality, urged by a pursuit the most licentious, rendered all attempt at its continuance intolerable. Without, therefore, a moment’s hesitation, she determined to relinquish her present enterprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The only, as well as immediate notion that occurred to her, in this new difficulty, was to apply to Mrs Hart, who seemed kind as well as civil, for employment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When she was summoned, therefore, by Miss Matson, with surprize and authority, back to the shop, she returned equipped for going abroad; and, after thanking her for the essay which she had permitted to be made in the millinery-business, declared that she found herself utterly unfit for so active and so public a line of life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leaving then Miss Matson, Flora, and the young journey-women to their astonishment, she bent her course to the house of Mrs Hart; where her application was happily successful. Mrs Hart had work of importance just ordered for a great wedding in the neighbourhood, and was glad to engage so expert a hand for the occasion; agreeing to allow, in return, bed, board, and a small stipend per day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With infinite relief, Juliet went back to make her little preparations, and take leave of Miss Matson; by whom she was now followed to her room, with many earnest instances that she would relinquish her design. Miss Matson, in unison with the very common character to which she belonged, had appreciated Juliet not by her worth, her talents, or her labours, but by her avowed distress, and acknowledged poverty. Notwithstanding, therefore, her abilities and her industry, she had been uniformly considered as a dead weight to the business, and to the house. But now, when it appeared that the pennyless young woman had some other resource, the eyes of Miss Matson were suddenly opened to merits to which she had hitherto been blind. She felt all the advantages which the shop would lose by the departure of such an assistant; and recollected the many useful hints, in fashion and in elegance, which had been derived from her taste and fancy: her exemplary diligence in work; her gentle quietness of behaviour; and the numberless customers, which the various reports that were spread of her history, had drawn to the shop. All, now, however, was unavailing; the remembrance of what was over occurred too late to change the plan of Juliet; though a kinder appreciation of her character and services, while she was employed, might have engaged her to try some other method of getting rid of the libertine Baronet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Matson then admonished her not to lose, at least, the benefit of her premium.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘What premium?’ cried Juliet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Why that Sir Jaspar paid down for you.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Juliet, astonished, now learnt, that her admission as an inmate of the shop, which she had imagined due to the gossipping verbal influence of Miss Bydel, was the result of the far more substantial money-mediation of Sir Jaspar.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She felt warmly grateful for his benevolence; yet wounded, in reflecting upon his doubts whether she deserved it; and confounded to owe another, and so heavy an obligation, to an utter stranger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was finishing her little package, when the loud sobbings of Flora, while mounting the stairs for a similar, though by no means as voluntary a purpose, induced her to go forth, with a view to offer some consolation; but Flora, not less resentful than disconsolate, said that her mother was arrived to take her from all her fine prospects; and loaded Juliet with the unqualified accusation, of having betrayed her secrets, and ruined her fortune.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Juliet had too strong a mind to suffer weak and unjust censure to breed any repentance that she had acted right. She could take one view only of the affair; and that brought only self-approvance of what she had done: if Sir Lyell meant honourably, Flora was easily followed; if not, she was happily rescued from earthly perdition.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nevertheless, she had too much sweetness of disposition, and too much benevolence of character, to be indifferent to reproach; though her vain efforts, either to clear her own conduct, or to appease the angry sorrows of Flora, all ended by the indignantly blubbering damsel’s turning from her in sulky silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Juliet then took a quick leave of Miss Matson, and of the young journey-women; and repaired to her new habitation.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1418/42576.html","bookId":1389,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 8:59:16 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 8:59:16 PM"}
