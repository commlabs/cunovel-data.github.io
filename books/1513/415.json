Adventuring and the exploration of pocket dimensions were also deemed normal for them. Due to their longevity, even were they to disappear for a few years, their absence would be inconspicuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twelve rank 3 Warlocks moderated the horrifying radiation and energy undulations on their bodies and went under the guise of a regular troop of adventurers from the central continent. Discreetly, they all boarded an airship at a city not far from Phosphorescence Swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding on board the deck, Leylin fell silent as he looked at the illustrious symbol of the Fallor Family splashed across the body of the airship,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are indeed the rulers of the skies. They single-handedly dominate and monopolize the entirety of aerial transport in the central continent!” From the bottom of his heart, Leylin sighed without any inhibitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you looking at?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA whiff of perfume and seconds later, Kesha walked over, half leaning on the railings and revealing her sensual beautiful body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the enhanced bloodline of Warlocks, her skin was more delicate and exquisite. Coupled with her slim, shaped eyes and slightly curled cherry lips, she eluded a kind of demonic charm that caused some travellers to have rumblings in their throat and flames burning in their stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s eyes naturally swept across Kesha’s body unrestrainedly, paying particular attention to the vital parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehe!” Kesha laughed tenderly and without a qualm arched her back and pushed her bosom forward, “The journey is getting rather boring, would you like to go back to my room for some fun?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin rolled his eyes, lust and illicit sexual relations among the nobles were common. It was even more normal for those who grasped great power and possessed a long life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there were some exceptions among the Warlocks. To attain an even more outstanding and pure bloodline, female Warlocks would go all out and embrace craziness. In fact, they had the advantage for seduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin smiled and replied, “Pardon me! Not today, you will be the be first to know when I decide to sell my seed, though!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright then! Such a pity!” Kesha licked a finger, revealing no hint of her humiliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But still! I really do like you, junior!” She placed her finger on Leylin’s chest and with a smile, twirled it in circles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, that was the furthest Kesha went and she attempted nothing else. In the end, she appropriately settled for casual conversation with Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know Freya and Miranda? Kesha asked out of the blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have met a few times!” Leylin replied with some uneasiness as he drew out the air from his breath. As far as those two nutjobs were concerned, especially the more powerful one out of the two, he really had a hard time dealing with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then are you aware?” Kesha smiled mysteriously, with an added crafty look of a little girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They have been spreading the word that you belong to them and you are their prey. Any other female Warlocks who have any intentions of looking your way, will have to go up against them!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…” Leylin rolled his eyes in anger, almost cursing in his rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These two maniacs!” he finally exclaimed with extreme resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, Why don’t you seriously consider it? Miranda has to-die-for skills and holds the title of the Succubus, as for Freya….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKesha moved forward, almost leaning on Leylin and whispered into his ears : ”Freya has never been with a man, so she might be a virgin after all!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent from her hair was pleasantly sweet as it permeated the air. Coupled with Kesha’s words, Leylin was left with a dry mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” A victorious smile surfaced on Kesha’s face, ”What about now? Do you want me to cease your desire? My skills might be better than Miranda’s!” As she spoke, she stuck out her pink tongue and gently licked on Leylin’s earlobes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Kesha felt Leylin’s body turned cold, just like a block of ice. “So I see, you knew the both of them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her head in astonishment and saw an emotionless Leylin standing there, both his eyes sparkling and clear, without a trace of sentiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes! I know them, and I am just relaying somewhat of a message for Freya, that’s all!” Seeing Leylin’s reaction, Kesha knowingly stepped back, not daring to tease him further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please tell them I will consider it carefully!” Leylin replied nonchalantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it! “ Kesha looked intently at Leylin: “Your current state! It’s as if you’re not influenced by the emotional and passionate moods that arise from your bloodline! I finally understand why Freya could not get her mind off you! Such an outstanding bloodline. It is what we Kemoyin Warlocks need….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching Kesha’s back as she was walking away, Leylin stroked his chin and a bitter smile curled the edges of his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven for Kemoyin Warlocks, deterioration of one’s bloodline cannot be avoided. Looking at the three Black Horrall Snake Warlocks from Kesha’s Clan, it was obvious their bloodline could not avoid the inevitable degeneration either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking back on her recent temptation, at least half of it were real. If Leylin had agreed to Kesha’s seduction and had multiple sexual escapades with her, she might have even helped herself to obtain his bloodline\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if it weren’t for the bloodline, according to the emotional state of minds of female Warlocks, as long as the mood and feel were right, they will go ahead and copulate with other Magi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Magus world, other than female Warlocks, the same applied to the female Magi. Those girls who were pure were a rare species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Leylin really had no interest at all. He was in the middle of a risky journey and had no mood for it. Even if he needed the company of a lady, his choice would not be Kesha, Freya or Miranda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese ambitious female Warlocks would do anything for the continuation of their bloodlines. As female Warlocks, they must have done their research on the nourishing of the bloodline with some specializing in techniques and spells to do it. They were well aware of the ways to attain the seed of a male, something which did not surprise Leylin at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not completely confident in the A.I. Chip’s ability to calm him down, as well as his control over his own body against the methods they deployed to acquire his bloodline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anything unthinkable were to happen, resulting in a pile of descendants that were raised and taught by other clans, it would be mind-boggling and Leylin dreaded the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, there was another hesitation in his heart\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis bloodline was purified by means of the A.I.Chip and the purity level was exceptionally high, almost equalling the original bloodline. With his own ability and with the help of the A.I. Chip, he was able to conceal his true strength and capabilities from others, but a newborn baby could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf his peculiar bloodline were to be discovered, given the greed of those Morning Star Magi, he might have been captured to become a reproductive machine for the next generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod knows, they might even be able to extract and strip him of his bloodline!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, until he was absolutely sure that it was safe, he would not allow the outflow of his bloodline, not to mention having descendants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But, nevertheless, if I am promoted to the rank of a Morning Star Magus and I want to start a clan of my own in the central continent, I am afraid those female Warlocks are my only choice!” Leylin stroked his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a pure Kemoyin bloodline Warlock, in order to have strong and powerful descendants in the future, it was naturally more suitable if he chose a female Kemoyin Warlock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for female commoners and ordinary Warlocks, children he had with them would have their bloodline diluted to half of his, something which was unacceptable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quality of a Warlock’s bloodline was known to be the best in the first generation. The more concentrated it was, the better they would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese minute details flashed across his mind once before he tossed them aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is not the right time for me to think about such matters!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin squinted his eyes, enjoying the natural and pure sunlight from the deck. A look of satisfaction gleamed in his eyes and his thoughts wandered to a faraway place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as Warlocks were concerned, long and slow journeys were not torturous. At worst, they might have to stay in their room every day and meditate to pass time. And since the Fallor Family had provided such excellent services in the first class cabin, Leylin was satisfied, especially with the meals provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven how poor Twilight Zone’s environment was, the food and drink of the central continent were worlds apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no matter how long a journey was, it had to come to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge airship started descending, casting a huge circular shadow on the ground. The shadow kept spreading until at last, a loud thump was heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is Sin City station. All passengers who are alighting, please maintain order!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the airship had stabilized, a group of workers and slaves opened the warehouse latch and started unloading the goods. A few flights of stairs were unfolded and secured to the ground. The passengers who were going to alight got ready and started forming a queue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are finally here, the border of the Forgotten Land, Sin City! Even the name is unpretentious with no need to cover up!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter multiple flights on airships and a month of travel, Leylin had finally reached his destination as he mingled among the other tourists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fixated his eyes on the orange sun in the distance, and the dilapidated grey and brown walls under it, as he sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe A.I. Chip issued a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Beep! The energy particle concentration here is about 10-20% lower than the outside world. Please take note!]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spells of Warlocks and Magi were cast through their own energy which galvanised the surrounding energy particles. Low concentrations of the energy particles would cause a weakening of their power, leading to greater consumption of their spiritual and magical energies. If they were to face such a situation all of a sudden, many Magi would probably be thrown into a flurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The elemental leakage had affected even the Forgotten Land!” Leylin sighed, “The power of Morning Star Magi is too devastating!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the energy particles concentration level was lower than that in the outside world by 20%, it posed no problem to Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concentration level of energy particles of his homeland, the south coast, and the Twilight Zone, were less than half of the central continent. Spellcasting with such low available energy was natural for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-414\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-416\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-415","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
