The guy’s an open book. You, on the other hand, weren’t so easy to track down. Your sister wouldn’t tell me a thing. She pretended she didn’t understand English.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who hired you to follow me?” Alek was growing bored with this detailed speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, but that’s privileged information.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Julia?” His heart pounded hard with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope. My lips are sealed. But I can tell you it isn’t her. She doesn’t know anything about this, although what I’m supposed to tell you concerns her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek was beginning to think he didn’t like Peck as much as he initially had. “Then tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeck arched his brows at Alek’s less than patient tone. “First, let me ask you a couple of questions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have time for this.” Alek surged to his feet and stalked away. He half expected Peck to follow him, but when the investigator didn’t get up, he slowed his pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek had gone a block before he recognized his mistake. His impatience had cost him what he’d wanted most, information about Julia. He turned back, walking at a fast clip. He need not have worried; Peck was sitting at the table, enjoying the fish-and-chips dinner Alek had hastily left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek stood over him and Peck licked his fingers. “I thought you might have a change of heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem. There’s something Jerry thought you’d like to know about his sister. She’s going to be a mother. If I understand correctly, that means you’re about to become a daddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek felt as if he’d had his legs knocked out from under him. He literally slumped onto the picnic table. “When?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t know. But I don’t think she’s very far along. A month, maybe two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you seen her? Is she healthy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeck shrugged. “The last time I did, she was a little green around the gills.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother crazy American idiom, one that made no sense to him at all. “Green gills? What does that mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, a little under the weather.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek’s confusion increased. “Say it in plain English, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, okay. She’s sick every afternoon. Jerry says it’s like watching Old Faithful. About three-fifteen her assistant leads her to the ladies’ room so she can lose her lunch. It’s perfectly normal from what I understand. Not that I know much about pregnant women.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek felt as if someone were sitting on his chest and the weight kept increasing. A baby. His baby. Julia was going to have his baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up again, frowning. He had a right to know, and the news shouldn’t have come from his brother-in-law, either. Julia should have told him herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low, burning anger simmered in his blood. He was angry, angrier than he’d been in a long time, and he wasn’t about to let this go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You tell Jerry something for me,” Alek muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. He didn’t have any cause to be angry with Jerry. His friend had taken the initiative and sent Peck to tell him what he should’ve been told from the beginning—by Julia. And he himself had been avoiding Jerry, at least for now—because of Julia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wanted me to pass something along to Jerry?” Peck pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Alek said, feeling the beginnings of a smile. “Tell him I think he’s going to make a very good uncle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia took another bite of her celery stalk, then set it back on the plate. Her attention wavered from her book for only an instant while she reached for a slice of apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manual, one she’d recently picked up at a bookstore, described the stages of pregnancy week by exciting week. She kept the book hidden from Anna and brought it out in the evenings. By the time Junior was ready to be born, she’d practically have the whole three hundred pages memorized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called the baby Junior, although she didn’t know yet if it was a boy or a girl. Funny, only a couple of weeks ago she hadn’t even known she was pregnant, and now it seemed as though the baby had always been a part of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt night, she slept with her hand on her stomach. She talked to Junior, carrying on lengthy conversations with her unborn child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry and Virginia had become ridiculously vigilant. Julia swore her assistant suffered more from her bouts of afternoon sickness than Julia did herself. And Jerry. She smiled as she thought about her brother and how solicitous he’d become. He was constantly asking after her health. He’d even gone so far as to contact Dr. Feldon about her daily bouts of afternoon sickness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been to see Dr. Brandt and liked the young, attractive woman very much. Thanks to her and the pregnancy book she’d recommended, Julia understood far better the changes that were taking place within her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried not to think about Alek, tried not to dwell on how much she missed him. Or the mistakes she’d made in her brief marriage. Sooner or later she’d have to get in touch with him. She needed to tell him about the baby. And to thank him. Phoenix Paints had taken the market by storm. A national television network had called today wanting to do a news piece on the ideas behind the innovative paints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe owed Alek so much and she’d treated him so poorly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn’t asked Anna his whereabouts since that first morning. His sister didn’t volunteer any information about Alek even when Julia asked. Julia didn’t think Anna had forgiven her yet for hurting her brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed her hand to her stomach and whispered, “Your daddy is a wonderful man, Junior. He’s going to love you so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took another bite of the celery stalk and turned the page of her text. Labor and delivery. She’d read this chapter first, the same night she’d bought the book, wanting to learn everything she could on the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she did deliver Junior, she hoped Alek would be there to coach her. From what she’d seen of Jerry, he wouldn’t last ten minutes in a delivery room. And Virginia wouldn’t be able to take watching her in pain, Julia was convinced of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she’d finished her snack, Julia moved into the living room to exercise. She turned on the television and inserted the low-impact prenatal aerobics DVD. Ten minutes later she was huffing and puffing and sweating enough to dampen the gray T-shirt she wore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you appreciate this,” she told the baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a full thirty minutes, she went into the kitchen, got a glass from the cupboard and gulped down some water. After that, she grabbed a pencil and marked the schedule posted on the refrigerator. Anna thought it was a diet sheet and it was. Sort of. Julia listed the food she ate, plus her water intake. Eight glasses a day, no excuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was another interesting aspect of her condition. Her life was now ruled by how long it would take her to reach a bathroom. She’d considered having one installed in her office because it was so disruptive to hurry down the hall every hour, and sometimes more often. The eight glasses of water didn’t help matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was feeling better, though, and for that Julia was grateful. The first couple of weeks after Alek had moved out she’d felt as if she were living in a nightmare. She did what needed to be done, performed her duties, ate, worked and slept, but did it all with a low-grade sense of dejection—and with an air of expectancy. She couldn’t seem to let go of the idea that Alek would come into her office one day the way he used to. It was the hope of seeing him again, of telling him about the baby, that had kept her going. That and, of course, her happiness about the baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang and Julia ripped the sweatband from her forehead. It was probably Jerry, who’d taken to checking up on her in the evenings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn’t. When she opened the door, Alek stood before her, looking more furious than she’d ever seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alek.” Julia couldn’t say anything more. He looked wonderful, while she must have resembled a towel that had been sitting at the bottom of the dirty-clothes hamper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just heard you’re pregnant. Is that true?” His eyes were hard as granite. He was furious with her and didn’t bother to disguise it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might have told me. I played an important role in this event.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I know, it’s just that…” She realized she’d left him standing in the hallway outside the condo. Opening the door wider, she said, “Come inside, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You weren’t going to tell me about the baby?” He was frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I intended to tell you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you care to sit down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, just answer the question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia ignored the demand in his voice. “Would you like something to drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just answer the question!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no reason to yell. I was going to tell you, how could I not? This baby is as much a part of you as of me. How could I keep something this important from you?” She hoped that would appease him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s my question exactly.” Alek’s hands were knotted into fists at his sides. Julia wanted to think that meant he was restraining himself from holding her—not simply expressing his frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to walk into the kitchen. He hesitated, then followed her. She poured a glass of water for him and then one for herself and set them down on the kitchen table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anna knew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I couldn’t tell her. I was afraid she’d say something to you.” Her explanation didn’t satisfy him; if anything, his scowl darkened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia pulled out a chair and sat. Alek did, too. Avoiding his probing eyes, she lowered her gaze to her water glass. “I’m drinking two quarts of water every day now. Eight full glasses… I’m keeping track of my intake on that sheet on the fridge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The baby needs water?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a manner of speaking, I guess, but actually it’s me the doctor’s concerned about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is the doctor concerned?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn’t said this to alarm Alek. It was just conversation, a way to ease the tension between them. “I’m perfectly healthy, Alek. Don’t look so worried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why is your doctor concerned?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s her job. She keeps a close eye on my health and the baby’s. So far I’m having a perfectly normal pregnancy. That’s what my doctor says. So does the book.” She reached across the table for the manual she’d read from cover to cover three times over. “Junior’s doing just great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Junior?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what I call him…or her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anger had faded and in its place Julia saw a love and devotion so deep it wounded her. To think she’d abused that love and mistrusted his word. Her throat grew thick. Tears filled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Julia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away. “Don’t worry, it’s all part of this pregnancy thing. I’m very emotional. The other night I started crying over a TV ad.” She didn’t tell him it was the one for Phoenix Paints. The tears had come because she’d realized how much she missed her husband. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-28.html","bookId":1964,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM"}
