I should hang up right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you\u0027re enjoying this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, but why stay too long at the fair? Enough\u0027s enough. But you want a hint, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not a hint. You\u0027re a detective. What you want is a clue, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m not too good at working with clues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure you are. Sherlock Holmes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that the clue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that\u0027s what you are. Sherlock fucking Holmes. Rumpelstiltskin.

I got to the house on Stafford Avenue ten minutes early, and at 4:20 I was beginning to worry. Fifteen minutes later I was in the vestibule examining the lock on the door leading up to her second-floor flat and wondering how much trouble it would be to let myself in. The possibility of getting nailed for illegal entry scared me less than the thought of what I might find. She lived, after all, just a fifteen-minute walk from where Helen Watson had drowned in her bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got a flat strip of flexible steel from my wallet and turned to make sure no one was watching me when I took a shot at the door. Across the street, someone was maneuvering a Ford Escort into a tight space. I could have been through the door and up the stairs before the car was parked, but I waited, and Felicia Karp emerged from the car. I put my burglar\u0027s tool away and went to meet her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"They sprang a meeting on us literally at the last minute and there was no way to reach you.\" She gave me her canvas tote bag to hold while she unlocked the door. Inside, she led me to the kitchen and heated two cups of the morning\u0027s coffee in the microwave. From the wall, the black cat swung its pendulum tail and rolled its eyes at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI showed her Ray Galindez\u0027s sketch. She held it at arm\u0027s length and asked who it was supposed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you recognize him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He looks familiar. Who is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He worked as a patrol officer for a private security firm. Back in February he discovered the body of Alan Watson while making his rounds a few blocks the other side of Continental Avenue. Watson had been stabbed, and it wasn\u0027t hard for this man to be the first person on the scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re implying that he killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was Alan Watson one of the men my husband had dinner with once a year?\" I said that he was. \"And this man? Did he kill my husband?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God,\" she said, and stared at the sketch, and shuddered. \"I knew Fred Karp would never kill himself,\" she said. \"My God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You say this man looks familiar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I\u0027ve seen him. Where did he patrol? We don\u0027t have private guards around here, although the neighborhood association has been talking about hiring them. You said the other side of Continental Avenue? I wouldn\u0027t have seen him there. It\u0027s a nice section, upscale compared to this, but I don\u0027t have any reason to go there. Anyway, I know his face, and I wouldn\u0027t know it from glimpsing it through the window of a patrol car. Why do I know his face? Help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen him in the neighborhood recently?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he come to the house?\" She shook her head. \"Have you seen him at the school? He could have posed as a parent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would he do that? Am I in danger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake,\" she said. She studied the picture. \"He looks so damn ordinary,\" she said. \"To look at him, you\u0027d think he was too much of a nebbish to be a policeman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could you picture him doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Something menial, something completely pedestrian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close your eyes. He\u0027s doing something. What do you see him doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this, some new guided-imaging technique? It\u0027s not going to work. I intellectualize too much, that\u0027s my problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try it anyway. What\u0027s he doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you could see him, what would he be doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t figure it out. Just answer it. What\u0027s he doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pushing a broom. My God, I don\u0027t believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it. He was a janitor in the Kashin Building where Fred had his office. He wore a uniform, matching pants and a shirt in greenish gray. How would I remember that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I would meet Fred at his office and we would have dinner and go to a play. And one time I saw this man. I think-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I seem to remember that he was in Fred\u0027s office when I got there, and they were talking. He was sweeping the floor and he was emptying a wastebasket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would I know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your husband might have introduced you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid… John. His name was John!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody introduced him. It was on his shirt.\" She traced a short horizontal line above her left breast. \"Over the pocket, embroidered in white. No! Not white, yellow.\" She shook her head. \"It\u0027s just amazing the things you remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And his name was John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I didn\u0027t like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was something about him. I thought he was sly. In fact I almost said something to Fred, but I let it go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you have said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have warned him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought the man was dangerous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Not physically dangerous. I thought he would steal something. There was a furtive quality about him.
