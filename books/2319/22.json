I thought at the time you were justifying your son\u0027s act. I didn\u0027t believe then that he did it, but I believed you thought so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you told me he admitted his guilt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t say anything. I watched him wipe perspiration from his forehead, then wipe his hand on his robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That didn\u0027t have to mean anything. You might have been talking yourself into the belief that Richie died penitent. Or he could well have admitted it to you because he could have become sufficiently confused after the fact. Everything was jumbled up for him. He told his lawyer he found Wendy dead in the bathtub. A little more reflection and he must have decided that he had killed her even if he couldn\u0027t remember it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the more I found out about Wendy, the harder it was to picture her as evil. I don\u0027t doubt she had an evil effect on the lives of certain other people. But why would she seem evil to you? There was really only one explanation for that, sir. She made you want to do something you were ashamed of. And that made you do something more shameful. You killed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You planned it. You took your razor along. And you had sex with her one final time before you murdered her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not. I can even tell you what you did. The autopsy showed that she had had both oral and vaginal intercourse shortly before death. Richie would have had genital intercourse with her, so what you did, sir, was take off all your clothes and let her perform fellatio upon you, and then you whipped out your razor and slashed her to death, and then you went home and let your son hang himself for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up and planted my feet in front of his chair. \"I\u0027ll tell you what I think. I think you\u0027re a son of a bitch. You knew Richie would be home from work in another couple of hours. You knew he\u0027d discover the body. You didn\u0027t necessarily know he\u0027d go nuts, but you knew the cops would grab him and lean on him hard. You set him up for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to… to call the police. I was going to report the crime anonymously. They would have found the body while he was still at work. They would have known he had nothing to do with it, they would have blamed it on some anonymous sex partner of hers. They never would have thought-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you follow through?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fought to catch his breath. He said, \"I left the apartment. My head was reeling, I was… badly shaken by what I had done. And then I saw Richie on his way home. He didn\u0027t see me. I saw him mount the stairs, and I knew… I knew it was too late. He was already on the scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you let him go upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when you went to see him in jail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to tell him. I wanted to… to say something to him. I… I couldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward and put his head in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him sit like that for a while. He didn\u0027t sob, didn\u0027t make a sound, just sat there looking somewhere into the black parts of his soul. Finally I got up and took a half-pint flask of bourbon from my pocket. I uncapped it and offered it to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t having any. \"I don\u0027t use spirits, Mr. Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think of it as a special occasion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t use spirits. I don\u0027t allow them in my house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that and decided he wasn\u0027t in a position to set rules. I took a long drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"You can\u0027t prove any of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some conjecture on your part. A great deal of it, as a matter of fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So far you haven\u0027t refuted any of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, if anything I\u0027ve confirmed it, haven\u0027t I? But I\u0027ll deny having said any such thing to you. You haven\u0027t the slightest bit of truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re absolutely right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I don\u0027t see what you\u0027re driving at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t prove anything. The cops will be able to, though, when I go to them. They never had any reason to dig before. But they\u0027ll start digging, and they\u0027ll turn something up. They\u0027ll start by asking you to account for your movements on the day of the murder. You won\u0027t be able to. That\u0027s nothing in and of itself, but it\u0027s enough to encourage them to keep looking. They\u0027ve still got that apartment sealed off. They never had a reason to dust it for prints. They\u0027ll have a reason now, and they\u0027ll find your prints somewhere. I\u0027m sure you didn\u0027t run around wiping surfaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll ask to see your razor. If you bought a new one since then, they\u0027ll wonder why. They\u0027ll go through all your wardrobe, looking for bloodstains. I guess you had your clothes off when you killed her, but you\u0027ll have gotten traces of blood on something or other and it won\u0027t all wash out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll put a case together a piece at a time, and they won\u0027t even need a full case because you\u0027ll crack under questioning in no time at all. You\u0027ll crack wide open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may be stronger than you seem to think, Mr. Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not strong so much as you\u0027re rigid. You\u0027ll break. I couldn\u0027t tell you how many suspects I\u0027ve questioned. It gives you a pretty good idea of who\u0027s going to crack easy. You\u0027d be a cinch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me, then averted his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it doesn\u0027t matter whether you crack or not, and it doesn\u0027t matter whether they put a solid case together or not, because all they have to do is start looking and you\u0027ve had it. Take a look at your life, Reverend Vanderpoel. Once they start, you\u0027re finished. You won\u0027t be up there on the pulpit Sunday mornings reading the Law to your congregation. You\u0027ll be disgraced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat for a few minutes in silence. I took out my flask and had another drink. Drinking was against his religion. Well, murder was against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want, Mr. Scudder? I have to tell you that I\u0027m not a rich man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose I could arrange regular payments. I couldn\u0027t afford very much, but I could-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not trying to blackmail me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned at me, puzzled. \"Then I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t gone to the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you intend to go to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope I won\u0027t have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another little drink. I capped the flask and put it back in my pocket. From another pocket I took a small vial of pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I found these in the medicine cabinet at the Bethune Street apartment. They were Richie\u0027s. He had them prescribed fifteen months ago. They\u0027re Seconal, sleeping pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if Richie had trouble sleeping or not, but he evidently didn\u0027t take any of these. The bottle\u0027s still full. There are thirty pills. I think he bought them with the intention of committing suicide. A lot of people make false starts like that. Sometimes they throw the pills away when they change their minds. Other times they keep them around in order to simplify things if they decide to kill themselves at a later date. And there are people who find some security in having the means of suicide close at hand. They say thoughts of self-destruction get people through a great many bad nights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over to him and placed the vial on the little table beside his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are enough there,\" I said. \"If a person were to take them all and go to bed, he wouldn\u0027t wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me. \"You have everything all worked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I haven\u0027t been able to think of much else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You expect me to end my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your life is over, sir. It\u0027s just a question of how it finishes up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I take these pills?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You leave a note. You\u0027re despondent over the death of your son, and you can\u0027t find it within yourself to go on living. It won\u0027t be that far from the truth, will it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I refuse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I go to the police Tuesday morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe breathed deeply several times. Then he said, \"Do you honestly think it would be so bad to let me go on living my life, Mr. Scudder? I perform a valuable function, you know. I\u0027m a good minister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I honestly think I do some good in this world. Not a great deal, but some. Is it illogical for me to want to go on doing good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I am not a criminal, you know. I did kill… that girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wendy Hanniford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I killed her. Oh, you\u0027re so quick to see it as a calculated, cold-blooded act, aren\u0027t you? Do you know how many times I swore not to see her again? Do you know how many nights I lay awake, wrestling with demons? Do you even know how many times I went to her apartment with my razor in my pocket, torn between the desire to slay her and the fear of committing such a monstrous sin? Do you know any of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I killed her. Whatever happens, I will never kill anyone again. Can you honestly say I constitute a danger to society?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s bad for society when murders remain unpunished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if I do as you suggest, no one will know I\u0027ve taken my life for that reason. No one will know I was punished for murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be judge and jury, then. Is that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You will, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, leaned back in his chair. I wanted another drink, but I let the flask stay in my pocket. The headache was still there. The aspirin hadn\u0027t even touched it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I regard suicide as a sin, Mr. Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely. If I didn\u0027t I probably would have killed myself years ago. There are worse sins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fixed his eyes on me. \"Do you think I am an evil man, Mr. Scudder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not an expert on that. Good and evil. I have a lot of trouble figuring those things out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ve had good intentions. You were talking about that earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ve paved a road to Hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t know where the road leads, but there are a lot of wrecks along the highway, aren\u0027t there? Your wife committed suicide. Your mistress got slashed to death. Your son went crazy and hanged himself for something he didn\u0027t do. Does that make you good or evil? You\u0027ll have to work that one out for yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You intend to go to the police Tuesday morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And otherwise you\u0027ll keep your silence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, and what about you, Mr. Scudder? Are you a force for good or evil? I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve asked yourself the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now and then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you answer it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ambivalently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now, in this act? Forcing me to kill myself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m allowing you to kill yourself. I think you\u0027re a damned fool if you don\u0027t, but I\u0027m not forcing you to do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was awake early Monday morning. I got a Times at the corner and read it over bacon and eggs and coffee. A cabdriver had been murdered in East Harlem. Someone had stuck an icepick into him through one of the air holes in his partition. Now everyone who read the Times would know a new way to score off a cabdriver. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sins-of-the-fathers-matthew-scudder-1/page-22.html","bookId":2319,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM"}
