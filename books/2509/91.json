I hope you have not decided to do this out of devotion to Drosos\u0027 memory. You tell me that you want to find out what is left of the Library and to try to salvage any of the texts that might have escaped the fires. That, I probably need not remind you, is dangerous work; high risk for a dubious reward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou told me once that Drosos called you a monster and that you did not know how to convince him you are not. Olivia, he was right. We are are monsters, Olivia, never forget that. But we need not be monsters simply because we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome time soon, I, too, hope you can return to Roma. I know how hard it is to be drawn by your native earth. Why else would I be in a place like Naissus? In less than a month I will be back in my native mountains, and they will restore me in ways I need not explain to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am pleased to know that Niklos Aulirios is still with you. His sense can stand you both in good stead, for often you have more courage than sense, which is one of the many reasons that I loved you while Nero wore the purple and love you now, and will love you when both of us are nothing more than dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake joy in living, Olivia, else the burden is too great for even you to endure, and loss of you would grieve me more than any other loss I have sustained in all my years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this, the Lord\u0027s Year 566, you have my love, as you have had it for the last half millennium\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanct Germain\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(his seal, the eclipse)\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-91.html","bookId":2509,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:25 PM"}
