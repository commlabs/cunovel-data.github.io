My meeting is here in the hotel. If you get done with your spa appointment before my meeting is over, come back up to the room and, when I get back, we’ll go and do some gambling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds good, babe,” she said as she kissed my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put on my suit coat and I walked Amelia down to the spa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is where we part ways. I’ll see you soon. Enjoy the spa, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will. Enjoy your meeting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That I won’t.” I smiled as I kissed her and headed to the board room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy meeting ran a little longer than I planned, but I signed the deal for the company and my dad was going to be extremely happy. I walked over to the spa to see if Amelia was done and saw her walking out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perfect timing. How was your massage?” I asked as I gave her a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exhilarating, relaxing, amazing.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckled. “Maybe before we leave Vegas, we can get a couple’s massage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d like that,” she said as she laid her head on my shoulder and looped her arm around mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spent our first night at the black jack table and I taught Amelia how to play. She was either very lucky or she was bullshitting me about not knowing how to play. She cleaned up and she cleaned up well. I was more in love with her than ever, and playing against her and watching how excited she got when she won was an amazing feeling. I reached over and stroked her blonde hair and asked her if she was ready to go back to the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready, baby? I think we have some celebrating to do.” I winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I’m ready.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took her hand and we entered the elevator. Once we hit the tenth floor, I pushed the stop button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to her and placed my hands on her thighs. My fingers slid their way up to the edge of her panties and pushed them to the side. I slipped my fingers inside her, feeling how excited she already was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m giving you a little something before we go to the room. Judging by how wet you are, I think you want it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed her against the elevator wall and she brought her knee up. “Collin, you’re so bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me how much you want me to make you come right now,” I whispered as my tongue stroked her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to,” she said breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want me to what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to make me come now and then multiple times in the room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took down the strap of her dress, exposing her bare breast as my fingers moved in and out of her at a rapid pace. She tried to contain her moans, but let loose once my mouth surrounded her breast. My thumb rested on her clit as she swelled against my fingers. I knew that a few short strokes on her clit would have her coming in no time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come, baby. Show me how good I make you feel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t stop. Please don’t stop,” she begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved my fingers in circles and hit her g-spot. She let out a howl and her body tightened against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God!” she said with bated breath as her orgasm came to full force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled as I looked at her and pulled up the strap to her dress. I then kissed her on the lips and pushed the button to go up to our room. The elevator door opened and there was a group of people standing in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you two okay?” a gentleman asked. “The elevator was stuck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. We’re great.” I smiled as I took Amelia’s hand and we went to our room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeedless to say, we were up all night and barely slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled over and opened my eyes when I heard my phone buzz. I picked it up from the nightstand and saw a text message from my dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning, son. Congratulations on closing the deal. We’ll celebrate when you get back to New York. I hope you and Amelia are having a great time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Dad. We’re having a blast. Amelia loves Vegas and she cleaned up last night at the black jack table. See you in a couple of days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled over and looked at how peacefully Amelia was sleeping. I got out of bed, put on some clothes, and went downstairs to the reception desk. When I came back to the room, Amelia rolled over and looked at me as I stood in the doorway with red roses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning, baby.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did you go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Down to the flower shop to get you these,” I said as I handed her the roses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brought them up to her nose and smelled them. “They’re beautiful. Thank you,” she said as she reached up and kissed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re welcome. Our breakfast will be here soon. I ordered you your favorite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chocolate chip pancakes?” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. Chocolate chip pancakes,” I said as I kissed her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she was in the shower, room service was delivered and set up at the table for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amelia, breakfast is here,” I said as I walked in the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be there in a sec. Don’t start without me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down at the table and waited for Amelia to join me. A few moments later, she came out in her silk robe and sat down across from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m starving,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted off the silver lid from her plate and stared at her pancakes. She put her hand over her mouth and looked up at me with tears in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up from my seat and took the five-carat diamond ring that sat on the stack of pancakes. I got down on one knee and took her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amelia, I want to spend the rest of my life with you. You have given me the best gift in life; true love. I fell in love with you from the moment I saw you walking past the beach house that morning after you saved me. My world was crumbling down before I met you, and then you came along and changed my life. There is nothing that I wouldn’t do for you or give you. I want to build a future with you. I want you to be the mother of my children and I want to do nothing but grow old with you. I love you so much that sometimes it hurts. I can’t stand to be away from you and, when I see you at the end of the day, my whole world lights up again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed my finger on her promise ring. “I gave you this ring as a promise of my love and a promise to marry you. Now, I’m fulfilling that promise by giving you this ring and asking you to be my wife forever and always. Let’s get married, baby. Let’s do it here in Vegas. I don’t want to wait a year to plan the perfect wedding. I want you now as my wife, Mrs. Amelia Black. What do you say, baby? Will you marry me today?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-61.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
