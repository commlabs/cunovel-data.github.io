One of these albums, Danny\u0027s personal favorite, had been an Eddie Cochran double-record set with four pages of bound-in liner notes by Lenny Kaye. Wendy had often been struck by Danny\u0027s fascination for this one particular album by a manboy who had lived fast and died young... had died, in fact, when she herself had only been ten years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, at quarter past seven (mountain time), as Dick Hallorann was telling Queems about his ex-wife\u0027s white boyfriend, she came upon Danny sitting halfway up the stairs between the lobby and the first floor, tossing a red rubber ball from hand to band and singing one of the songs from that album. His voice was low and tuneless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I climb one-two flight three flight four,\" Danny sang, \"five flight six flight seven flight more... when I get to the top, I\u0027m too tired to rock...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came around him, sat down on one of the stair risers, and saw that his lower lip had swelled to twice its size and that there was dried blood on his chin. Her heart took a frightened leap in her chest, but she managed to speak neutrally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened, doc?\" she asked, although she was sure she knew. Jack had hit him. Well, of course. That came next, didn\u0027t it? The wheels of progress; sooner or later they took you back to where you started from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I called Tony,\" Danny said. \"In the ballroom. I guess I fell off the chair. It doesn\u0027t hurt anymore. Just feels... like my lip\u0027s too big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what really happened?\" she asked, looking at him, troubled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy didn\u0027t do it,\" he answered. \"Not today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gazed at him, feeling eerie. The ball traveled from one band to the other. He had read her mind. Her son had read her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What... what did Tony tell you, Danny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" His face was calm, his voice chillingly indifferent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny-\" She gripped his shoulder, harder than she had intended. But he didn\u0027t wince, or even try to shake her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Oh we are wrecking this boy. It\u0027s not just Jack, it\u0027s me too, and maybe it\u0027s not even just us, Jack\u0027s father, my mother, are they here too? Sure, why not? The place is lousy with ghosts anyway, why not a couple more? Oh Lord in heaven he\u0027s like one of those suitcases they show on TV, run over, dropped from planes, going through factory crushers. Or a Timex watch. Takes a licking and keeps on ticking. Oh Danny I\u0027m so sorry)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" he said again. The ball went from hand to hand. \"Tony can\u0027t come anymore. They won\u0027t let him. He\u0027s licked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who won\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The people in the hotel,\" he said. He looked at her then, and his eyes weren\u0027t indifferent at all. They were deep and scared. \"And the... the things in the hotel. There\u0027s all kinds of them. The hotel is stuffed with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can see-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to see,\" he said low, and then looked back at the rubber ball, arcing from hand to hand. \"But I can hear them sometimes, late at night. They\u0027re like the wind, all sighing together. In the attic. The basement. The rooms. All over. I thought it was my fault, because of the way I am. The key. The little silver key.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny, don\u0027t... don\u0027t upset yourself this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s him too,\" Danny said. \"It\u0027s Daddy. And it\u0027s you. It wants all of us. It\u0027s tricking Daddy, it\u0027s fooling him, trying to make him think it wants him the most. It wants me the most, but it will take all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If only that snowmobile-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wouldn\u0027t let him,\" Danny said in that same low voice. \"They made him throw part of it away into the snow. Far away. I dreamed it. And he knows that woman really is in 217.\" He looked at her with his dark, frightened eyes. \"It doesn\u0027t matter whether you believe me or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slipped an arm around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe you, Danny, tell me the truth. Is Jack... is he going to try to hurt us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll try to make him,\" Danny said. \"I\u0027ve been calling for Mr. Hallorann. He said if I ever needed him to just call. And I have been. But it\u0027s awful hard. It makes me tired. And the worst part is I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s hearing me or not. I don\u0027t think he can call back because it\u0027s too far for him. And I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s too far for me or not. Tomorrow-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he now?\" she asked. \"\u0027Four daddy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in the basement. I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll be up tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up suddenly. \"Wait right here for me. Five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen was cold and deserted under the overhead fluorescent bars. She went to the rack where the carving knives hung from their magnetized strips. She took the longest and sharpest, wrapped it in a dish towel, and left the kitchen, turning off the lights as she went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny sat on the stairs, his eyes following the course of his red rubber ball from hand to hand. He sang: \"She lives on the twentieth floor uptown, the elevator is broken down. So I walk one-two flight three flight four...:\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(-Lou, Lou, skip to m\u0027 Lou-)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis singing broke off. He listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(-Skip to m\u0027 Lou my darlin\u0027-)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was in his head, so much a part of him, so frighteningly close that it might have been a part of his own thoughts. It was soft and infinitely sly. Mocking him. Seeming to say:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Oh yes, you\u0027ll like it here. Try it, you\u0027ll like it. Try it, you\u0027ll liiiiike it-)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow his ears were open and he could hear them again, the gathering, ghosts or spirits or maybe the hotel itself, a dreadful funhouse where all the sideshows ended in death, where all the specially painted boogies were really alive, where hedges walked, where a small silver key could start the obscenity. Soft and sighing, rustling like the endless winter wind that played under the eaves at night, the deadly lulling wind the summer tourists never heard. It was like the somnolent hum of summer wasps in a ground nest, sleepy, deadly, beginning to wake up. They were ten thousand feet high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Why is a raven like a writing desk? The higher the fewer, of course! Have another cup of tea!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a living sound, but not voices, not breath. A man of a philosophical bent might have called it the sound of souls. Dick Hallorann\u0027s Nana, who had grown up on southern roads in the years before the turn of the century, would have called it ha\u0027ants. A psychic investigator might have had a long name for it-psychic echo, psychokinesis, a telesmic sport. But to Danny it was only the sound of the hotel, the old monster, creaking steadily and ever more closely around them: halls that now stretched back through time as well as distance, hungry shadows, unquiet guests who did not rest easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the darkened ballroom the clock under glass struck seven-thirty with a single musical note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hoarse voice, made brutal with drink, shouted: \"Unmask and let\u0027s fuck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWendy, halfway across the lobby, jerked to a standstill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Danny on the stairs, still tossing the ball from hand to hand. \"Did you bear something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny only looked at her and continued to toss the ball from hand to hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be little sleep for them that night, although they slept together behind a locked door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the dark, his eyes open, Danny thought:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(He wants to be one of them and live forever. That\u0027s what he wants.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWendy thought:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(If I have to, I\u0027ll take him further up. If we\u0027re going to die I\u0027d rather do it in the mountains.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had left the butcher knife, still wrapped in the towel, under the bed. She kept her hand close to it. They dozed off and on. The hotel creaked around them. Outside snow had begun to spit down from a sky like lead. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shining-the-shining-1/page-37.html","bookId":2574,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:45 PM"}
