I liked her honesty. “What should I have said?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe batted her lashes at me and lowered her voice to a smoky rasp. “Cole, you big strong manimal. I know the boogeyman thinks you’ll jump out of his closet, but I think you’re— Hey, are you listening to our private conversation, Marcus?” she ended in a shout. “Yeah, that’s right. Run.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could only blink at her. Never, and I mean never, could I call Cole a manimal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where was I?” Kat asked me. “Never mind. Judging by your expression, you’re not ready for flirting lessons. I’ll just stick with giving you a pick-me-up. Come on. Let’s go to Café Bella and drink so many lattes we’re peeing coffee for a week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I heard angels singing. “I would seriously love that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “I always have the best ideas, don’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, a gray film covered the sky. Thick dark clouds looked ready to burst at any moment…except for one. It was white and fluffy, perfect in every way—and shaped like a rabbit in midhop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIce chips crystallized in my veins, and I skidded to a stop. The last time I’d seen a cloud like that, I’d lost everyone and everything I loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogically I knew a cloud did not determine my future, or even predict it, but…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world was suddenly spinning, spinning, round and round. Car after car zoomed beside me, the parking lot writhing and seething with blurry motions and hazy sounds. Someone honked. Someone grumbled. I couldn’t force myself to move. Could only stare in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat’s voice sounded far away, as if she stood at the end of a long, narrow tunnel. Would I cause Kat to wreck her car today? Would she die in front of me? Would I walk away without a scratch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, motion on my part. I backed away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali?” she said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked my gaze in her direction. Her frown of concern nearly leveled me. “I can’t,” I said, shaking my head. “I just can’t. I’m sorry.” Fog filled my head, making me dizzy. I spun and ran, just ran, arrowing toward the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard her calling for me, knew she was chasing after me. A back door blew open and closed in the wind. I shot through on its next opening and sprinted down the hall. I didn’t see Dr. Wright but I heard her shout for me. I ignored her, too, and found a bathroom (for boys) where I shut myself inside one of the stalls. Panting, I sat on the lid of the toilet, drew my knees up to my chest and fought the sting of tears in the back of my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes, maybe hours, passed but neither Kat nor Dr. Wright ever found me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat should I do? What should I freaking do? I’d already missed my bus, and I refused to call Nana to ask her to pick me up. I just…I couldn’t get in a car today. With anyone. If someone died because of me, I would never be able to shake the guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou realize you’re being irrational, \u0026nbsp;right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I did. But did that help me? No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy house was only a few miles away. I could walk, I decided. Yeah, that was the perfect solution. No cars would be involved, and I’d get some much-needed exercise. Finally I calmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storm would break at any moment, and I’d probably be soaked to the bone by the time I got home, but everyone would be safe. That was all that mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvice from a Dying Caterpillar\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinner that evening proved to be a horribly tense affair. Nana had come home early and I hadn’t been there. She had worried. She’d called my cell a dozen times but I hadn’t answered. I had known she would insist on coming to get me, and my protests would have fallen on deaf ears. So I’d sent her straight to voice mail, listened to her messages and texted her back each time, telling her I was on my way and fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the point of having a cell phone if you’re not going to use it,” she muttered now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did use it,” I said, my voice nasally. My nose was cold, wet and stuffed, and if I sneezed one more time, I’d hopefully blow the thing off my face. “I texted you.” Multiple times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lined face scrunched in distaste, making her appear older than she really was. “And I had no idea how to respond! I’ve never typed anything but a number into my phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll teach you the basics,” I said, the thought alone enough to make me nervous. I could already tell: there’d be lots of adjusting her reading glasses, repeating my instructions as if I’d spoken in Greek, until she finally asked me to write everything down in a language she could understand. But there wasn’t a language she would understand, so we’d never get anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll teach me?” Nana asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee? Repeating me already. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You, a girl who doesn’t even have enough sense to stay out of the rain until I can come and get you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to emphasize my own stupidity, I sneezed. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it. I’m taking you to the doctor.” She tossed her napkin on the table. “You’ve probably given yourself pneumonia!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sick, Nana. Honest.” Wasn’t like I’d gone to a medical lab, asked for a dish of their tastiest virus and feasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew in a deep breath…released…then picked up her napkin. “All right. If you’re without a fever tomorrow, I’ll allow you to teach me how to text.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGee. Thanks. “So what did you do when Mom was late?” I pushed my peas around my plate with the prongs of my fork. “She never had a cell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePops frowned at me. “Is that what today was about? Scaring us so that we’ll never take away your phone? Really, Ali. That was unnecessary. We wouldn’t do something like that to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That wasn’t what happened at all,” I said. “I just felt like walking.” And that was one hundred percent the truth. “With the thunder and the wind and the rain, I knew you wouldn’t be able to understand me if we spoke. Also, I was afraid I’d be struck by lightning and, if the phone was at my ear, electrocuted. Texting was the best option.” Again, truth—only stretched thin with the more pertinent details omitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, don’t walk home again,” Pops said in that scolding voice. Scolding, and worried. Over the past few days, his comb-over had lost a few valiant soldier-strands desperately holding on to his scalp. Because of me? “I’m not trying to— What do teenagers say nowadays?” he asked my grandmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get all up in her biznez,” Nana said. Without cracking a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right,” he replied. “We’re not trying to get all up in your biznez, Ali.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, wow. Okay. They were trying to relate to me right now. Had probably watched a news program about how to communicate with a teenager or something, and I’d bet they’d later spent hours in front of a computer screen, studying urban slang, muttering together as they deciphered words and discussed the best way to use them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow…sweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDang it! Their sweetness made me feel all kinds of guilty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those woods are dangerous,” Pops continued. “Predators of the four-legged variety roam freely, and animal carcasses are found all the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recalled the Bride and Groom of Gore I’d seen. Or might not have seen. Whatever. They were predators of the two-legged variety, definitely, and I never wanted an up-close-and-personal meet and greet with them without my baseball bat firmly in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” I said after another sneeze. “I really am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNana muttered something else about pneumonia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I missed my bus,” I added, “and I didn’t want to bother you.” Another stretched truth. “It won’t happen again. I promise.” And that was the God’s honest truth, with no evasion. I’d never put them through a worry-wringer again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You aren’t a bother.” Nana reached over and patted my hand. “We love you and just want—” By then her chin was quivering too much for her to continue. Tears filled her eyes, but she swiftly wiped them away with the back of her hand. She cleared her throat. “Now, then.” Sniff, sniff. “You asked about your mother. Once she started dating your father, she stayed in most nights. And if they went out, he always had her home before dark. We were always so impressed by that and failed to realize… Well, never mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid they know why? Had Mom? Or had Dad waited to tell her until after he’d bagged and tagged her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, gross. Thinking of my parents that way…ick, just ick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did Mom ever mention a friend whose last name was Holland?” I asked, recalling what Cole had said to me. Or had tried to say to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNana’s lips pursed as she pondered my question. “Holland…Holland…no, that name doesn’t ring a bell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mom was terribly shy. Didn’t make friends easily, truth be told. Didn’t date much, either,” Pops said, after swallowing a bite of roast. “In fact, your dad was the first boyfriend she ever had.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom? Shy? To me, she’d always been effervescent, full of life. Just like Emma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your dad made her laugh and was always convincing her to do such silly things,” Nana said with a soft smile. “One day, they dressed in the most hideous outfits I’d ever seen and went out to lunch. I’m sure people stared, but when they came back, they were laughing so hard your dad actually threw up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not imagine it. To me, he’d always been serious, a little too driven, even in his drunkenness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finished our dinner in silence, then I trudged to my bedroom. It was the only room on the second floor, and I had a bathroom of my own. My mom had spent her teenage years up here. How had she decorated the place? I wondered. After she’d moved out, Nana had boxed up her things and turned the space into first a playroom, then a sewing room and now a guest room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe, I hadn’t done any decorating at all. The walls were as bare as when I’d first moved in. I’d stashed the boxes of family pictures Nana had given me in my closet. I hadn’t opened them, hadn’t hung a single frame. Heck, I hadn’t even glanced at them. The most I’d done was go through my mom’s old things, and only because Nana had dug them out. I think she’d been trying to reconnect with the child she’d lost. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/alice-in-zombieland-white-rabbit-chronicles-1/page-16.html","bookId":2520,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM"}
