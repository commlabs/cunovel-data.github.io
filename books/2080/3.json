It was taking him to hisLas Vegas mansion, white walls and palm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrees, limpid blue fountains and tiled terraces. Rooms full of artwork and museum-quality furniture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything anyone could ask for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut his eyes and leaned back against the crimson cushions, wishing he were somewhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How wasHawaii , sir?\" The driver\u0027s voice came from the front seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry opened his eyes. Nilsson was a good driver. He seemed to be about Thierry\u0027s own age, around\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enineteen, with a neat ponytail, dark glasses despite the fact that it was nighttime, and a discreet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexpression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wet, Nilsson,\" Thierry said softly. He stared out the window. \"Hawaiiwas very... wet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t find what you were looking for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I didn\u0027t find what I was looking for ... again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Nilsson.\" Thierry tried to look past his own reflection in the window. It was disturbing,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseeing that young man with the white-blond hair and the old, old eyes looking back at him. He had such a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epensive expression ... so lost and so sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike somebody always looking for something he can\u0027t find, Thierry thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away from the window in determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything been going all right while I\u0027ve been gone?\" he asked, picking up his cellular phone. Work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWork always helped. Kept you busy, kept your mind off things, kept you away from yourself, basically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, I think, sir. Mr. James and Miss Poppy are back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good. They\u0027ll make thenext Circle Daybreak meeting.\" Thierry\u0027s finger hovered over a button on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe phone, considering whom to call. Whose need might be the most urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before he could touch it, the phone buzzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry pressed send and held it to his ear. \"Thierry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir? It\u0027s me, Lupe. Can you hear me?\" The voice was faint and broken by static, but distant as it was,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry could hear that the caller sounded weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lupe? Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got in a fight, sir. I\u0027m a little torn up.\" She gave a gasping chuckle. \"But you should see the other wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry reached for a leather-bound address book and a goldMont Blanc pen. \"That\u0027s not funny, Lupe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou shouldn\u0027t be fighting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, sir, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve really got to restrain yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me where you are, and I\u0027ll have somebody pick you up. Get you to a doctor.\" Thierry made a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epractice mark with the pen. No ink came out. He stared at the nib of it in mild disbelief. \"You buy an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeight-hundred-dollar pen and then it doesn\u0027t write,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, you\u0027re not listening to me. You don\u0027t understand. I\u0027ve found her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry stopped trying to make the pen write. He stared at it, at his own long fingers holding the chunky,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etextured gold barrel, knowing that this sight would be impressed on his memory as if burned in with a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etorch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear me, sir? I\u0027ve found her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his voice came out at last, it was strangely distant. \"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Yes, sir, I\u0027m sure. She\u0027s got the mark and everything. Her name is Hannah Snow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry reached over the front seat and grabbed the astonished Nilsson with a hand like iron. He said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003every quietly in the driver\u0027s ear, \"Do you have a pencil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pencil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something that writes, Nilsson. An instrument to make marks on paper. Do you have one? Quick,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecause if I lose this connection, you\u0027re fired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got a pen, sir.\" One-handed, Nilsson fished in his pocket and produced a Bic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your salary just doubled.\" Thierry took the pen and sat back. \"Where are you, Lupe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Badlands of Montana, sir. Near a town called Medicine Rock. But there\u0027s something else, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupe\u0027s voice seemed less steady all of a sudden. \"The other wolf that fought me-he saw her, too. And he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egot away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry\u0027s breath caught. \"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\" Lupe was suddenly talking quickly, in a burst of emotion. \"Oh, Thierry, I\u0027m sorry. I tried to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estop him. But he got away-and now I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s off telling... her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t help it, Lupe. And I\u0027ll be there myself, soon. I\u0027ll be there to take care of-everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry looked at the driver. \"We\u0027ve got to make some stops, Nilsson. First, the Harman store.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The witch place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. You can triple your salary if you get there fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Hannah got to Paul Winfield\u0027s house the next afternoon, the sheriff was there. Chris Grady was an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehonest-to-goodness Western sheriff, complete with boots, broad-brimmed hat, and vest. The only thing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emissing, Hannah thought as she walked around to the back of the house where Paul was hammering\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboards across the broken windows, was a horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Chris,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheriff nodded, sun-weathered skin crinkling at the corners of her eyes. She took off her hat and ran\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea hand through shoulder-length auburn hair. \"I see you found yourself a couple of giant timber wolves,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah. You\u0027re not hurt, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah shook her head no. She tried to summon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eup a smile but failed. \"I think they were maybe wolf-dogs or something. Pure-bred wolves aren\u0027t so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaggressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That print wasn\u0027t made by any wolf-dog,\" Chris said. On the concrete flagstones outside the window\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere was a paw print made in blood. It was similar to a dog\u0027s footprint, with four pads plus claw marks\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshowing. But it was more than six inches long by just over five inches wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judging from that, it\u0027s the biggest wolf ever heard of around here, bigger than the White Wolf of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith.\" The sheriff\u0027s eyes drifted to the empty rectangles of the broken windows. \"Big and mean. You\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeople be careful. Something\u0027s going on here that I don\u0027t like. I\u0027ll let you know if we catch your wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded to Paul, who was sucking his finger after banging it with the hammer. Then she set her hat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback on her head and strode off to her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah stared at the paw print silently. Everyone else thought there was something going on. Everyone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause there can\u0027t be, she thought. Because it has to all be in my head. It has to be something I can\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efigure out and fix quick... something I can control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for seeing me again so soon,\" she said to Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh...\" He gestured, tucking the hammer under his arm. \"It\u0027s no trouble. I want to get to the bottom of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat\u0027s upsetting you as much as you do. And,\" he admitted under his breath as he let them in the house,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t actually have any other patients.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah followed him down a hallway and into his office. It was dim inside, the boards across the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewindows reducing the late afternoon sunlight to separate oddly-angled shafts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat in the contoured chair. \"The only thing is, how can we get to the bottom of it? I don\u0027t understand\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat\u0027s upsetting me, either. It\u0027s all too strange. I mean, on the one hand, I\u0027m clearly insane.\" She spoke\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflatly as Paul took his seat on the opposite side of the desk. \"I have crazy dreams, I think the world is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing to end, I have the feeling I\u0027m being followed, and yesterday I started hearing voices in my head. On\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe other hand, me being insane doesn\u0027t explain wolves jumping through the windows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Voices?\" Paul murmured, looking around for a pencil. Then he gave up and faced her. \"Yeah, I know. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstand the temptation. Last night after having those wolves stare at me, I was about ready to believe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat there had to be something...\" He trailed off and shook his head, lifting papers on his desk to glance\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunder them. \"Something... really strange going on. But now it\u0027s daytime, and we\u0027re all rational people,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand we realize that we have to deal with things rationally. And, actually, you know, I think I may have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecome up with a rational explanation.\" He found a pencil and with an expression of vast relief began to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewaggle it between his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope stirred inside Hannah. \"An explanation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I mean, first of all, it\u0027s possible that your premonitions and things are entirely unconnected with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe wolves. People never want to believe in coincidence, but it happens. But even if the two things are\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econnected-well, I don\u0027t think that means that anybody\u0027s after you. It could be that there\u0027s some sort of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edisturbance in this area-something that\u0027s stirring up the whole ecosystem, making wolves crazy,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoing who knows what to other animals... and that you\u0027re somehow sensing this. You\u0027re attuned to it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomehow. Maybe it\u0027s earthquake weather or-or sunspots or negative ions in the air. But whatever it is,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit\u0027s causing you to think that some terrible disaster is coming. That the world is ending or that you\u0027re about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto be killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt the hope sink inside her, and it was more painful than not having had it at all. \"I suppose that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould happen,\" she said. She didn\u0027t want to hurt his feelings. \"But how does it explain this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached into the canvas bag she carried instead of a purse and pulled out a folded slip of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul took the paper and read it. \" \u0027They\u0027ve seen you. They\u0027re going to tell him. This is your last chance to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eget away.\u0027 \" He stuck the pencil in his mouth. \"Hmmm ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found it this morning wrapped around my toothbrush,\" Hannah said quietly. \"And it\u0027s your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehandwriting?\" She shut her eyes and nodded. \"And you don\u0027t remember writing it.\" \"I didn\u0027t write it. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow I didn\u0027t.\" She opened her eyes and took a deep breath. \"The notes scare me. Everything that\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappening scares me. I don\u0027t understand any of it, and I don\u0027t see how I\u0027m supposed to fix it if I don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstand it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul considered, chewing on the pencil gently. \"Look-whatever\u0027s happening, whoever\u0027s writing the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enotes, I think your subconscious mind is trying to tell you something. The dreams are evidence of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0027s not telling you enough. There\u0027s something I was going to suggest, something I don\u0027t exactly believe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein, but that we can try anyway. Something to get to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour subconscious directly so we can ask it what\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet to her subconscious directly.... Hannah held her breath. \"Hypnosis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul nodded. \"I\u0027m not a big hypnosis fan. It\u0027s not some magical trance like TV and the movies want you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto believe. It\u0027s just a state of mind where you\u0027re a little more relaxed, a little more likely to be able to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremember threatening things without choking up. But it\u0027s nothing you can\u0027t achieve yourself by doing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreathing exercises at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah wasn\u0027t happy. Hypnosis still seemed to mean giving up control. If not to Paul, then to her own\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esubconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what else am I supposed to do? She sat and listened to the quiet helplessness in her mind for a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoment. Not a peep from the cool wind voice or the crystal voice-and that was good, as far as she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econcerned. Still, it pointed up the fact that she didn\u0027t have an alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Paul. \"Okay. Let\u0027s do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" He stood, then reached for a book on the corner of his desk. \"Always assuming I remember\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow.... Okay, why don\u0027t you lie down on the couch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah hesitated, then shrugged. If I\u0027m going to do it, I might as well do it right. She lay down and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estared at the dark beams in the ceiling. In spite of how miserable she was feeling, she had an almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eirresistible impulse to giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere she was on a real psychologist\u0027s couch, waiting to be hypnotized. Her friends at school would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever consider even going to a shrink-out here inMontana craziness was okay. After all, you had to be a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elittle eccentric to be living in this hard land in the first place. What wasn\u0027t okay was admitting you couldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edeal with it on your own, paying too much attention to it, asking for help. And allowing yourself to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehypnotized was even worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all think I\u0027m the most independent and together of any of them. If they could see me now. \"Okay, I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewant you to get comfortable and shut your eyes,\" Paul said. He was perched with one hip on the edge of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis desk, leg swinging, book in hand. His voice was quiet and soothing-the professional voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah shut her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I want you to imagine yourself floating. Just floating and feeling very relaxed. There\u0027s nothing you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneed to think about and nowhere you need to go. And now you\u0027re seeing yourself enveloped by a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeautiful violet light. It\u0027s bathing your entire body and it\u0027s making you more and more relaxed ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe couch was surprisingly comfortable. Its curves fit under her, supporting her without being intrusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was easy to imagine that she was floating, easy to imagine the light around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now you feel yourself floating down deeper... into a deeper state of relaxation... and you\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esurrounded by a deep blue light. The blue light is all around you, shining through you, and it\u0027s making you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore comfortable, more relaxed...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soft soothing voice went on, and at its direction Hannah imagined waves of colored light bathing her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebody. Deep blue, emerald green, golden yellow, glowing orange. Hannah saw it all. It was amazing and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeffortless; her mind just showed her the pictures. And as the colors came and went she felt herself\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecoming more and more relaxed, warm and almost weightless. She couldn\u0027t feel the couch underneath\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher any longer. She was floating on light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now you\u0027re seeing a ruby red light, very deep, very relaxing. You\u0027re so relaxed; you\u0027re calm and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomfortable, and everything feels safe. Nothing will upset you; you can answer all my questions without\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eever feeling distressed. Do you understand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Hannah said. She was aware of saying it, but it wasn\u0027t exactly as if she had said it. She wasn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaware of planning to say it. Something within her seemed to be answering Paul using her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t frightening. She still felt relaxed, floating in the ruby light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I\u0027m now speaking to Hannah\u0027s subconscious. You will be able to remember things that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s waking mind isn\u0027t aware of-even things that have been repressed. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Again, the voice seemed to come before Hannah decided to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Now, I\u0027ve got this last note here, the one you found wrapped around your toothbrush this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emorning. Do you remember this note?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, that\u0027s good. And now I want you to go back in your mind, back to the time that this note was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewritten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Hannah was aware of a need to speak. \"But how can I do that? I don\u0027t know when it was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewritten. I didn\u0027t write-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just-just-just let go, Hannah,\" Paul said, overriding her. His voice soothing again, he added, \"Feel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erelaxed, feel yourself becoming very relaxed, and let\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour conscious mind go. Just tell yourself to go back to the time this note was written. Don\u0027t worry about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow. See the ruby light and think 1 will go back.\u0027 Are you doing that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Hannah said. Go back, she told herself gamely. Just relax and go back, okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now, a picture is beginning to form in your mind. You are seeing something. What are you seeing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt something inside her give way. She seemed to be falling into the ruby right. Her ordinary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emind was suspended; it seemed to have been shuttled off to the side somewhere. In this odd dreamlike\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estate, nothing could surprise her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul\u0027s voice was gently insistent. \"What are you seeing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah saw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny picture that seemed to open up, unfold as she stared at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see myself,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Wait, maybe I\u0027m in my room.\" She could see herself, wearing something long and white-a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enightgown. No, she was that self, she was in her bedroom, wearing her nightgown. She was in Paul\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoffice, lying on the couch, but she was in her bedroom at the same time. How strange, she thought dimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, now the picture will get clearer. You\u0027ll begin to see things around you. Just relax and you\u0027ll\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebegin to see them. Now, what are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout feeling anything-except a kind of distant amusement and resignation-Hannah said, \"Writing a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul muttered something that sounded like, \"Aha.\" But it might have been, \"XJh-huh.\" Then he said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esoftly, \"And why are you writing it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know-to warn myself. I have to warn myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt herself shake her own head helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay... what are you feeling as you write it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh ...\" That was easy. Paul was undoubtedly expecting her to say something like \"fear\" or \"anxiety.\" But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat wasn\u0027t the strongest thing she was feeling. Not the strongest at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Longing,\" Hannah whispered. She moved her head restlessly on the couch. \"Just-longing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want-so much ... I want...\" .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Him.\" It came out as a sob. Hannah\u0027s ordinary mind watched somewhere in amazement, but Hannah\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebody was entirely taken over by the feeling, racked with it. \"I know it\u0027s impossible. It\u0027s danger and death\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto me. But I don\u0027t care. I can\u0027t help it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa, whoa, whoa. I mean, you\u0027re feeling very relaxed. You\u0027re very calm and you can answer my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equestions. Who is this person that you\u0027re longing for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one who comes,\" Hannah said softly and hopelessly. \"He\u0027s wicked and evil ... I know that. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexplained it all to me. And I know he\u0027ll kill me. The way he always has. But I want him.\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was trembling. She could feel her own body radiating heat-and she could hear Paul swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow in this expanded state of consciousness she seemed to be able to see him, as if she could be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeverywhere at once. She knew he was sitting there on the edge of the desk, looking at her dazedly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebewildered by the transformation in the young woman on his couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew he could see her, her face pale and glowing from inner heat, her breath coming quickly, her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebody gripped by a fine muscular tremor. And she knew he was stirred-and frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, boy.\" Paul\u0027s breath came out and he shifted on the desk. He bowed his head, then lifted it, looking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor a pencil. \"Okay, I have to admit, I\u0027m lost. Let\u0027s just go back to the beginning here. You feel that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomebody is after you, and that he\u0027s tried to kill you before? Some old boyfriend who\u0027s stalking you,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emaybe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He hasn\u0027t tried to kill me. He has killed me.\" \"He has killed you.\" Paul bit his pencil. He muttered, \"I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshould have known better than to have started this. I don\u0027t believe in hypnosis anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s going to do it again. I\u0027ll die before my seventeenth birthday. It\u0027s my punishment for loving him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt always happens that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Okay. Okay, let\u0027s try something really basic here.... Does this mystery guy have a name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah lifted a hand and let it drop. \"When?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When what? What?\" Paul shook his head. \"Oh, hell-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah spoke precisely. \"He\u0027s used different names at different times. He\u0027s had-hundreds, I guess. But I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink of him as Thierry. Thierry Descouedres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause that\u0027s the one he\u0027s used for the last couple of lifetimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. Then Paul said, \"The last couple of ... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lifetimes. It may still be his name now. The last time I saw him he said he wouldn\u0027t bother to change it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanymore. He wouldn\u0027t bother to hide any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul said, \"Oh, God.\" He stood, walked to the window, and put his head in his hands. Then he turned\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback to Hannah. \"Are we talking about ... I mean, tell me we\u0027re not talking about...\" He paused and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen his voice came out soft and boneless. \"The Big R? You know...\" He winced. \"Reincarnation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Hannah heard her own voice say flatly, \"He hasn\u0027t been reincarnated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Paul\u0027s breath came out in relief. \"Well, thank God. You had me scared there for a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s been alive all this time,\" Hannah said. \"He isn\u0027t human, you know.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-3.html","bookId":2080,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM"}
