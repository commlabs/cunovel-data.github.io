The heat from his body scorched me as his breath tickled my cheek when he leaned in another inch. I gulped, unable to control my erratic panting, and tried to focus on his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy I chose his neck, I have no idea. But right then, even the freckle on his pulse looked too damn sexy to calm me. I wanted to sink my teeth in it and taste him. I think I even swayed toward it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you know,” he murmured, causing my nerves to wrench in eager, delicious contact with the sound of his voice and the wash of his warm, moist breath on me, “that when you’re sexually aroused your heart starts pumping fast to circulate the blood to all organs that’re preparing to fuck? So you start breathing harder to support the oxygen rushing through your lungs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed my eyes shut and bowed my head, trying desperately to slow my breathing, but instead I ended up jerking in a loud, shuddering gasp that made it overly obvious just how out of control my lungs were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cupped the side of my neck just under my earlobe, his fingers skimming around to the sensitive part of my nape while his thumb just barely grazed my lower jaw. The tip of his nose brushed the rim of my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you listening to me, Zoey? Do you hear me breathing just as hard as you are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA relieved sob tore from my throat and my eyes flashed open when I realized he was breathing as hard as I was. I lifted my face and met his gaze. His eyes were glassy and bloodshot, but the expression was just as uncertain and hopeful as I knew mine was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took my hands and laced our fingers together. More pressure tightened around my chest. I couldn’t believe this was happening. Quinn was touching me, and I was letting him. We both wanted what was coming next, and we both knew it. It was so crazy, yet amazing, a complete dream come true. I didn’t even care how wrong it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched me as he pressed our foreheads together. My breasts swelled and pulsed with pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whimpered, needing something, I have no idea what, but I knew Quinn could supply it. And he did. He dipped his face until his lips glanced the very corner of my mouth. I turned my face his way, seeking more, but he shifted back, teasing me out of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze flitted from my lips to my eyes. Ever so vigilant, he read my expression, testing my response. “Is this okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when I couldn’t stand it a second longer. I dove at him and kissed him for real, fitting my mouth completely against his. I had no idea what to expect, but the rush of endorphins to my head, the weightlessness in my stomach and the curling of my toes surprised me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn groaned and abandoned my hip to catch my face in his large, warm palms. His mouth moved over mine, and the tips of his fingers felt abrasive and hard and delicious as they skimmed through my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arched up, needing to get closer. My heart beat wonkily in my chest as he tugged me in until I was straddling him and pressing my throbbing core to his straining erection. I felt everything, the hard plane of his chest, the strength of muscle in his powerful thighs, the steel bulge of his arousal pressing into me. His mouth attacked mine as he kissed me hard and ruthlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I wasn’t freaked out. That might’ve been the craziest part of it all. I trusted Quinn implicitly. He could do anything, absolutely anything, because I knew I’d want it and I’d like it. I was already that far gone. So when he began to rub little circles over the hinges of my jaw with his thumbs, I followed his lead and let my lips part for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue swooped in, and he claimed me in a whole new way. Mine slid against his, eager but hesitant. He made a sound of approval that hummed from his throat. Then he wrapped his tongue around mine and showed me how to make them dance. Even with the hint of alcohol, I loved the way he tasted, all fresh and crisp and completely Quinn. Hungry for more, I clamped my thighs around his hips and ground against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned and pressed right back against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! That was it. Right there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI broke free of the brutally hot kiss and gasped for breath. Quinn tucked his face into my throat and panted as he continued to ride his hips hard against me. It seemed like the most natural thing in the world to wrap my legs around him and imagine him deep inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the next step after kissing?” he rasped breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wha...what?” I shook my head, my brows puckering in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Steps of intimacy,” he repeated. “You know...arm to shoulder, mouth to mouth. What’s next?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow he could remember something like that at a time like this, I’ll never know. I couldn’t even remember my own name. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-100.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
