Well, I shall leave you then.\u0027 He excused himself. \u0027You will be in excellent hands with my friend Felix Leiter.\u0027 He gave a short smile which embraced them both and walked with an unhurried gait towards the caisse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeiter sensed the rebuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He\u0027s a very serious gambler, Miss Lynd,\u0027 he said. \u0027And I guess he has to be. Now come with me and watch Number 17 obey my extra-sensory perceptions. You\u0027ll find it quite a painless sensation being given plenty of money for nothing.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond was relieved to be on his own again and to be able to clear his mind of everything but the task on hand. He stood at the caisse and took his twenty-four million francs against the receipt which had been given him that afternoon. He divided the notes into equal packets and put half the sum into his right-hand coat pocket and the other half into the left. Then he strolled slowly across the room between the thronged tables until he came to the top of the room where the broad baccarat table waited behind the brass rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe table was filling up and the cards were spread face down being stirred and mixed slowly in what is known as the \u0027croupiers\u0027 shuffle\u0027, supposedly the shuffle which is most effective and least susceptible to cheating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chef de partie lifted the velvet-covered chain which allowed entrance through the brass rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve kept Number 6 as you wished, Monsieur Bond.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were still three other empty places at the table. Bond moved inside the rail to where a huissier was holding out his chair. He sat down with a nod to the players on his right and left. He took out his wide gunmetal cigarette-case and his black lighter and placed them on the green baize at his right elbow. The huissier wiped a thick glass ash-tray with a cloth and put it beside them. Bond lit a cigarette and leant back in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpposite him, the banker\u0027s chair was vacant. He glanced round the table. He knew most of the players by sight, but few of their names. At Number 7, on his right, there was a Monsieur Sixte, a wealthy Belgian with metal interests in the Congo. At Number 9 there was Lord Danvers, a distinguished but weak-looking man whose francs were presumably provided by his rich American wife, a middle-aged woman with the predatory mouth of a barracuda, who sat at Number 3. Bond reflected that they would probably play a pawky and nervous game and be amongst the early casualties. At Number 1, to the right of the bank was a well-known Greek gambler who owned, as in Bond\u0027s experience apparently everyone does in the Eastern Mediterranean, a profitable shipping line. He would play coldly and well and would be a stayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond asked the huissier for a card and wrote on it, under a neat question mark, the remaining numbers, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, and asked the huissier to give it to the chef de partie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon it came back with the names filled in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber 2, still empty, was to be Carmel Delane, the American film star with alimony from three husbands to burn and, Bond assumed, a call on still more from whoever her present companion at Royale might be. With her sanguine temperament she would play gaily and with panache and might run into a vein of luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen came Lady Danvers at Number 3 and Numbers 4 and 5 were a Mr and Mrs Du Pont, rich-looking and might or might not have some of the real Du Pont money behind them. Bond guessed they would be stayers. They both had a business-like look about them and were talking together easily and cheerfully as if they felt very much at home at the big game. Bond was quite happy to have them next to him - Mrs Du Pont sat at Number 5 - and he felt prepared to share with them or with Monsieur Sixte on his right, if they found themselves faced with too big a bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Number 8 was the Maharajah of a small Indian state, probably with all his wartime sterling balances to play with. Bond\u0027s experience told him that few of the Asiatic races were courageous gamblers, even the much-vaunted Chinese being inclined to lose heart if the going was bad. But the Maharajah would probably stay in the game and stand some heavy losses if they were gradual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber 10 was a prosperous-looking young Italian, Signor Tomelli, who possibly had plenty of money from rackrents in Milan and would probably play a dashing and foolish game. He might lose his temper and make a scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond had just finished his sketchy summing-up of the players when Le Chiffre, with the silence and economy of movement of a big fish, came through the opening in the brass rail and, with a cold smile of welcome for the table, took his place directly opposite Bond in the banker\u0027s chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the same economy of movements the thick slab of cards which the croupier had placed on the table squarely between his blunt relaxed hands. Then, as the croupier fitted the six packs with one swift exact motion into the metal and wooden shoe, Le Chiffre said something quietly to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Messieurs, mesdames, les jeux sont faits. Un banco de cinq cent mille,\u0027 and as the Greek at Number 1 tapped the table in front of his fat pile of hundred-mille plaques, \u0027Le banco est fait.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLe Chiffre crouched over the shoe. He gave it a short deliberate slap to settle the cards, the first of which showed its semicircular pale pink tongue through the slanting aluminium mouth of the shoe. Then, with a thick white fore-finger he pressed gently on the pink tongue and slipped out the first card six inches or a foot towards the Greek on his right hand. Then he slipped out a card for himself, then another for the Greek, then one more for himself\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat immobile, not touching his own cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the Greek\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his flat wooden spatula, like a long bricklayer\u0027s trowel, the croupier delicately lifted up the Greek\u0027s two cards and dropped them with a quick movement an extra few inches to the right so that they lay just before the Greek\u0027s pale hairy hands which lay inert like two watchful pink crabs on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two pink crabs scuttled out together and the Greek gathered the cards into his wide left hand and cautiously bent his head so that he could see, in the shadow made by his cupped hand, the value of the bottom of the two cards. Then he slowly inserted the forefinger of his right hand and slipped the bottom card slightly sideways so that the value of the top card was also just perceptible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was quite impassive. He flattened out his left hand on the table and then withdrew it, leaving the two pink cards face down before him, their secret unrevealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he lifted his head and looked Le Chiffre in the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Non,\u0027 said the Greek flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the decision to stand on his two cards and not ask for another, it was clear that the Greek had a five, or a six, or a seven. To be certain of winning, the banker had to reveal an eight or a nine. If the banker failed to show either figure, he also had the right to take another card which might or might not improve his count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLe Chiffre\u0027s hands were clasped in front of him, his two cards three or four inches away. With his right hand he picked up the two cards and turned them face upwards on the table with a faint snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were a four and a five, an undefeatable natural nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Neuf â€¦ la banque,\u0027 quietly said the croupier. With his spatula he faced the Greek\u0027s two cards, \u0027Et le sept,\u0027 he said unemotionally, lifting up gently the corpses of the seven and queen and slipping them through the wide slot in the table near his chair which leads into the gib metal canister to which all dead cards are consigned. Le Chiffre\u0027s two cards followed them with a faint rattle which comes from the canister at the beginning of each session before the discards have made a cushion over the metal floor of their oubliette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Greek pushed forward five plaques of one hundred thousand and the croupier added these to Le Chiffre\u0027s half million plaque which lay in the centre of the table. From each bet the Casino takes a tiny percentage, the cagnotte, but it is usual at a big game for the banker to subscribe this himself either in a prearranged lump or by contributions at the end of each hand, so that the amount of the bank\u0027s stake can always be a round figure. Le Chiffre had chosen the second course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe croupier slipped some counters through the slot in the table which receives the cagnotte and announced quietly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Un banco d\u0027un million.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Suivi,\u0027 murmured the Greek, meaning that he exercised his right to follow up his lost bet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond lit a cigarette and settled himself in his chair. The long game was launched and the sequence of these gestures and the reiteration of this subdued litany would continue until the end came and the players dispersed. Then the enigmatic cards would be burnt or defaced, a shroud would be draped over the table and the grass-green baize battlefield would soak up the blood of its victims and refresh itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Greek, after taking a third card, could achieve no better than a four to the bank\u0027s seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Un banco de deux millions,\u0027 said the croupier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe players on Bond\u0027s left remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Banco,\u0027 said Bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 11 - MOMENT OF TRUTH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLe Chiffre looked incuriously at him, the whites of his eyes, which showed all round the irises, lending something impassive and doll-like to his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly removed one thick hand from the table and slipped it into the pocket of his dinner-jacket. The hand came out holding a small metal cylinder with a cap which Le Chiffre unscrewed. He inserted the nozzle of the cylinder, with an obscene deliberation, twice into each black nostril in turn, and luxuriously inhaled the benzedrine vapour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnhurriedly he pocketed the inhaler, then his hand came quickly back above the level of the table and gave the shoe its usual hard, sharp slap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this offensive pantomime Bond had coldly held the banker\u0027s gaze, taking in the wide expanse of white face surmounted by the short abrupt cliff of reddish-brown hair, the unsmiling wet red mouth and the impressive width of the shoulders, loosely draped in a massively cut dinner-jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for the high-lights on the satin of the shawl-cut lapels, he might have been faced by the thick bust of a black-fleeced Minotaur rising out of a green grass field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond slipped a packet of notes on to the table without counting them. If he lost the croupier would extract what was necessary to cover the bet, but the easy gesture conveyed that Bond didn\u0027t expect to lose and that, this was only a token display from the deep funds at Bond\u0027s disposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other players sensed a tension between the two gamblers and there was silence as Le Chiffre fingered the four cards out of the shoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe croupier slipped Bond\u0027s two cards across to him with the tip of his spatula. Bond, still with his eyes holding Le Chiffre\u0027s, reached his right hand out a few inches, glanced down very swiftly, then as he looked up again impassively at Le Chiffre, with a disdainful gesture he tossed the cards face upwards on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were a four and a five - an unbeatable nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a little gasp of envy from the table and the players to the left of Bond exchanged rueful glances at their failure to accept the two million franc bet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a hint of a shrug, Le Chiffre slowly faced his own two cards and flicked them away with his fingernail. They were two valueless knaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Le baccarat,\u0027 intoned the croupier as he spaded the thick chips over the table to Bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond slipped them into his right-hand pocket with the unused packet of notes. His face showed no emotion, but he was pleased with the success of his first coup and with the outcome of the silent clash of wills across the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman on his left, the American Mrs Du Pont, turned to him with a wry smile. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-9.html","bookId":2424,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:43 PM"}
