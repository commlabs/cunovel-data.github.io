{"id":109530,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eEVEN THOUGH EDDIE had told me not to worry about Angeline, the curious part of me couldn\u0027t help but prod him about it on the drive over to Adrian\u0027s apartment. \"How are you going to handle it?\" I asked. \"Have a heart-to-heart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Mostly I was going to simply avoid her unless absolutely necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully she\u0027ll lose interest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. I guess that\u0027s one method. But, I mean, you\u0027re a pretty direct person.\" If faced with a roomful of Strigoi, he would\u0027ve walked in without hesitation. \"Maybe you should try that kind of approach instead. Just confront her and tell her honestly that you\u0027re not interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s easy in theory,\" he said. \"Not so much in person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems easy to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie was skeptical. \"That\u0027s because you\u0027ve never had to do it.\" Going to Adrian\u0027s was a lot easier than it once had been for me. His apartment used to belong to Keith and was also the site where a Moroi named Lee and two Strigoi had died. Those were hard memories to shake. The Alchemists had offered the apartment to me, since I\u0027d also taken on full responsibility for Palm Springs, but I\u0027d yielded it to Adrian. I hadn\u0027t been sure I wanted to live there, and he\u0027d been pretty desperate for his own place. When I\u0027d seen how happy the apartment made him, I knew I\u0027d made the right choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian opened the door before we\u0027d barely had a chance to knock. \"The cavalry! Thank God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hid a smile as Eddie and I stepped inside. The first thing that always hit me about this place was the sunny yellow paint Adrian had put up on the walls. He was convinced it helped the mood and had warned us not to question his \"artistic sensibilities.\" The fact that the yellow clashed pretty terribly with his secondhand plaid furniture was apparently irrelevant. Or maybe I just wasn\u0027t \"artistic\" enough to appreciate it. Nonetheless, I actually found the erratic style comforting. It bore little resemblance to Keith\u0027s decorating, making it a little easier to blot out the events of that awful night. Sometimes, when I looked around the living room, my breath would catch as visions of the vicious Strigoi attack and Lee\u0027s death haunted me. Adrian\u0027s stamp on the apartment was like light chasing away the gruesome shadows of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes when I was down, Adrian\u0027s personality had a similar effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice blouse, Sage,\" he told me, deadpan. \"It really brings out the khaki in your pants.\" His sarcasm aside, he looked supremely delighted to see us. He had the tall, lean build that most Moroi guys did, along with their typically pale (though not Strigoi-pale) skin. I hated to admit it, but he was more good-looking than he had any right to be. He wore his dark brown hair stylishly messy and had eyes that sometimes seemed too green to be real. Adrian had on one of those button-up printed shirts that were trendy with guys lately, with a blue pattern on it I liked. He smelled like he\u0027d been smoking recently, which I didn\u0027t like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri and Sonya were sitting at the kitchen table going over a bunch of papers with hand-written notes on them. The papers were kind of haphazardly scattered around, which made me wonder how much work they could really be accomplishing. I would have had those pages neatly stacked and organized by topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad you\u0027re back, Sydney,\" said Sonya. \"I\u0027ve needed a little female support here.\" The prettiness of her red hair and high cheek bones was tainted by the fact that she showed her fangs when she smiled. Most Moroi were taught early to avoid that, to prevent detection from humans. Sonya had no qualms about doing it in private. It still bugged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri smiled at me. It made his already handsome face even more so, and I knew that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zen master wisdom\" wasn\u0027t the reason Rose had fallen for him. \"I\u0027m guessing you didn\u0027t take a nap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too much to do,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya gave Eddie a curious look. \"We\u0027ve been wondering where you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Busy at Amberwood,\" said Eddie vaguely. He\u0027d mentioned in the car that it might be best if Angeline\u0027s indiscretion and his forced shopping weren\u0027t mentioned. \"You know, keeping an eye on Jill and Angeline. Besides, I was waiting until Sydney came back since she wanted to see what we were doing.\" I let the white lie slide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is Angeline?\" asked Dimitri. \"Is she improving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie and I exchanged glances. So much for avoiding her indiscretions. \"Improving how exactly?\" I asked. \"In combat, in following the dress code, or in keeping her hands to herself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or in turning off caps-lock?\" added Eddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You noticed that too?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard not to,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri looked surprised, which was not a common thing. He wasn\u0027t caught off guard very often, but then, no one could really prepare for what Angeline might do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t realize I needed to be more specific,\" said Dimitri after a pause. \"I meant combat.\" Eddie shrugged. \"There\u0027s a little improvement, but it\u0027s hard to get through to her. I mean, she\u0027s absolutely dead set on protecting Jill, but she\u0027s also convinced she already knows how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s got years of that sloppy training drilled into her. It\u0027s hard to break that. Plus, she\u0027s...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeasily distracted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to swallow a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri still looked troubled. \"She has no time for distraction. Maybe I should talk to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Eddie firmly, in a rare show of contradicting Dimitri. \"You\u0027ve got plenty to do here. She\u0027s my responsibility to train. Don\u0027t worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian pulled up a chair, turning it backwards so he could rest his chin on its back. \"What about you, Sage? I know we don\u0027t have to worry about you violating the dress code. Did you have fun at your Alchemist spa this weekend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set down my bag and walked over to the refrigerator. \"If by spa, you mean underground bunker. And it was just business.\" I made a face as I looked inside. \"You promised to get me diet pop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did promise that,\" said Adrian, no remorse whatsoever. \"But then I read some article that said those artificial sweeteners aren\u0027t good for you. So, I figured I\u0027d watch out for your health.\" He paused. \"You\u0027re welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri said what we were all thinking. \"If you want to start tackling healthy habits, I could suggest a few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Eddie or I had said that, it would have rolled right off Adrian - particularly since it was completely valid. But coming from Dimitri? That was different. There was a huge amount of tension between the two men, tension that had been building for a long time. Dimitri\u0027s girlfriend, a notorious dhampir named Rose Hathaway, had briefly dated Adrian. She hadn\u0027t meant to hurt him, but she\u0027d been in love with Dimitri the whole time. So, there was no way that situation could have ended well. Adrian still carried a lot of scars from that and was particularly bitter toward Dimitri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t want to inconvenience you,\" said Adrian, a bit too coolly. \"Besides, when not hard at work with this research, I\u0027m actually conducting a side experiment on how cigarettes and gin increase charisma. As you might guess, the results are looking very promising.\" Dimitri arched an eyebrow. \"Wait, go back. Did you say hard at work?\" Dimitri\u0027s tone was light and playful, and again, I was struck by the double standard here. If I\u0027d made that comment, Adrian\u0027s response would\u0027ve been something like, \"Absolutely, Sage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll probably win the Nobel Prize for this.\" But for Adrian, Dimitri\u0027s words were a call to battle. I saw a glint of something hard in Adrian\u0027s eyes, a stirring of some old pain, and it bothered me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t his way. He always had a smile and a quip, even if they were often irreverent or inappropriate. I\u0027d gotten used to that. I kind of liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Adrian with a smile that I hoped looked genuine, rather than a desperate attempt to provide distraction. \"Research, huh? I thought you were a gambling man.\" It took Adrian a few moments to drag his gaze from Dimitri and fix it on me. \"I\u0027ve been known to roll the dice now and then,\" he said warily. \"Why?\" I shrugged. \"No reason. Just wondering if you\u0027d put your charisma research on hold and step up for a challenge. If you went twenty-four hours without cigarettes, I\u0027d drink a can of pop. Regular pop. The whole can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the glimmer of Adrian\u0027s earlier smile returning. \"You would not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I totally would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half a can would put you into a coma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya frowned. \"Are you diabetic?\" she asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Adrian, \"but Sage is convinced one extraneous calorie will make her go from super skinny to just regular skinny. Tragedy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said. \"You think it\u0027d be a tragedy to go an hour without a cigarette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t question my steel resolve, Sage. I went without one for two hours today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show me twenty-four, and then I\u0027ll be impressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a look of mock surprise. \"You mean you aren\u0027t already? And here I thought you were dazzled from the moment you met me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya shook her head indulgently at the two of us, like we were adorable children. \"You\u0027re missing out, Sydney,\" she remarked, tapping the open pop in front of her. \"I need about three of these a day to keep me focused on all this work. No detrimental effects so far.\" No detrimental effects so far? Of course not. Moroi never had any. Sonya, Jill... they could all eat whatever they wanted and still keep those amazing bodies. Meanwhile, I labored over every calorie and still couldn\u0027t reach that level of perfection. Fitting into these size four khakis had been a triumph this morning. Now, looking at Sonya\u0027s slender build, I felt enormous by comparison. I suddenly regretted my comment about drinking a can of pop, even if it had succeeded in distracting Adrian. I supposed I could rest easy knowing that him skipping cigarettes for a day was impossible. I\u0027d never be called to pay up on my sugary wager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should probably get to work. We\u0027re losing time.\" That was Dimitri, getting us back on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" said Adrian. \"This is five minutes of valuable research wasted. Up for more fun, Castile? I know how much you love sitting around.\" Because they were trying to find something special about Dimitri, Sonya and Adrian would often sit the two dhampirs side by side and study their auras in fine detail. Their hope was that Dimitri\u0027s Strigoi conversion had left some sign that would help explain the immunity to being turned again. It was a valid idea, though not something that someone as active as Eddie enjoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t complain, of course. Eddie wore a look as tough and determined as Dimitri. \"Tell me what you need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want to do another aura study,\" said Sonya. Looked like poor Eddie would be doing some more sitting around. \"Last time we focused on any sign of spirit. This time, we want to show both of you some pictures and see if they trigger any color changes in your auras.\" I nodded in approval. A lot of psychological experiments attempted similar techniques, though they usually monitored physiological responses instead of mystical auras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still say it\u0027s a waste,\" said Adrian. \"They\u0027re both dhampirs, but that doesn\u0027t mean we can assume any different reactions they have are because Belikov was a Strigoi. Everyone\u0027s unique. Everyone\u0027s going to respond differently to pictures of kittens or spiders. My old man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hates kittens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who could hate kittens?\" asked Eddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian made a face. \"He\u0027s allergic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrian,\" said Sonya. \"We\u0027ve already been over this. I respect your opinion but still think we can learn a lot.\" I was actually impressed that Adrian had an opinion. So far, I\u0027d kind of felt like he was just going along with everything Sonya and Dimitri told him to do and that he didn\u0027t give these experiments much thought. And, although I wasn\u0027t familiar with the auras that surrounded all living creatures, I could understand his point that individual differences would throw off their research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All data is useful in this case,\" said Dimitri. \"Especially since we haven\u0027t found anything so far. We know there\u0027s something different about former Strigoi. We can\u0027t rule out any chance to observe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian\u0027s lips tightened, and he made no further protest. Maybe it was because he felt overruled, but I had a feeling it was because he just didn\u0027t want to engage with Dimitri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the attention off me, I settled into the living room with a book and tried to stay awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t need me. I\u0027d simply come to keep Eddie company. Occasionally, I\u0027d check the others\u0027 progress. Dimitri and Eddie watched as Sonya flipped through different images on her laptop. In turn, Adrian and Sonya watched the dhampirs closely and made notes on paper. I almost wished I could see the bands of color and light and wondered if there really were any noticeable differences. Studying Eddie and Dimitri, I sometimes would notice a change in facial expression when particularly cute or horrific images showed up on the screen, but for the most part their work remained a mystery to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, I walked over to Sonya when they were about halfway through. \"What do you see?\" I asked in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colors,\" she said. \"Shining around all living things. Eddie and Dimitri have different colors, but they have the same reactions.\" She changed the picture on the screen to one of a factory spilling black smoke into an otherwise clear sky. \"Neither of them like this. Their auras dim and turn troubled.\" She flipped to the next image, a smile on her lips. Three kittens appeared on the screen. \"And now they warm up. Affection is very easy to spot in an aura. So far, they react in normal ways. There\u0027s no sign in Dimitri\u0027s aura that he\u0027s different from Eddie.\" I returned to the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a couple of hours, Sonya called a halt. \"I think we\u0027ve seen what we needed to. Thank you, Eddie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Happy to help,\" he said, rising from his chair and stretching. He seemed relieved both that it was over and that it had involved something slightly more interesting than staring off into space. He was active and energetic, and didn\u0027t like captivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Although... we\u0027ve got a few other ideas,\" she added. \"Do you think you guys can power through a little longer?\" Naturally, she asked just as I was yawning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie regarded me with sympathy. \"I\u0027ll stay, but you don\u0027t have to. Go sleep. I\u0027ll get a ride home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" I said, stifling a second yawn. \"I don\u0027t mind. What are your other ideas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping to do something similar with Eddie and Dimitri,\" she explained. \"Except this time, we\u0027d use sounds instead of images. Then I\u0027d like to see how they respond to direct contact with spirit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think that\u0027s a good idea,\" I said, not really sure what that last one would entail. \"Go for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya glanced around and seemed to notice I wasn\u0027t the only one who looked tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should get some food first.\" Eddie brightened up at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go,\" I offered. It was a sign of my progress that vampires talking about \"food\" no longer made me hyperventilate. I knew she didn\u0027t mean blood, not if the dhampirs and I were being involved. Besides, there was no feeder around. Feeders were humans who willingly gave blood to Moroi for the high it produced. Everyone here knew better than to even joke about that around me. \"There\u0027s a good Thai carryout place a few blocks away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll help,\" said Adrian eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll help,\" said Sonya. \"The last time you ran an errand, you were gone two hours.\" Adrian scowled but didn\u0027t deny the charge. \"Our aura observations have been identical anyway. You can get them started on the sounds without me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya and I took everyone\u0027s orders and set out. I didn\u0027t really feel like I needed help, but I supposed carrying food for five people - even for a few blocks - could get unwieldy. I soon learned she had other motives for coming along, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It feels good to get outside and stretch my legs,\" she said. It was early evening, with significantly less sun and heat - a condition the Moroi loved. We walked along a side street leading toward downtown, lined with cute apartments and small businesses. All around us, huge palm trees loomed, providing an interesting contrast to the eclectic urban setting. \"I\u0027ve been cooped up there all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at her. \"And here I thought Adrian was the only one who got cabin fever from the work you guys do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just complains the most,\" she explained. \"Which is kind of funny since he also probably gets out the most, between his classes and his cigarette breaks.\" I\u0027d nearly forgotten about the two art classes Adrian was taking at a local college. He usually kept his latest projects on display, but there\u0027d been none in the living room lately. I hadn\u0027t realized until that moment how much I missed them. I might give him a hard time, but sometimes those artistic glimpses into the way he thought were fascinating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya gave me a brief recap of her wedding plans as we walked the short distance to the Thai restaurant. Her relationship with dhampir Mikhail Tanner was kind of epic on a lot of levels, I supposed. First, dhampirs and Moroi didn\u0027t generally get involved in serious relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually, they were just casual affairs that resulted in the reproduction of more dhampirs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the scandal of even being involved, Mikhail had actually wanted to hunt down Sonya when she was a Strigoi to free her from that twisted state. Rose had attempted the same with Dimitri, believing death was better than being a Strigoi. Mikhail had failed, but their love had remained steadfast enough through the ordeal that when she\u0027d defied the odds and been restored, they\u0027d immediately gotten back together. I couldn\u0027t even begin to imagine love like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re still deciding on flowers,\" she continued. \"Hydrangeas or lilies. I\u0027m guessing I know what your vote is for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I\u0027d say hydrangeas. I\u0027m around too many lilies already.\" She laughed at that and suddenly knelt near a flower bed filled with gladiolas. \"More than you know. There are lilies sleeping in this bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re out of season,\" I pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s ever out of season.\" Sonya glanced around covertly and then rested her fingers on the earth. Moments later, dark green shoots appeared, growing taller and taller until a red trumpet lily opened up on top. \"Ah. Red. Alchemists ones are white - oh, are you okay?\" I had backed up so far on the sidewalk that I\u0027d nearly walked into the street. \"You... you shouldn\u0027t do that. Someone might see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one saw,\" she said, getting to her feet. Her face softened. \"I\u0027m so sorry. I forget sometimes how you feel about this. It was wrong of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" I said, not sure that it was. Vampire magic always made my skin crawl. Vampires, creatures who needed blood, were bad enough. But being able to manipulate the world with magic? Even worse. That lily, although beautiful, took on a sinister edge now. It shouldn\u0027t have existed this time of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more was said about magic, and we soon reached the main strip downtown, where the Thai restaurant was. We placed a giant carryout order and were told it would take about fifteen minutes. Sonya and I lingered outside, admiring downtown Palm Springs in twilight. Lastminute shoppers were out before the boutiques closed, and all the restaurants were hopping with those coming and going. Many of them had outdoor tables on the sidewalk, and friendly conversation buzzed around us. A large fountain, tiled in bright colors, fascinated children and inspired tourists to stop for photo ops. Sonya was easily distracted by the various plants and trees that the city used to beautify the streets. Even without spirit\u0027s ability to affect living things, she was still quite the gardener.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey you! Elder Melrose!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and winced when I saw Lia DiStefano striding toward me. Lia was a fashion designer with a shop here in downtown Palm Springs. I hadn\u0027t realized we were standing directly across from her store. If I had, I would\u0027ve waited inside the restaurant. Lia was short but had an overwhelming presence, enhanced by the flamboyant gypsy style she often chose for her personal attire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been calling you for weeks,\" she said, once she reached our side of the street. \"Why don\u0027t you answer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been really busy,\" I said straight-faced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" Lia put her hands on her hips and tried to stare me down, which was kind of amazing since I was taller. \"When are you going to let your sister model for me again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss DiStefano,\" I said patiently, \"I\u0027ve told you before. She can\u0027t do it anymore. Our parents don\u0027t like it. Our religion doesn\u0027t allow faces to be photographed.\" Last month, Jill\u0027s runway-perfect build and gorgeous, ethereal features had attracted Lia\u0027s attention. Seeing as having your picture taken en masse was kind of a bad way to stay in hiding, we\u0027d only agreed to let Jill walk in Lia\u0027s fashion show because all the models wore Venetian masks. Lia had been on me ever since to let Jill model again. It was hard because I knew Jill wanted to, but she understood as well as I did that her safety came first. Claiming we were part of some obscure religion had often explained away our weird behaviors to others, so I\u0027d figured it would get Lia off my back. It hadn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never hear from these parents of yours,\" Lia said. \"I\u0027ve watched your family. I see how it is. You\u0027re the authority. You\u0027re the one I have to go through. I have the chance to do a major magazine spread for my scarves and hats, and Jill was born to do it. What\u0027s it going to take to get her? You want a cut of the pay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"It\u0027s not about the money. We can\u0027t show her face. If you want to put her in a Venetian mask again, then be my guest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLia scowled. \"I can\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027re at an impasse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There must be something. Everyone has a price.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\" There was no price in the world she could offer to get me to shirk my duty to Jill and the Alchemists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA restaurant clerk stuck his head outside and called that our order was ready, mercifully freeing us from Lia. Sonya chuckled as we loaded up on our bags and headed back down the street to make the walk to Adrian\u0027s. The sky was still purple with the last of the day\u0027s light, and street lamps made whimsical patterns on the sidewalk as they cast their light through the leaves of palm trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ever imagine your job here would involve dodging aggressive fashion designers?\" Sonya asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I admitted. \"Honestly, I never foresaw half the stuff this job has - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sonya?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young man appeared seemingly out of nowhere, blocking our path. He was no one I knew and looked to be a little older than me. He wore his black hair in a buzz cut and was staring curiously at Sonya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came to a halt and frowned. \"Do I know you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brightened. \"Sure. Jeff Eubanks. Remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said politely, after a few moments of study. \"You must have me mistaken for someone else. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" he said. \"I know it\u0027s you. Sonya Karp, right? We met in Kentucky last year.\" Sonya stiffened. She\u0027d made Kentucky her home while she was a Strigoi. I knew those couldn\u0027t be pleasant memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she repeated, voice strained. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" The guy was undaunted, still smiling as though they were best friends. \"You\u0027ve come a long ways from Kentucky. What brings you out here? I just transferred for work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s some mistake,\" I told him sternly, nudging Sonya forward. I didn\u0027t know what that mistake could be exactly, but Sonya\u0027s attitude was all I needed. \"We have to go.\" The guy didn\u0027t follow us, but Sonya remained silent for most of the walk home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must be hard,\" I said, feeling like I should say something. \"Meeting people from your past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"He\u0027s not. I\u0027m certain of it. I\u0027ve never met him.\" I\u0027d figured she just wanted to avoid all associations with being a Strigoi. \"You\u0027re sure? He wasn\u0027t just some casual acquaintance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot me a wry look. \"Strigoi don\u0027t have casual acquaintances with humans. They have them for dinner. That guy shouldn\u0027t have known who I was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was human? Not dhampir?\" I couldn\u0027t tell the difference, but Moroi could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya had stopped again and was glancing back at the guy\u0027s retreating figure. I followed her gaze. \"There must be some reason he recognized you. He seems pretty harmless.\" That got me another smile. \"Come now, Sydney. I figured you\u0027d been around us long enough to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s ever as harmless as it seems.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-golden-lily-bloodlines-2/page-3.html","bookId":2042,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:15 PM"}
