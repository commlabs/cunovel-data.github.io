It\u0027s not just because she\u0027s gorgeous. It\u0027s because she\u0027s walking toward me. To be with me. Even if it\u0027s only for tonight or for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulp and grin at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles back and everything seems right with the world, a strange and unusual feeling for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mila is halfway to me, Tony says quietly, \"Don\u0027t hurt that girl or you will answer to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at him and he\u0027s got a gruff, rigid look on his face, very different from the congenial bartender he was a second ago. But I understand it. He\u0027s protecting Mila and I\u0027ve got to respect that. I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try not to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony nods back as he towels off a glass. \"Do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila slides up next to me, breaking the sudden tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she murmurs and she places her slender hand on my shoulder. I fight the urge to lift it into mine and kiss it. It\u0027s a strange inclination for me. But she seems to bring out strange things in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I answer. \"You ready for our date?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins again. \"Absolutely. Why don\u0027t we put our food orders in before the kitchen closes and then we\u0027ll open a bottle of wine. I\u0027ll show you the best table in the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabs my hand and leads me through the quiet dining room to an even quieter table for two by the windows. The entire back of the restaurant faces the lake which is easily visible through the windows. To the left, I see an Italian-style patio, which I must assume is used for dining in the summer months. It\u0027s too chilly to eat out there now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will this be all right, monsieur?\" Mila asks with a smile and an exaggerated accent. I grin back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"French? I thought this was some fancy Italian joint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggles, handing me a menu as I sit. I catch a hint of her perfume as she moves and I inhale it. She smells like heaven, just the way her mouth tastes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not aiming to be fancy. We\u0027re aiming to be an authentic Italian place. We just did a bunch of renovations this past summer to improve the ambiance and make it feel like you\u0027re in Italy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around at the rough stucco walls, the Italian art, the rustic charm. It does seem like we\u0027re sitting in an old-world kitchen. So I tell her that and she beams. Apparently, that\u0027s exactly the look they were going for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have the lasagna,\" I tell her. \"Is it good here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives me a look. \"Everything\u0027s good here. Make sure to tell all your friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. \"I don\u0027t have that many. But I\u0027ll try and pimp your restaurant for you anyway. How do you feel about the rougher type of crowd?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives me a dry look and darts away, presumably to turn our food order in. She\u0027s back within a minute with a bottle of wine and she settles into the chair across from me. The candlelight flickering on our table casts a soft light onto her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wine?\" she asks as she pours me a glass of red. I nod, which is good, because she\u0027s already pouring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I tell her. \"It\u0027s a beautiful night, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance out the windows, at the lake that is calm and dark in the night. Mila follows my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love the lake,\" she tells me quietly. \"I know that most of us do that live here, but I really love it. It\u0027s so comforting. It\u0027s always the same no matter what else changes in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to stare at her, because I feel exactly the same way. It\u0027s one of the reasons that I choose to live here, perched on the very edge of it. The lake symbolizes continuity to me. And it is comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila stares at me, her gaze pensive. I notice now that her eyes are the softest shade of green, almost like jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about yourself,\" she instructs softly as she sips from her wine. Her fingers almost stroke the wine glass and I find that I am jealous of it. I also notice that she\u0027s wearing a deep red ring on her middle finger that is the exact shade of the wine. I take a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, my name is Pax Alexander Tate. You know where I live now, but you probably don\u0027t know that I grew up in Connecticut and we moved to Chicago when I was seven. My father is still there. He\u0027s an attorney downtown. But I moved here a few years back. I love the lake, just like you. I love the peace and quiet and the solitude. I\u0027m not the most social person, and I knew that people in lake towns are used to leaving other people alone. Locals know that sometimes people come here for exactly that reason - to be alone, away from the noise of the city. That\u0027s why I chose to move to Angel Bay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila smiles encouragingly, as if she knows how hard it is for me to talk about myself. And honestly, I don\u0027t know why it is. What I\u0027m doing right now is just rattling off facts. It\u0027s not like I\u0027m getting into anything deeply personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your mom?\" she asks curiously. \"Are your parents divorced? Is that why you moved to Chicago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now we\u0027re in deeply personal territory. I inhale again and realize that my hand is clenched tightly against my thigh. I relax my fingers. This is just a conversation. No big deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom died years ago. When I was seven. My dad and I moved to Chicago to get away from the memories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila freezes, her gorgeous green eyes glued to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m...I... I didn\u0027t know that,\" she finally stammers. \"I\u0027m really sorry. You didn\u0027t say anything earlier at the hospital when I told you about my parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her. \"I know. I don\u0027t usually talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she sick?\" Mila asks. \"Did you have a chance to say goodbye? I think that was the worst thing about my parents\u0027 deaths. I didn\u0027t get a chance to say goodbye. It was so sudden. So shocking. The shock of it was the worst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to think back to when my mom died, and like always, I draw a big blank. The only thing I ever see when I try to think on it is a bunch of vague whiteness. No memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you ever remember things by colors?\" I ask her off-handedly. \"See, because I was so young, I apparently blocked all the memories of my mother\u0027s death. She died suddenly, also in a car crash, like your parents. But I can\u0027t remember anything about it. When I think about it, all I see is a big whiteness, like a blank screen, almost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila seems shocked. \"I do that too,\" she whispers. \"I associate colors with pretty much everything. I think it\u0027s because I\u0027m an artist. I paint for a living, so I naturally see things in paint. I don\u0027t know how to explain you, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile. \"No one knows how to explain me,\" I tell her wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you were a little boy when your mom died,\" Mila says slowly. \"That must have been horrible for you. No wonder you suppressed the memories. How did your dad handle it? Do you have any other family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, I would be put off by someone probing into my personal life. But I know that Mila doesn\u0027t mean any harm. I think she\u0027s just trying to figure me out, to see what makes me tick. I almost laugh, because that\u0027s pretty impossible to do, I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was a little boy,\" I confirm. \"And I think it probably was horrible. But like I said, I pretty much don\u0027t have any memories of it at all. I don\u0027t remember much until I turned nine or so. My old therapist, the one I had when I was a kid, said that it was my brain\u0027s way of protecting itself from the trauma. My dad didn\u0027t handle it well, either. It\u0027s one of the reasons that we moved away. He\u0027s never been the same. My mom took a little piece of him when she died. And no. I don\u0027t have any family other than him. My grandfather, my mother\u0027s father, is still alive. But he was pretty pissed when we moved and stopped talking to me. He runs an oil company, which is how I make my living. I inherited my mother\u0027s shares.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, I\u0027ve shared more with Mila than I\u0027ve shared with anyone in a long time. I guess I really hadn\u0027t realized how secluded I\u0027ve become until this moment. It\u0027s pretty sad. I\u0027ve never really had a use for anyone else. Until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at Mila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, now you have my life\u0027s story. What about you? I know your parents died. What else is there to know about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach for the bottle of wine and fill our glasses up again. I have a feeling that we\u0027ll both need it by the time the evening is out. I glance around and find that the restaurant has pretty much cleared out, except for some clattering in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m still fascinated by the fact that we have more in common that I had thought,\" Mila admits, her cheeks flushed from the wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we belong to an elite club,\" I roll my eyes. \"We know what it\u0027s like to lose a parent at a young age. Lucky us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were much younger than me,\" she tells me seriously. \"I was grown and in college. I can\u0027t imagine what that would do to a little boy- to grow up without his mama. Was your grandma alive for a while at least? Did you have any kind of female influence at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"No. My grandma died before I was born. And no, I didn\u0027t have any kind of female influence, other than teachers as I was growing up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right there, with one breath, Mila touched on something that I\u0027d never thought about. Had the fact that I didn\u0027t have a mother (or any other female) affect me more than I had known? Is that why I\u0027m not good at relating to women?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the look on Mila\u0027s face, I think she\u0027s wondering the same thing. But she doesn\u0027t say anything. There\u0027s a bit of sympathy in her eyes though and I hate that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t feel sorry for me,\" I tell her. \"There are millions of people who have had their mother die. You did, as well. I\u0027m not so unique. We all get through it as best we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares at me again, her face pensive. \"So you don\u0027t cut yourself any slack at all that you grew up without a mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes. \"Are you trying to find some sort of reason that I\u0027ve become such an asshole? The reason is...I\u0027m an asshole. There are some things in life that can\u0027t be explained. Period. Assholes are assholes. Rainbows are pretty. Kittens are cute. Chick flicks are sad. It\u0027s the way of things, no explanations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now she rolls her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things are the way they are, but everything has a reason. Kittens are cute because they\u0027re tiny fur-balls with smushed faces. Rainbows are pretty because they have every color in the world in them and they\u0027re made from refracted light. Chick flicks are sad because chicks sometimes just need a good cry. And assholes are always assholes for a reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares at me again, her eyes full of determination, and I can see that she truly wants to pick me apart and see what makes me tick. I suddenly feel naked beneath her gaze. But as luck would have it, our food arrives at this most perfect of times, and I almost sigh with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sister Madison sets our plates down in front of us. Lasagna for me, penne for Mila. A basket of bread between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should be all set,\" she tells us, but she\u0027s looking at Mila, not me. \"If you just want to put your dishes in the kitchen and lock up when you\u0027re done, that would be great. Everyone else will be leaving soon. Are you good here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raises an eyebrow at her sister and I know she\u0027s really asking Mila, Are you okay here with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fight the need to glare at her. She\u0027s the one who left her little sister alone and drunk with an asshole last night. I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila nods and smiles. \"We\u0027re good, Maddy. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison nods and leaves without looking at me again. I look at Mila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your sister\u0027s an ice bitch,\" I point out politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila throws her head back and laughs. \"Why don\u0027t you tell me how you really feel, Pax?\" She giggles again, then adds, \"Maddy\u0027s just protective. She\u0027s all I have now and she takes that role pretty seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise an eyebrow. \"She didn\u0027t last night when she left you alone with Jared the asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila shakes her head. \"She feels badly about that. She can\u0027t handle her liquor very well either and she made a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, but let it go as we dive into our food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is very good,\" I tell her. \"It\u0027s no wonder this place is swamped in tourist season.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles. \"Thank you. It was my parents\u0027 dream. And Madison is keeping it alive for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continue eating by the candlelight, the silence surprisingly comfortable. I\u0027ve never been with someone before when I didn\u0027t feel the need to fill the awkward silence. With Mila, nothing seems awkward. She\u0027s got an easy way about her that puts me at ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we\u0027re finished, we carry our plates to the kitchen and Mila turns to me, her slender hand on my chest. I glance down at her in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not ready to say goodnight yet,\" she tells me softly. \"Would you like to go for a walk on the beach?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. \"Of course. Let\u0027s get our jackets though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI help her shrug into hers and then I follow her outdoors, over the worn trail leading down to the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila grabs my hand as we walk and holds it, and it feels really intimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to play here on this beach when I was a kid,\" she tells me as she gazes around at the frozen wild-grass and gray water. \"Maddy and I used to run up and down this stretch of sand while our parents worked in the restaurant. It was a great childhood. Where did you play?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think on that as I guide her around a piece of driftwood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t really remember,\" I tell her. \"I have bits of memories from my grandfather\u0027s estate. I think my mother maybe took me there from time to time. And I remember a few Christmases. But nothing more than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at me sympathetically again, but doesn\u0027t say anything. I have a feeling she knows that I wouldn\u0027t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think there\u0027s a God?\" she asks, changing the subject. And it seems so out of the blue. I stare at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of question is that? It\u0027s so random.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and we continue to walk and I feel the moisture of the wet sand permeating my dress shoes. I wish that I would have worn my boots, but they would have looked out of place with slacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s not really random. I just wonder from time to time. Don\u0027t you? I never really thought about it until my parents died, but now it crosses my mind sometimes. I can\u0027t help it. And we were talking about other deep things tonight, so I just thought I\u0027d ask. I\u0027m trying to get to know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles and squeezes my hand and my heart softens a bit. There\u0027s something about this girl. I know that she could ask anything, and I\u0027d probably answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I tell her. \"I don\u0027t know about God. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s there somewhere. Out there. Probably looking down on all of us and wondering why we\u0027re so fucked up. And if he\u0027s there, I\u0027m sure he forgot about me a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila\u0027s breath catches in her throat, I can hear it. And she stops, turning to me, her hand on my arm. She looks up at me, her eyes filled with something that I can\u0027t identify.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you say that?\" she asks quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s something missing in me, Mila. It\u0027s just not there and I\u0027m not sure if it ever was. And I\u0027m pretty sure that God doesn\u0027t mess around with someone like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, there\u0027s a lump in my throat and I have no idea why. I swallow it and stare down at the delicate, beautiful girl on the beach beside me. Anyone else might have tucked tail and run. But not her. Her feet are planted and her eyes are wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reaches up and touches my chest, then my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong,\" she tells me softly. \"About everything. You don\u0027t see yourself the way I see you. But if you did, you would know that there\u0027s nothing missing in you at all. I think that you\u0027ve always used drugs to block out questions that you\u0027ve had about yourself, or doubt or fear. I\u0027m not sure what all your reasons were. But I know that you\u0027ve got things you\u0027ve never dealt with or thought about, and that\u0027s probably why you feel a void now. But once you discover what it is that you need to deal with, you\u0027ll feel whole again. No more holes, no more voids. That\u0027s what I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes burn as I stare down at this incredibly perceptive woman. I do have a lot of shit that I\u0027ve never bothered to think about. In fact, I went way out of my way to avoid thinking about it. And maybe that was what was most to my detriment - not doing crazy shit, like I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you know me better than you should,\" I tell her gruffly. She smiles her delicate smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know you nearly as well as I\u0027d like to,\" she answers, wrapping her arms around my neck. \"But I\u0027m going to remedy that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she kisses me. As she does, everything seems right in the world, like it always does when she\u0027s in my arms. It\u0027s like holding a ray of sunshine. I kiss her until we can\u0027t breathe and when we finally pull away, we take a breath and kiss again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stars twinkle overhead, the lake is soundless and calm to our left and for the first time in as long as I can remember, I feel like I\u0027m home. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-11.html","bookId":2758,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:14 PM"}
