What did you run all the way here for? Don’t tell me that you want me to make another gun for you, right? Let’s get something straight first, this time, I will have to charge you, and not one cent less!” The captain who was like a chunk of black steel shrugged his shoulders. Then, he clicked his tongue a few times and said, “The amount of time you’ve served as a dragonrider isn’t small now, but you are still like those fellas from the wilderness! You don’t even know to bring a bottle or two of good alcohol before coming!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu didn’t pay Curtis’ jeering any attention. Instead, after choosing his words carefully, he said, “I want to learn the art of combat.

His loud and clear voice shook the warehouse walls until pieces of rust fell off. “If you want me to join you, that’s easy. All you need is money! However, it has to be cash and not some I owe you!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe shrewd and ruthless captain’s words left Su speechless with a single sentence. Curtis clearly understood Su’s financial situation. After experiencing the captain’s training camp, Su obviously knew that this captain that was like a chunk of black steel’s brain was just as developed as his muscles.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“As for art of combat, I believe I already taught you before during the training camp.

Wait for me a bit, and then we’ll go to the training camp.

Its trembling body couldn’t help but make one feel that if even a slightly larger piece of rock was weighing down on it, this antique that should have exploded a long time ago would fall apart.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis vehicle that should have two rows of seats had its back portion torn off a long time ago, and the driving seat had been extended all the way back. Even though this was the case, it could still only allow the captain to barely fit inside. The captain wasn’t actually that large when compared to those power strengthened fellas that were often over two meters in height. However, the captain was quite wide, wide to a terrifying degree!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu was tightly pressed up against the vehicle’s door, to the extent where he was almost like a painting hanging from the door.

I’m not doing this for you, but for Persephone!

Moreover, this is a major event, so why does even a little girl who can’t keep her mouth shut know about it? Persephone needs a man who is alive, not a deformed corpse!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen he saw the roaring captain, Su put away his cold expression and seriously said, “I killed Sarton, so there is no way for me and Mitchels to reconcile with each other anymore. As for why I told that girl these matters, it is to have her spread the news. If Mitchels wants to kill me, then he should just come after me in the wilderness!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe captain remained silent for a long time. Then, he said, “Even though your abilities are a bit below average, you still know to pick your own home ground, so your death might not be guaranteed. However, Mitchels is a crafty old fox. He won’t fall for your tricks.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu laughed and said, “Is that so?

After carefully looking him over for a long time, he shook his head and said, “Youngster, you really did change.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I did change, moreover, extremely thoroughly.” Su said.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAn hour later, the Dodge that was spitting out thick smoke and noise smashed through the dragonrider training ground’s gates. This vehicle that should have been scrapped a long time ago drew everyone’s attention. In front of the new dragonrider style buildings around, this olden era industrial era antique looked extremely out of place.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eJust like when he got onto the vehicle, the captain squeezed his way out from the vehicle with difficulty.
