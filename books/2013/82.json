That shall not occur again, unless your carelessness permits it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a gentle bend in the river, Letheras revealed itself, sprawling up and back from the north shore, magnificent bridges arching over garishly painted buildings and the haze of innumerable cookfires. Domes and terraces, towers and platforms loomed, edges blurred in the gold-lit smoke. The imperial quays were directly ahead, just beyond a mole, and the first dromons of the fleet were shipping oars and swinging in towards berths. Scores of figures were gathering along the waterfront, including a bristling procession coming down from the Eternal Domicile, pennons and standards wavering overhead-the official delegation, although Yan Tovis noted that there were no Edur among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed that Triban Gnol’s quiet usurpation was all but complete. She was not surprised. The Chancellor had probably begun his plans long before King Ezgara Diskanar downed the fatal draught in the throne room. Ensuring a smooth transition, is how he would have defended himself. The empire is greater than its ruler, and that is where lies the Chancellor’s loyalty. Always and for ever more. Laudable sentiments, no doubt, but the truth was never so clear. The lust for power was a strong current, roiling with clouds that obscured all to everyone, barring, perhaps, Triban Gnol himself, who was at the very centre of the maelstrom. His delusion of control had never been challenged, but Yan Tovis believed that it would not last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, the Tiste Edur had returned. Tomad Sengar, Hanradi Khalag and three other former war chiefs of the tribes, as well as over four thousand seasoned warriors who’d long ago left their naivety behind, lost in Callows, in Sepik, Nemil, the Perish Coast, Shal-Morzinn and Drift Avalii, in a host of foreign waters, among the Meckros-the journey had been long. Fraught-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The nest is about to be kicked awake,’ Taralack Veed said, a rather ugly grin twisting his features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis shrugged. ‘To be expected. We have been absent a long time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Maybe your Emperor is already dead. I see no Tiste Edur in that contingent.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I do not think that likely. Our K’risnan would have known.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Informed by their god? Yan Tovis, no gift from a god comes for free. More, if it sees fit, it will tell its followers nothing. Or, indeed, it will lie. The Edur do not understand any of this, but you surprise me. Is it not the very nature of your deity, this Errant, to deceive you at every turn?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Emperor is not dead, Taralack Veed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then it is only a matter of time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So you continually promise.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he shook his head. ‘I do not speak of Icarium now. I speak of when a god’s chosen one fails. And they always do, Twilight. We are never enough in their eyes. Never faithful enough, never fearful enough, never abject enough. Sooner or later we betray them, in weakness or in overwrought ambition. We see before us a city of bridges yet what I see and what you see are two different things. Do not let your eyes deceive you-the bridges awaiting us are all too narrow for mortals.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir ship slowly angled in towards the central imperial dock like a weary beast of burden, and a handful of Edur officers were now on deck, whilst sailors readied the lines along the port rail. The stench of effluent from the murky waters rose thick enough to sting the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed spat onto his hands and smoothed back his hair yet again. ‘Almost time. I go to collect my champion.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoticed by no-one, Turudal Brizad, the Errant, stood with his back to a quayside warehouse thirty or so paces from the main pier. His gaze noted the disembarking of Tomad Sengar-the venerable warrior looking worn and aged-and his expression, as he observed the absence of Tiste Edur among the delegation from the palace, seemed to grow darker by the moment. But neither he nor any of the other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e¦ ¦\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdur held the god’s attention for long. His attention sharpened as the Atri-Preda in command of this fleet’s Letherii Marines strode the length of the gangway, followed by a half-dozen aides and officers, for he sensed, all at once, that there was something fated about the woman. Yet the details eluded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe god frowned, frustrated by his diminishing percipience. He should have sensed immediately what awaited Yan Tovis. Five years ago he would have, thinking nothing of the gift, the sheer privilege of such ascendant power. Not since those final tumultuous days of the First Empire-the succession of ghastly events that led to the intercession of the T’lan Imass to quell the fatal throes of Dessimbelackis’s empire-had the Errant felt so disconnected. Chaos was rolling towards Letheras with the force of a cataclysmic wave, an ocean surge that simply engulfed this river’s currents-yes, it comes from the sea. That much 1 know, that much I can feel. From the sea, just like this woman, this Twilight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-82.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
