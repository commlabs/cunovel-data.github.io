Since she heard the muted sounds of the Today show, she gave the door a knuckle rap. \"It\u0027s Quinn,\" she added, in case Layla was still jumpy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLayla opened the door in a pretty damn cute pair of purple-and-white-striped pajama pants and a purple sleep tank. There was color in her cheeks, and her quiet green eyes had the clarity that told Quinn she\u0027d been awake awhile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m about to head out to Cal\u0027s. Mind if I come in a minute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She stepped back. \"I was trying to figure out what I\u0027m supposed to do with myself today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can come with me if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Into the woods? Not quite ready for that, thanks. You know...\" Layla switched off the TV before dropping into a chair. \"I was thinking about the wimp statement you made last night. I\u0027ve never been a wimp, but it occurred to me as I was huddled in bed with the shades drawn and this stupid chair under the doorknob that I\u0027ve never had anything happen that tested that before. My life\u0027s been pretty normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came here, and you\u0027re still here. So I\u0027m thinking that puts you pretty low on the wimp scale. How\u0027d you sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Once I got there, good. No dreams, no visitations, no bumps in the night. So, of course, now I\u0027m wondering why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No dreams for me either.\" Quinn glanced around the room. Layla\u0027s bed was a sleigh style and the color scheme was muted greens and creams. \"We could theorize that your room here\u0027s a safe zone, but that\u0027s off because mine isn\u0027t, and it\u0027s two doors down. It could be that whatever it is just took the night off. Maybe needed to recharge some expended energy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Happy thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got my cell number, Cal\u0027s, Fox\u0027s. We\u0027ve got yours. We\u0027re-connected. I wanted to let you know that the diner across the street, figuring you\u0027re not going to try the dining room here again, has a nice breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking I might try room service, and start on the books that you gave me last night. I didn\u0027t want to try them for bedtime reading.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wise. Okay. If you head out, it\u0027s a nice town. Some cute little shops, a little museum I haven\u0027t had time to explore so can\u0027t give you a rating, and there\u0027s always the Bowl-a-Rama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hint of a smile appeared around Layla\u0027s mouth. \"Is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Cal\u0027s family\u0027s place. Interesting, and it feels like the hub of the town. So, I\u0027ll look you up when I get back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Quinn?\" Layla added as Quinn reached for the door. \"Wimp scale or not, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d still be here if I hadn\u0027t run into you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know how you feel. I\u0027ll see you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC AL WAS WAITING FOR HER WHEN SHE DROVE UP. He stepped out, started down the steps, the dog wandering behind him, as she got out of the car. He took a scan, starting with her feet. Good, sturdy hiking boots that showed some scars and wear, faded jeans, tough jacket in I\u0027m-Not-a-Deer red, and a multistriped scarf that matched the cloche-style cap on her head. Silly hat, he mused, that was unaccountably appealing on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, he decided she knew what to wear on a hike through the winter woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I pass muster, Sergeant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He came down the rest of the steps. \"Let\u0027s start this off with me saying I was off base by a couple inches last night. I haven\u0027t completely resolved dealing with you, and now there\u0027s another person in the mix, another unknown. When you live with this as long as I have, part of you gets used to it, and other parts just get edgier. Especially when you\u0027re into the seventh year. So, I\u0027ll apologize, if you need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. Wind, sails sucked out. Okay, I can\u0027t be pissed off after that or it\u0027s just bitchy instead of righteous. So let me say this. Before I came here, this was an idea for a book, a job I enjoy on a level some might consider twisted, and that I consider vastly fascinating. Now, it\u0027s more personal. While I can appreciate you being somewhat edgy, and somewhat proprietary, I\u0027m bringing something important to the table. Experience and objectivity. And guts. I\u0027ve got some impressive guts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve noticed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, we\u0027re going to do this thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we\u0027re going to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave the dog who came over to lean on her a rub. \"Is Lump seeing us off on our adventure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s coming. He likes to walk in the woods when the mood strikes. And if he\u0027s had enough, he\u0027ll just lie down and sleep until he\u0027s in the mood to walk back home again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strikes me as a sensible attitude.\" She picked up a small pack, hitched it on, then drew her tape recorder out of her pocket. It was attached to the pocket with a small clamp. \"I\u0027m going to want to record observations, and whatever you tell me. Okay with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He\u0027d given it a lot of thought overnight. \"I\u0027m okay with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m ready when you are, Tonto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trail\u0027s going to be sloppy,\" he said as they started toward the woods. \"Given that, from this point it\u0027ll take about two hours-a little more depending-to reach the clearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in no hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal glanced up at the sky. \"You will be if the weather turns, or anything holds us up after sundown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clicked on her recorder, and hoped she\u0027d been generous enough with her cache of extra tapes and batteries. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Years back people hiked or hunted in this section of the woods routinely. Now they don\u0027t. People got lost, turned around, spooked. Some reported hearing what they thought were bear or wolves. We don\u0027t have wolves and it\u0027s rare for bear to come this far down the mountains. Kids, teens mostly, used to sneak in to swim in Hester\u0027s Pool in the summer, or to screw around. Now they don\u0027t. People used to say the pool was haunted, it was kind of a local legend. Now, people don\u0027t like to talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it\u0027s haunted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know there\u0027s something in it. I saw it myself. We\u0027ll talk about that once we get to the pool. No point in going into it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Is this the way the three of you came in on your birthday twenty-one years ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We came in from the east.\" He gestured. \"Track closest to town. This way\u0027s shorter, but it would\u0027ve been a longer ride around for us from town. There wasn\u0027t anything...off about it, until we got to the pool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have the three of you been back together since that night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we went back. More than once.\" He glanced toward her. \"I can tell you that going back anytime near the Seven isn\u0027t an experience I look forward to repeating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Seven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what we call the week in July.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me more about what happens during the Seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to do just that, he thought. To say it straight-out to someone who wanted to know. To someone, maybe, who was part of the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People in the Hollow get mean, violent, even murderous. They do things they\u0027d never do at any other time. Destroy property, beat the hell out of each other, start fires. Worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Murders, suicides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. After the week\u0027s up, they don\u0027t remember clearly. It\u0027s like watching someone come out of a trance, or a long illness. Some of them are never the same. Some of them leave town. And some fix up their shop or their house, and just go on. It doesn\u0027t hit everyone, and it doesn\u0027t hit those it does all in the same way. The best I can explain is it\u0027s like a mass psychotic episode, and it gets stronger each time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of habit, Cal reached down, picked up a stick. There was no point in tossing it for Lump, that would only embarrass them both. So he held it down so Lump could take it into his mouth and plod contentedly along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chief Larson was in charge last time. He was a good man, went to school with my father. They were friends. The third night, he locked himself in his office. I think he, some part of him anyway, knew what was happening to him, and didn\u0027t want to risk going home to his wife and kids. One of the deputies, guy named Wayne Hawbaker, nephew to Fox\u0027s secretary, came in looking for him, needed help. He heard Larson crying in the office. Couldn\u0027t get him to come out. By the time Wayne knocked down the door, Larson had shot himself. Wayne\u0027s chief of police now. He\u0027s a good man, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow much loss had he seen? Quinn wondered. How many losses had he suffered since his tenth birthday? And yet he was walking back into these woods, back where it all began for him. She didn\u0027t think she\u0027d ever known a braver stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the county cops, the state cops?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like we\u0027re cut off for that week.\" A cardinal winged by, boldly red, carelessly free. \"Sometimes people get out, sometimes they get in, but by and large, we\u0027re on our own. It\u0027s like...\" He groped for words. \"It\u0027s like this veil comes down, and nobody sees, not clearly. Help doesn\u0027t come, and after, nobody questions it too closely. Nobody looks straight on at what happened, or why. So it ends up being lore, or Blair Witch stuff. Then it fades off until it happens again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay, and you look at it straight on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my town,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Quinn thought, that was the bravest stand she\u0027d ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you sleep last night?\" he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dreamlessly. So did Layla. You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same. Always before, once it started, it didn\u0027t stop. But then, things are different this time around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I saw something, and so did Layla.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the big one. And it\u0027s never started this early, or this strong.\" As they walked, he studied her face. \"Have you ever had a genealogy done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You think we\u0027re related back when, or I\u0027m related to someone who was involved in whatever happened at the Pagan Stone way back when?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think, we\u0027ve always thought, this was about blood.\" Absently, he glanced at the scar on his wrist. \"So far, knowing or sensing that hasn\u0027t done any good. Where are your ancestors from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"England primarily, some Irish tossed in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine, too. But then a lot of Americans have English ancestry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I should start researching and find out if there are any Dents or Twisses in my lineage?\" She shrugged when he frowned at her. \"Your great-grandmother sent me down that path. Have you tried to trace them? Giles Dent and Lazarus Twisse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Dent may be an ancestor, if he did indeed father the three sons of Ann Hawkins. There\u0027s no record of him. And other than accounts from the time, some old family letters and diaries, no Giles Dent on anything we\u0027ve dug up. No record of birth, death. Same for Twisse. They could\u0027ve dropped down from Pluto as far as we\u0027ve been able to prove.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a friend who\u0027s a whiz on research. I sent her a heads-up. And don\u0027t get that look on your face again. I\u0027ve known her for years, and we\u0027ve worked together on other projects. I don\u0027t know as yet if she can or will come in on this, but trust me, if she does, you\u0027ll be grateful. She\u0027s brilliant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than respond, he chewed on it. How much of his resistance was due to this feeling of losing control over the situation? And had he ever had any control to begin with? Some, he knew, was due to the fact that the more people who became involved, the more people he felt responsible for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe most of all, how much was all this exposure going to affect the town?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Hollow\u0027s gotten some publicity over the years, focused on this whole thing. That\u0027s how you found out about us to begin with. But it\u0027s been mild, and for the most part, hasn\u0027t done much more than bring interested tourists through. With your involvement, and now potentially two others, it could turn the Hollow into some sort of lurid or ridiculous caption in the tourist guides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew that was a risk when you agreed to talk to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was keeping pace with him, stride-by-stride on the sloppy ground. And, she was striding into the unknown without a quake or a quiver. \"You\u0027d have come whether or not I agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So part of your cooperation is damage control.\" She nodded. \"Can\u0027t blame you. But maybe you should be thinking bigger picture, Cal. More people invested means more brains and more chance of figuring out how to stop what\u0027s been happening. Do you want to stop it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than I can possibly tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want a story. There\u0027s no point in bullshitting you about that. But I want to stop it, too. Because despite my famous guts, this thing scares me. Better shot at that, it seems to me, if we work together and utilize all our resources. Cybil\u0027s one of mine, and she\u0027s a damn good one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll think about it.\" For now, he thought, he\u0027d given her enough. \"Why don\u0027t you tell me what made you head down the woo-woo trail, writing-wise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s easy. I always liked spooky stuff. When I was a kid and had a choice between, say, Sweet Valley High or Stephen King, King was always going to win. I used to write my own horror stories and give my friends nightmares. Good times,\" she said and made him laugh. \"Then, the turning point, I suppose, was when I went into this reputed haunted house with a group of friends. Halloween. I was twelve. Big dare. Place was falling down and due to be demolished. We were probably lucky we didn\u0027t fall through floorboards. So we poked around, squealed, scared ourselves, and had some laughs. Then I saw her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ghost, of course.\" She gave him a friendly elbow poke. \"Keep up. None of the others did. But I saw her, walking down the stairs. There was blood all over her. She looked at me,\" Quinn said quietly now. \"It seemed like she looked right at me, and walked right by. I felt the cold she carried with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do? And if I get a guess, I\u0027m guessing you followed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, I followed her. My friends were running around, making spooky noises, but I followed her into the falling-down kitchen, down the broken steps to the basement by the beam of my Princess Leia flashlight. No cracks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I crack when I had a Luke Skywalker flashlight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. What I found were a lot of spiderwebs, mouse droppings, dead bugs, and a filthy floor of concrete. Then the concrete was gone and it was just a dirt floor with a hole-a grave-dug in it. A black-handled shovel beside it. She went to it, looked at me again, then slid down, hell, like a woman might slide into a nice bubble bath. Then I was standing on the concrete floor again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your guess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d guess you and Leia got the hell out of there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right again. I came out of the basement like a rocket. I told my friends, who didn\u0027t believe me. Just trying to spook them out as usual. I didn\u0027t tell anyone else, because if I had, our parents would have known we were in the house and we\u0027d have been grounded till our Social Security kicked in. But when they demolished the house, started jackhammering the concrete floor, they found her. She\u0027d been in there since the thirties. The wife of the guy who\u0027d owned the house had claimed she\u0027d run off. He was dead by then, so nobody could ask him how or why he\u0027d done it. But I knew. From the time I saw her until they found her bones, I dreamed about her murder, I saw it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t tell anyone. I was too afraid. Ever since, I\u0027ve told what I find, confirming or debunking. Maybe partly to make it up to Mary Bines-that was her name. And partly because I\u0027m not twelve anymore, and nobody\u0027s going to ground me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing for a long time. \"Do you always see what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s seeing or just intuiting, or just my imagination, which is even more far-famed than my guts. But I\u0027ve learned to trust what I feel, and go with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped, gestured. \"This is where the tracks cross. We came in from that direction, picked up the cross trail here. We were loaded down. My mother had packed a picnic basket, thinking we were camping out on Fox\u0027s family farm. We had his boom box, his load from the market, our backpacks full of the stuff we figured we couldn\u0027t live without. We were still nine years old. Kids, pretty much fearless. That all changed before we came out of the woods again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he started to walk once more, she put a hand on his arm, squeezed. \"Is that tree bleeding, or do you just have really strange sap in this part of the world?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, looked. Blood seeped from the bark of the old oak, and seeped into the soggy ground at its trunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That kind of thing happens now and again. It puts off the hikers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet.\" She watched Lump plod by the tree after only a cursory sniff. \"Why doesn\u0027t he care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old hat to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to give the tree a wide berth, then stopped. \"Wait, wait. This is the spot. This is the spot where I saw the deer across the path. I\u0027m sure of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He called it, with magick. The innocent and pure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to speak, then looking at Cal\u0027s face, held her tongue. His eyes had darkened; his cheeks had paled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Its blood for the binding. Its blood, his blood, the blood of the dark thing. He grieved when he drew the blade across its neck, and its life poured onto his hands and into the cup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his head swam, Cal bent over from the waist. Prayed he wouldn\u0027t be sick. \"Need a second to get my breath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy.\" Quickly, Quinn pulled off her pack and pulled out her water bottle. \"Drink a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the queasiness passed when she took his hand, pressed the bottle into it. \"I could see it, feel it. I\u0027ve gone by this tree before, even when it\u0027s bled, and I never saw that. Or felt that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two of us this time. Maybe that\u0027s what opened it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drank slowly. Not just two, he thought. He\u0027d walked this path with Fox and Gage. We two, he decided. Something about being here with her. \"The deer was a sacrifice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get that. Devoveo. He said it in Latin. Blood sacrifice. White witchery doesn\u0027t ascribe to that. He had to cross over the line, smear on some of the black to do what he felt he needed to do. Was it Dent? Or someone who came long before him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause she could see his color was eking back, her own heart rate settled. \"Do you see what came before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bits, pieces, flashes. Not all of it. I generally come back a little sick. If I push for more, it\u0027s a hell of a lot worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not push then. Are you okay to go on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Yeah.\" His stomach was still mildly uneasy, but the light-headedness had passed. \"We\u0027ll be coming to Hester\u0027s Pool soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027m going to tell you what it looks like before we get there. I\u0027m telling you I\u0027ve never been there before, not in reality, but I\u0027ve seen it, and I stood there night before last. There are cattails and wild grass. It\u0027s off the path, through some brush and thorny stuff. It was night, so the water looked black. Opaque. Its shape isn\u0027t quite round, not really oval. It\u0027s more of a fat crescent. There were a lot of rocks. Some more like boulders, some no more than pebbles. She filled her pockets with them-they looked to be about hand-sized or smaller-until her pockets were sagging with the weight. Her hair was cut short, like it\u0027d been hacked at, and her eyes looked mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her body didn\u0027t stay down, not according to reports.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve read them,\" Quinn acknowledged. \"She was found floating in the pool, which came to bear her name, and because it was suicide, they buried her in unconsecrated ground. Records I\u0027ve dug up so far don\u0027t indicate what happened to the infant daughter she left behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore replacing the pack, she took out a bag of trail mix. Opened it, offered. Cal shook his head. \"There\u0027s plenty of bark and twigs around if I get that desperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t bad. What did your mother pack for you that day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ham-and-cheese sandwiches, hard-boiled eggs, apple slices, celery and carrot sticks, oatmeal cookies, lemonade.\" Remembering made him smile. \"Pop-Tarts, snack pack cereal for breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uppercase M Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, always has been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long do we date before I meet the parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered. \"They want me to come for dinner some night soon if you want in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A home-cooked meal by Mom? I\u0027m there. How does she feel about all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard for them, all of this is hard. And they\u0027ve never let me down in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a lucky man, Cal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke trail, skirting the tangles of blackberry bushes, and following the more narrow and less-trod path. Lump moved on ahead, as if he understood where they were headed. The first glint of the pool brought a chill down his spine. But then, it always did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBirds still called, and Lump-more by accident than design, flushed a rabbit that ran across the path and into another thicket. Sunlight streamed through the empty branches onto the leaf-carpeted ground. And glinted dully on the brown water of Hester\u0027s Pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks different during the day,\" Quinn noted. \"Not nearly as ominous. But I\u0027d have to be very young and very hot to want to go splashing around in that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were both. Fox went in first. We\u0027d snuck out here before to swim, but I\u0027d never much liked it. Who knew what was swimming under there? I always thought Hester\u0027s bony hand was going to grab my ankle and pull me under. Then it did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn\u0027s eyebrows shot up, and when he didn\u0027t continue, she sat on one of the rocks. \"I\u0027m listening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fox was messing with me. I was a better swimmer, but he was sneaky. Gage couldn\u0027t swim for crap, but he was game. I thought it was Fox again, dunking me, but it was her. I saw her when I went under. Her hair wasn\u0027t short the way you saw her. I remember how her hair streamed out. She didn\u0027t look like a ghost. She looked like a woman. Girl,\" he corrected. \"I realized when I got older she was just a girl. I couldn\u0027t get out fast enough, and I made Fox and Gage get out. They hadn\u0027t seen anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they believed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what friends do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ever go back in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twice. But I never saw her again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn gave Lump, who wasn\u0027t as particular as his master, a handful of trail mix. \"It\u0027s too damn cold to try now, but come June, I\u0027d like to take a dip and see what happens.\" She munched some mix as she looked around. \"It\u0027s a nice spot, considering. Primitive, but still picturesque. Seems like a great place for three boys to run a little wild.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked her head. \"So do you usually bring your women here on dates?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be the first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Is that because they haven\u0027t been interested, or you haven\u0027t wanted to answer questions pertaining.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027m breaking molds here, which is one of my favorite hobbies.\" Quinn stared out over the water. \"She must\u0027ve been so sad, so horribly sad to believe there was no other way for her. Crazy\u0027s a factor, too, but I think she must\u0027ve been weighed down by sadness and despair before she weighed herself down with rocks. That\u0027s what I felt in the dream, and it\u0027s what I feel now, sitting here. Her horrible, heavy sadness. Even more than the fear when it raped her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered, rose. \"Can we move on? It\u0027s too much, sitting here. It\u0027s too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be worse, he thought. If she felt already, sensed or understood this already, it would be worse. He took her hand to lead her back to the path. Since, at least for the moment, it was wide enough to walk abreast, he kept ahold of her hand. It almost seemed as if they were taking a simple walk in the winter woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me something surprising about you. Something I\u0027d never guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head. \"Why would I tell you something about me you\u0027d never guess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t have to be some dark secret.\" She bumped her hip against his. \"Just something unexpected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lettered in track and field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn shook her head. \"Impressive, but not surprising. I might\u0027ve guessed that. You\u0027ve got a yard or so of leg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, all right.\" He thought it over. \"I grew a pumpkin that broke the county record for weight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fattest pumpkin in the history of the county?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It missed the state record by ounces. It got written up in the paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that is surprising. I was hoping for something a bit more salacious, but am forced to admit, I\u0027d never have guessed you held the county record for fattest pumpkin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve never grown a pumpkin of any size or weight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surprise me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can walk on my hands. I\u0027d demonstrate, but the ground\u0027s not conducive to hand-walking. Come on. You wouldn\u0027t have guessed that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right. I will, however, insist on a demo later. I, after all, have documentation of the pumpkin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept up the chatter, light and silly enough to make him laugh. He wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d laughed along this path since that fateful hike with his friends. But it seemed natural enough now, with the sun beaming down through the trees, the birds singing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil he heard the growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d heard it, too. He couldn\u0027t think of another reason her voice would have stopped so short, or her hand would have gripped his arm like a vise. \"Cal-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I hear it. We\u0027re nearly there. Sometimes it makes noise, sometimes it makes an appearance.\" Never this time of year, he thought, as he hitched up the back of his jacket. But these, apparently, were different times. \"Just stay close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, I...\" Her voice trailed off this time as he drew the large, jagged-edged hunting knife. \"Okay. Okay. Now that would have been one of those unexpected things about you. That you, ah, carry a Crocodile Dundee around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t come here unarmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moistened her lips. \"And you probably know how to use it, if necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shot her a look. \"I probably do. Do you want to keep going, or do you want to turn around and go back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not turning tail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear it rustling in the brush, could hear the slide of mud underfoot. Stalking them, he thought. He imagined the knife was as useless as a few harsh words if the thing meant business, but he felt better with it in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lump doesn\u0027t hear it,\" Quinn murmured, lifting her chin to where the dog slopped along the path a few feet ahead. \"Even he can\u0027t be that lazy. If he heard it, scented it, he\u0027d show some concern. So it\u0027s not real.\" She took a slow breath. \"It\u0027s just show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not real to him, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the thing howled, Cal took her firmly by the arm and pulled her through the edge of the trees into the clearing where the Pagan Stone speared up out of the muddy earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess, all things considered, I was half expecting something along the lines of the king stone from Stonehenge.\" Quinn stepped away from Cal to circle the stone. \"It\u0027s amazing enough though, when you take a good look, the way it forms a table, or altar. How flat and smooth the top is.\" She laid her hand on it. \"It\u0027s warm,\" she added. \"Warmer than stone should be in a February wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his hand beside hers. \"Sometimes it\u0027s cold.\" He fit the knife back into its sheath. \"Nothing to worry about when it\u0027s warm. So far.\" He shoved his sleeve back, examined the scar on his wrist. \"So far,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout thinking, he laid his hand over hers. \"As long as-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s heating up! Feel that? Do you feel that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifted, started to place her other hand on the stone. He moved, felt himself move as he might have through that wall of fire. Madly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped her shoulders, spinning her around until her back was pressed to the stone. Then sated the sudden, desperate appetite by taking her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant, he was someone else, as was she, and the moment was full of grieving desperation. Her taste, her skin, the beat of her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was himself, feeling Quinn\u0027s lips heat under his as the stone had heated under their hands. It was her body quivering against his, and her fingers digging into his hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted more, wanted to shove her onto the table of rock, to cover her with his body, to surround himself with all she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot him, he thought dimly, or not entirely him. And so he made himself pull back, forced himself to break that connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air wavered a moment. \"Sorry,\" he managed. \"Not altogether sorry, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surprised.\" Her voice was hoarse. \"Me, too. That was definitely unexpected. Made me dizzy,\" she whispered. \"That\u0027s not a complaint. It wasn\u0027t us, then it was.\" She took another steadying breath. \"Call me a slut, but I liked it both ways.\" With her eyes on his, she placed her hand on the stone again. \"Want to try it again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m still a man, so damn right I do. But I don\u0027t think it\u0027d be smart, or particularly safe. Plus, I don\u0027t care for someone-something-else yanking on my hormones. Next time I kiss you, it\u0027s just you and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Connections.\" She nodded. \"I\u0027m more in favor than ever about the theory regarding connections. Could be blood, could be a reincarnation thing. It\u0027s worth exploring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sidestepped away from the stone, and him. \"So, no more contact with each other and that thing for the time being. And let\u0027s take it back to the purpose at hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stirred me up, I\u0027ll admit. But no harm, no foul.\" She took out her water bottle, and this time drank deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted you. Both ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowering the bottle, she met those calm gray eyes. She\u0027d just gulped down water, she thought, but now her throat was dry again. \"I know. What I don\u0027t know is if that\u0027s going to be a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to be a problem. I\u0027m not going to care about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer pulse gave a couple of quick jumps. \"Ah...This probably isn\u0027t the place to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not.\" He took a step forward, but didn\u0027t touch her. And still her skin went hot. \"There\u0027s going to be another place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" She cleared her throat. \"All right. To work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did another circle while he watched her. He\u0027d made her a little jumpy. He didn\u0027t mind that. In fact, he considered it a point for his side. Something might have pushed him to kiss her that way, but he knew what he\u0027d felt as that something released its grip. He knew what he\u0027d been feeling since she\u0027d stepped out of her car at the top of his lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlain and simple lust. Caleb Hawkins for Quinn Black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You camped here, the three of you, that night.\" Apparently taking Cal at his word about the safety of the area, Quinn moved easily around the clearing. \"You-if I have any understanding of young boys-ate junk food, ragged on each other, maybe told ghost stories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some. We also drank the beer Gage stole from his father, and looked at the skin mags he\u0027d swiped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, though I\u0027d have pegged those activities for more like twelve-year-olds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Precocious.\" He ordered himself to stop thinking about her, to take himself back. \"We built a fire. We had the boom box on. It was a pretty night, still hot, but not oppressive. And it was our night. It was, we thought, our place. Sacred ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So your great-grandmother said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It called for ritual.\" He waited for her to turn to him. \"We wrote down words. Words we made. We swore an oath, and at midnight, I used my Boy Scout knife to cut our wrists. We said the words we\u0027d made and pressed our wrists together to mix the blood. To make us blood brothers. And hell opened up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, not exactly. None of us do, not that we can remember. There was a kind of explosion. It seemed like one. The light was blinding, and the force of it knocked me back. Lifted me right off my feet. Screams, but I\u0027ve never known if they were mine, Fox\u0027s, Gage\u0027s, or something else. The fire shot straight up, there seemed to be fire everywhere, but we weren\u0027t burned. Something pushed out, pushed into me. Pain, I remember pain. Then I saw some kind of dark mass rising out, and felt the cold it brought with it. Then it was over, and we were alone, scared, and the ground was scorched black.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen years old, she thought. Just a little boy. \"How did you get out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We hiked out the next morning pretty much as we\u0027d hiked in. Except for a few changes. I came into this clearing when I was nine. I was wearing glasses. I was nearsighted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brows rose. \"Was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-one hundred in my left eye, twenty-ninety in my right. I walked out ten, and twenty-twenty. None of us had a mark on him when we left, though Gage especially had some wounds he brought in with him. Not one of us has been sick a day since that night. If we\u0027re injured, it heals on its own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no doubt on her face, only interest with a touch, he thought, of fascination. It struck him that other than his family she was the only one who knew. Who believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were given some sort of immunity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could call it that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you feel pain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn right. I came out with perfect vision, not X-ray. And the healing can hurt like a mother, but it\u0027s pretty quick. I can see things that happened before, like out on the trail. Not all the time, not every time, but I can see events of the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A reverse clairvoyance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When it\u0027s on. I\u0027ve seen what happened here on July seventh, sixteen fifty-two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened here, Cal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The demon was bound under the stone. And Fox, Gage, and I, we cut the bastard loose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved to him. She wanted to touch him, to soothe that worry from his face, but was afraid to. \"If you did, you weren\u0027t to blame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blame and responsibility aren\u0027t much different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hell with it. She laid her hands on his cheeks even when he flinched. Then touched her lips gently to his. \"That was normal. You\u0027re responsible because, to my mind, you\u0027re willing to take responsibility. You\u0027ve stayed when a lot of other men would\u0027ve walked, if not run, away from here. So I say there\u0027s a way to beat it back where it belongs. And I\u0027m going to do whatever I can to help you do just that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her pack. \"I\u0027m going to take photos, some measurements, some notes, and ask a lot of annoying questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d shaken him. The touch, the words, the faith. He wanted to draw her in, hold on to her. Just hold on. Normal, she\u0027d said, and looking at her now, he craved the bliss of normality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the place, he reminded himself, and stepped back. \"You\u0027ve got an hour. We start back in an hour. We\u0027re going to be well out of the woods before twilight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No argument.\" This time, she thought, and went to work. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-brothers-sign-of-seven-1/page-9.html","bookId":2248,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:44 PM"}
