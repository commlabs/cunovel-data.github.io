Gerald trembled as he saw him. There are few, whatever their courage, who would not do so. He did not dare to set out on the way to the village.

He looked terrible, with the blood-stains about his jaws, but Paul King\u0027s equanimity was not shaken. One thing, however, he failed to consider, and that was the effect of blood upon the savage brute. Great as was his ascendency over Nero, the savage instinct of the great animal destroyed the effect of years of discipline.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul King understood this when Nero advanced upon him, unheeding his tone of command.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Down, Nero!\" he cried; but Nero would not down.

As a boy, of course, he was not a practised marksman; but luck—or perhaps it would be better to say Providence—was on his side, and the bullet entered Nero\u0027s eye and penetrated to his brain.

Five miles away was a mining station, and some seventy-five miners were in attendance. Gerald was glad to go, partly because it filled up his evening agreeably, and partly from the taste for such performances which he had in common with most boys of his age.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was a small show, but Goldwin had never had a visit from Barnum or Forepaugh, and vociferously applauded the clown, the bareback riders, the trapeze performers, and other acts familiar to the regular circus goer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In cages, in full view of the audience, were a few animals, including a Bengal tiger and a lioness. Paul King, Gerald\u0027s acquaintance of the afternoon, described these in succession. When he came to the lioness, he said: \"I am sorry not to be able to show you the lion Nero, one of the finest specimens ever imported from Africa. He has been connected with our show for five years, but this morning he escaped and started out on a jaunt across country. He nearly killed a boy, who slipped off his horse and left the lion to chase the unfortunate animal. He overtook and tore the horse to pieces, and then started on his return.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I had gone out in search of him, having confidence in my power over him. But I was mistaken. The blood which he had tasted roused his savage nature, and I was compelled to use my gun.

The whole audience, and especially the miners, cheered him loudly.
