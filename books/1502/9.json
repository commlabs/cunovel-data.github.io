Night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanterns had been lit, just now. One hundred and nighty-six exquisite cinnabar lanterns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Boss Tang of the “As You Wish Gambling Hall” paid close attention to pomp and ceremony, and believed that people liked brightly lit places. If people were going to spend money, they would likely spend a bit more in a well-lit location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interior designer who decorated the gambling hall had recommended ninety lanterns, but Big Boss Tang had insisted on one hundred ninety-six.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs You Wish Gambling Hall brought in more income than any other seven or eight gambling halls combined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Boss Tang rarely made mistakes, and as of now, didn’t actually need to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing he needed to do was sit at home and count the silver flowing in. If silver didn’t flow in, gold flowed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light of one hundred ninety-six lamps was sufficient. Underneath that amount of light, even the wrinkles on a carefully made up thirty-five year old woman could be seen clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it seemed as if Xiao Jun saw nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople filled the gambling hall, people both good looking and bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll sorts of things happened in the gambling hall, things both good and bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Xiao Jun saw none of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course all sorts of people came here to gamble, even if it were at the risk of losing a wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one knew what Xiao Jun was doing there, and no one dared to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis facial expression was just too fearsome, and underneath the bright light, it grew even more terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked almost transparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as the lanterns lit up, Frogboy arrived with Wu Tao and Ingot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, many of the people in the gambling hall knew him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was no prince who abstained from drinking, feasting, women and gambling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a close friend of Big Boss Tang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone in Jinan who ran this kind of business needed to be a friend of the Flowered Flag Sect, otherwise as soon as one hundred and ninety-six lanterns were lit in the grand hall, they would be smashed to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so Frogboy made quite a grand entrance. Even people who didn’t really know him wanted to call out a greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne needed to have quite a bit of face to call out a greeting to Frogboy, and even more to be able to call him “Frogbro.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed quite a few people had the face to greet him. Not a few called out, “Frogbro, what are you going to play today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not playing today,” he replied with a shake of his head. “I brought two friends here today, they’re going to play. They’re my guests.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly people with a lot of face could earn the right to be called Frogboy’s friend, and even though Wu Tao and Ingot didn’t seem that type, people had no choice but to look at them in a favorable light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun didn’t notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t notice them and they didn’t seem to notice him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to only be able to see the things in that other world in which he resided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://tinyurl.com/ouyblnw\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003epai gow\u003c/a\u003e tiles in front of him.

Heaven Position would go first, the dealer third.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third place dealer unexpectedly played a club of panthers. [2] If the young beggar hadn’t interfered and messed things up, the dealer could have won about two thousand silver from the Heaven position with this play, since that position’s pieces were crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngot had lost, and was completely cleared out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, he was the only person who hadn’t place a new bet on the table. Everyone waited, even the dealer, looking like they weren’t sure whether they wanted to laugh or cry. What would he bet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing he had left to bet, was himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you put yourself down on the table?” said Frogboy. “Don’t tell me you forgot that you’re an ingot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dealer gaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that Frogbro had suggested it, what would they do if the young beggar actually laid down on the table?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never imagined that the “ingot” would suddenly shake his head and say: “No, I can’t do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because this ingot is far too valuable. I don’t think they could afford to match up against me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dealer let out a sigh, as did everyone else. But Frogboy didn’t give up. “What are you going to wager this round, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some gold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gold?” A young beggar, he clearly didn’t have a single scrap of gold. Frogboy couldn’t help but ask: “What gold?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nearby. There’s gold everywhere,” he said nonchalantly. “I just need to go grab it. I can any time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When do you plan to do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right now.” He strode toward the exit. “Just hold on, I’ll be back in a bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease wait?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid anyone believe that he could really get his hands on some gold? Did anyone believe that he would bring it back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dealer laughed loudly. “It looks like the Heaven position is now empty. Who would like to come play a few rounds?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao suddenly stood up. “Me,” he said. “I’m here, you leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoking down a laugh, the dealer said, “Why do I have to leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because,” replied Wu Tao coolly, “You can’t afford to bet what I will be betting. And you can’t afford to lose if you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dealer stared in shock. And then suddenly, he heard a voice from behind him say, “I’m here, you leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around to find himself looking at a face as pale as a corpse’s, as pale a corpse that had been sitting in an icebox for three months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho would dare to offend a person such as this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dealer left, as well as the two players in the other positions on the table.

He knew exactly how incredible this round of gambling would be. Incredible to the point of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing he didn’t know, was whose death it would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant, it suddenly seemed as if all one hundred ninety-six lanterns shone onto two faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faces really did look like the faces of corpses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao sat in the Heaven position, Xiao Jun took the dealer’s spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re here, as am I,” said Xiao Jun. “You want to gamble, I’ll join you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I worthy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re worthy,” said Wu Tao. “What I wish to gamble, only you can afford.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want to wager? Lives?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wager lives? How many lives do you have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just one,” said Xiao Jun. “One is enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it’s not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? Perhaps before you had more than one life, but at the moment, you only have one left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s precisely that way: I have only one life. It’s not enough,” said Wu Tao. “Therefore, we can’t gamble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because if you lose even once, you have no chance to recover your losses. That’s neither fun nor satisfying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then how do you want to gamble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I always wager people, not lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wager people?” Xiao Jun didn’t understand. “What’s the difference between wagering people and wagering lives?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re completely different. We both have only one life to wager, but as for people, well, there are many people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The person you wish to wager isn’t yourself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then who is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao stretched out his hand and pointed a finger toward a man wearing grey clothing, with black hair and a pale face. “This time, I want to wager him. Whoever wins, gets him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in grey originally had a pale face, but now it had grown green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he stood there, unmoving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrogboy suddenly laughed. “This is some incredible gambling. Incredible through and through. You use people who have nothing to do with you as the stakes. That way, if the gambler loses, nothing happens to he himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not necessarily.” Wu Tao coldly asked him: “If you lost, are you sure you could catch that person and hand him over to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” admitted Frogboy, “I’m not sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what happens if you lose?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrogboy didn’t respond, so Wu Tao asked Xiao Jun: “How about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun said nothing. He tossed the dice. One came up a four, the other, too low to mention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not easy to roll so low, and yet Xiao Jun did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrogboy leaped up and shouted to the man in grey: “Flee! Flee! He lost you him, you need to flee!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in grey didn’t flee. In fact, not only did he not flee, he walked forward to stand in front of Wu Tao. His pale, greenish face had a smile on it, a somewhat horrifying smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I’ve been lost and given to you?” he asked Wu Tao earnestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well here I am, you can collect me up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had inexplicably and mysteriously been selected to be the stakes in a wager, and yet did not seem to find this strange. Furthermore, he handed himself over with not the slightest bit of discontent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrogboy stared in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never seen something so incredible in his entire life. Nobody had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven more incredible, from within the crowd suddenly appeared twelve additional men, each one wearing almost exactly the same grey clothes. They walked forward to stand in front of Wu Tao, and in the same strange, empty voice, said, “Why don’t you collect me up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won one person. Why would I collect you all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are one person,” the thirteen of them responded in unison. “But there is something different about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Other people have only one life. You yourself only have one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And all of you?” asked Wu Tao. “How many lives do you have? Thirteen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have nine hundred and ninety-nine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nine and ninety-nine lives, all yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao sighed. Anyone with that many lives would have no fear of death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thirteen men nodded in unison, and then stretched out their arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stretched out their left arms, except… they had no left arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir left arms had all been chopped off, and in their places had been installed strangely-shaped, gleaming steel pincers. They looked peculiar, ugly, dextrous and deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp to now, no one had seen them stretch out their arms, nor had anyone seen the steel pincers. For them to suddenly do this only increased the unspeakable bizarre sense of horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed that they all used the same stance to extend their arms, a simple stance, but a stance in which the position of each person’s body was very strange. They all complemented each other: the thirteen steel pincers almost seemed as if they were being controlled by some sort of machine. And the thirteen men seemed as if they were some sort of exquisite robot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the flickering light, the thirteen steel pincers shot towards Wu Tao’s ankles, knees, wrists, elbows, shoulders, head, neck and larynx.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a split second, every joint and vital point on his body became vulnerable to them, and all routes of escape sealed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere he made of wood, it would mean he was about to be snapped into pieces. Were he made of rock, it would mean he was about to be crushed to bits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven were he made of iron, he would still be unable to evade the grasp of the steel pincers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone would believe him unable to escape death. But who could know for sure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that exact moment, all one hundred ninety-six lanterns in the great hall all went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brilliant lantern light in the hall suddenly became sheets of pitch black. It was so black that even the gleaming of the steel pincers could not be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people like darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin darkness, some people are capable of doing certain things which they normally would never think of doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people can only think in darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout history, many deep philosophies and secret plans were given birth to within darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut darkness can be frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople will always have an inexplicable fear of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the darkness of As You Wish Gambling hall, people began screaming and rushing around in panic. But then they stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause suddenly, thirty-six of the one hundred nighty-six lanterns lit up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the lantern light spread, the crowd found that the thirteen men in grey were nowhere to be seen. Neither was Wu Tao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thirty-six lanterns lit, and the floor manager of the gambling hall shouted, “Big Boss Tang has prepared a hundred jugs of fine alcohol and a hundred tables of food for everyone. Everyone here tonight is an honored guest of Big Boss Tang. It’s all on the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll one hundred and ninety-six lanterns now shone. Everyone in the crowd watched as staff members entered carrying food and alcohol.
