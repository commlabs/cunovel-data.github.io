AN UNPLEASANT ACQUAINTANCE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;ROBERT felt curious to learn what was in the letter, but faithfully carried out the wishes of Miss Stafford, and did not open it till he was more than a mile away. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On opening it, to his surprise he found inclosed two $10 bills, with the following words written in pencil:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My Young Friend Robert: I desire you to accept the inclosed and hope you will find it of use. You needn\u0027t hesitate, for it comes from a crusty old maid who has more than her share of this world\u0027s goods, and likes to do a little good as she goes along in life, instead of saving up thousands for heirs who might squander it. Accept my good wishes and thanks beside for the service you have done me in taming a perverse brute, and when you are again in this vicinity be sure to call on your friend,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Louisa Stafford.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 235\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The old lady\u0027s a trump!\" exclaimed Robert warmly. \"There isn\u0027t one in a thousand that would be so generous. This is a regular windfall to me as I am situated now. Now I shan\u0027t be obliged to send to Dr. Grey for part of my savings.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert continued on his way with a light heart, for it is wonderfully cheering to think that one has money enough to pay for rest and food at the close of the day. Our young hero decided that he would not walk all the way to the East, but would on the day following take the cars at any convenient station.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pursuing his journey, he came to a portion of the road which ran through the primeval forests, he felt it to be rather a relief, for the morning was well advanced, and the sun began to make him uncomfortably warm. He soon had occasion to learn that to be warm is not the most undesirable thing that can happen to a traveller.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Half a mile from the entrance of the wood he saw sitting on the fallen trunk of a tree a rough-looking fellow, whose face looked even more repulsive than usual from a short black beard which appeared to be of a week\u0027s growth. He looked236 like what he was—a tramp, who was so from choice, even more than from necessity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What an ill-looking fellow!\" thought Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man looked up, and scanned the boy curiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hallo, young chap!\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hallo!\" returned Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you got any tobacco about you?\" inquired the tramp.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I never use it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then have you a cigar? That will do just as well.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; I don\u0027t smoke at all.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, you are an innocent baby!\" said the man, with a sneer of disappointment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert did not think it necessary to reply, but was moving on, being anxious to get away from so undesirable a companion as soon as possible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stop a minute, boy—don\u0027t be in such a hurry,\" said the man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you have anything to say to me I will listen,\" said Robert, coldly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will, will you? You\u0027re mighty accommodatin\u0027! Where are you goin\u0027?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Straight ahead!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert and the Tramp.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 237\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Any fool would know that. That isn\u0027t an answer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why do you wish to know?\" retorted Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s my business!\" said the tramp, his repulsive features assuming an ugly expression. \"You\u0027d better answer my question.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert thought on the whole it would be prudent to avoid trouble by keeping on as good terms as possible with the man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t tell you,\" he said, \"for I don\u0027t know myself. I expect to keep on till I get to New York.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s where I\u0027m goin\u0027! Suppose we keep company,\" said the man with a grin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We can keep company for the present, if you wish,\" answered Robert, trying to repress his disgust.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Look here, young fellow! Have you got any money?\" asked the tramp with a sidelong glance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert was not surprised at this inquiry, for he had expected it, but in spite of his courage it alarmed him, for he could see that he was no match in physical strength for this ill-looking man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 238\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A little!\" he answered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How much?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s my business,\" answered Robert, provoked. \"I don\u0027t ask how much money you\u0027ve got.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I haven\u0027t a cent,\" said the tramp, \"but,\" he added, significantly, \"I\u0027m going to have some soon.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The look which accompanied this declaration made it evident what he meant, and Robert looked about to see what chance he had of escape if the worst came to the worst. As to surrendering the $20 for which he had been indebted to the generosity of Miss Stratton, he had no intention of doing it, unless it should be absolutely necessary.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have nothing to do with your affairs,\" said Robert. \"If you\u0027ll let me know which way you are going, I\u0027ll go the other way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will you so? No, boy, you don\u0027t get rid of me so easily. We\u0027re goin\u0027 the same way. If you want to leave you can, but you must hand over your money first.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you a thief, then?\" demanded Robert, quickly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 239\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; and you\u0027d better not call me so. I\u0027m only goin\u0027 to borrer your money; I\u0027ll give you my note for it,\" returned the tramp with a cunning grin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I decline to lend,\" said Robert stoutly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Look here, my young chicken!\" said the man in a menacing tone. Ain\u0027t you crowin\u0027 rather too loud for a bantem? Do you know who I am?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, but I can guess.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Guess, then?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027re a man whose company I do not like.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The tramp laughed. Instead of offending, the reply appeared to amuse him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s true enough, I reckon. Well, I\u0027m a man that don\u0027t stand no nonsense. I want your money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He advanced towards Robert in a menacing manner, and our hero, who had been looking about him, jumped aside nimbly, and seizing the branch of a tree swung himself up into the branches, before his companion clearly understood his intention.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, that\u0027s your game, is it?\" he said, angrily. \"It won\u0027t do!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 240\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He darted forward, but Robert bad been too quick for him, and was already out of reach. He was light and agile by nature, and his training in the ring had helped to make him more so.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So you think you\u0027ve escaped me, do you?\" he demanded with an oath.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert did not answer, but looked calmly down upon him from the tree.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come down at once!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you; I\u0027d rather stay here,\" said our hero calmly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Without a word the tramp made an effort to follow Robert up the tree.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83319.html","bookId":277,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:33:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:33:11 AM"}
