Bright arc-lights lit up the shining bodywork of several other cars. There was a big negro at the wheel of the sedan and another stood near him, leaning against the rear door. No one else was in view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt sight of Bond the negroes\u0027 mouths fell open in astonishment. A cigarette dropped from the mouth of the man at the wheel. Then they both dived for their guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinctively, Bond shot first at the man standing, knowing he would be quickest on the draw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy gun roared hollowly in the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe negro clutched his stomach with both hands, staggered two steps towards Bond, and collapsed on his face, his gun clattering on to the concrete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man at the wheel screamed as Bond\u0027s gun swung on to him. Hampered by the wheel the negro\u0027s shooting hand was still inside his coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond shot straight into the screaming mouth and the man\u0027s head crashed against the side window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond ran round the car and opened the door. The negro sprawled horribly out. Bond threw his revolver on to the driving-seat and yanked the body out on to the ground. He tried to avoid the blood. He got into the seat and blessed the running engine and the steering-wheel gear-lever. He slammed the door, rested his injured hand on the left of the wheel and crashed the lever forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand-brake was still on. He had to lean under the wheel to release it with his right hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a dangerous pause. As the heavy car surged forward out of the wide doors there was the boom of a gun and a bullet hammered into the bodywork. He tore the wheel round right-handed and there was another shot that missed high. Across the street a window splintered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flash came from low down near the floor and Bond guessed that the first negro had somehow managed to reach his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no other shots and no sound came from the blank faces of the buildings behind him. As he went through the gears he could see nothing in the driving-mirror except the broad bar of light from the garage shining out across the dark empty street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond had no idea where he was or where he was heading. It was a wide featureless street and he kept going. He found himself driving on the left-hand side and quickly swerved over to the right. His hand hurt terribly but the thumb and forefinger helped to steady the wheel. He tried to remember to keep his left side away from the blood on the door and window. The endless street was populated only by the little ghosts of steam that wavered up out of the gratings in the asphalt that gave access to the piped heat system of the city. The ugly bonnet of the car mowed them down one by one, but in the driving-mirror Bond could see them rising again behind him in a diminishing vista of mildly gesticulating white wraiths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept the big car at fifty. He came to some red traffic lights and jumped them. Several more dark blocks and then there was a lighted avenue. There was traffic and he paused until the lights went green. He turned left and was rewarded by a succession of green lights, each one sweeping him on and further away from the enemy. He checked at an intersection and read the signs. He was on Park Avenue and 116th Street. He slowed again at the next street. It was 115th. He was heading downtown, away from Harlem , back into the City. He kept going. He turned off at Goth Street. It was deserted. He switched off the engine and left the car opposite a fire hydrant. He took the gun off the seat, shoved it down the waistband of his trousers and walked back to Park Avenue. A few minutes later he flagged a prowling cab and then suddenly he was walking up the steps of the St. Regis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Message for you, Mr. Bond,\u0027 said the night porter. Bond kept his left side away from him. He opened the message with his right hand. It was from Felix Leiter, timed at four a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Call me at once,\u0027 it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond walked to the elevator and was carried up to his floor. He let himself into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21:00\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand went through into the sitting-room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo both of them were alive. Bond fell into a chair beside the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027God Almighty,\u0027 said Bond with deep gratitude. \u0027What a break.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER IX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTRUE OR FALSE?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOND looked at the telephone, then he got up and walked over to the sideboard. He put a handful of wilted icecubes into a tall glass, poured in three inches of Haig and Haig and swilled the mixture round in the glass to cool and dilute it. Then he drank down half the glass in one long swallow. He put the glass down and eased himself out of his coat. His left hand was so swollen that he could only just get it through the sleeve. His little finger was still crooked back and the pain was vicious as it scraped against the cloth. The ringer was nearly black. He pulled down his tie and undid the top of his shirt. Then he picked up his glass, took another deep swallow, and walked back to the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeiter answered at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thank God,\u0027 said Leiter with real feeling. \u0027What\u0027s the damage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Broken finger,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027How about you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Blackjack. Knocked out. Nothing serious. They started off by considering all sorts of ingenious things. Wanted to couple me to the compressed-air pump in the garage. Start on the ears and then proceed elsewhere. When no instructions came from The Big Man they got bored and I got to arguing the finer points of Jazz with Blabbermouth, the man with the fancy six-shooter. We got on to Duke Ellington and agreed that we liked our band-leaders to be percussion men, not wind. We agreed the piano or the drums held the band together better than any other solo instrument — Jelly-roll Morton, for instance. Apropos the Duke, I told him the crack about the clarinet - “an ill woodwind that nobody blows good”. That made him laugh fit to bust. Suddenly we were friends. The other man - The Flannel, he was called - got sour and Blabbermouth told him he could go off duty, he\u0027d look after me. Then The Big Man rang down.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I was there,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027It didn\u0027t sound so hot.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Blabbermouth was worried as hell. He wandered round the room talking to himself. Suddenly he used the blackjack, hard, and I went out. Next thing I knew we were outside Bellevue Hospital. About half after three. Blabbermouth was very apologetic, said it was the least he could have done. I believe him. He begged me not to give him away. Said he was going to report that he\u0027d left me half dead. Of course I promised to leak back some very lurid details. We parted on the best of terms. I got some treatment at the Emergency ward and came home. I was worried to Hell an\u0027 gone about you, but after a while the telephone started ringing. Police and FBI. Seems The Big Man has complained that some fool Limey went berserk at The Boneyard early this morning, shot three of his men - two chauffeurs and a waiter, if you please - stole one of his cars and got away, leaving his overcoat and hat in the cloakroom. The Big Man\u0027s yelling for action. Of course I warned off the dicks and the FBI, but they\u0027re madder\u0027n hell and we\u0027ve got to get out of town at once. It\u0027ll miss the mornings but it\u0027ll be splashed all over the afternoon blatts and Radio and TV\u0027ll have it. Apart from all that, Mr. Big will be after you like a nest of hornets. Anyway, I\u0027ve got some plans fixed. Now you tell, and God, am I glad to hear your voice!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond gave a detailed account of all that had happened. He forgot nothing. When he had finished, Leiter gave a low whistle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Boy,\u0027 he said with admiration. \u0027You certainly made a dent in The Big Man\u0027s machine. But were you lucky. That Solitaire dame certainly seems to have saved your bacon. D\u0027you think we can use her?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Could if we could get near her,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I should think he keeps her pretty close.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ll have to think about that another day,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Now we\u0027d better get moving. I\u0027ll hang up and call you back in a few minutes. First I\u0027ll get the police surgeon round to you right away. Be along in a quarter of an hour or so. Then I\u0027ll talk to the Commissioner myself and sort out some of the police angles. They can stall a bit by discovering the car. The F B I\u0027ll have to tip off the radio and newspaper boys so that at least we can keep your name out of it and all this Limey talk. Otherwise we shall have the British Ambassador being hauled out of bed and parades by the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and God knows what all. Leiter chuckled down the telephone. \u0027Better have a word with your chief in London . It\u0027s about half after ten their time. You\u0027ll need a bit of protection. I can look after the CIA, but the FBI have got a bad attack of “see-here-young-man” this morning. You\u0027ll need some more clothes. I\u0027ll see to that. Keep awake. We\u0027ll get plenty of sleep in the grave. Be calling you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up. Bond smiled to himself. Hearing Leiter\u0027s cheerful voice and knowing everything was being taken care of had wiped away his exhaustion and his black memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the telephone and talked to the Overseas operator. \u0027Ten minutes\u0027 delay, she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond walked into his bedroom and somehow got out of his clothes. He gave himself a very hot shower and then an ice-cold one. He shaved and managed to pull on a clean shirt and trousers. He put a fresh clip in his Beretta and wrapped the Colt in his discarded shirt and put it in his suitcase. He was half way through his packing when the telephone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listened to the zing and echo on the line, the chatter of distant operators, the patches of Morse from aircraft and ships at sea, quickly suppressed. He could see the big, grey building near Regents Park and imagine the busy switchboard and the cups of tea and a girl saying, \u0027Yes, this is Universal Export,\u0027 the address Bond had asked for, one of the covers used by agents for emergency calk on open lines from abroad. She would tell the Supervisor, who would take the call over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re connected, caller,\u0027 said the Overseas operator. \u0027Go ahead, please. New York calling London .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond heard the calm English voice. \u0027Universal Export. Who\u0027s speaking, please?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Can I speak to the Managing Director,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027This is his nephew James speaking from New York .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just a moment, please.\u0027 Bond could follow the call to Miss Moneypenny and see her press the switch on the intercom. \u0027It\u0027s New York , Sir,\u0027 she would say. \u0027I think it\u0027s 007.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Put him through,\u0027 M would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes?\u0027 said the cold voice that Bond loved and obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s James, Sir,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I may need a bit of help over a difficult consignment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Go ahead,\u0027 said the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I went uptown to see our chief customer last night,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Three of his best men went sick while I was there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How sick?\u0027 asked the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027As sick as can be, Sir,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027There\u0027s a lot of \u0027flu about.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hope you didn\u0027t catch any.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve got a slight chill, Sir,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027but absolutely nothing to worry about. I\u0027ll write to you about it. The trouble is that with all this \u0027flu about Federated think I will do better out of town.\u0027 (Bond chuckled to himself at the thought of M\u0027s grin.) \u0027So I\u0027m off right away with Felicia.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who?\u0027 asked M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Felicia,\u0027 Bond spelled it out. \u0027My new secretary from Washington .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thought I\u0027d try that factory you advised at San Pedro.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good idea.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But Federated may have other ideas and I hoped you\u0027d give me your support.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I quite understand,\u0027 said M. \u0027How\u0027s business?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Rather promising, Sir. But tough going. Felicia will be typing my full report today.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good,\u0027 said M. \u0027Anything else?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, that\u0027s all, Sir. Thanks for your support.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s all right. Keep fit. Goodbye.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Goodbye, Sir.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond put down the telephone. He grinned. He could imagine M calling in the Chief of Staff, \u0027007\u0027s already tangled up with the FBI. Dam\u0027 fool went up to Harlem last night and bumped off three of Mr. Big\u0027s men. Got hurt himself, apparently, but not much. Got to get out of town with Leiter, the CIA man. Going down to St. Petersburg. Better warn A and C. Expect we\u0027ll have Washington round our ears before the day\u0027s over. Tell A to say I fully sympathize, but that 007 has my full confidence and I\u0027m sure he acted in self-defence. Won\u0027t happen again, and so forth. Got that?\u0027 Bond grinned again as he thought of Damon\u0027s exasperation at having to dish out a lot of soft soap to Washington when he probably had plenty of other Anglo-American snarls to disentangle. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/live-and-let-die-james-bond-2/page-11.html","bookId":2425,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:48 PM"}
