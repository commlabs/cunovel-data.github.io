{"id":25400,"no":1,"title":"PREFACE","content":"Some years ago, through my interest in the life and work of Charles M. Russell, I met Con Price. No one could go far into the subject of Montana’s Cowboy Artist without cutting Con Price’s trail.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These two men were more than cowpuncher friends and associates in a ranch partnership. Charlie regarded Con as one of the greatest bronco riders of his time, and Con considers Charlie the finest kind of friend a man could have had.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a long time before Con would talk much about his close friendship with Charlie Russell—a friendship that started on the range before either was married, and lasted until Charlie crossed the Big Divide in 1926. After some urging Con has, over a period of years, written something of his early days in Old Montana, with a few, too few, references to his friend Russell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My own knowledge of Russell has been immeasurably enriched through knowing Con Price, but more important is our own friendship, which I treasure even more.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1922/55241.html","bookId":885,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 4:09:42 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 4:09:42 PM"}
