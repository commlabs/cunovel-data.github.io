Do you see me? Do you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow who you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m wet,\" Hannah said slowly, feeling dazed. She touched her face. Her hair was dripping. Paul was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eholding a water glass. \"Why am I wet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to wake you up.\" Paul sagged to the floor beside the couch. \"What\u0027s your name? What year is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Hannah Snow,\" Hannah said, still feeling dazed and bodiless. \"And it\u0027s-\" Suddenly memory\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erushed out of the fog at her. She sat bolt upright, tears starting to stream from her eyes. \"What was all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Paul whispered. He leaned his head against the couch, then looked up. \"You just kept\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etalking-you were telling that story as if you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere there. It was really happening to you. And nothing I could do would break the trance. I tried\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeverything-I thought you were never going to come out of it. And then you started sobbing and I couldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emake you stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I felt as if it were happening to me,\" Hannah said. Her head ached; her whole body felt bruised with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etension. And she was reeling with memories that were perfectly real and perfectly hers... and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eimpossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was like no past life regression I\u0027ve ever read about,\" Paul said, his voice agitated. \"The detail...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou knew everything. Have you ever studied-is there any way you could have known those kinds of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Hannah was just as agitated, \"I\u0027ve never studied humans in the Stone Age-and this was real. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t something I was making up as I was going along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both talking at once. \"That guy,\" Paul was saying. \"He\u0027s the one you\u0027re afraid of, isn\u0027t he? But,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elook, you know, regression is one thing... past lives is another thing... but this is crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe in vampires,\" Hannah was saying at the same time. \"Because that\u0027s what that guy was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esupposed to be, wasn\u0027t it? Of course it was. Caveman vampire. He was probably the first one. And I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t believe in reincarnation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just plain crazy. This is crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both took a breath, looking at each other. There was a long silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah put a hand to her forehead. \"I\u0027m ... really tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Yeah, I can understand that.\" Paul looked around the room, nodded twice, then got up. \"Well,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe\u0027d better get you home. We can talk about all this later, figure out what it really means. Some kind of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esubconscious fixation... archetypical symbolism... something.\" He ran out of air and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, you feel all right, don\u0027t you? And you\u0027re not going to worry about this? Because there\u0027s nothing to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least we know we don\u0027t have to worry about vampires attacking you.\" He laughed. The laugh was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estrained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah couldn\u0027t manage even a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief silence, then Paul said, \"You know, I think I\u0027ll drive you home. That would be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be fine,\" Hannah whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out a hand to help her off the couch. \"By the way, I\u0027m really sorry I had to get you all wet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It was good you did. I was feeling so awful- and there were worse things about to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul blinked. \"I\u0027m sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah looked at him helplessly, then away. \"There were worse things about to happen. Terrible things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, really awful things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But there were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul walked her to her doorstep. And Hannah was glad of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside the house, she went straight down the hall to her mother\u0027s study. It was a cluttered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomfortable room with books piled on the floor and the tools\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof a paleontologist scattered around. Her mother was at her desk, bending over a microscope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that you, Hannah?\" she asked without looking up. \"I\u0027ve got some marvelous sections of haversian\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecanals in duckbill bones. Want to see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... not now. Maybe later,\" Hannah said. She wanted very much to tell her mother about what had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappened, but something was stopping her. Her mother was so sensible, so practical and intelligent....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027ll think I\u0027m crazy. And she\u0027ll be right. And then she\u0027ll be appalled, wondering how she could have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egiven birth to an insane daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was an exaggeration, and Hannah knew it, but somehow she still couldn\u0027t bring herself to tell. Since\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher father had died five years ago, she and her mother had been almost like friends-but that didn\u0027t mean\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe didn\u0027t want her mother\u0027s approval. She did. She desperately wanted her mother to be proud of her,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand to realize that she could handle things on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been the same with the notes-she\u0027d never told about finding them. For all her mom knew,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s only problem was bad dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how did it go tonight?\" her mother asked now, eye still to the microscope. \"That Dr. Winfield is so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyoung-I hope he\u0027s not too inexperienced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast chance. Take it or lose it. \"Uh, it went fine,\" Hannah said weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good. There\u0027s chicken in the crockpot. I\u0027ll be out in a little while; I just want to finish this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Great. Thanks.\" Hannah turned and stumbled out, completely frustrated with herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know Mom won\u0027t really be awful, she scolded\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eherself as she fished a piece of chicken out of the crockpot. So tell her. Or call Chess and tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027ll make things better. They\u0027ll tell you how impossible all this stuff about vampires and past lives is. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, and that\u0027s the problem. Hannah sat frozen, holding a fork with a bite of chicken on it motionless in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efront of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t believe in vampires or reincarnation. But I know what I saw. I know things about Hana . ., things\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat weren\u0027t even in the story I told Paul. I know she wore a tunic and leggings of roe deer hide. I know\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe ate wild cattle and wild boar and salmon and hazel nuts. I know she made tools out of elk antler and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edeer bone and flint.... God, I could pick up a flint cobble and knock off a set of blades and scrapers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eright now. I know I could. I can feel how to in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the fork down and looked at her hands. They were shaking slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I know she had a beautiful singing voice, a voice like crystal....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the crystal voice in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what do I do when they tell me it\u0027s impossible? Argue with them? Then I\u0027ll really be crazy, like those\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeople in institutions who think they\u0027re Napoleon or Cleopatra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I hope I haven\u0027t been Cleopatra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf laughing and half crying, she put her face in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what about him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond stranger with the bottomless eyes. The guy Hana didn\u0027t have a name for, but Hannah knew as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the rest of it is real, what about him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s the one I\u0027m afraid of, Hannah thought. But he didn\u0027t seem so bad. Dangerous, but not evil. So why\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo I think of him as evil?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why do I want him anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause she did want him. She remembered the feelings of Hana standing next to the stranger in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoonlight. Confusion... fear... and attraction. That magnetism between them. The extraordinary things\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat happened when he touched her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came to the Three Rivers and turned her life upside down.... The Three Rivers. Oh, God-why\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t I think of that before? The note. One of the notes said \"Remember the Three Rivers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. So I\u0027ve remembered it. So what now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no idea. Maybe she was supposed to understand everything now, and know what to do ... but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe didn\u0027t. She was more confused than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, a tiny voice like a cool dark wind in her brain said, you didn\u0027t remember all of it yet. Did you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul woke you up before you got to the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up, Hannah told the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t stop thinking. All night she was restless, moving from one room to another, avoiding her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emother\u0027s questions. And even after her mother went to bed, Hannah found herself wandering aimlessly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough the house, straightening things, picking up books and putting them down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got to sleep. That\u0027s the only thing that will help me feel better, she thought. But she couldn\u0027t make\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eherself sit, much less lie down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I need some air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a strange thought. She\u0027d never actually felt the need to go outside for the sole purpose of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreathing fresh air-in Montana you did that all day long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was something pulling at her, drawing her to go outside. It was like a compulsion and she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll just go on the back porch. Of course there\u0027s nothing to be scared of out there. And if I go outside,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen I\u0027ll prove there isn\u0027t, and then I can go to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout stopping to consider the logic of this, she opened the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a beautiful night. The moon threw a silver glow over everything and the horizon seemed very far\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway. Hannah\u0027s backyard blended into the wild bluestem and pine grass of the prairie. The wind carried\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe clean pungent smell of sage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll have spring flowers soon, Hannah thought. Asters and bluebells and little golden buttercups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything will be green for a while. Spring\u0027s a time for life, not death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was right to come out. I feel more relaxed now. I can go back inside and lie down....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at that moment that she realized she was being watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same feeling she\u0027d been having for weeks, the feeling that there were eyes in the darkness and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey were fixed on her. Chills of adrenaline ran through Hannah\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t panic, she told herself. It\u0027s just a feeling. There\u0027s probably nothing out here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a slow step backward toward the door. She didn\u0027t want to move too quickly. She had the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eirrational certainty that if she turned and ran, whatever was watching her would spring out and get her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebefore she got the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time she edged backward, her eyes and ears were straining so hard that she saw gray\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espots and she heard a thin ringing. She was trying, desperately, to catch some sign of movement, some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esound. But everything was still and the only noises were the normal distant noises of the outdoors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she saw the shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack against the lighter blackness of the night, it was moving among the bluestem grass. And it was big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTall. Not a cat or other small animal. Big as a person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was coming toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah thought she might faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t be ridiculous, a sharp voice in her head told her. Get inside. You\u0027re standing here in the light from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe windows; you\u0027re a perfect target. Get inside fast and lock the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah whirled, and knew even as she did it that she wouldn\u0027t be fast enough. It was going to jump at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher exposed back. It was going to ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" came a voice out of the darkness. \"Please. Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA male voice. Unfamiliar. But it seemed to grab Hannah and hold her still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t hurt you. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunrunrunrun! Hannah\u0027s mind told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery slowly, one hand on the door knob, she turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the dark figure coming out of the shadows to her. She didn\u0027t try to get away again. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad a dizzying feeling that fate had caught up with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground sloped, so the light from the house windows showed her his boots first, then the legs of his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejeans. Normal walking boots like any Montanan might wear. Ordinary jeans-long legs. He was tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the light showed his shirt, which was an ordinary T-shirt, a little cold to be walking around at night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein, but nothing startling. And then his shoulders, which were nice ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as he stepped to the base of the porch, she saw his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked better than when she had seen him last. His white-blond hair wasn\u0027t crazily messed up; it fell\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneatly over his forehead. He wasn\u0027t splattered with mud and his eyes weren\u0027t wild. They were dark and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso endlessly sad that it was like a knife in the heart just to see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was unmistakably the boy from her hypnosis session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" Hannah said. \"Oh, God.\" Her knees were giving out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s real. It\u0027s real. He\u0027s real and that means... it\u0027s all true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God.\" She was trembling violently and she had to put pressure on her knees to keep standing. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworld was changing around her, and it was the most disorienting thing she\u0027d ever experienced. It was as if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe fabric of her universe was actually moving-pulsing and shifting to accommodate the new truths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing was ever going to be the same again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" The stranger moved toward her and Hannah recoiled instinctively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch me!\" she gasped, and at the same moment her legs gave out. She slid to the floor of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eporch and stared at the boy whose face was now approximately level with hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" he almost whispered. \"I know what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou\u0027re going through. You\u0027re just realizing now, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah said, whispering to herself, \"It\u0027s all true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" The dark eyes were so sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s... I\u0027ve had past lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He squatted on the ground, looking down as if he couldn\u0027t keep staring at her face anymore. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epicked up a pebble, examined it. Hannah noticed that his fingers were long and sensitive-looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re an Old Soul,\" he said quietly. \"You\u0027ve had lots of lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was Hana of the Three Rivers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers stopped rolling the pebble. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re Thierry. And you\u0027re a ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t look up. \"Go on. Say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah couldn\u0027t. Her voice wouldn\u0027t form the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stranger-Thierry-said it for her. \"Vampires are real.\" A glance from those unfathomable eyes. \"I\u0027m\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah breathed and looked down at him. But the world had finished its reshaping. Her mind was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeginning to work again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least I know I\u0027m not crazy, she thought. That\u0027s some consolation. It\u0027s the universe that\u0027s insane, not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I have to deal with it-somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said quietly, \"Are you going to kill me now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God-no!\" He stood up fast, uncoiling. Shock was naked on his face. \"You don\u0027t understand. I would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever hurt you. I ...\" He broke off. \"It\u0027s hard to know where to begin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah sat silently, while he looked around the porch for inspiration. She could feel her heart beating in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher throat. She\u0027d told Paul that this boy had killed her, kept killing her. But his look of shock had been so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egenuine-as if she\u0027d hurt him terribly by even suggesting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose I should start by explaining exactly what I am,\" he said. \"And what I\u0027ve done. I made you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecome outside tonight. I influenced you. I didn\u0027t want to do it, but I had to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Influenced me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a mental thing. I can also just communicate this way. It was his voice, but his lips weren\u0027t moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was the same voice she\u0027d heard at the end of her hypnotic session, the voice that wasn\u0027t Paul\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one that had spoken in her head, saying, Hannah, come back. You don\u0027t have to relive this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were the one who woke me up,\" Hannah whispered. \"I wouldn\u0027t have come back except for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t stand to see you hurting like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan somebody with his eyes be evil?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was obviously a different sort of creature than she was, and every move he made showed the grace\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof a predator. It reminded her of how the wolves had moved-they had rippled. He did, too, his muscles\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoving so lightly under his skin. He was unnatural- but beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething struck her. \"The wolves. I picked up a silver picture frame to bash them with. Silver.\" She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked at him. \"Werewolves are real.\" At the last moment her voice made it a statement instead of a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So much is real that you don\u0027t know about. Or that you haven\u0027t remembered yet. You were starting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto remember with that shrink. You said I was a Lord of the Night World.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Night World. Just the mention of it sent prickles through Hannah. She could almost remember, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enot quite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she knew it was crazy to be kneeling here having this conversation. She was talking to a vampire. A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eguy who drank blood for a living. A guy whose every gesture showed he was a hunter. And not only a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire, but the person her subconscious had been warning her about for weeks. Telling her to be afraid,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe very afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why wasn\u0027t she running? For one thing, she didn\u0027t think her legs would physically support her. And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor another-well, somehow she couldn\u0027t stop looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the werewolves was mine,\" he was saying quietly. \"She was here to find you-and protect you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the other one... Hannah, you have to understand. I\u0027m not the only one looking for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo protect me. So I was right, Hannah thought. The gray female was on my side. She said, \"Who else is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another Night Person.\" He looked away. \"Another vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I a Night Person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You\u0027re a human.\" He said it the way he said everything, as if reminding her of terrible facts he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewished he didn\u0027t have to bring up. \"Old Souls are just humans who keep coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many times have I come back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... I\u0027d have to think about it. Quite a few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And have you been with me in all of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any of them I could manage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do the rest of the notes mean?\" Hannah had been gathering speed, and now she was shooting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equestions at him in machine-gun fashion. She thought she was in control, and she hardly noticed the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehysterical edge to her own voice. \"Why am I telling myself I\u0027ll be dead before I\u0027m seventeen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah...\" He reached out a hand to calm her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s own hand moved by reflex, coming up to ward his off. And then their fingers touched, bare\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eskin to bare skin, and the world disappeared. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-6.html","bookId":2080,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM"}
