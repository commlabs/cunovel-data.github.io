He heaved a huge sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis way, he had completely dealt with the troublesome parts of his body. The price he had to pay for this was that he could only use the strength of a rank 1 Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter stabilising his injuries, Leylin was now in the mood to survey his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was rather dim, with some moss that gave off some faint light, which allowed him to see just a few metres away. Everything else was just pitch black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This must be somewhere within a cave! I wonder what direction leads to the outside…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin gave a long sigh and took another look at the teleportation spell formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spell formation here was the same as that in the Ancient Spirit Slayer Sect’s secret plane. However, a rune at one of the corners had already been destroyed by Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin believed that if he was the rank 3 Magus on the other end if he was not going to personally keep watch, he would destroy the spell formation at the other area. Hence, this teleportation spell formation would not be able to be used for a long period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one end, the set up by the Magi of the Spirit Slayer Sect was very simple. There was only the spell formation in the cave, and other than that, there was a very long and narrow passage that seemed to be carved out from the stone walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Night Vision!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin used a support-type acolyte level spell on himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black glint flashed in his eyes, and darkness no longer hindered his sight and he took his surroundings in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The dark elemental particles here are very dense. It seems to be more than in the south coast!” While using this spell Leylin could tell the large difference between the two continents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it was said that the concentration of dark elemental particles in the air in the south coast was 1, it would be at least 1.5 or even up to 2 here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A.I. Chip! Test the concentration of elemental particles in the air and make a comparison with that in the south coast!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Mission established. Beginning collection of data. Generating comparative diagrams.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly enough, the A.I. Chip transmitted two different pie charts to Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the pie chart, the ratio of colours that represented different elemental particles had various percentages. These were all presented in front of Leylin clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the right is the average data found on the south coast, while the one on the left is the newest data!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin compared the differences between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newest set of data revealed that the concentration of dark, shadow and death, as well as other negative energy particles, rose to about two times that of in the south coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe positive energy particles such as that of light, plant and life were a little lower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Also, the concentration of earth elemental particles is quite high, while fire and water are quite meagre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin touched his chin, looking thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In other words, there is approximately the same concentration of elemental particles here as in the south coast, though the composition is a little different. The concentration of negative elemental particles is almost equal to that of a small scale secret plane, while the positive elemental particles are only like that of the Chernobyl Islands…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin made a few conjectures and took a few large steps forwards, entering the long and narrow stone passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis passage was quite long, and only after ten or so minutes of strolling did he reach the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the passage was a large stone door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalling it a door might even be a stretch. From what Leylin could tell, it was just a large rounded rock that was blocking the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the chinks in the rock, Leylin could hear the faint sounds of wind entering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s best to keep this stone door. When I need this teleportation spell formation in the future, I can still come back!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a thought, he used a rank 1 spell. “Shadow Stealth!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack rays surrounded Leylin’s body, and within the rays, he started to become transparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe effect of Shadow Stealth was that the user would temporarily become hard to see, and would be able to hide within tiny shadows. He could pass through most physical objects, but in this mode, he would be unable to attack, else this stealth mode would disappear. Area of effect attacks using energy or sound waves were also the bane of this spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, however, this was just meant to pass through a rock, so it was a simple task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faint image that Leylin turned into easily passed through the shadows of the cracks on the rock and he reached the outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hah! This is…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked at the view outside, and was stunned for a few moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was standing on a little hill formed from large rocks, and surrounding him was a vast plain. There were also a large number of shrubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gloomy darkness encompassed the whole area, making it so that there was no light at all. The sky was dim and looked as if it would collapse at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVastness, gloominess, a deathly stillness! This was Leylin’s first impression about the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the help of his night vision, Leylin did not have any trouble looking at his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This plant looks quite strange!” Leylin picked up a dried up twig on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It has no leaves and at most, just has some thorns. On top of that, it seems like all the plants I can see share this characteristic!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin grabbed forward with his right hand, a little mole-like creature was captured from the ground. It constantly made ‘chik chik’ sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Its eyes are small and don’t seem to serve much of a purpose. It also looks like it has albinism! This is a mutation from not being able to get sunlight for a long period of time!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin mumbled to himself, clearing up his doubts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Pak!* He tossed the mole aside and pushed himself into the sky using a dull, red light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin kept ascending, and he could feel pressure on his head. Finally, after who knows how long, Leylin reached the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a large rock rampart. It had a metallic sheen to it, which made it look like the canopy of heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So the top of this place is the Earth’s crust!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin descended slowly, his expression still revealing his shock, “This is a subterranean world!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a plain made entirely out of rocks and moss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo grey boar-like animals that were a lot smaller used their thick and coarse snouts to dig into the earth, searching for edible food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Xiu Xiu!* Two black arrows were suddenly released, and the sharp arrowheads penetrated the back of these two little beasts, pinning them to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a bad harvest today. There are two grey boars! I can change the menu!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a hill, not far away, Leylin saw this scene, and joy was present in his smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust ten or so minutes later, he used a wooden frame and made a fire. On top, the grey boars that had been skinned and washed were being roasted, a little grease rolling off the boiling hot skin. There was also an aroma that could make anyone drool mixed with the scent of pine wood, and Leylin’s forefinger couldn’t help but twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s been around a month since I exited from the large rock hill where the teleportation spell formation is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter gnawing away at an entire grey boar, Leylin sighed contently and kept the other one for later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a month of wandering around, he now had an idea of how barren this subterranean world was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, it was possible to not see any life despite walking for days, and only moss and bugs were tenaciously surviving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pig-like creature that Leylin named “grey boar” was the biggest animal he had seen thus far. It was also the tastiest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this thought, Leylin couldn’t help but feel a little regretful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the precious spatial leather pouch was extremely spacious, there was a limit to how much could be stored within. It was already full of precious items that Leylin had gained through various methods, the value of which was something even rank 3 Magus would be envious of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, there was no good food or wine at all. Compared to precious materials, their value was much too low and it was not worth being stored within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHence, Leylin found himself living the life of a barbarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater was not an issue. He was a Magus, and with a water elemental spell, he could easily produce large amounts of fresh water. If it was food, however, he had little in the way of options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he was a rank 2 Warlock, it was fine if he didn’t eat for ten days or half a month, but if it was a full month, it wasn’t possible for him not to eat at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, his living environment in his previous life, and even now, were all not unsatisfactory. He was used to having three meals a day, and even had some stringent requirements regarding the content of his meals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, after a long search, Leylin could somewhat find a few starchy plants and roots that he could consume. He might also be able to have some birds or berries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin was beginning to get tired of these meagre meals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis boar-like creature that he had named “grey boar” was, by far, the tastiest out of everything else that he had seen here up until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it! I hope this isn’t a completely barren land.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter walking for a full month, besides this desert-area, Leylin had also seen some plains. Leylin began to have some suspicions, as even large animals were rarely seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly speaking, as he was accustomed to sunlight, Leylin had never realised how precious it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-288\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-290\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-289","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
