She was tired. Even though she\u0027d expected a long night, the past few months had taken a toll, especially the last few weeks, and the ordeal seemed far from over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone switched on the lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been told about what had happened the previous fall-when Malone\u0027s ex-wife had appeared...and the firebombing-but the restorers had done a terrific job. She noted the workmanship. New, yet made to appear old. \"My compliments to the craftsmen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen nodded. \"I wanted it to look like it once did. Too much history in this building to be blown away by fanatics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to get out of those damp clothes?\" Malone asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t we send Henrik home first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone grinned. \"I hear he likes to watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds intriguing,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"But tonight I\u0027m not in the mood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither was she. \"I\u0027m fine. Leather dries quickly. One reason I wear it when I\u0027m working.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what were you working on tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure you want to hear this? Like you say all the time, you\u0027re a bookseller, not an operative. Retired, and all those other excuses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sent me an e-mail telling me to meet you at that museum in the morning. With what you said back at the fire, there wouldn\u0027t have been any museum there tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat in one of the club chairs. \"Which is why we were going to meet there. Tell him, Henrik.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe liked Malone. He was a smart, confident, handsome man-she\u0027d thought that when they first met last year in France. A uniquely trained lawyer. Twelve years he worked for the U.S. Justice Department in a covert unit known as the Magellan Billet. Then, two years ago, he opted out and bought a bookshop from Thorvaldsen in Copenhagen. He was plain spoken and sometimes rough in manner, just like her, so she couldn\u0027t complain. She liked his animated face, that malicious twinkle in his bright green eyes, his sandy-colored hair, and the always-swarthy complexion. She knew his age, mid-forties, and realized that, thanks to a bloom of youth that had yet to fade, he was at the zenith of his charms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe envied him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor her, it seemed in such short supply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cotton,\" Thorvaldsen said, \"across Europe there have been other fires. They started in France, then in Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland. Similar to what you just experienced. The police in each location realized arson but, so far, none of them have been connected. Two of the buildings burned to ash. They were in rural locations and nobody seemed to care. All four were unoccupied private residences. The one here was the first commercial establishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how did you connect the dots?\" Malone asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know what they\u0027re after,\" she said. \"Elephant medallions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" Malone said, \"that\u0027s exactly what I was thinking. Five arsons. All across Europe. Has to be elephant medallions. What else could it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re real,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to know, but what the hell is an elephant medallion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-three hundred years ago,\" Thorvaldsen said, \"after Alexander the Great conquered Asia Minor and Persia, he set his sights on India. But his army quit him before he could take much of that land. He fought several battles in India and, for the first time, encountered war elephants. They crushed the Macedonian lines, wreaked havoc. Alexander\u0027s men were terrified of them. Medallions were later struck to commemorate the event, which depicted Alexander facing off with the elephants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The medallions,\" she said, \"were minted after Alexander\u0027s death. We have no idea how many, but today only eight are known. The four already taken, the one from tonight, two more in private hands, and one on display in the Museum of Cultural History in Samarkand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The capital of the Central Asian Federation?\" Malone said. \"Part of the region Alexander conquered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen slouched in one of the club chairs, his crooked spine cocking his neck forward and settling his fleshy chin onto a thin chest. Cassiopeia noticed that her old friend looked worn. He wore his customary baggy sweater and oversized corduroy trousers. A uniform he used, she knew, to conceal the deformity. She regretted involving him, but he\u0027d insisted. He was a good friend. Time to see how good a friend Malone was. \"What do you know about the death of Alexander the Great?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve read about it. Lots of myth mixed with conflicting facts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That eidetic memory of yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"It came with me out of the womb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"What happened in June 323 BCE made a great deal of difference to the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen gestured with his arm. \"Go ahead. Tell him. He needs to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the final day of May, within the walls of Babylon, Alexander attended a dinner given by one of his trusted Companions. He pledged a toast, drank a large cup of undiluted wine, then shrieked aloud as if smitten by a violent blow. He was quickly taken to bed where a fever came, but he continued to play dice, plan with his generals, and make the proper sacrifices. On the fourth day he complained of weariness and some of his Companions noticed a lack of his normal energy. He lay quiet for several more days, sleeping in the bathhouse for coolness. Despite his weakened condition, Alexander sent word to the infantry to be ready to march in four days and for the fleet to sail in five. His plans to move west and take Arabia were about to unfold. On June 6, feeling weaker, he passed his ring to Perdiccas so the proper administration of the government could continue. This caused a panic. His troops feared he\u0027d died and, to calm their unease, Alexander allowed them to file past his bed. He greeted each one with a smile. When the last man left he whispered, \"After my death, where will you find a king who deserves such men?\" He commanded that, after his death, his body should be taken to the Temple of Ammon in Egypt. But none of the Companions wanted to hear such fatalism. His condition worsened until, on June 9, his Companions asked, \"To whom do you leave your kingdom?\" Ptolemy said he heard, \"to the brightest.\" Seleucus said, \"to the righteous.\" Peithon recalls, \"to the strongest.\" A great debate ensued as to who was right. Early during the morning of the next day, in the thirty-third year of life, twelve years and eight months into his reign, Alexander III of Macedonia died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People still debate those last words,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why is it so important?\" Malone asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what he left behind,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"His kingdom, with no rightful heir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that has something to do with elephant medallions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cotton,\" Thorvaldsen said, \"I bought that museum knowing someone would destroy it. Cassiopeia and I have been waiting for that to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"We had to stay a step ahead of whoever is after the medallions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems like they won. They have the thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen cast her a look, then the older man stared at Malone and said, \"Not exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVIKTOR RELAXED ONLY WHEN THE DOOR TO THE HOTEL ROOM was closed and locked. They were across Copenhagen, near Nyhavn, where boisterous waterfront cafes catered to rowdy patrons. He sat at the desk and switched on a lamp as Rafael assumed a window position, which overlooked the street four stories below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe now possessed the fifth medallion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first four had been disappointments. One was a forgery, the other three in poor condition. Six months ago he knew little about elephant medallions. Now he considered himself quite proficient in their provenance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should be fine,\" he said to Rafael. \"Calm down. No one followed us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep watch to be sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew Rafael was trying to make amends for overreacting in the museum, so he said, \"It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He should have died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s better he didn\u0027t. At least we know what we\u0027re facing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unzipped a leather case and removed a stereomicroscope and digital scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laid the coin on the desk. They\u0027d found it displayed in one of the museum cases, correctly noted as an \"Elephant Medallion (Alexander the Great), a decadrachm, circa second century BCE.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe first measured its width. Thirty-five millimeters. About right. He flicked on the electronic scales and checked its weight. Forty point seventy-four grams. Correct, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a magnifying glass he examined the image on one face-a warrior in regal splendor, complete with plumed helmet, neck guard, breastplate, and a calvary cloak that fell to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pleased. An obvious flaw in the forgeries was the cloak, which in the false medallions hung to the ankles. For centuries, trade in fake Greek coins had flourished and clever forgers had become adept at fooling both the anxious and the willing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, he was neither.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first known elephant medallion had surfaced when it was donated to the British Museum in 1887. It came from somewhere in central Asia. A second appeared in 1926, from Iran. A third was discovered in 1959. A fourth in 1964. Then, in 1973, four more were found near the ruins of Babylon. Eight in all that had made the rounds through museums and private collectors. Not all that valuable, considering the variety of Hellenistic art and the thousands of coins available, but nonetheless collectible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to his examination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clean-shaven, youthful warrior grasped a sarissa in his left hand topped by a leaf-shaped point. His right hand held a bolt of lightning. Above him loomed a flying Nike, the winged goddess of victory. To the warrior\u0027s left, the die cutter had left a curious monogram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether it was BA or BAB, and what the letters represented Viktor did not know. But an authentic medallion should show that odd symbol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll seemed in order. Nothing added or missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flipped the coin over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts edges were grossly distorted, the pewter-colored patina worn smooth as if by running water. Time was slowly dissolving the delicate engraving on both sides. Amazing, really, that any of them had managed to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All quiet?\" he asked Rafael, who still stood near the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t patronize me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up. \"I actually want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t seem to get it right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught the defeatism. \"You saw someone coming to the museum door. You reacted. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was foolish. Killing attracts too much attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There would have been no body to find. Quit worrying about it. And besides, I approved leaving him there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe refocused his attention on the medallion. The obverse showed the warrior, now a calvaryman, wearing the same outfit, attacking a retreating elephant. Two men sat atop the elephant, one brandishing a sarissa, the other trying to remove a calvaryman\u0027s pike from his chest. Numismatists all agreed that the regal warrior on both sides of the coin represented Alexander, and the medallions commemorated a battle with war elephants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the real test as to whether the thing was authentic came under the microscope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe switched on the illuminator and slid the decadrachm onto the examining tray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthentic ones contained an anomaly. Tiny microletters concealed within the engraving, added by ancient die cutters using a primitive lens. Experts believed the lettering represented something akin to a watermark on a modern banknote, perhaps to ensure authenticity. Lenses were not common in ancient times, so detecting the mark then would have been nearly impossible. The lettering was noticed when the first medallion surfaced years ago. But of the four they\u0027d stolen so far, only one had contained the peculiarity. If this medallion were genuine, within the folds of the cavalryman\u0027s clothing there should be two Greek letters �C ZH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe focused the microscope and saw tiny writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not letters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e36 44 77 55.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up from the eyepiece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafael was watching him. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir dilemma had just deepened. Earlier he\u0027d used the hotel room\u0027s phone and made several calls. His gaze shot to the telephone and the display at its base. Four sets of numbers, two each, starting with thirty-six.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the same ones he\u0027d just seen through the microscope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he instantly knew what the digits on the supposedly ancient medallion represented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Danish phone number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVENICE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:30 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVINCENTI STUDIED HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR AS HIS VALET creased the jacket and allowed the Gucci suit to drape his enormous frame. With a camel-haired brush, all remnants of lint from the dark wool were removed. He then adjusted his tie and made sure the dimple plunged deep. The valet handed him a burgundy handkerchief and he adjusted the silk folds into his coat pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis three-hundred-pound frame looked good in the tailored suit. The Milan fashion consultant he kept on retainer had advised him that swarthy colors not only conveyed authority, they also drew attention away from his stature. Which wasn\u0027t an easy thing to do. Everything about him was big. Pouched cheeks, rolled forehead, cob-nose. But he loved rich food and dieting seemed such a sin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motioned and the valet buffed his Lorenzo Banfi laced shoes. He stole a last look in the mirror, then glanced at his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir,\" the valet said, \"she called while you were showering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the private line?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe valet nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She leave a number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe valet reached into his pocket and found a slip of paper. He\u0027d managed some sleep both before and after the Council meeting. Sleep, unlike dieting, was not a waste of time. He knew people were waiting for him, and he despised being late, but he decided to call from the privacy of his bedroom. No use broadcasting everything over a cellular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe valet retreated from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped to a bedside phone and dialed international. Three buzzes shrilled in his ear before a woman\u0027s voice answered and he said, \"I see, Supreme Minister, that you\u0027re still among the living.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s good to know your information was accurate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t have bothered you with fantasy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you still haven\u0027t said how you knew someone would try to kill me today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days ago he\u0027d passed on to Irina Zovastina the Florentine\u0027s plan. \"The League watches over its members, and you, Supreme Minister, are one of our most important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckled. \"You\u0027re so full of it, Enrico.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you win at buzkashi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Two times into the circle. We left the assassin\u0027s body on the field and trampled it into pieces. The birds and dogs are now enjoying the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced. That was the problem with central Asia. Wanting desperately to be a part of the twenty-first century, its culture remained entrenched in the fifteenth. The League would have to do what it could to change all that. Even if the task would be like weaning a carnivore onto a vegetarian diet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know the Iliad?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew she\u0027d have to be humored. \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cast the souls of many stalwart heroes to Hades and their bodies to the gods and birds of prey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"You fashion yourself Achilles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s much to admire in him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t he a proud man? Excessive, as I recall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But a fighter. Always a fighter. Tell me, Enrico, what of your traitor? Was that problem resolved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Florentine will enjoy a lovely burial north of here, in the lake district. We\u0027ll send flowers.\" He decided to see if she was in the mood. \"We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your payment for saving my life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your end of our bargain, as we originally discussed long ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be ready to meet with the Council in a few days. First, there are things I need to resolve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m more interested in when you and I will meet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckled. \"I\u0027m sure you are. I am, too, actually. But there are things I must complete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My time on the Council ends soon. Thereafter, you\u0027ll have others to deal with. They may not be as accommodating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"I love that. Accommodating. I do enjoy dealing with you, Enrico. We so understand each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon. First, you have that other problem we spoke about. The Americans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, he did. \"Not to worry, I plan to deal with that today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eELEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCOPENHAGEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOT EXACTLY?\" MALONE ASKED THORVALDSEN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I commissioned a fake elephant medallion. It\u0027s quite easy to do, actually. There are many counterfeits on the market.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why did you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cotton,\" Cassiopeia said to him, \"these medallions are important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gee, never would have guessed. What I haven\u0027t heard is how and why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know of Alexander the Great, after he died?\" Thorvaldsen asked. \"With what happened to his body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d read on the subject. \"I know some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt you know what we do,\" Cassiopeia said. She stood beside one of the bookshelves. \"Last fall, I received a call from a friend who worked at the cultural museum in Samarkand. He\u0027d found something he thought I might like to see. An old manuscript.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First or second century after Christ. Ever hear of X-ray fluorescence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a relatively new procedure,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"During the early Middle Ages, parchment was so scarce that monks developed a recycling technique where they scraped away the original ink, then reused the clean parchment for prayer books. With fluorescence, X-rays are formed from a particle accelerator, then bombarded onto the recycled parchment. Thankfully, the ink used centuries ago contained lots of iron. When the X-rays hit that ink, molecules deep in the parchment glow, and those images can be recorded. Pretty amazing, actually. Like a fax from the past. Words once thought erased, written over with new ink, reappear from their molecular signature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cotton,\" Cassiopeia said, \"what we know firsthand about Alexander is confined to the writings of four men who all lived nearly five hundred years after Alexander. Ephemerides, Alexander\u0027s so-called royal journal, which was supposedly contemporaneous, is useless-the victor rewriting history. The Alexander Romance, which many people cite as authority, is wild fiction and bears little relation to reality. The other two, though, were written by Arrian and Plutarch, both reputable chroniclers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve read the Alexander Romance. Great story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s all it is. Alexander is like Arthur, a man whose actual life has been replaced with romantic legend. He\u0027s now regarded as some great, benign conqueror. Some sort of statesman. Actually, he slaughtered people on an unprecedented scale and totally squandered the resources of the lands he acquired. He murdered friends out of paranoia and led most of his troops to early deaths. He was a gambler who staked his life, and the lives of those around him, on chance. There\u0027s nothing magical about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I disagree,\" he said. \"He was a great military commander, the first person to unite the world. His conquests were bloody and brutal because that\u0027s war. True, he was bent on conquering, but his world seemed ready to be conquered. He was politically shrewd. A Greek, who ultimately became a Persian. From everything I\u0027ve read, he seemed to have little use for petty nationalism-and I can\u0027t fault him for that. After he died his generals, the Companions, divided the empire among themselves, which ensured that Greek culture dominated for centuries. And it did. The Hellenistic Age utterly changed Western civilization. And all that started with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw that Cassiopeia did not agree with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s that legacy which was discussed in the old manuscript,\" she said. \"What actually happened after Alexander died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know what happened,\" he said. \"His empire became the prey of his generals and they played finders-keepers with his body. Lots of differing accounts about how they each tried to highjack the funeral cortege. They all wanted the body as a symbol of their power. That\u0027s why it was mummified. Greeks burned their dead. But not Alexander. His corpse needed to live on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what happened between the time when Alexander died in Babylon and when his body was finally transported back west that concerned the manuscript,\" Cassiopeia said. \"A year passed. A year that\u0027s critical to the elephant medallions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft ring broke the room\u0027s silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone watched as Henrik removed a phone from his pocket and answered. Unusual. Thorvaldsen hated the things, and especially detested people who talked on one in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone glanced at Cassiopeia and asked, \"That important?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression stayed sullen. \"It\u0027s what we\u0027ve been waiting for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why you so chipper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may not believe this, Cotton, but I have feelings, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered about the caustic comment. When she\u0027d visited Copenhagen during Christmas, they\u0027d spent a few pleasant evenings together at Christiangade, Thorvaldsen\u0027s seaside home north of Copenhagen. He\u0027d even given her a present, a rare seventeenth-century edition on medieval engineering. Her French reconstruction project, where stone by stone she was building a castle with tools and raw materials from seven hundred years ago, continued to progress. They\u0027d even agreed that, in the spring, he\u0027d come for a visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen finished his call. \"That was the thief from the museum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how did he know to call you?\" Malone asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had this phone number engraved on the medallion. I wanted to make it perfectly clear that we\u0027re waiting. I told him that if he wants the original decadrachm he\u0027s going to have to buy it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing that, he\u0027ll probably kill you instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re hoping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how do you plan to prevent that from happening?\" Malone asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia stepped forward, her face rigid. \"That\u0027s where you come in.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-venetian-betrayal-cotton-malone-3/page-4.html","bookId":2234,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM"}
