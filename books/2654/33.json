I wanted to ask her more about the princess Cantacuzene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Kruglevski was leaving the Vladimirichi Palace. He smiled when he saw me. \"Duchess Katerina Alexandrovna!\" he said in greeting. \"What a pleasure!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Doctor,\" I said, alarmed to see him. \"Is the grand duchess ill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Not at all. But I shal let her tell you the news. How are your parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are well. Papa is excited about his plans for his new medical institute. And we shal travel to Switzerland this summer to look at the medical schools there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"excellent! Good day to you, Duchess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried inside and up the stairs to the grand duchess\u0027s parlor. I waited as her servants announced me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katerina Alexandrovna, what a delight.\" The grand duchess did not exactly look pleased to see me. Her voice dripped with sarcasm. \"How is your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is well, thank you. And you are well? I saw Dr. Kruglevski leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am fine, my dear. As are the babies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Babies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled slightly, though the smile did not reach her eyes. \"They are due in the fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations, Your Imperial Highness. I did not know. Twins? That is wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark faerie\u0027s youngest child, Helena, was already seven years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer oldest, Kyril, was thirteen. It must have been a surprise to find herself expecting again. She sat down in the velvet chair opposite me. \"And what has brought you here today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to ask you about Princess Cantacuzene,\" I whispered. I was never sure when the princess would be at Miechen\u0027s palace. This would not be a good day to run into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" the grand duchess said, turning to pour herself some tea. From the side, I spotted a slight swelling in her belly that I had not noticed before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I tell you about the princess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her lineage,\" I said, holding my breath. \"Is she a descendant of the House of Bessaraba?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt cold and slightly nauseated. I grabbed the chair in front of me as the room tilted slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know the history of the House of Bessaraba?\" Miechen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only that its descendant is the person responsible for killing the members of the Order of St. John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed?\" the grand duchess asked. \"Where did you hear such a thing?\" I did not think the grand duke George would want me to let Miechen know exactly how I had come across that information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiechen\u0027s violet eyes narrowed like a cat\u0027s as she stared at me. \"Then you do not know that one of Princess Ruxandra\u0027s ancestors was Vlad Dracul of Wall achia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost dropped the cup of tea she had given me. \"No,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrincess Cantacuzene was a vampire. She was their leader. \"You have been protecting her secret from the tsar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiechen nodded. \"I am bound by an oath. But now you have discovered it on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would she want members of the Order dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She must believe them some sort of threat. She and I will discuss this. I will not allow it to continue.\" The dark faerie\u0027s face was grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wanted me to kill Prince Danilo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you told me before. It would be the most prudent way for her to deal with the Montenegrin threat. They are close all ies of the tsar.\" Miechen stirred her own tea thoughtfully. \"And Princess Militza is an ambitious young blood drinker, who wants to rule the St. Petersburg bloodline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about Princess Elena and the tsarevitch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow, I do not see that union coming to pass, no matter how fond the tsar is of King Nikola. Elena is still a blood drinker, and the Romanov line cannot be tainted with their like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must have breathed a sigh of relief, because Miechen smiled. \"You perhaps thought of marrying the tsarevitch yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mon Dieu, no!\" I said, blushing. \"I would never want to be empress.\" I shuddered, imagining the burden. \"Besides, I believe the tsarevitch has already found his bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiechen smiled. \"Do you have a touch of the faerie sight as well? You have a precarious situation, child. Your future is very unclear to me. I wonder what you will do with your gift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does the tsar allow the Romanian vampires to live in St.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetersburg?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A truce that his grandfather Nicholas made with the most powerful vampire house. The House of Bessaraba is strong enough to keep the other houses in line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many houses are there? Does Princess Cantacuzene rule the Dekebristi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiechen shook her head. \"The Dekebristi minions do not exist anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the House of Bessaraba has absorbed many of the smaller families, especially the Bulgarians and the Moravians. There is a small family of upyri in Siberia, but they are watched carefully by the Old Believers. And there are the houses in Rome, India, Egypt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered, wondering how many blood drinkers there were in the world. I had heard before of the Old Believers, who kept to the beliefs of the Byzantine Orthodox Church. \"Princess Cantacuzene told me about the Dekebristi,\" I said. \"She said the wife of Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich was a vampire and had created the Dekebristi from members of the Order of St. John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiechen nodded. \"But I imagine she did not tell you Konstantin\u0027s wife, Johanna, was also from the House of Bessaraba.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was related to Princess Cantacuzene?\" A chil slid down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Distantly, or so she has told me. Johanna was defeated with the Dekebristi by Tsar Nicholas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had summoned the bogatyr,\" I guessed. Why did they not teach us the true version of history in school? It would be ever so helpful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and that is why you have become so valuable, Katerina Alexandrovna. Only a necromancer can evoke the bogatyr for the tsar. The Koldun is forbidden from performing such rituals. The Dekebristi would kill you to prevent the bogatyr from being summoned. If they still existed.\" Now I did not know who to fear more-Princess Cantacuzene or the Montenegrins. Or the Dekebristi. I had planned to visit Princess Cantacuzene, to say goodbye to her before we left for Biarritz. I had never felt threatened or in danger when I was with her. I could not imagine the aged princess drinking someone\u0027s blood. She was too elegant. Too delicate. And yet I remembered Princess Cantacuzene\u0027s tale of the veshtizas. They were beautiful women who turned into insect-like creatures and sucked the blood of sleeping victims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath caught. How could I have forgotten? Flying insects, like moths. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-33.html","bookId":2654,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM"}
