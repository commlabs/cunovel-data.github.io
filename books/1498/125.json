You’ve probably not seen how eyes light up due to food. Can I invite another person along?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMa Ke curiously asked, “There is someone that is more excited about eating than you? Who are you asking to come along? A person with a bigger appetite than yours? Is he going to wipe out all the food from my house? Haha!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI nudged him and said, “That won’t happen! Ah! It’s Mu Zi.

I had a strange feeling in my heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMa Ke replied, “Go and invite her then!

I’ll head off already.” I did a short distance teleport and teleported five hundred meters away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI succeeded in solving the riddle of the Kingdom of Aixia’s fate and felt exceptionally light hearted. I arrived at the academy quickly, where it looked like the last class for the morning. I walked to the class entrance and shouted, “Permission to enter!” \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTeacher Si replied from inside the classroom, “Come in!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI pushed open the door and said, “Teacher, I’m back!” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTeacher Si Lan said, “\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAh\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e!

Are we going to Ascending Jade Tide?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI made a wry face and said, “Do you only know that one place? We aren’t going there, but the quality shouldn’t be too far off from the Ascending Jade Tide Restaurant. It’s a banquet and I’ve intentionally come to get you.” \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi frowned and said, “I’m not going as there will definitely be lots of people going there and I hate noisy places.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI pleaded and said, “Mu Zi, let’s go together! There’ll be a lot of delicious food to eat and you don’t need to socialize. You can just eat the food. Isn’t that great? Are you really going to reject this offer?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi looked at me curiously and said, “Really? If the food isn’t good, I won’t forgive you!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI said elatedly, “It won’t be a problem because if you find the food unsatisfying, I’ll just bring you to the Ascending Jade Tide. Are you satisfied this way?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi nodded and said, “Alright. But I’ve made it clear that I’ll just be going to eat and I won’t be socializing.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘She really is just like a little piglet that only knows how to eat.

When we arrived at the prince’s mansion quickly, Mu Zi looked at the vast building. She gasped, “It can’t be that this is the place you plan to bring me?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI smiled and replied, “That’s right! It’s here.” I pulled her tender and delicate hand and walked towards the entrance. The guards standing at the entrance smiled at me cordially and said, “Young Master Zhang Gong, you’ve finally arrived. You should quickly head inside as everyone is waiting for you!” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Alright!

I knew where the study was, so naturally, I would be able to find the ballroom.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWah\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e! When I opened the door, it was so lively. The room was sufficient to contain about 500 people and was filled with people who were obviously brimming with joy. The prince was so fast. He was able to gather his subordinates in such a short period of time. It was easy to see how cheerful he was. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Boss, you’ve finally arrived.

This is his house after all.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi replied, “Ma Ke is the prince’s son? I didn’t know that!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI said, “This is a secret so don’t expose it after going back to the academy.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi pouted and whispered into my ears, “Why are you participating in this banquet? It seems to be for high ranking officers.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI whispered back, “You don’t need to worry about that.

I’ve just arrived.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe prince came over and looked curiously at Mu Zi before talking to me. “Zhang Gong, why are you still calling me Your Highness? You should just call me uncle Ke Zha!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI pointed at Mu Zi and said, “Alright!

How can I let you elders wait for me? You could’ve just started without me.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe prince said, “You’re the main contributor in my victory!

Let’s go in.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI pulled Mu Zi, who was now even more curious, into the ballroom and sat at the main table.
