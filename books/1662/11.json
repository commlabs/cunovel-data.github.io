Since he is a doctor and all. Oh! Are we going to a fancy dinner and will we talk politics and current events?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shush it.” She smiled, though, settling back. “I think you’ll like him. He’s not stuffy or overbearing. He’s really like…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart did a funny thing. “Like Dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom smiled sadly. “Yeah, like Dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of us spoke for a few minutes. Mom had met Dad her first year of nursing residency at the hospital in Florida. He’d been a patient, having fallen off the deck and broken his foot, trying to impress some girl. But according to my dad, the moment he’d looked into Mom’s eyes, he couldn’t even remember the other girl’s name. They’d dated for six months, got engaged, and married within the year. I came shortly thereafter, and there hadn’t been two people more in love than them. Even when they’d argued, love fueled their words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d give anything to have that kind of relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished off the rest of my cocoa and wiggled closer to Mom. She lifted her slender arm and I snuggled in, inhaling the apple-scented body lotion she always wore during autumn. Mom had this habit of changing her perfumes and lotions with the seasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m happy you met him,” I said finally. “Will sounds like a really nice guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is.” She kissed the top of my head. “I like to think your father would approve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad would approve of anyone who made Mom happy. I’d been there the day hospice had told us it wouldn’t be much longer. Standing outside their bedroom, I’d heard him tell Mom to love again. That was all he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes. That kind of love should’ve been able to beat sickness. That kind of love should’ve conquered anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI readjusted the thin black straps for the third time and finally gave up. No matter how many times I tugged on it, the neckline of the dress wasn’t coming up any higher. I couldn’t believe it fit me. Aw hell, it fit a little too well, emphasizing the vast difference between Dee’s body and mine. My boobs just might come out and say hello tonight. The dress clung to my bust and had a cinched empire waist before it billowed in soft waves to end before my knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kind of looked hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I needed to cover those babies up. I whipped open the closet door. I knew I had a red cardigan that wouldn’t look too bad with this dress, but I couldn’t find it in the mess. It took me a few minutes to realize that it was in the dryer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holy crud.” I moaned and headed downstairs in a flurry of black and tapping heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God Mom had already left for work. She’d either stroke out or applaud the dress. Either one would’ve been embarrassing. I headed down the hallway, nervous and nauseous. I could hear the car doors outside, the laughter as I pulled out the cardigan, shook it, and slipped it on. What if I did something stupid? Like lift a TV in front of an entire house full of classmates?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then there was a knock on the door. Taking a deep breath, I backtracked to the front door and swung it open. “Hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake stepped in, holding a half dozen roses in his hands. His eyes drifted over me. “Whoa, you look really great.” He smiled as he held out the flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlushing, I took the roses and inhaled their clean scent. Giddiness swept through me. “Thank you, but you didn’t have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, the key word again: want. “Well, they’re beautiful. And you look really nice, too.” And he did, dressed in a dark V-neck sweater with a collared shirt on underneath. I stepped back, holding the roses close. No one had ever given me flowers before. “Would you like something to drink before we head over?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded and followed me into the kitchen. Options were limited, so he settled on one of my mom’s wine coolers. He leaned against the counter, looking around as I found a vase for the roses. “You have books everywhere. It’s really cute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled as I set the roses on the counter. “My mom hates it. She’s always trying to pick them up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you just put them right back, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “Yeah, sounds right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved forward, wine cooler in one hand. His gaze dipped and he reached out, picking up the silver chain. His knuckles brushed the swell of my chest. “Interesting necklace. What kind of stone is this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Obsidian,” I told him. “A friend gave it to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s really different.” He let it drop. “It’s cool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.” I placed my fingers on it, trying to push away the images of Daemon it brought along with it. I searched for something to say. “Thanks for the flowers again. They’re really pretty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad you like them. I was worried I’d look like a nerd for giving them to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. They’re perfect.” I smiled. “Are you ready to go over?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished up the wine cooler and rinsed it before tossing it in the trash. Mom would’ve loved him for that—well, not the underage-drinking-of-her-wine-cooler part. “Sure,” he said. “But I kind of have some bad news. I can only stay for half an hour tops. We have some family coming in last minute. I’m really sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I said, hoping the disappointment wasn’t audible. “It’s okay. We didn’t give you much notice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure? I feel like such a tool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. You’re not a tool. You did bring me roses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake grinned. “Well, I want to make it up to you. Can you do dinner with me tomorrow night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. “I can’t tomorrow. Spending the day with my mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about Monday?” he asked. “Do your parents let you out on a school night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just my mom, but yes, she does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. There’s this little Indian restaurant I saw in town.” He inched closer. There was a slight scent of aftershave that reminded me of the conversation I’d had with Lesa about how boys smelled. Blake smelled good. “You game?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure thing.” I glanced around, biting my lip. “You ready to head over now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep, if you do one thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, two things.” Another step closer and his shoes were touching mine. I had to tip my head back to meet his eyes. “Then we can go over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a little dizzy, staring in his eyes. “What are the two things?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got to give me your hand. If this is a speed date, we’ve got to make it believable.” He dipped his head, still holding onto my gaze. “And a kiss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A kiss?” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips spread in a crooked smile. “I need you to remember me when I leave. In that dress, you’re going to have guys all over you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will. So? Is it a deal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath slowed in my lungs. Curiosity filled me. Would kissing him be like kissing Daemon? Would the world burn or just simmer? I wanted to find out, needed to discover if I could forget the boy next door in a simple kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Deal,” I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand found my cheek, and I closed my eyes. Blake whispered my name. My mouth opened, but there were no words to be spoken. There was just anticipation and the need to lose myself. At first, his lips brushed across mine lightly, testing my response, and the gentle nature of the kiss was disarming. I placed my hands on his shoulders, and they tightened when he swept his lips over mine again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis kiss deepened, and I felt like I was swimming in raw emotions. It was elating and yet confusing at the same time. I kissed him back, and his hands dropped to my waist, pulling me closer. I waited breathlessly in between kisses for something—anything—other than the restlessness stirring inside me. Then all at once, I felt frustration, anger, and sadness—which were nothing I was searching for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake broke contact, breathing heavily. His lips were ripe, swollen. “Well, I will definitely remember you when I leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered my chin, blinking. Nothing had been wrong with that kiss, other than it was lacking something. It had to be me. Stress. With everything happening, I was thinking too much into things. And kissing him was just too fast. I felt like one of those girls in the books I read, delving into a guy headfirst without even thinking about it. Practical Katy still lived inside me, and she wasn’t happy with what I’d done. And it was more than that. A stirring of sour guilt poked at me, telling me that my heart hadn’t been in that kiss because of someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just one more thing,” he said, and his hand found mine. “Ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I? Confliction tore through me. Maybe if Daemon saw me happy with Blake, he wouldn’t feel compelled to pursue our unreal connection. I felt sick. “Yes. I’m ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, there were numerous cars lining the driveway and all the way down to the empty house at the beginning of our road. “Holy crap, I thought this was supposed to be a little party?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee had really outdone herself. She’d dug up numerous paper lanterns and strung them along the porch. Through their windows, thick candles spread throughout flickered softly. A warm, pleasant cider-and-spice smell floated outside and tickled my nose, reminding me how much I loved the smell of autumn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople were everywhere inside, packed on the couch, surrounding two guys in a Wii death match. Several familiar faces were crowding the staircase, laughing as they drank from red plastic cups. Blake and I couldn’t go two feet without bumping into someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee weaved in and out of the crowd, playing the hostess. She looked beautiful in her delicate white dress that highlighted the darkness of her hair and the emerald color of her eyes. When she saw our hands joined together, she barely hid her surprise…or disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling like I was doing something wrong, I pulled free and gave her a tight hug. “Wow. The house looks great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It does, doesn’t it? I’m a natural.” She looked over my shoulder. “Katy…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks burned. “He’s my—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Date,” Blake inserted, catching and squeezing my hand. “I have to bail soon, but I wanted to escort her to the party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Escort her?” She glanced at him, then back to me. “Okay. Well, I’ll go…check on some stuff. Yeah.” Then she floated away, back stiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to not let her disappointment get to me. She couldn’t seriously want me to be with her brother. One of them had already gone down that path with a human and look what happened. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-11.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
