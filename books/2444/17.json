I said I hadn\u0027t been feeling well to begin with, and couldn\u0027t face classes with the thought of Tara on my mind. He agreed that I\u0027d be better off at home. \"Darren,\" he said as I was leaving, \"will you stay in this weekend and take care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" I lied, then hurried downstairs to look for Richard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmickey Martin and a couple of his friends were lounging by the entrance as I hit the ground floor. He\u0027d said nothing to me since our run-in on the stairs - he\u0027d shown his true yellow colours by fleeing - but he called out jeeringly when he saw me. \"Look what the cat\u0027s dragged in! Shame - I thought the vampires had done for you, like they did for Ta-ta Williams.\" Pausing, I stomped across to face him. He looked wary. \"Watch yourself, Horsty,\" he growled. \"If you get in my face, I\u0027ll-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed the front of his jumper, lifted him off the ground and held him high above my head. He shrieked like a little child and slapped and kicked at me, but I didn\u0027t let go, only shook him roughly until he was quiet. \"I\u0027m looking for Richard Montrose,\" I said. \"Have you seen him?\" Smickey glared at me and said nothing. With my left fingers and thumb, I caught his nose and squeezed until he wailed. \"Have you seen him?\" I asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yuhs!\" he squealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let go of his nose. \"When? Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few minutes ago,\" he mumbled. \"Heading for the computer room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, relieved, and gently lowered Smickey. \"Thanks,\" I said. Smickey told me what I could do with my thanks. Smiling, I waved a sarcastic goodbye to the humbled bully, then left the building, satisfied that Richard was safe - at least until night...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Steve\u0027s I woke the sleeping vampires and humans - Harkat was already awake - and discussed the latest twist with them. This was the first Debbie had heard about the murdered girl - she hadn\u0027t seen the papers - and the news struck her hard. \"Tara,\" she whispered, tears in her eyes. \"What sort of a beast would pick on an innocent young child like Tara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told them about Richard, and put forward the proposal that he was next on the vampaneze hit list. \"Not necessarily,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"I think they will go after another of your classmates - just as they executed those living to either side of Debbie - but they might go for the boy or girl sitting in front of or behind you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Richard\u0027s my friend,\" I pointed out. \"I barely know the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not think the vampaneze are aware of that,\" he said. \"If they were, they would have targeted Richard first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to stake out all three,\" Vancha said. \"Do we know where they live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can find out,\" Debbie said, wiping tears from her cheeks. Vancha tossed her a dirty scrap of cloth, which she accepted gratefully. \"The student files are accessible by remote computer. I know the password. I\u0027ll go to an Internet cafe, tap into the files and get their addresses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do when - if- they attack?\" Steve asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do to them what they did to Tara,\" Debbie growled before any of the rest of us could answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think that\u0027s wise?\" Steve responded. \"We know there\u0027s more than one of them in operation, but I doubt they\u0027ll all turn out to kill a child. Wouldn\u0027t it be wiser to trace the attacker back to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\" Debbie interrupted. \"Are you saying we let them kill Richard or one of the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes sense. Our primary aim is to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie slapped his face before he got any further. \"Animal!\" she hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve stared at her emotionlessly. \"I am what I have to be,\" he said. \"We won\u0027t stop the vampaneze by being civilized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You... you...\" She couldn\u0027t think of anything dreadful enough to call him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got a point,\" Vancha interceded. Debbie turned on him, appalled. \"Well, he has,\" Vancha grumbled, dropping his gaze. \"I don\u0027t like the idea of letting them kill another child, but if it means saving others...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Debbie said. \"No sacrifices. I won\u0027t allow it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me neither,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you an alternative suggestion?\" Steve asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Injury,\" Mr. Crepsley answered when the rest of us were silent. \"We stake out the houses, wait for a vampaneze, then shoot him with an arrow before he strikes. But we do not kill him - we target his legs or arms. Then we follow and, if we are lucky, he will lead us back to his companions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dunno,\" Vancha muttered. \"You, me and Darren can\u0027t use those guns - it\u0027s not the vampire way - which means we\u0027ll have to rely upon the aim of Steve, Harkat and Debbie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t miss,\" Steve vowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t either,\" Debbie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor me,\" Harkat added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you won\u0027t,\" Vancha agreed, \"but if there are two or more of them, you won\u0027t have time to target a second - the arrow guns are single-shooters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a risk we must take,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Now, Debbie, you should go to one of these inferno net cafes and find the addresses as soon as possible, then get to bed and sleep. We must be ready for action when night comes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Crepsley and Debbie staked out the house of Derek Barry, the boy who sat in front of me in English. Vancha and Steve took responsibility for Gretchen Kelton (Gretch the Wretch, as Smickey Martin called her), who sat behind me. Harkat and I covered the Montrose household.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriday was a dark, cold, wet night. Richard lived in a big house with his parents and several brothers and sisters. There were lots of upper windows the vampaneze could use to get in. We couldn\u0027t cover them all. But vampaneze almost never kill people in their homes - it was how the myth that vampires can\u0027t cross a threshold without being invited started - and although Debbie\u0027s neighbours had been killed in their apartments, all the others had been attacked in the open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened that night. Richard stayed indoors the whole time. I caught glimpses of him and his family through the curtains every now and then, and envied them their simple lives - none of the Montroses would ever have to stake out a house, anticipating an attack by dark-souled monsters of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the family was all in bed and the lights went off, Harkat and I took to the roof of the building, where we remained the rest of the night, hidden in the shadows, keeping guard. We left with the rising sun and met the others back at the apartments. They\u0027d had a quiet night too. Nobody had seen any vampaneze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The army are back,\" Vancha noted, referring to the soldiers who\u0027d returned to guard the streets following the murder of Tara Williams. \"We\u0027ll have to take care not to get in their way - they could mistake us for the killers and open fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Debbie had gone to bed, the rest of us discussed our post-weekend plans. Although Mr. Crepsley, Vancha and I had agreed to leave on Monday if we hadn\u0027t run down the vampaneze, I thought we should reconsider - things had changed with the murder of Tara and the threat to Richard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampires were having none of it. \"A vow\u0027s a vow,\" Vancha insisted. \"We set a deadline and must stick to it. If we postpone leaving once, we\u0027ll postpone again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vancha is right,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed. \"Whether we sight our opponents or not, on Monday we leave. It will not be pleasant, but our quest takes priority. We must do what is best for the clan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to go along with them. Indecision is the source of chaos, as Paris Skyle used to say. This wasn\u0027t the time to risk a rift with my two closest allies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs things worked out, I needn\u0027t have worried, because late that Saturday, with heavy clouds masking an almost full moon, the vampaneze finally struck - and all bloody hell broke loose! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/allies-of-the-night-the-saga-of-darren-shan-8/page-17.html","bookId":2444,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:09 PM"}
