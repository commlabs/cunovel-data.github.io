Boston. 1843.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We have already expressed our faith in Mr. Channing’s genius, which in some of the finest and rarest traits of the poet is without a rival in this country. This little volume has already become a sign of great hope and encouragement to the lovers of the muse. The refinement and the sincerity of his mind, not less than the originality and delicacy of the diction, are not merits to be suddenly apprehended, but are sure to find a cordial appreciation. Yet we would willingly invite any lover of poetry to read “The Earth-Spirit,” “Reverence,” “The Lover’s Song,” “Death,” and “The Poet’s Hope.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1378/41341.html","bookId":1432,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 11:30:11 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 11:30:11 AM"}
