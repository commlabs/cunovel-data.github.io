Her hair pulled up in a high ponytail was killing me because I love it when she wears her hair up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Ellery,” I said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back at her phone. “I asked you a question,” she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell she was pissed, but I didn’t care. “Nobody should have to go through this alone,” I said as I sat down in the chair next to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed out that she wasn’t alone, and that she had Nurse Bailey as she continued looking at her phone. She wouldn’t even look at me, and it was seriously pissing me off. I grabbed her phone out of her hand and put it in my pocket. Needless to say, she wasn’t happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell, Connor?!” she yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was just about to spit fire at me when Nurse Bailey came over and inserted a needle into her port. I took a deep breath because I couldn’t imagine what she was thinking or going through when that needle went in. “Cheers,” she smiled at Nurse Bailey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and looked at me; her blue eyes that once sparkled and danced were now dull and pained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here as your friend, Ellery,” I said as I so desperately wanted to take her hand in mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I have my phone back, please,” she asked holding out her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached in my pocket and handed her the phone. Our hands touched as she took it from me. Her skin was as soft and warm as I remembered. I wanted to make it very clear to her why I was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is how this is going to work,” I spoke. “I’m going to bring you here every week and then take you home. I’ve hired a private nurse to come to your apartment daily to tend to you and make you comfortable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked me why I was doing this, and I simply explained to her that I owed her for the night she took me home from the club. She was giving me that darling attitude of hers and told me she was fine and that I could leave. God, I’ve missed her attitude. I told her that I was staying and that she was in no position to say otherwise. She gave me a dirty look and asked me how I knew about her treatment today. I explained to her once again that I can find out anything. I didn’t dare tell her that I was having Denny follow her. She called me a stalker and then proceeded to read a book on her kindle. I opened up my iPad and started checking my emails. After 15 minutes of silence, Ellery looked up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t need to be here; I’m sure you have better things to do than sit in a room, watching people get chemo for five hours,” she randomly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whether I have better things to do or not, this is how it’s going to be, so let’s be quiet, and don’t worry about it,” I replied still looking down at my iPad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNurse Bailey came by and asked Ellery how she was doing. I was shocked by her response. “I’m doing f**king fantastic, Nurse Bailey, because I know that probably by tonight, I’ll have my head down the toilet for a good hour or two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Ellery and then at Nurse Bailey, “Ellery, that’s enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse looked at me sympathetically. “It’s alright; she’s angry right now and needs to let it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m used to it. I just try to make my patients as comfortable as possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned in closer to her and whispered, “Could you please stop being a smart ass? She’s only trying to help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a look and raised her hands to redo her ponytail. My eyes instantly went to her wrists as the sleeves of her sweatshirt fell back. I nearly gasped when I saw the tattoos; my name on her left wrist and the infinity sign on her right. Why the hell would she do that? I didn’t want to say anything to her about it; I wanted to wait and see if she would tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and told Ellery that I’d be right back. I walked down the hall to the restroom to catch my breath. I was speechless as to what I just saw, and I couldn’t understand why she would do that. As I was heading back to Ellery, Nurse Bailey stopped me in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, Mr. Black; Ellery is going through a bunch of raw emotions right now. She’s feeling sad, anxious, depressed, and most of all, angry. She’s angry that this is happening to her all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s angry at life right now. When she’s angry, everyone around her will feel it too. It’s a normal part of the emotional process of having cancer and going through the chemotherapy treatments,” she said as she put her hand on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, I’ll remember that, and I plan on making her as comfortable as possible,” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a long five hours. Not because of Ellery’s chemo treatment, but because of her attitude and anger towards me. I don’t blame her for being mad at me. I was mean, rude, and out of line at the hotel in Michigan, and I’ll find a way to make that up to her. I took her blanket to hold it for her, and she ripped it out of my hands while telling me she’s got it. I sighed as she walked several feet in front of me. We approached the limo, and I graciously opened the door for her. She slid in the back seat without even looking at me. The only person who got a hello and a smile was Denny. He was thrilled to see her. I could tell he missed her as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat there, staring out the window and still refusing to look at me. I asked her how she was feeling, and she said she was fine. She obviously didn’t want to talk, so I left her alone, and there was silence the whole way to her apartment. After hearing what she told Nurse Bailey about how she anticipates getting sick, I decided she shouldn’t be left alone. I knew Peyton was out of town with Henry, so she wouldn’t be able to stay with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pulled up to her apartment, and I followed her inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to start packing,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what?” she asked as she turned and looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took in a sharp breath, “You will be staying in the guest room at my penthouse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not going anywhere; this is my home. This is where I’m staying!” she snapped at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen to me,” I said in a raised voice. “I don’t want you staying here alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked over to me with a strange look on her face and put her finger to my chest. “I’m not your f**king charity case, Connor Black, and I don’t need your help. Besides, you hate me anyway, why would you want to help me after what I did?” She said as she slowly turned around and walked to the sink, resting her hands on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurt me to know that she thinks I hate her. Maybe that’s the reason for her behavior towards me today. I slowly walked up behind her. I wanted to wrap my arms around her, but I couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellery, I don’t hate you; please don’t ever say that again. Yes, I will admit that I’m still angry, and that I probably will be for a while, but I need to put all that aside because you are my friend, and you need help. Please put your stubbornness aside, and let me help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said you hired a nurse to come here,” she softly spoke with her back still turned to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’m making other arrangements,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned around and looked at me with sadness in her eyes as she agreed and went to pack her bag. I let out a sigh because I was relieved. That was easier than I thought it was going to be. She’s one stubborn girl and can put up a fight until she wins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took her bag upstairs to the guest room and set it in the corner as Ellery laid herself on the bed. I could tell she loved that bed. I could see the corners of her mouth slightly curve up as she ran her hands across the comforter. I’m glad I made the decision to bring her here. I just hope I don’t end up regretting it. Seeing her sitting in that chair at the hospital while getting treatment was melancholy. I never dreamed in a million years that I would be bringing home a girl with cancer and taking care of her. It wasn’t me, but then again, I’m not the same person when I’m with Ellery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a business dinner with Paul this evening. I told her I was going out tonight and that she’s welcome to help herself to anything she needs or wants. She gave me a half smile as I turned and walked out the door. I didn’t want to leave her, but Denny had agreed to stay until I got home in case something happened. I grabbed my keys and headed out the door to meet Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arrived back home around 11:00 pm and went upstairs to check on Ellery. Denny said she had been sleeping since I left. The door was opened a crack, and I peeked inside to make sure she was ok.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sleeping peacefully. I walked to my room and changed into a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on the bed and opened my laptop to do some work. I had fallen asleep for a while and woke up to the sound of Ellery vomiting in the bathroom. I got out of bed quickly and headed down the hall to the bathroom. I slightly opened the door and saw her on the floor, over the toilet, violently vomiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellery,” I whispered as I took her hair and held it back in my hands. She told me to go away because she didn’t want me seeing her like this. I knelt down beside her while holding her hair and told her I wasn’t going anywhere until she was back in bed. About an hour later, she was finally done vomiting. She rested her elbows on the toilet and cupped her face in her hands. I walked over to the sink and wet a washcloth with tepid water. I folded it and patted it gently across her head. She grabbed the washcloth from me as I helped her stand up; she was weak. I held her arm and helped her back to bed. I pulled the covers over her, and as I turned to walk away, she lightly grabbed my hand. I turned around and looked at her as she softly spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is nothing. You have no idea what you’ve gotten yourself into, Mr. Black.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her pale and pained face. I didn’t know how to respond to that, so I just turned around and walked out the door, leaving it slightly open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning I woke up early because I needed to go to the office. I showered and put on my jeans and a button down shirt. I walked to Ellery’s room, stood outside the door, and listened. I could hear her stirring in bed. I quietly opened the door and asked her if she was awake. She looked at me in a way that made me ache for her. I asked her how she was feeling, and she told me that she was ok and going to take a shower. I told her that when she was done to come downstairs, and Claire would make her breakfast. She asked me who Claire was. Apparently, I forgot to tell her that I had a housekeeper. Before she went into the bathroom, I told her I had to go to the office for a while, and I’d be home later. She said, “Ok, see ya,” in a tone that was cold and flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the kitchen and explained to Claire that Ellery was sick last night, and she may or may not want to eat. She told me not to worry, and that she would take care of her. I grabbed a cup of coffee and took it to my office to do some computer work before heading to Black Enterprises. I sat back in my chair and ran my hands through my hair. What the hell was I doing? Having her here was nice, but it was emotionally painful at the same time. I walked back to the kitchen where Claire and Ellery were talking. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-23.html","bookId":1820,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:43 PM"}
