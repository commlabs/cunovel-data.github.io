He stoked the fires of passion with each hard thrust. She screamed his name as wave after wave of ecstasy poured over her, and only then when he knew she had found her fulfillment did he give in to his own. With an almost violent shudder, he thrust deep and poured his seed into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t move for long minutes. The only sound was harsh panting as each tried to recover. Gillian was overcome by what had just happened. She continued to hold on to him as she tried to calm her racing heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick wanted to kiss her and tell her how much she had pleased him, but he couldn\u0027t find the strength to move. He heard her whisper, \"Good Lord Almighty,\" and he laughed, but he still couldn\u0027t make himself move, and so he kissed her earlobe and stayed where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d be good, but damn, Gillian, I didn\u0027t know you\u0027d kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I made you happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again and finally lifted his head and looked at her. Her eyes were still misty with passion, she looked thoroughly ravaged, and he suddenly thought it might be a good idea to make love to her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you made me very happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know… when you… and then I… I didn\u0027t know we could do… what we did… I didn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands cupped the sides of her face, and he kissed her lazily and thoroughly. When he shifted his position ever so slightly, his chest hairs tickled her breasts, and she sighed in reaction. He kissed her again then rolled to his side and pulled her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt an overpowering possessiveness. He didn\u0027t know how he had managed to capture her or why she loved him, but she belonged to him now. She was his wife and for the rest of his life he would protect and cherish her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stroked his chest as she snuggled closer to him and closed her eyes. She was just drifting off to sleep when a sudden thought jarred her wide awake. \"Brodick, what am I going to tell Father Laggan tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn graphic detail, using every lusty word he could think of, he described what they had just done and then suggested she simply repeat those words to the priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told him she\u0027d do no such thing, and after mulling the matter over in her mind for several minutes, she decided she wasn\u0027t going to tell him anything at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want Father to remove the blessing,\" she worried out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a yawn, he answered, \"He won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he agreed. \"Now you tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell you what?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you love me. I want to hear the words again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell asleep waiting for him to tell her that he loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoving Brodick was exhausting. She didn\u0027t get much sleep that night, unaccustomed as she was to having a man in her bed, a big man at that, who took up most of the space. Every time she tried to move, she bumped into him. She finally slept pinned under one of his hard thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick wasn\u0027t used to sleeping in a bed, and so he had just as much trouble. It was too soft, and he much preferred the ground outdoors with the brisk wind cooling his body and the stars to gaze at until he drifted off, but he wasn\u0027t about to leave his bride on their wedding night, and so he stayed where he was and dozed off and on. In between he made love to her. He tried to be gentle because he knew he\u0027d hurt her the first time he\u0027d mated with her, and Gillian was too sleepy at first to resist him; then she was too caught up in the magic of his touch to care if he hurt her or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was dead to the world when he finally got out of bed. He was late meeting Ramsey on the field—dawn had already come and gone—and after kissing Gillian on her forehead, he covered her with the plaid blanket and then quietly left the cottage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe training session went well in spite of the fact that he was in such a good mood. He really didn\u0027t want to hurt anyone. Ramsey did most of the damage and impressed the MacPherson boys in no time at all. Brodick did accidentally break the nose of one of the MacPherson soldiers with his elbow, but he snapped it back in place with his hand before the soldier could regain his feet and told him he\u0027d be as good as new once the bleeding stopped. It wasn\u0027t an apology, but it was damned close, and Brodick began to worry that marriage had already turned him into milk toast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey of course noticed his cheerful disposition. He took great delight in ribbing him about showing up late and yawning every other minute until Brodick seriously considered breaking one of Ramsey\u0027s bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the training session had begun, Proster, the leader of the faction, refused to use a weapon against the laird. He was being honorable, and foolish, for though he was vastly superior to the other MacPherson soldiers in skill and technique, he wasn\u0027t by any means Ramsey\u0027s equal. After his laird had knocked him to his knees a couple of times, Proster\u0027s cloak of arrogance began to shred. All of the other soldiers reached for their swords, thinking that would give them the advantage, but Proster still stubbornly refused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t really matter, though. Brodick and Ramsey quickly disarmed all of the soldiers, and then got down to the business of teaching them how to stay alive on the battlefield. It was a lesson in humility, and by the time the two lairds strolled off the field, the ground behind them was littered with groaning bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two friends went to the lake to wash the blood off them. They passed Bridgid on their way back. She greeted Ramsey with a curt nod, smiled at Brodick and wished him a good day, and then continued on with her head held high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that all about?\" Brodick asked. \"She seems irritated with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey laughed. \"That\u0027s an understatement. She\u0027s furious with me, but because I\u0027m her laird, she has to be civil. I think it must be killing her. Did you see the fire in her eyes? She\u0027s something else, isn\u0027t she? That smile of hers could make a man…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Brodick prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want her, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey didn\u0027t have to guard his words with his friend, and so he was bluntly honest. \"Sure I want her. Hell, she\u0027s a beautiful woman, and most of the men here want to bed her. God help the man she ends up with, though, for I swear she\u0027ll lead him a merry chase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to tell me what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, Ramsey admitted, \"I embarrassed Bridgid. The widow Marion wanted to warm my bed,\" he explained. \"Bridgid must have seen her going into my chamber and she went in after her. Honest to God, Brodick, I\u0027ve never seen such a temper in a woman before. Bridgid rivals you,\" he added. \"Poor Marion wanted to be discreet and had gone to considerable trouble making certain no one knew she was going to share my bed, and then Bridgid marched in there and made such a ruckus, all hell broke loose. Marion had already gotten undressed and was waiting in bed for me, and that shocked the hell out of Bridgid, and it also infuriated her. She thought I was being… duped. Will you stop laughing so I can finish this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Brodick said, though he didn\u0027t sound the least contrite. \"What happened then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bridgid dragged Marion out of bed, that\u0027s what happened. By the time I got upstairs, Marion was running down the back steps, screaming at the top of her lungs and only barely clothed. Fortunately the hall was almost empty and Father Laggan had already passed out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I slept alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick laughed again. \"No wonder you\u0027re in such a foul mood today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I am,\" he agreed. \"Bridgid seemed to think that I should have thanked her for saving me from Marion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, no, I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you explain that you had invited Marion to share your bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did, but that was a mistake. I\u0027m never going to understand women,\" he said, his voice bleak now. \"I swear Bridgid looked… wounded. I hurt her and I…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey shook his head. \"Bridgid is innocent and naive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you still want her in your bed, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t take virgins to my bed. I would never dishonor Bridgid in such a way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then marry her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that simple, Brodick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still getting pressured to marry one of the MacPhersons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meggan MacPherson,\" he countered. \"And I am still considering it. It would solve a lot of problems, and I have to do my duty as laird. I want their land and resources, and I also want peace. It seems the only way to get that is to join the clans by marriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this woman like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Admirable,\" he replied. \"She wants the best for her clan. She\u0027s strong and stubborn,\" he added. \"But she doesn\u0027t have Bridgid\u0027s…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will you decide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon,\" he replied. \"Enough talk about me,\" he added as he turned the conversation to what he considered a much more serious matter. \"Did Gillian give you the names of the Englishmen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the hell not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I forgot to ask,\" he admitted sheepishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncredulous, Ramsey stared at him for several seconds and then snapped, \"How could you forget?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doing what?\" Ramsey asked before he realized how foolish the question was. Now he sounded as naive as Bridgid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick glanced at him. \"What the hell do you think I was doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I wasn\u0027t,\" Ramsey replied drolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked along in silence, each lost in his own thoughts. Brodick had always been able to tell his friend whatever was on his mind, but he was hesitant now as he asked his advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marriage changes a man, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should ask Iain that question, not me. I\u0027ve never been married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re more astute about these matters than I am, and Iain\u0027s not here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matters of the heart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve only been married one day,\" Ramsey pointed out. \"What is it you\u0027re worried about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are. Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve just noticed…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Ramsey asked in exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m… cheerful, damn it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey laughed. Brodick didn\u0027t appreciate his friend\u0027s reaction. \"Look, forget I said anything. I\u0027m not used to talking about such…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never talk about what you\u0027re thinking or feeling. I shouldn\u0027t have laughed. Now tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just did,\" he growled. \"I mean it, I\u0027m cheerful, God help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is unusual,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I mean. I\u0027ve been married one day and marriage is already changing me. Gillian confuses me. I knew I wanted her, but I didn\u0027t know I\u0027d become so possessive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were possessive of her before you married her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, well, it\u0027s worse now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s your wife. It\u0027s probably just a natural inclination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s more than that. I want to take her home and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey cut him off. \"You can\u0027t, not yet. She\u0027s got to help me find the bastard who tried to kill my brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know she needs to stay here, but I still want to take her home, and if I could, I swear I\u0027d keep her under lock and key,\" he admitted, shaking his head over his own foolish thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she\u0027d be safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and also because I don\u0027t like other men…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Staring at her? She\u0027s a beautiful woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not the jealous sort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s turned my mind upside down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like a man in love with his wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lovesick men are weak men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if they were weak before they fell in love,\" Ramsey said. \"Iain loves his wife. Would you consider him weak?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it stands to reason that love doesn\u0027t make a man less than what he already is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes him vulnerable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps it does,\" Ramsey agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if his mind is constantly consumed with thoughts of her, then he becomes weak. Is that not so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey smiled. \"I\u0027ll tell you what is so. You love her, Brodick, and that scares the hell out of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have broken your nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the names first; then you can try. Are you certain that she\u0027ll tell you who they are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course she will. She\u0027s my wife, and she\u0027ll do whatever I tell her to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t use those exact words when you talk to her. Wives don\u0027t like being told what to do by their husbands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know Gillian,\" he said. \"She won\u0027t refuse me. I\u0027ll have the names of all the Englishmen by sundown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one was more surprised than Brodick when his sweet, she\u0027ll-do-whatever-I-tell-her-to-do wife refused to give him the names of the Englishmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstounded that she would deny him, he was at a loss as to what to do next. Gillian sat at the table with her hands folded in her lap, as calm as could be in the eye of his storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, no?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forgot to kiss me when you came inside. I think you should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forgot to kiss me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the love of…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hauled her to her feet, planted a hard kiss on her mouth, and then sat her back down again. \"You\u0027re going to tell me who those bastards in England are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she agreed, and then qualified her answer. \"Eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe refused to answer. She picked up her brush and ran it through her hair. Damn, she looked pretty tonight, he thought. She wore a flowing blue sleeping gown that delicately clung to her soft curves. Her cheeks were pink, her eyes were bright, and she smelled like roses. The woman was nearly irresistible. He glanced at the bed, then back at her before he realized where his thoughts were leading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was already way past sunset, and he still hadn\u0027t gotten the names from her, though in truth, he hadn\u0027t seen her since he\u0027d left at dawn, and he\u0027d been too busy until this minute to think about it. Now, however, he was determined to get what he wanted before they went to bed, and with that thought in mind, he said, \"A wife must do whatever her husband orders her to do.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-44.html","bookId":1843,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM"}
