Indeed, he’d already lost track of how long he’d been dodging. He did know that, at around the thirteen-minute mark, he’d begun using his lightning discipline. Thankfully the machine worked as the Bookworm assured – it was able to read and translate his discipline in to the simulation. Through that power he was able to inject his mecha and make it move the way it did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut really, it was a carefree and enjoyable experience to test one’s limits! He’d been involved in very many tests over the years, but in all of those he couldn’t recall one that went to the length this one did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands ached, but there was a competitive excitement in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a gift, and to him it seemed like there really was no difference in the simulation and the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, through the course of the test, he found himself to be stronger than he remembered after his recovery. Even his hand speed had improved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Test complete. Hand speed: ninety CPS [1. Commands Per Second.]. Total peak hand speed unknown. Peak hand speed for the first test: ninety CPS.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNinety?! I’ve reached ninety commands! Lan Jue stifled a gasp at the surprising results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been stuck at eighty-seven for six years. It wasn’t as though he hadn’t vigorously trained to change that in the past, but he hadn’t had many opportunities to train it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was hearing from the simulation that he’d reached that hurdle, and passed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s more, that may not even be his peak speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course Lan Jue was not aware that his mysterious increase in power was a result of the Silkworm Discipline that’d saved him. The power that had poured through him was enough not only to heal his ruined body, but improve it. Lan Jue was only starting to clearly see the benefits his troubled have reaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the simulator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSlap\u003c/em\u003e! The Bookworm viciously smacked the armrest of his chair with a wrinkled hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSu He, recently returned from checking on the comatose Accountant, jumped at the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The kid actually passed! Hmph! But we have more fun in store for him, and I doubt he’ll be able to handle it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the simulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Practical combat skill determination commencing. Please note, pilots will feel the simulation as they would in real life. Battles will continue until complete, or until the pilot sustained critical, life threatening damage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold mechanical voice hung in the small sim pod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractical combat, eh? Lan Jue’s eyes flashed with anticipation. He was excited to get started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Weapons selection.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral sorts of weapons, of many different styles and sorts, appeared before the silver mecha for selection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue picked up a spear with very little consideration necessary. He reached out for another, but they all vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beam of red light appeared in the distance. It was a mecha, ruby in color, that released a fiery red aura as it raced his way. This was a practical combat test, he recalled, not a competition. As such, there wouldn’t be any starting whistle or other outside indications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis simulated opponent bore a large sword, with a blade as red as the rest of the suit. In the span of a few breaths, he’d arrived before Lan Jue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver mecha braced itself by shifting its left foot back and bringing its spear up before it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe encroaching red light fell to earth. Lan Jue did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a flash the red light washed over him. It was startling, but left no damage. The Jewelry Master suddenly thrust his weapon straight upwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDink!\u003c/em\u003e The sound of impact rang out. The red mecha shivered, lost its balance and tumbled to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was clear now that the first appearance of the red mecha had been a mirage. The simulation was employing ghosting techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Silver mech moved the instant the red light flashed over him, shimmering with arcs of blue electricity. He was like a bullet, charging ferociously towards his enemy with spear outstretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red mecha, in response, swept its sword back once it got back to its feet. A fiery red aura sprung to life around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver mecha continued its approach. The suit’s forward motion was clear at the onset, but suddenly Lan Jue shifted, approaching obliquely. A flash, and then his direction changed again. He left a dazzling blue contrail in his wake, tracing his erratic advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spear flashed keenly in the Jewelry Master’s hand. The strange conical blue light that followed him vanished, as the silver mecha disappeared from view. Then, without warning, Lan Jue barreled headlong in to the red mecha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBooooom!\u003c/em\u003e The ensuing impact was so intense that it seemed the whole simulation shook. Lan Jue’s opponent was thrust to the ground like a sack of metal parts. The fire that surrounded it spread out in all directions. Lan Jue took the moment to recover his balance and, with a vicious swipe of his spear, obliterated the spot where the pilot’s cockpit would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBoooommmmm!\u003c/em\u003e Lan Jue’s unfortunate opponent exploded, with shrapnel flying every which way. The pieces dissolved in to disparate flashes of light, then vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his first opponent vanished in to oblivion, a second mecha appeared a distance away. This one was orange, and a sniper judging by the similarly-colored rifle it bore. A moment after appearing, a frighteningly fast orange light raced towards him. The orange mecha reappeared at Lan Jue’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver mecha vanished, as though it ceased to exist in the simulation. When he was spotted once again, he was floating in the air overhead. With a ferocious blast, the mech raced towards the orange attacker at impossible speeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was working. His power was flooding through the suit, forcing it to move at the speed of a lightning bolt!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orange suit was pretty quick itself, but whether from programming limitations or simply a failure of the suit, it couldn’t compete with Lan Jue’s speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following encounters between the two were brief, vicious, and in the end there was nothing left of the orange mecha but a pile of scrap metal. Arenas were really no place for a sniper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn no more time it took to tie his shoes, Lan Jue had defeated two challengers, both coded to be god-ranked. They were only just the beginning stages of God-ranked, though. Despite his apparent dominance, he knew that extended battles like this would really put a strain on his capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore importantly, though, it was also pushing him towards the peak of his prowess. The unbridled emulated combat, his hand speed… he lost himself in the moment. There was nothing else he need consider but for the obstacles before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result: two God-ranked challengers, defeated in less than five minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next enemy to reveal themselves was a yellow mecha. The moment the mecha appeared, Lan Jue knew it wasn’t like the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orange mecha hadn’t had time to completely employ its Discipline before Lan Jue put an end to it. This yellow one, though… it was smart enough to use it right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment it landed the ground beneath its feet became an earthen yellow [2. As an interesting aside, yellow is the color of earth in China. I assume, though I have no proof to back it up, it’s because the color of the soil – especially in the north – is a very pale tan, almost yellow. Compare this to, say, farming communities in the U.S. where healthy dirt is very dark.]. Immediately following, great boulders extricated themselves and rose of their own accord in to the air. Lan Jue stood in the midst of them and, as he looked on, the numerous crushing stones fell towards him from all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe yellow mecha blended well with the tempestuous boulders, disappearing among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarth Discipline! What’s more, even the topography bowed to the whim of this simulated enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question was, how would it manifest itself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver mecha rose in to the air amidst a shower of sparks and lightning. The boulders raced towards him and just as Lan Jue’s escape seemed impossible the sky suddenly became a deep, navy blue. From the cloudless sky, scores of angry lightning bolts crashed to earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arcing bolts of electricity blanketed the entire Arena. As they fell, they exploded against the levitating hunks of stone. The fractured pebbles were flung every which way, as the many earthen projectiles were obliterated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrength in the face of one’s enemies! This was Lan Jue’s creed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis enemy’s invisibility was too strong, his cover too wide. He decided to play upon the strength of his Discipline: to blanket the world in lightning!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder that terrifying anger from the heavens, and the cascading debris of burning rock – who could survive? His enemy had chosen to become his element. Lan Jue used his own to destroy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skies quieted abruptly, the shuddering roar of thunder peeling through the sky. Bits and pieces of the yellow mecha – most no bigger than a screw – tumbled to the ground in a shower of slag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue had no respite. Next came green, cyan, blue and purple mechas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue determined that they must also possess elemental powers. Notably the purple one, which bore a very rare Discipline: Darkness. Now, not only would Lan Jue have to contend with the inherent caustic properties of the Discipline, he’d also have to do it in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him ten minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven battles. Seven mechas. Seven heaps of scrap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScars and scraps dotted Lan Jue’s battered silver warrior. However, despite the damage it looked ready to take on another seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the sim pod, Lan Jue was soaked through with sweat. His eyes were bright as the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside of the sim pod, the bookworm clutched the armrest with a white-knuckled grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the simulation, sunlight flashed off of a silver mecha as it came to ground a distance from Lan Jue. It was slower than its predecessors, more dramatic. It gave Lan Jue a moment to catch his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue could sense that, after seven intense battles, his Discipline was strained. It was to be expected, since his enemies have all been God-ranked ninth-level adepts!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe purple mech he’d disposed of was ninth-level seventh rank Darkness adept. That was where he’d expected the majority of his energy. Where it not for his innate double Disciplines, for their combines power, he’d probably have lost long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow came the eighth. Judging by the exterior, this silver mecha looked a lot like his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue could instantly sense a danger about this one. It was a sensation he was familiar with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the former sequence was being upheld, then this time he’d be facing a Ninth-level Eighth-rank fighter. With his powers so diminished, how could he defend himself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ghost of a smile emerged on Lan Jue’s sweat-soaked face. He lifted his left hand from the keyboard, and slowly clenched his fingers in to a fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA halo of dim blue light slowly spread outward. The light wasn’t strong, and bore no intense aura. But there was something strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue’s eyes flashed a bluish-purple, and the light that surrounded his suit adopted the same hue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside of the sim pod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The hell is this? A \u003cem\u003ephylactery\u003c/em\u003e?” The Bookworm shook with impudent rage. He’d seen Lan Jue defeat the seven previous mechas. Seven of them, all God-ranked! And still he fought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis simulated opponent had unlimited energy to employ. A real adept had so such luxury! These fights had drained him immensely, and already Lan Jue was surprised he had more to give. How much longer could he hold out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-213\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-215\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-214","bookId":1509,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:07 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:07 AM"}
