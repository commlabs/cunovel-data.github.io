Lance laughed out loud. She gasped and struggled harder, but Lance lifted the book and continued to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bolt of lighting stretched across the sky,\" he exclaimed as if he himself had been struck with electricity. \"The horse leapt from the road, chasing the thunder, and before Isabella knew what was happening, she and the horse were gone, as if transported to another world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very nice, Lance,\" Julia said, finally prying his hand from her and straightening herself on the couch. She turned and planted her feet on the floor beside him. \"You get an A-plus. Now you can stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to stand, but he wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her nearly into his lap. \"Wait.\" Both arms were around her then, squeezing her tight. \"This is my favorite part,\" he whispered near her ear and read on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man in whose arms she lay seemed half angel and half demon, too strong and brave to be a mortal man. She looked up into his hard, gray eyes and felt herself shudder. He held her in strong arms that seeped warmth through her thin gown and brought her another, deeper kind of runaway emotion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance lowered the book and shifted her effortlessly against the arm of the couch. He stared into her with those same eyes, smiled with that same mouth, and said, \"I like your stuff, Veronica.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her there a moment too long. Then he shifted, and she felt his weight pressing down on her and realized how warm and soft a hard, strong man could be. \"Tell me, Ms. White, where do you get your ideas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it!\" Julia snapped, lunging for and grabbing the book, but she found herself sprawled across him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance twisted, trapping her beneath him on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would Isabella have done there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go!\" she cried, but the harder Julia fought to regain control of the situation, the wider Lance smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a pretty good workout,\" he said. \"You\u0027re cute when you\u0027re scrappy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair was as wild as the rest of her, and Julia literally couldn\u0027t see straight. She lay, tangled in a web of arms and legs, and said, \"You are enjoying this way too much!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You started it, Veronica.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call me that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey scrambled and tumbled to the floor, and as soon as Julia was able to right herself, she grabbed the book and scampered behind the sofa, using it as a barricade between them. \"Hey,\" Lance said. \"I was reading that.\" He climbed onto the sofa, so she stepped back, toward the kitchen, farther from his reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you were reading,\" she said. \"I heard you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, with more agility than Julia thought humanly possible, Lance sprang over the back of the sofa and plucked the book out of her hands. As he walked past her to his old place on the floor, he used the book to slap her on the butt. She jumped, but he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enonchalantly sunk to the floor and continued to read by firelight. After a long while, she saw a smirk rise on his lips, and without looking at her, he said, \"You are very talented, Veronica.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia couldn\u0027t get to her cell phone fast enough. \"Get your night-vision goggles ready,\" she said when Nina answered. \"We\u0027re going in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWAY #33: Utilize professional resources for professional tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing independent and happily single doesn\u0027t mean you have to do everything yourself; always know what is better left in the hands of a professional. And if you do decide to tackle your own project, take the time to research the task and acquire the tools that will enable you to work like a pro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—from 101 Ways to Cheat at Solitaire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m the lookout,\" Caroline said with more cheer than should ever belong in that sentence. It made Julia wonder if the James sisters, like the Jarfies brothers, had been cut out for a life of crime. The answer was obvious—no, probably not. Then she noticed the walkie-talkie that Caroline had duct-taped to her shoulder, and Julia reconsidered, deciding that there might be a little bandit blood in them after all. Steve was out of town on business, her daughter was asleep downstairs, her infant son dozed in the corner of the room, and Caroline was about to do the craziest thing she\u0027d done, maybe in her en-lire life. Julia studied her sister\u0027s face and realized it looked good on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how are we getting in?\" Lance asked for the hundredth time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNina dismissed him. \"I said I took care of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" Lance demanded, and Julia knew he wouldn\u0027t budge from that room until someone, evidently Nina, had laid out the plan in detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has these old tapestries,\" Nina said. \"Some of them are pretty valuable. She\u0027s called every design firm in town, wanting to sell them, so today I went by to give her an estimate. But what I was really doing was checking out the joint.\" Proudly, Nina tapped the notebook in front of her. \"When her hack was turned, I unlocked a window.\" She finished by raising her eyebrows a few times in quick succession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia looked between Caroline and Nina and made a mental note that it might be time to make new friends. I just hope I won\u0027t be doing it in prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Lance said. \"There\u0027s an open window. What else do we know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told her that the tapestries were valuable and asked how she had them protected. She didn\u0027t mention a security system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia recognized the squeamish look on Nina\u0027s face. \"What did she mention?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a sharp pinch to the fleshy part of Nina\u0027s arm to make her say \"pit bull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t have a dog,\" Caroline scoffed. \"I\u0027ve been watching that house for months and I\u0027ve never seen a dog.\"\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" Nina said, point proven. \"That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t bring it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline moved a box of wet wipes from the changing table and unrolled a set of detailed diagrams of the four house styles allowed in the development. She pulled out the floor plan for the smallest of the possible houses, the one the bankrupt contractor had chosen to build for his mother. It showed that the window Nina had unlocked was in the rear of the house, the \"keeping room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Caroline said as everyone gathered around. \"I\u0027m going to stay here and be central control.\" She used a turkey baster to point to the diagram as she carried on. \"I can only see into the formal living room, formal dining room, keeping room, and part of the kitchen. But I can keep an eye out for lights coming on and movement in the south side of the house. We have emergency exits here and here.\" She placed Candy Land game pieces on top of the locations of the pedestrian door in the garage and the French doors off the patio. \"Take this.\" She handed Nina the other walkie-talkie. \"If you see anything strange, radio back to base, and I\u0027ll tell you whether or not to abort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbort? Emergency exits? Central control? What\u0027s next, Julia wondered, code names and tubes of lipstick that double as rocket launchers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUndaunted, Caroline carried on. \"Nick wakes up to eat i lost nights about one-thirty. I\u0027ve never noticed any activity over there then, and judging from the number of whiskey bottles Myrtle hauls to the curb on recycling days, I think that\u0027s as good a time as any to go in.\" She paused to survey the troops. \"Does that sound okay?\" she asked. There were nods all around, so Caroline finished. \"Until then, we should consider ourselves in a holding pattern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, Julia found herself starting to relax. We\u0027ve got plan, she thought as she, Nina, and Lance shared \"this might actually work\" glances in the playroom. A feeling of cockiness was starting to build when the doorbell rang and, despite their cool bravado, all four of them nearly jumped through the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s with the getups?\" Jason asked, looking at Julia, Nina, and Caroline, who stood in the foyer, decked out in black. \"You look like rejects from mime academy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going clubbing,\" Nina coolly lied, ever the used-car salesman’s daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You three?\" Jason asked, eyebrows raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep,\" Caroline agreed. \"We\u0027re gonna pick up guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline had forgotten that she had the walkie-talkie taped to her shirt. Julia jumped and tried to stand in front of her, but Jason had already noticed and said, \"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby monitor,\" Julia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is it taped to you?\" Jason asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Babies are a lot of work, Jason,\" Julia snapped. \"Families are a lot of work. But you know that already. Isn\u0027t that why you told Nina you never want to have kids?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNina looked troubled, but Jason was unfazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just smirked and pointed to the walkie-talkie. \"Won\u0027t that get in the way of picking up guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\" Lance\u0027s voice carried down the staircase. \"I\u0027m already here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance strolled toward the door, looking strong and territorial. Julia thought her heart was going to pound out of her chest as a thought settled firmly in her mind: I actually know a man like this. He stopped ten feet from Jason, and Julia realized how Lance had survived as a kid, moving from town to town, living without a father. He was a good man and a great actor, and at that moment, he was acting like someone who would dearly love to beat the crap out of Jason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTestosterone bounced off the marble floors of the foyer as the two men sized each other up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Justin, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right. What brings you by?\" Lance asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for Tiny here,\" Jason said, and snapped his fingers in an annoying gesture that Julia had seen him do ever since the seventh grade. \"Got a couple of movie tickets. Thought she\u0027d want to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Lance said. \"What are you gonna see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason waved the question away. \"It doesn\u0027t really—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance cut him off. \"If you\u0027re asking the lady to a movie because you\u0027ve got an extra ticket, you ought to tell her what the movie is. So, Jason, what movie is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia\u0027s eyes darted back and forth, trying to understand this strange phenomenon; the bully was being bullied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see my wife. Nina, grab your purse,\" Jason said, i a king her arm and starting toward the door. \"Let\u0027s go for a drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" she cried. \"Stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance stepped toward the door, blocking Jason\u0027s path of escape, but Jason still had a firm grip on Nina\u0027s thin arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia stepped forward. \"Nina and I have plans tonight, Jason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason turned on her, twenty years\u0027 worth of anger seeping into his voice. \"Maybe Nina doesn\u0027t want to be your date tonight! Huh? Did you ever think of that, Julia? Tiny\u0027s got a man; she doesn\u0027t need to compensate for you not having one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call me Tiny,\" Nina said, sounding clearer and stronger than she\u0027d sounded in Jason\u0027s presence in years. \"I hate it!\" She cringed. \"I\u0027m telling you for the last time, don\u0027t ever call me Tiny!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Babe?\" Jason turned to her, laying on the charm. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t know—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you did,\" Nina said. Julia heard tears swelling in her best friend\u0027s voice. \"You know how it makes me feel. I\u0027m not helpless, Jason. Don\u0027t treat me like I am.\" She wiped her eyes, then said, \"I think you\u0027d better leave.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cheating-at-solitaire-cheating-at-solitaire-1/page-22.html","bookId":2751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:56 PM"}
