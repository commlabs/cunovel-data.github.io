The novel continues the adventures of Lyra Belacqua as she investigates the mysterious Dust phenomenon and searches for her father. Will Parry is introduced as a companion to Lyra, and together they explore the new realms to which they have both been introduced. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe book focuses more on the characters and their own individual plots, rather than just on Lyra\u0027s father, Lord Asriel, and his war against the Magisterium. It describes not only Lyra and Will\u0027s journey, but also the journeys of Lee Scoresby and Serafina Pekkala. In addition, Pullman alludes heavily to the study of dark matter (or \"Dust\") and particle physics to further establish his metaphysical saga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-subtle-knife-his-dark-materials-2.jpg","author":"Philip Pullman","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-subtle-knife-his-dark-materials-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:33 PM"}
