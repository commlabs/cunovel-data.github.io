That’s the way I came. My nocturnal vision’s pretty good, and then there’s this modern thing called a flashlight. I always have one with me,” he told her, offering a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t smile in return. Instead, she looked at him gravely. “Be careful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not the person anyone’s going to be after,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? Really? They all know you’re an agent. What if the killer’s afraid you’ll be snooping around and then he wants you out of the picture?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she wasn’t so naive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’m also a big guy who works out, has had training—and carries a big gun,” he said. “That does make me safer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm. All right, I’ll go along with that,” she conceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By tomorrow night I’ll see that you at least have some mace. Friday night, we’ll both do the camping trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Camping and Ping-Pong,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly. Ping-Pong is a great way to get to know the people who hang out at the Horse Farm. And camping will give me a glimpse of a lot more. If we’re going to find out who did this to Marcus Danby, we need to find out why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” she said. “That makes sense. Come on, I’ll walk you out back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia led him through the kitchen, the dining room, something that now seemed to be a family room and, finally, out the back door. She was polite and agreeable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make sure everything’s locked down tight,” he told her. “If someone’s determined to get in, they’ll figure out a way. But it’s best to make it as hard for them as possible. That gives you more time to call the cops or come up with an escape route yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will lock everything,” she promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the feeling that the minute he was gone, she’d be on the phone calling Malachi and asking him if the agent he’d sent was really capable of getting anything done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia had never been afraid in her own house before. Now it was inhabited by a ghost who appeared out of nowhere whenever he chose. And on top of that, she was worried that someone might try to break in while she was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was still early. She returned to the kitchen, ready to forage through the refrigerator for something to eat. Instead, she walked around downstairs and then upstairs, closing and locking windows. When she was done, she checked the front door again, followed by the back door—even though she’d just locked it behind Dustin Blake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing else to lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe returned to the kitchen once more only to freeze, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus was back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you very much. You made me look like an idiot,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had to see who it was and make a judgment call,” Marcus told her. “Besides, I’m pretty sure he knew I was here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve walked around the Horse Farm. I even waved my hands and tried to blow cold breath at people. They can’t see me. But this guy—I think he may be the real deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about? He didn’t tell me he saw you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t say he saw me. I said he knew I was around. I didn’t intend to be seen. Not yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?” Olivia demanded, annoyed with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had to be sure he’s the one,” Marcus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The one what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who could really help. I mean, if they’d just sent you a facts guy, we’d be in trouble. But I think he does believe you, and I know he can see and feel and sense what’s there—and what’s not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might have introduced yourself at the end, Marcus. And how will all these abilities actually make a difference? You weren’t killed by a ghost—were you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said. “Someone flesh-and-blood killed me. But...now I’m sorry I asked for help. I want the killer caught and the truth exposed, but I hadn’t—well, I hadn’t recognized the danger I was putting you in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Marcus was telling her she should be afraid, too!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” Marcus continued, “you have the agent here. He’ll investigate, and you just need to keep quiet from now on. If they say I fell back into drugs, let them say it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t it too late?” she asked him. “They’re already saying it. And move, please. You’re blocking the refrigerator.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t really block it,” he said, but he moved aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached in and brought out a head of lettuce, shaking it at him. “And quit appearing and disappearing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. I’d, um, give you a hand if I could. Since I can’t...I’m going to go prowl around the Horse Farm and see what I can learn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia set the lettuce on the cutting board and looked at him. She’d been about to warn him to be careful. She managed to refrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marcus, why do you think someone wanted you dead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s see. I wasn’t blackmailing anyone. I wasn’t sleeping with anyone’s wife. I wasn’t dealing drugs and I hadn’t robbed any banks. I’ll be damned if I know, Liv.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The property?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Horse Farm is nonprofit, and while the management remains in the hands of Aaron Bentley, there’s nothing to be gained by my death. Oh, well, there are specific bequests in the will, but nothing anyone would kill for. Anyway, I’m off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you coming back?” she asked him. “I’m so jumpy I actually wouldn’t mind having you around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep everything locked up, like the fed told you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But will you be back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. “Of course I’ll be back. I intend to watch out for you through the night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSammy whined and Marcus leaned down to pat his head. Olivia thought the dog couldn’t possibly feel his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet it was as if he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, just like Dustin Blake, he left through the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that Marcus didn’t have to open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin walked back to Willis House and entered his room by the private door. He put through a call to Malachi and told him he’d been to see Olivia and they’d talked about Marcus Danby. “Do you have anything more on the situation, or on Danby?” Dustin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing that would explain why anyone wanted the man dead. The property is really only worth anything with a functioning business, and the business only functions if the Horse Farm is successful. The land is valuable to an extent, but there are acreages of similar land if someone was looking to buy, and some of it’s for sale. I don’t think anyone’s crawling out of the man’s past—the Horse Farm isn’t a rehab facility, it’s a therapy center. On paper, there’s nothing our people have been able to find. How is Olivia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s fine. I’m sure she’s called you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not since you’ve been there,” Malachi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was asking about you coming out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to handle this delicately. If local law enforcement believes we’re trying to home in on their territory, it could get dicey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right. Well, as far as I know, law enforcement considers his death an open-and-shut case.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think your cousin has spoken to a ghost and that the ghost knows he was murdered,” Dustin said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tread carefully.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I intend to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And keep an eye on Liv for me, will you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll do my best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rang off. Dustin figured that since he hadn’t eaten, he might as well go to the diner again. He just might pick up something more than dinner there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was silent as he headed out. The other residents were either gone or in bed. He locked the door behind him, and as he did, he realized Coot was sitting in his usual rocker on the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, there, Coot,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Howdy. Nice night.” Dustin heard the sound of Coot’s rocker moving back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I’d go to the café for a bite to eat. Do you want to join me?” Dustin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought the old-timer would say no. To his surprise the rocker creaked and Coot stood up and walked over to him. “Sure. Be happy to go along. Thanks for the invite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d enjoy the company,” Dustin said, guessing there was more to be learned from the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We gonna drive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin nodded. It seemed like a simpler and safer alternative, with a possible killer skulking in the nearby woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoot knew which car was his and waited patiently at the passenger door for Dustin to open it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drive was short. Coot didn’t talk; he merely gazed out the window at the darkened landscape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelilah, who was waiting tables again, welcomed them both warmly. Her coffee was fresh, good and strong, and in a few minutes they ordered—the daily special, chicken potpie—and sat facing each other. The café’s only occupants when they came in were a family foursome that appeared to be parents and a girl of twelve or so and a boy of maybe ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelilah, of course, knew all about them. They were the Richardson family and they were driving to Nashville from Colorado; their daughter had won tickets to see the newest sensation on the Nashville charts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoot sipped his coffee and stared at Dustin while they waited for their meals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t look like you’re in any trouble to me,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not in trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thought you law guys hated it when they want you to see shrinks or go through therapy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I was ready for a respite. That’s about it,” Dustin responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoot shrugged and lowered his head, trying to hide a smile. Then he glanced up. “I know who you are,” he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-forever-krewe-of-hunters-11/page-13.html","bookId":2285,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:49:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:49:43 PM"}
