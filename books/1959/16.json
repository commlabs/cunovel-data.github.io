With unhurried ease, he bent forward and kissed her again, only this time his kiss was slow and tender, as slow and tender as the one before had been untamed and harsh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to taste you.\" The heat in his eyes and in his words caused her to shiver. His hands expertly parted her blouse, and when he discovered she wasn\u0027t wearing a bra, his eyes narrowed into blue slits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands cupped her breasts and lifted them until they\u0027d formed perfect rounds in his palms. Her nipples had tightened even before he began stroking them with his thumbs. Catherine went still, afraid even to breathe, her eyes half-closed as she dealt with the intense pleasure his hands brought her. His mouth followed, and she rolled her head back and moaned even before his mouth closed over her nipple. With her eyes slammed shut, she arched her back. The impact was so keen, so intense, she longed to cry out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll too soon his mouth returned to hers and she opened to him, greedily accepting what he was offering. Her hands slid along the curve of his back and up to the thickness of his mussed hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce\u0027s kisses were sweet and warm. Sweet and gentle; too gentle. He broke away completely and rubbed his face against the side of her jaw with a moist foray of nibbling kisses, working his way down her neckline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to make love to you,\" he whispered, then quickly amended. \"I need to make love to you, but damn it all, Catherine, I refuse to do it in the front seat of a car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith eyes still closed and her heart thundering like a Nebraska storm, she grinned. \"Any bed will do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re making this difficult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has it ever been easy for us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he growled, his hands continuing to caress her breasts. \"You make me feel seventeen all over again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the car, trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" He shifted his weight and groaned, the sound rich and masculine. \"I just hope the seamstress who sewed these pants took her job seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvoluntarily, Catherine\u0027s gaze dropped to the bulge in his loins. Against her better judgment she trailed her knuckles over it, feeling the heat even through the thickness of his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe temptation was so powerful that she had to force herself to look away. She sighed, her shoulders lifted several inches with the effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapping his arms around her, Royce pulled her toward him, until her back was cushioned by his chest. He leaned forward and slowly rotated his cheek over hers, nuzzling her ear with his nose. \"Tell me about your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine grinned, content for the first time since the mail had arrived. \"You\u0027d like her. She\u0027s wonderfully witty and intelligent. To look at her, you\u0027d never guess she\u0027s in her early fifties, almost everyone assumes she\u0027s at least ten years younger. The best part is that she\u0027s strikingly attractive and doesn\u0027t realize it. For the past fifteen years she\u0027s lived in San Francisco, and works at the corporate headquarters for this huge importing business. That\u0027s where she met Norman. He\u0027s a widower, and I swear he fell in love with Mom the minute they met. He\u0027s waited ten years for this day, and as much as I love my father, I can\u0027t begrudge Mom and Norman any happiness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds like mother and daughter are a good deal alike.\" Royce murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine had to think on that a moment. \"Yes, I suppose that\u0027s true...I just never thought much about it.\" Catherine hesitated, then added, \"She loved my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loves,\" he corrected gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loves,\" Catherine agreed softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re close?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always. She\u0027s incredible. If you meet her and still think we\u0027re alike, then it would be the greatest compliment anyone could ever give me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re incredible,\" he whispered, playfully nuzzling her neck. His arms were tightly wrapped around her middle, and she felt as though she were in the most secure place in all the worldâ€” in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce\u0027s loving arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContent, Catherine smiled, folded her arms over his and closed her eyes. \"What are we going to do, Royce?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the harsh sigh work its way across his chest. It was a question she was sure he\u0027d asked himself a hundred times. One that had hounded them both for weeks, and they were no closer now to a solution than they had been before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I knew.\" It went without saying that if they continued in this vein they were both going to be booted out of the Navy. \"I never thought I\u0027d be jealous of my own daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of Kelly?\" Catherine didn\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of Kelly.\" His grip around her middle tightened. \"She, at least, can spend the night with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine grinned and nestled back in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you think I felt learning that you sleep in a little slip of lace that\u0027s all see-through on top?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She told you that?\" Catherine asked, twisting around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! Is it true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce groaned. \"You could have lied...I wish you had lied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she also tell you I sleep on ivory-colored satin sheets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she was merciful enough to skip over that part,\" he growled in her ear. \"Oh, sweet heaven, it feels so good to hold you in my arms. I could get drunk on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine was equally content, although she was likely to suffer in the morning. The console was digging into her hip, but it was a small price to pay for the pleasure of being in Royce\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to be all right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I don\u0027t know what came over me. Obviously I have a lot of unresolved feelings for my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get so philosophical. Your mother is letting go of an important part of your lives together. It\u0027s only natural for you to feel a certain amount of regret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a lot more than regret in that raging storm of tears that overtook her, but Royce didn\u0027t know that. Catherine had yet to fully comprehend the blitz of feelings herself. Her emotions were hopelessly tangled. But it didn\u0027t matter, she could face anything or anyone as long as Royce was by her side, as long as the man she loved would hold her tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orders Royce received to conduct an under way inspection aboard the USS Venture, a small service craft used by the base, seemed like a godsend. Royce needed time away from Bangor, and from Catherine. The time away was essential to his peace of mind. Three days aboard the Venture would help him gain some perspective on what was happening between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hundred times he\u0027d told himself to stay away from her. They were playing with a lit stick of dynamite. The fact they were both doing it with their eyes wide open frustrated him even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce had done everything he knew to get her out of his mind. He\u0027d ignored her, pretended she didn\u0027t exist. When it came to dealing with her at the office, he made her a faceless name and tried to react to her that way. He\u0027d had women under his command before without there ever being so much as a hint of a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe difficulty was it didn\u0027t work. Royce couldn\u0027t ignore Catherine any more than he could jump over the moon. It was a physical impossibility. He couldn\u0027t look at her, even in the most impersonal way, and not hunger for the taste of her. It went without saying that a single taste would never satisfy him, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe knew it. He had to feel her, had to run his hands down the soft curving slopes of her body and experience for himself her ready response to his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome mornings he walked into the office and with one glance at her he\u0027d been forced to knot his hands at his sides just to keep from reaching for her. The ache would start then and last all day and sometimes long into the night. Was it any wonder his men had come up with a few choice names for him while he was in his present state of mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe physical frustration was killing him, and as far as Royce could tell it was going to get a hell of a lot worse before it got better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when Royce was foolish enough to believe he had everything under control, she\u0027d called him, weeping in the middle of the night. If he hadn\u0027t been so starved for her, he might have been able to handle the situation differently. But the moment he\u0027d heard her weep, the urge to take her in his arms and comfort her had been overwhelming. Already it was happening. What he swore never would. He arranged for them to meet in some out-of-the-way place where no one was likely to see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce justified the meeting, remembering how she\u0027d been there for him when Kelly was in the hospital. Helping her deal with the fact her mother was going to remarry was returning the kindness, nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo further vindicate his actions, he\u0027d convinced himself that he\u0027d have done the same thing for anyone under his command. That might be true, but he doubted that he\u0027d meet them at the end of a long dirt road. Nor would he hold and kiss them the way he did Catherine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that night forward, matters had only gotten worse. Royce could feel his control slipping even more than before. Twice he found himself looking for excuses to call her into his office just so he could hear the sound of her voice. It was coming to the point that she was able to maintain protocol much better than he was. A bad sign. A very bad sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly wasn\u0027t helping matters any. If having to deal with Catherine at the office wasn\u0027t bad enough, Kelly talked about her constantly. The kid was crazy about Catherine and had been from the moment they\u0027d met. At first Royce was convinced it was the fingernails, but gradually, in a slow and painful process, he\u0027d come to realize how badly Kelly needed a mother figure. Why she chose Catherine and not Missy\u0027s mom or any of the mothers of her friends, Royce had yet to understand. Instead she\u0027d chosen the one woman who was driving Royce slowly out of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis assignment aboard the Venture was exactly what he needed. Time away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce was packing his bag when Kelly wandered into the bedroom. She plopped herself down on the edge of the mattress and sighed as though she were being abandoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long are you going to be gone?\" Royce had told her no less than four times, but she continued to ask anyway. \"Three days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly had wanted to spend the time with Catherine, but it made more sense for her to stay with Missy\u0027s family since the two girls were in the same class at school. Kelly hadn\u0027t been overly thrilled, but she hadn\u0027t argued. At least not any more than she usually did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you get back, can we go for pizza?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Royce agreed, glancing up long enough to smile at her. He didn\u0027t know why she asked, they always went out to eat when he arrived home from an assignment. It had become tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang, and Kelly leaped off the bed as though she\u0027d received an electric shock. Even though Royce was less than three feet away, she screamed at the top of her voice, \"I\u0027ll get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInserting his little finger in his ear, Royce cleared the passageway and resumed packing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly appeared a minute or so later. \"It\u0027s for you,\" she said, sounding disappointed. \"It sounds like Captain Garland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce nodded. \"Tell him I\u0027ll be right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce finished tucking his socks into the comer of the bag and then went down the hallway. Kelly handed him the phone and leaned against the wall and waited until he\u0027d finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversation with his commanding officer didn\u0027t last more than a couple of minutes. But each one of those minutes might as well have been a lifetime as far as Royce was concerned. What was it that was said about the best laid plans? He didn\u0027t know. Hell he didn\u0027t know much of anything anymore. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-woman-navy-4/page-16.html","bookId":1959,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:25 AM"}
