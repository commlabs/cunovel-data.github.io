Take the knife, pick up the FedEx envelope, and-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom door opened. “Harry?” she said. “What on earth is-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she saw Keller. Looked right at him, saw his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny second now she’d scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s his heart,” Keller cried. “Come here, you’ve got to help me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t get it, but there was Harry on the floor, and here was this nice-looking fellow in a suit, moving toward her, saying things about CPR and ambulance services, speaking reassuringly in a low and level voice. She didn’t quite get it, but she didn’t scream, either, and in no time at all Keller was close enough to get a hand on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t part of the deal, but she was there, and she couldn’t have stayed in the bathroom where she belonged, oh no, not her, the silly bitch, she had to go and open the door, and she’d seen his face, and that was that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boning knife, washed clean of blood, wiped clean of prints, went into a storm drain a mile or two from the hotel. The FedEx mailer, torn in half and in half again, went into a trash can at the airport. The Tempo went back to Hertz, and Keller, paying cash, went on American to Chicago. He had a long late lunch at a surprisingly good restaurant in O’Hare Airport, then bought a ticket on a United flight that would put him down at La Guardia well after rush-hour traffic had subsided. He killed time in a cocktail lounge with a window from which you could watch takeoffs and landings. Keller did that for a while, sipping an Australian lager, and then he shifted his attention to the television set, where Oprah Winfrey was talking with six dwarfs. The volume was set inaudibly low, which was probably just as well. Now and then the camera panned the audience, which seemed to contain a disproportionate number of small people. Keller watched, fascinated, and refused to make any Snow White jokes, not even to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered if it was a mistake to go back to New York the same day. What would Andria think?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, he’d told her his business might not take him long. Besides, what difference did it make what she thought?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had another Australian lager and watched some more planes take off. On the plane he drank coffee and ate the two little packets of peanuts. Back at La Guardia he stopped at the first phone and called White Plains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was fast,” Dot said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Piece of cake,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught a cab, told the driver to take the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge, and coached him on how to find it. At his apartment, he rang the bell a couple of times before using his key. Nelson and Andria were out. Perhaps they’d been out all day, he thought. Perhaps he’d gone to St. Louis and killed two people while the girl and his dog had been engaged in a single endless walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made himself a sandwich and turned on the television set. Channel hopping, he wound up transfixed by an offering of sports collectibles on one of the home shopping channels. Balls, bats, helmets, caps, shirts, all of them autographed by athletes and accompanied by certificates of authenticity, the certificates themselves suitable for framing. Cubic zirconium for guys, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you hear the wordsblue chip, ” the host was saying, “what are you thinking? I’ll tell you what I’m thinking. I’m thinking Mickey Mantle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller wasn’t sure what he thought of when he heard the wordsblue chip, but he was pretty sure it wasn’t Mickey Mantle. He was working on that one when Nelson came bounding into the room, with Andria behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I heard the TV,” she said, “my first thought was I must have left it on, but I never even turned it on in the first place, so how could that be? And then I thought maybe there was a break-in, but why would a burglar turn on the television set? They don’t watch them, they steal them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should have called from the airport,” Keller said. “I didn’t think of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened? Was your flight canceled?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I made the trip,” he said. “But the business hardly took me any time at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow,” she said. “Well, Nelson and I had our usual outstanding time. He’s such a pleasure to walk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s well behaved,” Keller agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not just that. He’s enthusiastic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what you mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He feels so good about everything,” she said, “that you feel good being with him. And he really takes an interest. I took him along when I went to water the plants and feed the fish at this apartment on Park Avenue. The people are in Sardinia. Have you ever been there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Neither have I, but I’d like to go sometime. Wouldn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never thought about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway, you should have seen Nelson staring at the aquarium, watching the fish swim back and forth. If you ever want to get one, I’d help you set it up. But I would recommend that you stick with freshwater. Those saltwater tanks are a real headache to maintain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll remember that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bent over to pet the dog, then straightened up. She said, “Can I ask you something? Is it all right if I stay here tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. I more or less figured you would.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I wasn’t sure, and it’s a little late to make other arrangements. But I thought you might want to be alone after your trip and-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t gone that long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure it’s all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched television together, drinking cups of hot chocolate that Andria made. When the program ended Keller took Nelson for a late walk. “Do you really want a fish tank?” he asked the dog. “If I can have a television set, I suppose you ought to be able to have a fish tank. But would you watch it after the first week or so? Or would you get bored with it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the thing about dogs, he thought. They didn’t get bored the way people did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a couple of blocks he found himself talking to Nelson about what had happened in St. Louis. “They didn’t say anything about a woman,” he said. “I bet she wasn’t registered. I don’t think she was his wife, so I guess she wasn’t officially there. That’s why he sent her to the bathroom before he opened the door, and why he didn’t want to open the door in the first place. If she’d stayed in the bathroom another minute-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut suppose she had? She’d have been screaming her head off before Keller was out of the hotel, and she’d have been able to give a certain amount of information to the police. How the killer had gained access to the room, for a starter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as well things had gone the way they did, he decided. But it still rankled. They hadn’t said anything at all about a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one bathroom. Andria used it first. Keller heard the shower running, then nothing until she emerged wearing a generally shapeless garment of pink flannel that covered her from her neck to her ankles. Her toenails were painted, Keller noticed, each a different color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller showered and put on a robe. Andria was on the sofa, reading a magazine. They said goodnight and he clucked to Nelson, and the dog followed him into the bedroom. When he closed the door the dog made that sound again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shucked the robe, got into bed, patted the bed at his side. Nelson stayed where he was, right in front of the door, and he repeated that sound in his throat, making it the least bit more insistent this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to go out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNelson wagged his tail, which Keller had to figure for a yes. He opened the door and the dog went into the other room. He closed the door and got back into bed, trying to decide if he was jealous. It struck him that he might not only be jealous of the girl, because Nelson wanted to be with her instead of with him, but he might as easily be jealous of the dog, because he got to sleep with Andria and Keller didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle pink toes, each with the nail painted a different color…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still sorting it out when the door opened and the dog trotted in. “He wants to be with you,” Andria said, and she drew the door shut before Keller could frame a response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut did he? The animal didn’t seem to know what he wanted. He sprang onto Keller’s bed, turned around once, twice, and then leaped onto the floor and went over to the door. He made that noise again, but this time it sounded plaintive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller got up and opened the door. Nelson moved into the doorway, half in and half out of the room. Keller leaned into the doorway himself and said, “I think the closed door bothers him. Suppose I leave it open?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the door ajar and went back to bed. Nelson seized the opportunity and went on into the living room. Moments later he was back in the bedroom. Moments after that he was on his way to the living room. Why, Keller wondered, was the dog behaving like an expectant father in a maternity ward waiting room? What was all this back-and-forth business about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller closed his eyes, feeling as far from sleep as he was from Sardinia. Why, he wondered, did Andria want to go there? For the sardines? Then she could stop at Corsica for a corset, and head on to Elba for the macaroni. And Malta for the falcons, and Crete for the cretins, and-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was just getting drifty when the dog came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nelson,” he said, “what the hell’s the matter with you? Huh?” He reached down and scratched the dog behind an ear. “You’re a good boy,” he said. “Oh yes, you’re a good boy, but you’re nuts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knock on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up in bed. It was Andria, of course, and the door was open; she had knocked to get his attention. “He just can’t decide who he wants to be with,” she said. “Maybe I should just pack my things and go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said. He didn’t want her to go. “No, don’t go,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then maybe I should stay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came on into the room. She had turned on a lamp in the living room before she came in, but the back lighting was not revealing. The pink flannel thing was opaque, and Keller couldn’t tell anything about her body. Then, in a single motion, she drew the garment over her head and cast it aside, and now he could tell everything about her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a feeling this is a big mistake,” she said, “but I don’t care. I just don’t care. Do you know what I mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know exactly what you mean,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward he said, “Now I suppose you’ll think I put the dog up to it. I wish I could take the credit, but I swear it was all his idea. He was like that donkey in the logic problem, unable to decide between the two bales of hay. Where did he go, I wonder?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t say anything, and he looked closely and saw that she was crying. Jesus, had he said something to upset her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “ Andria? Is something wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up and crossed her arms beneath her breasts. “I’m just scared,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of me?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-man-keller-1/page-18.html","bookId":2312,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM"}
