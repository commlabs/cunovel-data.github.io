This is a test of your mind and your heart; meager metal weapons will play no part. Magic is the true power of our people!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt accepted the berating without reply. He knew that the traits this young mage was boasting of were also neces-sary qualities of a true fighter. Physical attributes played only a minor role in Drizzt\u0027s style of battle. Strong will and calculated maneuvers, everything the mage apparently be-lieved only wizards could handle, won the duels that Drizzt fought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will show you many marvels in the next few months\" the mage went on, \"artifacts beyond your belief and spells of a power beyond your experience!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I know your name?\" Drizzt asked, trying to sound somewhat impressed by the student\u0027s continued stream of self-glorification. Drizzt had already learned quite a lot about wizardry from Zaknafein, mostly of the weaknesses inherent in the class. Because of magic\u0027s usefulness in situa-tions other than battle; drow wizards were accorded a high position in the society, second to the clerics of Lloth. It was a wizard, after all, who lighted the glowing Narbondel, time clock of the city, and wizards who lighted faerie fires on the sculptures of the decorated houses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZaknafein had little respect for wizards. They could kill quickly and from a distance, he had warned Drizzt, but if one could get in close to them, they had little defense against a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Masoj\" replied the mage. \"Masoj Hun\u0027ett of House Hun\u0027ett, beginning my thirtieth and final year of study. Soon I will be recognized as a full wizard of Menzoberranzan, with all of the privileges accorded my station\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greetings, then, Masoj Hun\u0027ett\" Drizzt replied. \"I, too, have but a year remaining in my training at the Academy, for a fighter spends only ten years\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lesser talent\" Masoj was quick to remark. \"Wizards study thirty years before they are even considered practiced enough to go out and perform their craft\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Drizzt accepted the insult graciously. He wanted to get this phase of his instruction over with, then finish out the year and be rid of the Academy altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt found his six months under Masoj\u0027s tutelage actu-ally the best of his stay at the Academy. Not that he came to care for Masoj; the budding wizard constantly sought ways to remind Drizzt of fighters\u0027 inferiority. Drizzt sensed a competition between himself and Masoj, almost as if the mage were setting him up for some future conflict. The young fighter shrugged his way through it, as he always had, and tried to get as much out of the lessons as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt found that he was quite proficient in the ways of magic. Every drow, the fighters included, possessed a de-gree of magical talent and certain innate abilities. Even drow children could conjure a globe of darkness or edge their opponents in a glowing outline pf harmless colored flames. Drizzt handled these tasks easily, and in a few weeks, he could manage several cantrips and a few lesser spells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the innate magical talents of the dark elves also came a resistance to magical attacks, and that is where Zaknafein had recognized the wizards\u0027 greatest weakness. A wizard could cast his most powerful spell to perfection, but if his in-tended victim was a drow elf, the wizard may well have found no results for his efforts. The surety of a well-aimed sword thrust always impressed Zaknafein, and Drizzt, after witnessing the drawbacks of drow magic during those first weeks with Masoj, began to appreciate the course of train-ing he had been given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still found great enjoyment in many of the things Masoj showed him, particularly the enchanted items housed in the tower of Sorcere. Drizzt held wands and staves of incredi-ble power and went through several attack routines with a sword so heavily enchanted that his hands tingled from its touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasoj, too, watched Drizzt carefully through it all, study-ing the young warrior\u0027s every move, searching for some weakness that he might exploit if House Hun\u0027ett and House Do\u0027Urden ever did fall into the expected conflict. Several times, Masoj saw an opportunity to eliminate Drizzt, and he felt in his heart that it would be a prudent move. Matron SiNafay\u0027s instructions to him, though, had been explicit and unbending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasoj\u0027s mother had secretly arranged for him to be Drizzt\u0027s tutor. This was not an unusual situation; instruction for fighters during their six months in Sorcere was always handled one-on-one by higher-level Sorcere students. When she had told Masoj of the setup, SiNafay quickly reminded him that his sessions with the young Do\u0027Urden remained no more than a scouting mission. He was not to do anything that might even hint of the planned conflict between the two houses. Masoj was not fool enough to disobey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, there was one other wizard lurking in the shadows, who was so desperate that even the warnings of the matron mother did little to deter him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My student, Masoj, has informed me of your fine prog-ress\" Alton DeVir said to Drizzt one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Master Faceless One\" Drizzt replied hesi-tantly, more than a little intimidated that a master of Sor-cere had invited him to a private audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you perceive magic, young warrior?\" Alton asked. \"Has Masoj impressed you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt didn\u0027t know how to respond. 1ruly, magic had not impressed him as a profession, but he did not want to insult a master of the craft. \"I find the art beyond my abilities\" he said tactfully. \"For others, it seems a powerful course, but i believe my talents are more closely linked to the sword\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could your weapons defeat one of magical power?\" AI. ton snarled. He quickly bit back the sneer, trying not to tip off his intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt shrugged. \"Each has its place in battle\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who could say which is the mightier? As with every combat, it would depend upon the individuals engaged\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what of yourself?\" Alton teased. \"First in your class, I have heard, year after year. \u0027The masters of Melee-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagthere speak highly of your talents\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Drizzt found himself flushed with embarrassment. More than that, though, he was curious as to why a master and student of Sorcere seemed to know so much about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you stand against one of magical powers?\" asked Alton. \"Against a master of Sorcere, perhaps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not-\" Drizzt began, but Alton was too enmeshed in his own ranting to hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us learn!\" the Faceless One cried. He drew out a thin wand and promptly loosed a bolt of lightning at Drizzt. Drizzt was down into a dive before the wand even dis-charged. The lightning bolt sundered the door to Alton\u0027s highest chamber and bounced about the adjoining room, breaking items and scorching the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt came rolling back to his feet at the side of the room, his scimitars drawn and ready. He still was unsure of this master\u0027s intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many can you dodge?\" Alton teased, waving the wand in a threatening circle. \"What of the other spells I have at my disposal-those that attack the mind, not the body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt tried to understand the purpose of this lesson and the part he was meant to play in it. Was he supposed to at-tack this master?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are not practice blades\" he warned, holding his weapons out toward Alton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother bolt roared in, forcing Drizzt to dodge back to his original position. \"Does this seem like practice to you, fool-ish Do\u0027Urden?\" Alton growled. \"Do you know who I am?\" Alton\u0027s time of revenge had come-damn the orders of Matron SiNafay!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Alton was about to reveal the truth to Drizzt, a dark form slammed into the master\u0027s back, knocking him to the floor. He tried to squirm away but found himself help-lessly pinned by a huge black panther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt lowered the tips of his blades; he was at a loss to understand any of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough, Guenhwyvar!\" came a call from behind Alton. Looking past the fallen master and the cat, Drizzt saw Masoj enter the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe panther sprang away from Alton obediently and moved to rejoin its master. It paused on its way, to consider Drizzt, who stood ready in the middle of the room. So enchanted was Drizzt with the beast, the graceful flow of its rippling muscles and the intelligence in its saucer eyes, that he paid little attention to the master who had just at-tacked him, though Alton, unhurt, was back to his feet and obviously upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My pet\" Masoj explained. Drizzt watched in amazement as Masoj dismissed the cat back to its own plane of existence by sending its corporeal form back into the magical onyx statuette he held in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you get such a companion?\" Drizzt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never underestimate the powers of magic\" Masoj re-plied, dropping the figurine into a deep pocket. His beaming smile became a scowl as he looked to Alton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt, too, glanced at the faceless master. That a stu-dent had dared to attack a master seemed impossibly odd to the young fighter. This situation grew more puzzling each minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlton knew that he had overstepped his bounds, and that he would have to pay a high price for his foolishness if he could not find some way out of this predicament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you learned your lesson this day?\" Masoj asked Drizzt, though Alton realized that the question was also di-rected his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt shook his head. \"I am not certain of the point of all this\" he answered honestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A display of the weakness of magic\" Masoj explained, trying to disguise the truth of the encounter, \"to show you the disadvantage caused by the necessary intensity of a casting wizard; to show you the vulnerability of a mage obsessed-\" he eyed Alton directly at this point-\"with spellcasting. The complete vulnerability when a wizard\u0027s intended prey becomes his overriding concern\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt recognized the lie for what it was, but he could not understand the motives behind this day\u0027s events. Why would a master of Sorcere attack him so? Why would Ma-soj, still just a student, risk so much to come to his defense?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us bother the master no more\" Masoj said, hoping to deflect Drizzt\u0027s curiosity further. \"Come with me now to our practice hall. 1 will show you more of Guenhwyvar, my magical pet\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt looked to Alton, wondering what the unpredicta-ble master would do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do go\" Alton said calmly, knowing the facade Masoj had begun would be his only w~y around the wrath of his adopted matron mother. \"I am confident that this day\u0027s les-son was learned\" he said, his eyes on Masoj.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt glanced back to Masoj, then back to Alton again. He let it go at that. He wanted to learn more of Guen-hwyvar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Masoj had Drizzt back in the privacy of the tutor\u0027s own room, he took out the polished onyx figurine in the form of a panther and called Guenhwyvar back to his side. The mage breathed easier after he had introduced Drizzt to the cat, for Drizzt spoke no more about the incident with Alton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever before had Drizzt encountered such a wonderful magical item. He sensed a strength in Guenhwyvar, a dignity, that belied the beast\u0027s enchanted nature. lruly, the cat\u0027s sleek muscles and graceful moves epitomized the hunting qualities drow elves so dearly desired. Just by watching Guenhwyvar\u0027s movements, Drizzt believed, he could im-prove his own techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasoj let them play together and spar together for hours, grateful that Guenhwyvar could help him smooth over any damage that foolish Alton had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt had already put his meeting with the faceless mon-ter far behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matron SiNafay would not understand\" Masoj warned Alton when they were alone later that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will tell her\" Alton reasoned matter-of-factly. So frus-trated was he with his failure to kill Drizzt that he hardly cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasoj shook his head. \"She need not know\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA suspicious smile found its way across Alton\u0027s disfigured face. \"What do you want?\" he asked coyly. \"Your tenure here is almost at its end. What more might a master do for Masoj?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\" Masoj replied. \"I want nothing from you\" \"Then why?\" Alton demanded. \"I desire no debts follow. ing my paths. This incident is to be done with here and nowl\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is done\" Masoj replied. Alton didn\u0027t seem convinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could I gain from telling Matron SiNafay of your foolish actions?\" Masoj reasoned. \"Likely, she would kill you, and then the coming war with House Do\u0027Urden would have no basis. You are the link we need to justify the attack. I desire this battle; I\u0027ll not risk it for the little pleasure I might find in your tortured demise\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was foolish\" Alton admitted, more somberly. \"I had not planned to kill Drizzt when I summoned him here, just to watch him and learn of him, so that I might savor more when the time to kill him finally arrived. Seeing him before me, though, seeing a cursed Do\u0027Urden standing unpro-tected before me . . . !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand\" said Masoj sincerely. \"I have had those same feelings when looking upon that one\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no grudge against House Do\u0027Urden\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the house\" Masoj explained, \"that one! I have watched him for nearly a decade, studied his movements and his attitudes\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like not what you see?\" Alton asked, a hopeful tone in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He does not belong\" Masoj replied grimly. \"After six months by his side, I feel I know him less now than I ever did. He displays no ambition, yet has emerged victorious from his class\u0027s grand melee nine years in a row. It\u0027s unprecedented! His grasp of magic is strong; he could have been a wizard, a very powerful wizard, if he had chosen that course of study\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasoj clenched his fist, searching for the words to convey his true emotions about Drizzt. \"It is all too easy for him\" he snarled. \"There is no sacrifice in Drizzt\u0027s actions, no scars for the great gains he makes in his chosen profession\" \"He is gifted\" Alton remarked, \"but he trains as hard as any I have ever seen, by all accounts\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is not the problem\" Masoj groaned in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something less tangible about Drizzt Do\u0027Urden\u0027s character that truly irked the young Hun\u0027ett. He couldn\u0027t recognize it now, because he had never witnessed it in any dark elf before, and because it was so very foreign to his own makeup. What bothered Masoj-and many other stu-dents and masters-was the fact that Drizzt excelled in all the fighting skills the drow elves most treasured but hadn\u0027t given up his passion in return. Drizzt had not paid the price that the rest of the drow children were made to sacrifice long before they had even entered the Academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not important\" Masoj said after several fruitless minutes of contemplation. \"I will learn more of the young Do\u0027Urden in time\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His tutelage under you was finished, I had thought\" said Alton. \"He goes to Arach- Tinilith for the final six months of his training-quite inaccessible to you\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both graduate after those six months\" Masoj explained. \"We will share our indenture time in the patrol forces together\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many will share that time\" Alton reminded him. \"Dozens of groups patrol the corridors of the region. You may never even see Drizzt in all the years of your term\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already have arranged for us to serve in the same group\" replied Masoj. He reached into his pocket and pro-duced the onyx figurine of the magical panther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mutual agreement between yourself and the young Do\u0027Urden\" Alton reasoned with a complimentary smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It appears that Drizzt has become quite fond of my pet\" Masoj chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tho fond?\" Alton warned. \"You should watch your back for scimitars\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasoj laughed aloud. \"Perhaps our friend, Do\u0027Urden, should watch his back for panther claws!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-elf-trilogy-homeland-the-dark-elf-trilogy-1/page-16.html","bookId":1517,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:40:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:40:17 AM"}
