Just so long as I take it easy on the curves so you don’t wind up on the floor, you’ll be perfectly willing to sit there and listen as long as I want to talk. Won’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I played golf,” he said, “I’d be out on the course every day, and I wouldn’t have to burn up a tankful of gas driving around the desert. I’d spend all my time within the Sundowner walls, and I wouldn’t have been walking around the mall, wouldn’t have seen you in the display next to the cash register. A batch of different breeds on sale, and I’m not sure what you’re supposed to be, but I guess you’re some kind of terrier. They’re good dogs, terriers. Feisty, lots of personality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I used to have an Australian cattle dog. I called him Nelson. Well, that was his name before I got him, and I didn’t see any reason to change it. I don’t think I’ll give you a name. I mean, it’s nutty enough, buying a stuffed animal, taking it for a ride and having a conversation with it. It’s not as if you’re going to answer to a name, or as if I’ll relate to you on a deeper level if I hang a name on you. I mean, I may be crazy, but I’m not stupid. I realize I’m talking to polyester and foam rubber, or whatever the hell you’re made out of. Made in China, it says on the tag. That’s another thing, everything’s made in China or Indonesia or the Philippines, nothing’s made in America anymore. It’s not that I’m paranoid about it, it’s not that I’m worried about all the jobs going overseas. What do I care, anyway? It’s not affecting my work. As far as I know, nobody’s flying in hired killers from Thailand and Korea to take jobs away from good homegrown American hit men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just that you have to wonder what people in this country are doing. If they’re not making anything, if everything’s imported from someplace else, what the hell do Americans do when they get to the office?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe talked for a while more, then drove around some in silence, then resumed the one-sided conversation. Eventually he found his way back to Sundowner Estates, circling the compound and entering by the southwestern gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHi, Mr. Miller. Hello, Harry. Hey, whatcha got there? Cute little fella, isn’t he? A present for my sister’s little girl, my niece. I’ll ship it to her tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hell with that. Before he got to the guard shack, he reached into the backseat for a newspaper and spread it over the stuffed dog in the passenger seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the clubhouse bar, Keller listened sympathetically as a fellow named Monty went over his round of golf, stroke by stroke. “What kills me,” Monty said, “is that I just can’t put it all together. Like on the seventh hole this afternoon, my drive’s smack down the middle of the fairway, and my second shot with a three iron is hole high and just off the edge of the green on the right. I’m not in the bunker, I’m past it, and I’ve got a good lie maybe ten, twelve feet from the edge of the green.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice,” Keller said, his voice carefully neutral. If it wasn’t nice, Monty could assume he was being ironic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very nice,” Monty agreed, “and I’m lying two, and all I have to do is run it up reasonably close and sink the putt for a par. I could use a wedge, but why screw around? It’s easier to take this little chipping iron I carry and run it up close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I run it up close, all right, and it doesn’t miss the cup by more than two inches, but I played it too strong, and it picks up speed and rolls past the pin and all the way off the green, and I wind up farther from the cup than when I started.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell of a thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I chip again, and pass the hole again, though not quite as badly. And by the time I’m done hacking away with my goddam putter I’m three strokes over par with a seven. Takes me two strokes to cover four hundred and forty yards and five more strokes to manage the last fifty feet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s golf,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By God, you said a mouthful,” Monty said. “That’s golf, all right. How about another round of these, Dave, and then we’ll get ourselves some dinner? There’re a couple of guys you ought to meet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wound up at a table with four other fellows. Monty and a man named Felix were residents of Sundowner Estates, while the other two men were Felix’s guests, seasonal residents of Scottsdale who belonged to one of the other local country clubs. Felix told a long joke, involving a hapless golfer driven to suicide by a bad round of golf. For the punch line, Felix held his wrists together and said, “What time?” and everybody roared. They all ordered steaks and drank beer and talked about golf and politics and how screwed-up the stock market was these days, and Keller managed to keep up his end of the conversation without anybody seeming to notice that he didn’t know what the hell he was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So how’d you do out there today?” someone asked him, and Keller had his reply all ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know,” he said thoughtfully, “it’s a hell of a thing. You can hack away like a man trying to beat a ball to death with a stick, and then you hit one shot that’s so sweet and true that it makes you feel good about the whole day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t even remember when or where he’d heard that, but it evidently rang true with his dinner companions. They all nodded solemnly, and then someone changed the subject and said something disparaging about Democrats, and it was Keller’s turn to nod in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we’ll go out tomorrow morning,” Monty said to Felix. “Dave, if you want to join us…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller pressed his wrists together, said, “What time?” When the laughter died down he said, “I wish I could, Monty. I’m afraid tomorrow’s out. Another time, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could take a lesson,” Dot said. “Isn’t there a club pro? Doesn’t he give lessons?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is,” he said, “and I suppose he does, but why would I want to take one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you could get out there and play golf. Protective coloration and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If anyone sees me swinging a golf club,” he said, “with or without a lesson, they’ll wonder what the hell I’m doing here. But this way they just figure I fit in a round earlier in the day. Anyway, I don’t want to spend too much time around the clubhouse. Mostly I get the hell out of here and go for drives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the driving range?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Out in the desert,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just ride around and look at the cactus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a lot of it to look at,” he said, “although they have a problem with poachers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re kidding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said, and explained how the cacti were protected, but criminals dug them up and sold them to florists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cactus rustlers,” Dot said. “That’s the damnedest thing I ever heard of. I guess they have to be careful of the spines.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Serve them right if they get stuck. You just drive around, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And think things out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s nice. But you don’t want to lose sight of the reason you moved in there in the first place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides,” she said, “I miss you. I got this phone call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was sort of weird. Well, atypical, anyway. I don’t know who it was from, or why he called.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe it was a wrong number.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it wasn’t that. The hell with it. If you were here we could talk about it, but not over the phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stayed away from the clubhouse the next day, and the day after. Then, on a Tuesday afternoon, he got in his car and drove around, staying within the friendly confines of Sundowner. He passed the Lattimore house and wondered if Mitzi Prentice had shown it to anyone lately. He drove past William Egmont’s house, which looked to be pretty much the same model as the Sundstrom place. Egmont’s Cadillac was parked in the carport, but the man owned his own golf cart, and Keller couldn’t see it there. He’d probably motored over to the first tee on his cart, and might be out there now, taking big divots, slicing balls deep into the rough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller went home, parked his Toyota in the Sundstrom carport. He’d worried, after taking the house for two weeks, that Mitzi would call all the time, or, worse, start turning up without calling first. But in fact he hadn’t heard a word from her, for which he’d been deeply grateful, and now he found himself thinking about calling her, at work or at home, and figuring out a place to meet. Not at his place, because of the masks, and not at her place, because of her daughter, and-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat settled it. If he was starting to think like that, well, it was time he got on with it. Or the next thing you knew he’d be taking golf lessons, and buying the Lattimore house, and trading in the stuffed dog for a real one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went outside. The afternoon had already begun fading into early evening, and it seemed to Keller that the darkness came quicker here than it did in New York. That stood to reason, it was a good deal closer to the equator, and that would account for it. Someone had explained why to him once, and he’d understood it at the time, but now all that remained was the fact: the farther you were from the equator, the more extended twilight became.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any event, the golfers were through for the day. He took a walk along the edge of the golf course, and passed Egmont’s house. The car was still there, and the golf cart was not. He walked on for a while, then turned around and headed toward the house again, coming from the other direction, and saw someone gliding along on a motorized golf cart. Was it Egmont, on his way home? No, as the cart came closer he saw that the rider was thinner than Keller’s quarry, and had a fuller head of hair. And the cart turned off before it reached Egmont’s house, which pretty much cinched things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, he was soon to discover, Egmont had already returned. His cart was parked in the carport, alongside his car, and the bag of golf clubs was slung over the back of the cart. Something about that last touch reminded Keller of a song, though he couldn’t pin down the song or figure out how it hooked up to the golf cart. Something mournful, something with bagpipes, but Keller couldn’t put his finger on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were lights on in Egmont’s house. Was he alone? Had he brought someone home with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne easy way to find out. He walked up the path to the front door, poked the doorbell. He heard it ring, then didn’t hear anything and considered ringing it again. First he tried the door, and found it locked, which was no great surprise, and then he heard footsteps, but just barely, as if someone was walking lightly on deep carpet. And then the door opened a few inches until the chain stopped it, and William Wallis Egmont looked out at him, a puzzled expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Egmont?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-parade-keller-3/page-16.html","bookId":2314,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:32 PM"}
