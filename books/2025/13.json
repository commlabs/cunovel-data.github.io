But I did foresee that you would be more difficult if I surprised you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were walking to the car after school, and I was completely clueless as to what she was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In English?\" I requested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be a baby about this. No tantrums.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I\u0027m scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re - I mean we\u0027re - having a graduation party. It\u0027s no big thing. Nothing to freak out over. But I saw that you would freak out if I tried to make it a surprise party\" - she danced out of the way as Edward reached over to muss her hair - \"and Edward said I had to tell you. But it\u0027s nothing. Promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed heavily. \"Is there any point in arguing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Alice. I\u0027ll be there. And I\u0027ll hate every minute of it. Promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the spirit! By the way, I love my gift. You shouldn\u0027t have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice, I didn\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know that. But you will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI racked my brains in panic, trying to remember what I\u0027d ever decided to get her for graduation that she might have seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amazing,\" Edward muttered. \"How can someone so tiny be so annoying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice laughed. \"It\u0027s a talent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t you have waited a few weeks to tell me about this?\" I asked petulantly. \"Now I\u0027ll just be stressed that much longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice frowned at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,\" she said slowly. \"Do you know what day it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes. \"Yes. It is Monday . . . the fourth.\" She grabbed my elbow, spun me halfway around, and pointed toward a big yellow poster taped to the gym door. There, in sharp black letters, was the date of graduation. Exactly one week from today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the fourth? Of June? Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither one answered. Alice just shook her head sadly, feigning disappointment, and Edward\u0027s eyebrows lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can\u0027t be! How did that happen?\" I tried to count backwards in my head, but I couldn\u0027t figure out where the days had gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like someone had kicked my legs out from under me. The weeks of stress, of worry . . . somehow in the middle of all my obsessing over the time, my time had disappeared. My space for sorting through it all, for making plans, had vanished. I was out of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I wasn\u0027t ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know how to do this. How to say goodbye to Charlie and Ren��e . . . to Jacob . . . to being human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew exactly what I wanted, but I was suddenly terrified of getting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn theory, I was anxious, even eager to trade mortality for immortality. After all, it was the key to staying with Edward forever. And then there was the fact that I was being hunted by known and unknown parties. I\u0027d rather not sit around, helpless and delicious, waiting for one of them to catch up with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn theory, that all made sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice . . . being human was all I knew. The future beyond that was a big, dark abyss that I couldn\u0027t know until I leaped into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis simple knowledge, today\u0027s date - which was so obvious that I must have been subconsciously repressing it - made the deadline I\u0027d been impatiently counting down toward feel like a date with the firing squad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a vague way, I was aware of Edward holding the car door for me, of Alice chattering from the backseat, of the rain hammering against the windshield. Edward seemed to realize I was only there in body; he didn\u0027t try to pull me out of my abstraction. Or maybe he did, and I was past noticing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ended up at my house, where Edward led me to the sofa and pulled me down next to him. I stared out the window, into the liquid gray haze, and tried to find where my resolve had gone. Why was I panicking now? I\u0027d known the deadline was coming. Why should it frighten me that it was here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know how long he let me stare out the window in silence. But the rain was disappearing into darkness when it was finally too much for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his cold hands on either side of my face and fixed his golden eyes on mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you please tell me what you are thinking? Before I go mad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could I say to him? That I was a coward? I searched for words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your lips are white. Talk, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exhaled in a big gust. How long had I been holding my breath?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The date took me off guard,\" I whispered. \"That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, his face full of worry and skepticism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to explain. \"I\u0027m not sure what to do . . . what to tell Charlie . . . what to say . . . how to . . .\" My voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t about the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"No. But thanks for reminding me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain was louder as he read my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not ready,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am,\" I lied immediately, a reflex reaction. I could tell he saw through it, so I took a deep breath, and told the truth. \"I have to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to be anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel the panic surfacing in my eyes as I mouthed the reasons. \"Victoria, Jane, Caius, whoever was in my room . . . !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the more reason to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t make any sense, Edward!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed his hands more tightly to my face and spoke with slow deliberation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella. Not one of us had a choice. You\u0027ve seen what it\u0027s done . . . to Rosalie especially. We\u0027ve all struggled, trying to reconcile ourselves with something we had no control over. I won\u0027t let it be that way for you. You will have a choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already made my choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t going through with this because a sword is hanging over your head. We will take care of the problems, and I will take care of you,\" he vowed. \"When we\u0027re through it, and there is nothing forcing your hand, then you can decide to join me, if you still want to. But not because you\u0027re afraid. You won\u0027t be forced into this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carlisle promised,\" I mumbled, contrary out of habit. \"After graduation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until you\u0027re ready,\" he said in a sure voice. \"And definitely not while you feel threatened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. I didn\u0027t have it in me to argue; I couldn\u0027t seem to find my commitment at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There.\" He kissed my forehead. \"Nothing to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed a shaky laugh. \"Nothing but impending doom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still watching my face, waiting for me to relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I ask you something?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, biting my lip, and then asked a different question than the one I was worried about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I getting Alice for graduation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snickered. \"It looked like you were getting us both concert tickets -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right!\" I was so relieved, I almost smiled. \"The concert in Tacoma. I saw an ad in the paper last week, and I thought it would be something you\u0027d like, since you said it was a good CD.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a great idea. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope it\u0027s not sold out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the thought that counts. I ought to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something else you meant to ask,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"You\u0027re good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have lots of practice reading your face. Ask me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and leaned into him, hiding my face against his chest. \"You don\u0027t want me to be a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t,\" he said softly, and then he waited for more. \"That\u0027s not a question,\" he prompted after a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well . . . I was worrying about . . . why you feel that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worrying?\" He picked out the word with surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you tell me why? The whole truth, not sparing my feelings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated for a minute. \"If I answer your question, will you then explain your question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, my face still hidden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath before he answered. \"You could do so much better, Bella. I know that you believe I have a soul, but I\u0027m not entirely convinced on that point, and to risk yours . . .\" He shook his head slowly. \"For me to allow this - to let you become what I am just so that I\u0027ll never have to lose you - is the most selfish act I can imagine. I want it more than anything, for myself. But for you, I want so much more. Giving in - it feels criminal. It\u0027s the most selfish thing I\u0027ll ever do, even if I live forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there were any way for me to become human for you - no matter what the price was, I would pay it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat very still, absorbing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward thought he was being selfish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the smile slowly spread across my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So . . . it\u0027s not that you\u0027re afraid you won\u0027t . . . like me as much when I\u0027m different - when I\u0027m not soft and warm and I don\u0027t smell the same? You really do want to keep me, no matter how I turn out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhaled sharply. \"You were worried I wouldn\u0027t like you?\" he demanded. Then, before I could answer, he was laughing. \"Bella, for a fairly intuitive person, you can be so obtuse!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew he would think it silly, but I was relieved. If he really wanted me, I could get through the rest . . . somehow. Selfish suddenly seemed like a beautiful word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you realize how much easier it will be for me, Bella,\" he said, the echo of his humor still there in his voice, \"when I don\u0027t have to concentrate all the time on not killing you. Certainly, there are things I\u0027ll miss. This for one . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared into my eyes as he stroked my cheek, and I felt the blood rush up to color my skin. He laughed gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the sound of your heart,\" he continued, more serious but still smiling a little. \"It\u0027s the most significant sound in my world. I\u0027m so attuned to it now, I swear I could pick it out from miles away. But neither of these things matter. This,\" he said, taking my face in his hands. \"You. That\u0027s what I\u0027m keeping. You\u0027ll always be my Bella, you\u0027ll just be a little more durable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and let my eyes close in contentment, resting there in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now will you answer a question for me? The whole truth, not sparing my feelings?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" I answered at once, my eyes opening wide with surprise. What would he want to know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke the words slowly. \"You don\u0027t want to be my wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart stopped, and then broke into a sprint. A cold sweat dewed on the back of my neck and my hands turned to ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, watching and listening to my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not a question,\" I finally whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down, his lashes casting long shadows across his cheekbones, and dropped his hands from my face to pick up my frozen left hand. He played with my fingers while he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was worrying about why you felt that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to swallow. \"That\u0027s not a question, either,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The truth?\" I asked, only mouthing the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I can take it, whatever it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. \"You\u0027re going to laugh at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flashed up to mine, shocked. \"Laugh? I cannot imagine that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll see,\" I muttered, and then I sighed. My face went from white to scarlet in a sudden blaze of chagrin. \"Okay, fine! I\u0027m sure this will sound like some big joke to you, but really! It\u0027s just so . . . so . . . so embarrassing!\" I confessed, and I hid my face against his chest again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not following you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head back and glared at him, embarrassment making me lash out, belligerent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not that girl, Edward. The one who gets married right out of high school like some small-town hick who got knocked up by her boyfriend! Do you know what people would think? Do you realize what century this is? People don\u0027t just get married at eighteen! Not smart people, not responsible, mature people! I wasn\u0027t going to be that girl! That\u0027s not who I am. . . .\" I trailed off, losing steam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s face was impossible to read as he thought through my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all?\" he finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"Isn\u0027t that enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that you were . . . more eager for immortality itself than for just me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, though I\u0027d predicted that he would laugh, I was suddenly the one having hysterics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward!\" I gasped out between the paroxysms of giggles. \"And here . . . I always . . . thought that . . . you were . . . so much . . . smarter than me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took me in his arms, and I could feel that he was laughing with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward,\" I said, managing to speak more clearly with a little effort, \"there\u0027s no point to forever without you. I wouldn\u0027t want one day without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s a relief,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still . . . it doesn\u0027t change anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nice to understand, though. And I do understand your perspective, Bella, truly I do. But I\u0027d like it very much if you\u0027d try to consider mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d sobered up by then, so I nodded and struggled to keep the frown off my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis liquid gold eyes turned hypnotic as they held mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see, Bella, I was always that boy. In my world, I was already a man. I wasn\u0027t looking for love - no, I was far too eager to be a soldier for that; I thought of nothing but the idealized glory of the war that they were selling prospective draftees then - but if I had found . . .\" He paused, cocking his head to the side. \"I was going to say if I had found someone, but that won\u0027t do. If I had found you, there isn\u0027t a doubt in my mind how I would have proceeded. I was that boy, who would have - as soon as I discovered that you were what I was looking for - gotten down on one knee and endeavored to secure your hand. I would have wanted you for eternity, even when the word didn\u0027t have quite the same connotations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled his crooked smile at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him with my eyes frozen wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breathe, Bella,\" he reminded me, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you see my side, Bella, even a little bit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for one second, I could. I saw myself in a long skirt and a high-necked lace blouse with my hair piled up on my head. I saw Edward looking dashing in a light suit with a bouquet of wildflowers in his hand, sitting beside me on a porch swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and swallowed. I was just having Anne of Green Gables flashbacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing is, Edward,\" I said in a shaky voice, avoiding the question, \"in my mind, marriage and eternity are not mutually exclusive or mutually inclusive concepts. And since we\u0027re living in my world for the moment, maybe we should go with the times, if you know what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But on the other hand,\" he countered, \"you will soon be leaving time behind you altogether. So why should the transitory customs of one local culture affect the decision so much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pursed my lips. \"When in Rome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed at me. \"You don\u0027t have to say yes or no today, Bella. It\u0027s good to understand both sides, though, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So your condition . . . ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is still in effect. I do see your point, Bella, but if you want me to change you myself. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dum, dum, dah-dum,\" I hummed under my breath. I was going for the wedding march, but it sort of sounded like a dirge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime continued to move too fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night flew by dreamlessly, and then it was morning and graduation was staring me in the face. I had a pile of studying to do for my finals that I knew I wouldn\u0027t get halfway through in the few days I had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I came down for breakfast, Charlie was already gone. He\u0027d left the paper on the table, and that reminded me that I had some shopping to do. I hoped the ad for the concert was still running; I needed the phone number to get the stupid tickets. It didn\u0027t seem like much of a gift now that all the surprise was gone. Of course, trying to surprise Alice wasn\u0027t the brightest plan to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meant to flip right back to the entertainment section, but the thick black headline caught my attention. I felt a thrill of fear as I leaned closer to read the front-page story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEATTLE TERRORIZED BY SLAYINGS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s been less than a decade since the city of Seattle was the hunting ground for the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history. Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer, was convicted of the murders of 48 women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now a beleaguered Seattle must face the possibility that it could be harboring an even more horrifying monster at this very moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police are not calling the recent rash of homicides and disappearances the work of a serial killer. Not yet, at least. They are reluctant to believe so much carnage could be the work of one individual. This killer - if, in fact, it is one person - would then be responsible for 39 linked homicides and disappearances within the last three months alone. In comparison, Ridgway\u0027s 48- count murder spree was scattered over a 21-year period. If these deaths can be linked to one man, then this is the most violent rampage of serial murder in American history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police are leaning instead toward the theory that gang activity is involved. This theory is supported by the sheer number of victims, and by the fact that there seems to be no pattern in the choice of victims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Jack the Ripper to Ted Bundy, the targets of serial killings are usually connected by similarities in age, gender, race, or a combination of the three. The victims of this crime wave range in age from 15-year-old honor student Amanda Reed, to 67-year-old retired postman Omar Jenks. The linked deaths include a nearly even 18 women and 21 men. The victims are racially diverse: Caucasians, African Americans, Hispanics and Asians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe selection appears random. The motive seems to be killing for no other reason than to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why even consider the idea of a serial killer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are enough similarities in the modus operandi to rule out unrelated crimes. Every victim discovered has been burned to the extent that dental records were necessary for identification. The use of some kind of accelerant, like gasoline or alcohol, seems to be indicated in the conflagrations; however, no traces of any accelerant have yet been found. All of the bodies have been carelessly dumped with no attempt at concealment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore gruesome yet, most of the remains show evidence of brutal violence - bones crushed and snapped by some kind of tremendous pressure - which medical examiners believe occurred before the time of death, though these conclusions are difficult to be sure of, considering the state of the evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother similarity that points to the possibility of a serial: every crime is perfectly clean of evidence, aside from the remains themselves. Not a fingerprint, not a tire tread mark nor a foreign hair is left behind. There have been no sightings of any suspect in the disappearances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there are the disappearances themselves - hardly low profile by any means. None of the victims are what could be viewed as easy targets. None are runaways or the homeless, who vanish so easily and are seldom reported missing. Victims have vanished from their homes, from a fourth- story apartment, from a health club, from a wedding reception. Perhaps the most astounding: 30- year-old amateur boxer Robert Walsh entered a movie theater with a date; a few minutes into the movie, the woman realized that he was not in his seat. His body was found only three hours later when fire fighters were called to the scene of a burning trash Dumpster, twenty miles away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pattern is present in the slayings: all of the victims disappeared at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the most alarming pattern? Acceleration. Six of the homicides were committed in the first month, 11 in the second. Twenty-two have occurred in the last 10 days alone. And the police are no closer to finding the responsible party than they were after the first charred body was discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evidence is conflicting, the pieces horrifying. A vicious new gang or a wildly active serial killer? Or something else the police haven\u0027t yet conceived of?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one conclusion is indisputable: something hideous is stalking Seattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me three tries to read the last sentence, and I realized the problem was my shaking hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFocused as I was, Edward\u0027s voice, though quiet and not totally unexpected, made me gasp and whirl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was leaning in the doorway, his eyebrows pulled together. Then he was suddenly at my side, taking my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I startle you? I\u0027m sorry. I did knock. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" I said quickly. \"Have you seen this?\" I pointed to the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frown creased his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hadn\u0027t seen today\u0027s news yet. But I knew it was getting worse. We\u0027re going to have to do something . . . quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t like that. I hated any of them taking chances, and whatever or whoever was in Seattle was truly beginning to frighten me. But the idea of the Volturi coming was just as scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does Alice say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the problem.\" His frown hardened. \"She can\u0027t see anything . . . though we\u0027ve made up our minds half a dozen times to check it out. She\u0027s starting to lose confidence. She feels like she\u0027s missing too much these days, that something\u0027s wrong. That maybe her vision is slipping away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes were wide. \"Can that happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows? No one\u0027s ever done a study . . . but I really doubt it. These things tend to intensify over time. Look at Aro and Jane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Self-fulfilling prophecy, I think. We keep waiting for Alice to see something so we can go . . . and she doesn\u0027t see anything because we won\u0027t really go until she does. So she can\u0027t see us there. Maybe we\u0027ll have to do it blind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have a strong desire to attend class today? We\u0027re only a couple of days from finals; they won\u0027t be giving us anything new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I can live without school for a day. What are we doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to talk to Jasper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper, again. It was strange. In the Cullen family, Jasper was always a little on the fringe, part of things but never the center of them. It was my unspoken assumption that he was only there for Alice. I had the sense that he would follow Alice anywhere, but that this lifestyle was not his first choice. The fact that he was less committed to it than the others was probably why he had more difficulty keeping it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt any rate, I\u0027d never seen Edward feel dependent on Jasper. I wondered again what he\u0027d meant about Jasper\u0027s expertise. I really didn\u0027t know much about Jasper\u0027s history, just that he had come from somewhere in the south before Alice found him. For some reason, Edward had always shied away from any questions about his newest brother. And I\u0027d always been too intimidated by the tall, blond vampire who looked like a brooding movie star to ask him outright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got to the house, we found Carlisle, Esme, and Jasper watching the news intently, though the sound was so low that it was unintelligible to me. Alice was perched on the bottom step of the grand staircase, her face in her hands and her expression discouraged. As we walked in, Emmett ambled through the kitchen door, seeming perfectly at ease. Nothing ever bothered Emmett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Edward. Ditching, Bella?\" He grinned at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both are,\" Edward reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett laughed. \"Yes, but it\u0027s her first time through high school. She might miss something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward rolled his eyes, but otherwise ignored his favorite brother. He tossed the paper to Carlisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see that they\u0027re considering a serial killer now?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle sighed. \"They\u0027ve had two specialists debating that possibility on CNN all morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t let this go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go now,\" Emmett said with sudden enthusiasm. \"I\u0027m dead bored.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hiss echoed down the stairway from upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s such a pessimist,\" Emmett muttered to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward agreed with Emmett. \"We\u0027ll have to go sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie appeared at the top of the stairs and descended slowly. Her face was smooth, expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle was shaking his head. \"I\u0027m concerned. We\u0027ve never involved ourselves in this kind of thing before. It\u0027s not our business. We aren\u0027t the Volturi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want the Volturi to have to come here,\" Edward said. \"It gives us so much less reaction time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And all those innocent humans in Seattle,\" Esme murmured. \"It\u0027s not right to let them die this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Carlisle sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Edward said sharply, turning his head slightly to look at Jasper. \"I didn\u0027t think of that. I see. You\u0027re right, that has to be it. Well, that changes everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t the only one who stared at him in confusion, but I might have been the only one who didn\u0027t look slightly annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027d better explain to the others,\" Edward said to Jasper. \"What could be the purpose of this?\" Edward started to pace, staring at the floor, lost in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t seen her get up, but Alice was there beside me. \"What is he rambling about?\" she asked Jasper. \"What are you thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper didn\u0027t seem to enjoy the spotlight. He hesitated, reading every face in the circle - for everyone had moved in to hear what he would say - and then his eyes paused on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re confused,\" he said to me, his deep voice very quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no question in his assumption. Jasper knew what I was feeling, what everyone was feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re all confused,\" Emmett grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can afford the time to be patient,\" Jasper told him. \"Bella should understand this, too. She\u0027s one of us now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words took me by surprise. As little as I\u0027d had to do with Jasper, especially since my last birthday when he\u0027d tried to kill me, I hadn\u0027t realize that he thought of me that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much do you know about me, Bella?\" Jasper asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett sighed theatrically, and plopped down on the couch to wait with exaggerated impatience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper stared at Edward, who looked up to meet his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Edward answered his thought. \"I\u0027m sure you can understand why I haven\u0027t told her that story. But I suppose she needs to hear it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper nodded thoughtfully, and then started to roll up the arm of his ivory sweater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched, curious and confused, trying to figure out what he was doing. He held his wrist under the edge of the lampshade beside him, close to the light of the naked bulb, and traced his finger across a raised crescent mark on the pale skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a minute to understand why the shape looked strangely familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I breathed as realization hit. \"Jasper, you have a scar exactly like mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held out my hand, the silvery crescent more prominent against my cream skin than against his alabaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper smiled faintly. \"I have a lot of scars like yours, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper\u0027s face was unreadable as he pushed the sleeve of his thin sweater higher up his arm. At first my eyes could not make sense of the texture that was layered thickly across the skin. Curved half-moons crisscrossed in a feathery pattern that was only visible, white on white as it was, because the bright glow of the lamp beside him threw the slightly raised design into relief, with shallow shadows outlining the shapes. And then I grasped that the pattern was made of individual crescents like the one on his wrist . . . the one on my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at my own small, solitary scar - and remembered how I\u0027d received it. I stared at the shape of James\u0027s teeth, embossed forever on my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I gasped, staring up at him. \"Jasper, what happened to you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-13.html","bookId":2025,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM"}
