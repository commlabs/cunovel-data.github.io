Now I\u0027m lying spoon-style with a guy I\u0027m not even remotely interested in. In fact, I know he likes my cousin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do I get myself into these situations in the first place? This sleeping bag is way too small for the two of us. And I\u0027m painfully aware my mongo boobs are pressed against O\u0027dead\u0027s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing my eyes, I pray sleep will come fast. But now that I can\u0027t see, my other senses are heightened. Like the sound of the fire crackling, the crickets chirping. Like the masculine, musky scent of Avi lingering on his pillow. Like hoping my nipples aren\u0027t poking O\u0027dead\u0027s back because it\u0027s so damn cold outside. It\u0027s all keeping me awake, which gives me a great idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait five minutes before I start snoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I\u0027m up, but I have to make it sound authentic. I make sure my mouth is close to O\u0027dead\u0027s ear before I start. First, I make this long, slow snoring sound that doesn\u0027t really sound like a snore at all, but loud breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping my eyes closed, I breathe in loudly and exhale with the back of my tongue vibrating against the roof of my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO\u0027dead shifts, probably attempting to wake me up. Only I\u0027m not really sleeping so it doesn\u0027t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snore a little louder, and this time add a little nose and extra back-throat noises with just the right touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continue this for a few minutes, ignoring his fidgeting and restless moving around in the sleeping bag made for one-and-a-half. In fact, I should be up for an academy award for this performance. Some would say it\u0027s not nice to trick people. But listen, sleep is more important than anything. And if 1 don\u0027t get enough sleep, I\u0027m going to be crabbier than I usually am come morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy breath. Exhale loudly. Nose and back-throat combo. Exhale softer. Nose only. Exhale loudly. Heavy breath. Exhale normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m mixing up the order so it sounds authentic. Genius, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe finale is coming. I know it, but nobody else does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy breath. Exhale softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere it comes ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleep apnea-type choke as loud as possible. Exhale normal. I know how to do this because Marc snores. Mom minks I can\u0027t tell when he sleeps over because he leaves at five in the morning or something like that. The guy sounds louder than a train wreck. I wonder how Mom can stand it; it keeps me up half the night and my room is way down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do another one of those obnoxious apnea-type snorts and sure enough O\u0027dead starts wiggling out of the sleeping bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMission accomplished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear O\u0027dead walk away and I squeeze one eye open to spy on him. I know he\u0027s going to ask Snotty to sleep in her sleeping bag. Ha! I am so sneaky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as my one eyeball scans the area inconspicuously, I get a weird feeling someone\u0027s watching me. Then I realize why I feel that way. Avis looking straight at me, and he gives me this I-know-you\u0027re-a-faker look with those depth-less, brown eyes of his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s getting to be a real pain in my ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a harrumph, quickly shut my eye and go back to pretending I\u0027m sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf humans were meant to be in water, we would have been born with fins .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squint to the sound of my cousin\u0027s voice and the early morning sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sleeping,\" I say, then shut my eyes and turn over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can sleep later,\" Snotty says. \"We\u0027re leaving in five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moan, because as I stated earlier I\u0027m not a morning person. Heck, sometimes I\u0027m not even a day person. I turn back around and squint my eyes open again as I look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought this camping thing was supposed to be a vacation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, so ...why wake up before you have to?\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnotty crouches down and whips the pillow out from under my head. Which, by the way, slams down on the rock beneath it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch!\" I yell. \"Give that back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she\u0027s not listening to me because my dear cousin\u0027s back is facing me as she walks away. With, I might add, my pillow under her smelly armpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so it\u0027s not exactly my pillow. But it was last night and it was really fluffy and soft and smelled really comforting. I know that\u0027s probably not possible. That\u0027s just how it felt to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly, I get up and head over to the Jeep where the rest of the gang is hanging out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too early,\" I say in a moaning, groggy voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody answers me, they\u0027re all packing up their stuff. And they\u0027re all dressed. What is it with these people, getting up and dressed at the crack of dawn?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready to go,\" Avi says to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my arms wide, showing him my pajamas. \"Do I look ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe there\u0027s miscommunication. I didn\u0027t ask you if you were ready to go. I\u0027m saying we\u0027re going. Now. It\u0027s not always about you, Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him my famous sneer. \"I do not always think it\u0027s about me,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as one of his eyebrows rises up in amused contempt. Then he has the audacity to fetch my backpack and shove it at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d advise you to wear a bathing suit,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, where are we going?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kayaking. Down the Jordan River.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen should I break the news to him I\u0027m not going to kayak down the Jordan River, or any other river for that matter? I don\u0027t kayak. I don\u0027t canoe. I don\u0027t even swim well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just to show him I don\u0027t think it\u0027s all about me, I stalk off to change behind some bushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I come back, everything is packed up and in the flatbed truck. O\u0027dead is driving and next to him in the front is O\u0027snot. Of course Ofra is cuddling up next to Doo-Doo. So that means I have to sit next to Avi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat, just what I need first thing in the morning. I park myself next to him and make sure I don\u0027t make eye contact. It\u0027s starting to get warm outside so I have shorts on and a bikini top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as we start moving, I realize my choice in tops is not the best. Damn, I forgot the rocky road we\u0027re driving on does not bode well for my boobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bikini top I\u0027m wearing is not a support bra, not even close. And when O\u0027dead starts driving faster, I have no choice but to hold on to the railing. Which means my boobs are bouncing around like buoys on a windy day. Maybe I will have a boob reduction after all, detached pinky parts or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess Avi realizes I\u0027m uncomfortable because he shifts closer to me and puts his arm around my shoulders. He holds me so strongly I don\u0027t have to hold on to anything and my boobs are shmushed so tightly they aren\u0027t moving, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should pull away from him. I should slap him for holding me like I\u0027m his. But I feel so ...stable against him. Nothing\u0027s bouncing out of control and that\u0027s a good thing. So I stay where I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil, minutes later, we finally turn onto a paved road. I yank myself out of his embrace and push my shoulders back in a dignified manner. Or as dignified as I can while wearing a bikini top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, as I look at Ofra and Doo-Doo, they\u0027re too involved in gazing into each other\u0027s eyes to notice what\u0027s going on. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore long, we\u0027ve turned into a large parking lot. Everyone gets out of the Jeep and heads to the entrance of the place. Except me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Snotty says as she puts on her backpack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll just wait until you get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be waiting a long time, Amy. Moron is meeting us at the end of the river. We\u0027re not coming back here for a couple of days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart starts pounding fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you say a couple of days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Don\u0027t be scared. Kayaking is fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give a little huff as I think of white-water rapids and all the different ways I could die in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not scared. I just...well, I don\u0027t like water all that much. Maybe there\u0027s a phone around here and I can ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her hands on her hips and interrupts me, saying, \"You\u0027re scared, but you won\u0027t admit it. If you\u0027re such a baby, I\u0027ll ride with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up my backpack and jump out of the truck, my feet landing on the gravel parking lot with a loud thud. I put on my sunglasses and look up at her. \"You don\u0027t know anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you think you\u0027re tough, but you\u0027re really not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start walking toward the entrance to the kayak place and say, \"And I know O\u0027dead likes you way more than a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe runs to catch up with me. \"What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O\u0027dead likes you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only as a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI throw my backpack over my shoulder. \"I see the way he looks at you. It\u0027s definitely more than friendship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you find out for sure?\" she asks with hope in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"You\u0027re Israeli,\" I say. \"Why don\u0027t you go straight up to him and ask him? You keep reminding me how Israelis don\u0027t bullshit or beat around the bush.\" I ... 1 cant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI huff loudly, mocking her like she mocks me all the time. \"Okay, I\u0027ll ask him for you.\" We start walking toward the river together. \"By the way, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m tough,\" I say. \"I am tough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a good kisser has a direct correlation to how much you like the person you\u0027re kissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking with attitude over to the kayak place is hard while I have a sinking feeling in my stomach I\u0027m not going to get out of this situation alive. But at least Snotty will come in my kayak; I see they\u0027re only made for two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListen, I know if I sink everyone will be happy, including my cousin. Too bad for her if I go down, she goes with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch carefully as Doo-Doo and Ofra get into the first kayak. It seems unstable, to say the least. The kayak is not one of those hard plastic-made ones, it\u0027s a blow-up rubber one. Whoever the hell thought of a blow-up kayak is one dumb sucker. Don\u0027t they know one sharp stick poking it or a hungry piranha and the kayak will pop?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" Avi asks. I look at him and he\u0027s wearing a blue Nike bathing suit with a white stripe down the sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a look. \"Of course I\u0027m okay,\" I say. \"What would make you think I\u0027m not okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re all looking at me like I\u0027m a mashed potato.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in,\" Snotty says as she tosses our backpacks into the kayak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes dart back and forth between her and the guy who\u0027s launching the inflatable kayaks. He looks like he\u0027ll push me in if I don\u0027t move faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you need a life vest?\" the guy asks me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. \"No. But this kayak is running out of air,\" I say as I point to the floating thing. \"I think it has a hole in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKayak-Man has the audacity to actually snicker at me until Avi jerks the life vest out of the guy\u0027s hand and says to me, \"Get in. I\u0027ll help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O\u0027snot\u0027s going with me,\" I counter. Then I look at Avi over the top of my sunglasses. \"You\u0027re going with O\u0027dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say this then push my sunglasses back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I realize what he\u0027s doing, Avi picks me up and throws me like a bale of hay over his shoulder. Then he jumps right into the kayak. It\u0027s wobbly and I\u0027m scared and I\u0027m clawing at him and I\u0027m yelling obscenities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sets me down on the bottom of the kayak and pushes off with one of the oars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you do that?!\" I scream, obviously having a very hard time controlling my fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignores me and keeps paddling our kayak down the river, letting O\u0027dead and O\u0027snot pass us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put on the jacket. It\u0027s gonna get rough,\" he says after he\u0027s been paddling for a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thread my arms through the holes, but I can\u0027t click the belt shut. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-17.html","bookId":2764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM"}
