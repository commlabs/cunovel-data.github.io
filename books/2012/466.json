She possessed but a few. One for Anomander Rake, one for her fallen brother, Orfantal; one for Spinnock Durav – who cared nothing for her low birth – and one for Whiskeyjack. Soon, she had begun to suspect, she would set out to find two more. For Queen Yan Tovis. For Lord Nimander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese stones were not to be surrendered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo give one up was to set down a love, to walk away from it for evermore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it had been foolish, finding a stone for a man whose love she had known for so brief a time. He had never felt the way she had – he could not have – she had gone too far, had given up too much. They’d not possessed the time to forge something eternal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he had died, and it was as if he had been the one doing the walking away, leaving his own stone behind – the dull, lifeless thing that was her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ The dead forget us .’ So said Gallan . ‘ The dead forget us, and this is why we fear death .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had thought … there on that distant barrow now called the Awakening … a whisper of something, a presence arriving old and achingly familiar. As if he had looked upon her – as if she had felt his eyes – no, you foolish woman. It was his soldiers gathered on that hill. If he was there at all, it was for them .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of the woman from the K’Chain Che’Malle ranks. Korlat had come to a halt with her memories, and now she looked on this stranger, offering a rueful half-smile. ‘My courage fails,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe human woman, plain, past her youth, studied her for a moment. ‘What is that,’ she asked, ‘in your hand?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKorlat thought to hide it away again, but then sighed and showed the black stone. ‘I thought … a gift. For the barrow. I have seen such practices before …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Did you know them?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, Korlat turned to retrace her steps. ‘No. I am sorry. I did not.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the woman took her arm. ‘Walk with me, then, and I will tell you about Mortal Sword Gesler and Shield Anvil Stormy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I was presumptuous—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I doubt it,’ the woman replied. ‘But you can hold on to your tale, if you like. I am Kalyth.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKorlat gave her own name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They won free the heart of the Crippled God,’ said Kalyth as they drew closer. ‘But that is not how I remember them. They were stubborn. They snapped at each other like … like dogs. They mocked their own titles, told each other lies. They told me lies, too. Wild stories of their adventures. Ships on seas of fire. Dragons and headless Tiste Andii – whatever they are …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKorlat turned at that, thought to speak, then decided to remain silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In the time I knew them,’ Kalyth went on, not noticing her companion’s reaction, ‘they pretty much argued without surcease. Even in the middle of terrible battle they bickered back and forth. And all the while, these two Malazans, they did all that needed to be done. Each and every time.’ She nodded towards the Spire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Up there,’ she said, ‘they climbed through walls of fire, and at that moment I realized that all those wild tales they told me – they were probably all true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stormy died on the stairs, keeping a wild witch away from the heart. Those flames he could not in the end defeat. Gesler – we are told – died saving the life of a dog.’ She pointed. ‘That one, Korlat, the one guarding the barrow’s entrance. See how they await me now? It is because I am the only one the dog will let pass into the chamber. I dragged Gesler’s body in there myself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the woman at her side stopped talking then, Korlat looked down and saw how her face had crumpled – with her own words, as if their meaning only now struck true. She very nearly collapsed – would have done so if not for Korlat’s arm, now flexing to take the woman’s weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalyth righted herself. ‘I – I am sorry. I did not mean – oh, look at me …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have you,’ Korlat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis side of the small round barrow, the group of humans parted before them, as many eyes on Korlat as on Kalyth. She saw Hedge there, along with Quick Ben and Kalam, and the grey-bearded man she now knew to be Fiddler, Whiskeyjack’s closest friend. Their expressions were flat, and she weathered their regards with as much dignity as she could muster. Near them stood a mother and daughter, the latter, though little more than a child, pulling hard on a stick of rustleaf – and on this one’s other side stood an older woman doing the same with her own, beside a handsome young man. She saw a White Face Barghast chieftain grinning openly at herself – his desires made plain in the amused glint in his eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-466.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
