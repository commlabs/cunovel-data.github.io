A mounted tiger\u0027s head glared at me from the wall behind the desk. The ceiling was decorated with deer antlers like stalactites. On the east wall a padlocked gun display glowed from inside, showing off all sorts of rifles and shotguns. On the west wall an identical case was filled with musical instruments—a fiddle, two acoustic guitars, a black electric. I looked closer at the instruments. The fiddle had Bob Wills\u0027 name on it, set in motherofpearl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter five minutes rummaging I hadn\u0027t learned much. The few personal records Sheckly kept were all done by hand, scrawled in a thirdgrade cursive with all the b\u0027s and d\u0027s slanting backward and none of the i\u0027s dotted. He was a doodler? little stars and curlicues adorned the margins of his notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheck had been making some calls recently about a trucking company he owned that had apparently been losing stock value. He also had notes on phone calls he\u0027d made with Les, among other agents, discussing the terms of various deals with performers scheduled to play the Paintbrush. As Leena the bartender had indicated, there were several notes about managers and agents protesting Tilden\u0027s unstated rights to his radio broadcasts of the headliner shows. Apparently the artists got no percentage of the syndication money and had no say over the mix or content of the show that was recorded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were also airline receipts for trips to Europe dating back several years—mostly to Germany and the Czech Republic. Some were made out to Tilden Sheckly. Others to someone named Alexander Blanceagle. On two of the itineraries from early last year Alexander Blanceagle was listed as travelling with Julie Kearnes. I took those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast was a folder with a schedule of artists\u0027 names next to dates they had performed over the last two years. Some of these names had checks, some stars. There were no notes about Miranda Daniels. No pictures of Les SaintPierre with dart holes in his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked back into the main office and tried the second door, the one labelled STUDIO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt opened easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room on the other side was about twenty by twenty, brightly lit, and completely quiet. The walls and ceiling were white acoustic tile, the floor tan industrial carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClumps of boom microphone stands stuck up here and there like oversized toothpick sculptures. The left wall was covered with milk crates, towers of expensive stereo equipment, and speakers all stacked together haphazardly, many topped with collections of old McDonald\u0027s soda cups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst the right wall was a tenfootlong mixing board. A man sat sideways next to it in a battered easy chair, turning control knobs and listening through Walkmanstyle earphones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was oddly built, muscular but gangly, his face angular and goofylooking with freckles in a raccoon pattern across his nose and ears that, if not pinned back by headphones, would have made perfect little radar dishes on the sides of his head. A standardissue Hayseed. The only thing not comical about him was the bulge under his beige windbreaker, right about where a shoulder holster would go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was most definitely drunk. A nearempty bottle of Captain Morgan\u0027s sat next to him on the console. His eyes were heavylidded and his fingers were having trouble with the sound board controls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Hayseed finally noticed me, he took a few seconds of blinking and frowning to decide I wasn\u0027t just another stack of musical equipment. He brought the easy chair into upright position and spent some time trying to connect both his feet to the floor. He got his hands working, groped up the side of his head until he found the earphones and removed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evening,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me more closely and his ears turned red. \"Goddamn Jean—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said Jean the French way, the Claude Van Damme way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to correct him when he stood up and began staggering toward me, reaching for the now exposed black butt of his gun with one unsteady hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat pretty much decided me against the diplomatic approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met Hayseed halfway across the room and heel kicked him in the shin to take his mind off the gun. He grunted, stumbled forward one more step, his hands moving down instinctively toward the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed his shoulders and forced him backward. When he tipped over the side of the easy chair, his knees went up and his butt sank and the back of his head hit the mixing board. The equalizer lights did a crazy little surge. His bottle of Captain Morgan\u0027s toppled over, speckling the controls with rum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHayseed stayed put, his arms splayed and his knees up around his ears in hogtie position. He made a little groaning sound in his throat, like he was showing displeasure at a very bad pun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI extracted a .38 revolver from his shoulder holster, emptied its chambers, threw gun and bullets into a nearby milk crate. I found his wallet in the pocket of his windbreaker and emptied that, too. He had twelve dollars, a driver\u0027s license that read ALEXANDER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBLANCEAGLE, 1600 MECCA, HOLLYWOOD PARK, TX, and a Paintbrush Enterprises business card identifying him as Business Manager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the mixing board. Rows of equalizer lights still bounced up and down happily. A bank of CD burners and digital disc drives were daisychained together, all with beady little green eyes, ready to go. There were six or seven chunky onegigabyte cartridges scattered across the board. I picked up the earphones Alex had been wearing and listened—country music, recorded live, male singer, nothing I recognized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the chair was an unzipped black duffel bag filled with more recording cartridges and some microphone cords and a bunch of paper folders and files I didn\u0027t have time to look through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlanceagle\u0027s groaning changed pitch, got a little more insistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI helped him untangle his legs from his ears, then got him seated the right way again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis clothes fit him like a shortsheeted bed and his once nicely combed hair was doing a little swirly unicorn thing on top of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe massaged his shin. \"I need a damn drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you damn don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to sit up, then decided that didn\u0027t feel too good and settled back in. He tried to make some thick, fuzzy calculations in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ain\u0027t Jean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I agreed. \"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Sheck ...\" He knit his eyebrows together, trying to think. \"You look a little—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Jean,\" I supplied. \"So it would seem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander Blanceagle rubbed his jaw, pulled his lower lip. There was a little U of blood on the gum line under one of his teeth. \"What\u0027d you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to get mistaken for Jean and killed, preferably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. He didn\u0027t understand. Our little dance across the room might\u0027ve happened a hundred years ago, to somebody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here about a friend of yours,\" I said. \"Julie Kearnes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name registered slowly, sinking in through layers of rumhaze until it went off like a depth charge somewhere far under the surface. Blanceagle\u0027s freckles darkened into a solid redbrown band across his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julie,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows went up. His mouth softened. His eyes cast farther afield for something to latch on to. Nostalgia mode. I had maybe five minutes when he might be open to questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that drunks have predictable emotional cycles, but they do follow a brand of chaos theory that makes sense once you\u0027ve been around enough of them, or been made an alumni yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI overturned a milk crate, shook the electrical cords out of it, and sat down next to Blanceagle. I unfolded one of the airline receipts I\u0027d taken from Sheckly\u0027s desk and handed it across. \" You and Julie went to Europe together a couple of times on Sheckly\u0027s tab. Were you close?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlanceagle stared at the receipt. His focus dissipated again. His eyes watered up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe curled forward and put the hand with the airline receipt against his forehead, the Great Karnak reading a card. He scrunched his eyes together and swallowed and started shuddering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll admit to a certain manly discomfort when another guy starts to cry in front of me, even if he is drunk and funnylooking and recently guilty of trying to draw a gun on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat very still until Blanceagle got his body under control. One Muddy Waters, two Muddy Waters. Twentyseven Muddy Waters later he sat up, wiped his nose with his knuckles. He set the airline receipt on the arm of the chair and patted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got to go. I got to—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the sound board, struggling to remember what he\u0027d been doing. He started gathering up the one gigabyte cartridges, sticking them in his windbreaker pockets that were a little too small to hold them. I handed him one that kept slipping away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re copying a lot of music here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stuffed the last of the discs in his pocket, then made a feeble attempt to clean the drops of Captain Morgan\u0027s Spiced Rum off the sound board\u0027s controls, wiping between the lines of knobs with his fingers. \"Sheck is crazy. I can\u0027t just—I\u0027m in six years deep now, he can\u0027t expect—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex padded his shoulder holster, realized it was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over there.\" I pointed. \"Sheckly can\u0027t expect what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlanceagle glanced over at his unloaded gun in the milk crate, then at me, suspicious how I\u0027d pulled that off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was your name?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him. He repeated \"Navarre\" three times, trying to place it. \"You know Julie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was tailing her the day she got murdered. Maybe I helped it happen by applying pressure on her at the wrong time. I don\u0027t feel particularly good about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex Blanceagle pulled together enough anger to sound almost sober. \"You\u0027re another goddamn investigator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to maintain the glare but he didn\u0027t have the attention span or the energy or the sobriety for it. His eyes zigzagged down and came to rest on my navel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe muttered unconvincingly, \"Get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, you\u0027ve had some kind of disagreement with Sheck. You\u0027re clearing out your stuff. It\u0027s got to be in connection with the other things that have been happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe you should talk to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things will work out. You don\u0027t worry about Sheck, you understand? Les SaintPierre couldn\u0027t do it, I\u0027ll take care of it myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of what, exactly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlanceagle looked down at his halfpacked duffel bag and wavered between anger and wistfulness. Maybe if I\u0027d had more time and more Captain Morgan\u0027s I could\u0027ve eventually plied him into a temporary friendship, but just then the door of the studio opened and my stunt double came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean did look enough like me that I couldn\u0027t label Alex a complete idiot for making the mistake. Jean was much thicker in every part of his body, though, slightly taller, his black hair curlier. He was also less comfortably and more expensively dressed—black boots, tight gray slacks, a black turtleneck, a gray linen jacket. It must\u0027ve been a thousand degrees in those clothes. His left hand casually held a gray and black Beretta that matched his outfit perfectly. His eyes were the same colour as mine, hazel, but they were smaller and amorally fierce as a crab\u0027s. Put me on the GNC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehighcal highfibre diet and force me to dress that way and I probably would\u0027ve looked the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean looked around calmly. He zeroed in on the shoulder holster under Alex Blanceagle\u0027s windbreaker, dismissed it, then noticed Blanceagle\u0027s full pockets and the duffel bag. Finally he looked at me. That took a little longer. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-10.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
