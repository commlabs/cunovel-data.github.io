You’re gonna die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Du Xuemei is at the peak of Earthstring Foundation Establishment. Killing her would be like ridding the earth of the next Master Limitless!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Du Xuemei, I’ve been thinking about this day from the moment you killed my Junior Brother!” Of the four Foundation Establishment cultivators, some wanted to kill her for revenge, and some wanted to earn merit in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally speaking, they would have been worried about Patriarch Limitless showing up. But with the sects all at war, all bets were off, and they had their chance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, they attacked with full force, resorting to any means, fair or foul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore blood oozed down Xuemei’s chin, and it was laced with blackness; clearly, she had been poisoned. More than half of the Pill Stream Sect had been absorbed by the Profound Stream Sect, and they used poison as a powerful weapon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuemei chuckled bitterly, and her expression flickered with despair. Looking up, she saw her father in the middle of fighting one of the Profound Stream Sect patriarchs; clearly, he didn’t have time to try to help her. The blood rippers and prime elders were all engaged in life-or-death struggles, and besides, the battlefield was so large that it would be impossible for them spare her any attention. Even if they did notice her situation, they were so tangled up with Profound Stream Sect cultivators that they would never be able to come save her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, she didn\u0027t want to distract her father. Unfortunately, she had virtually no life-saving precious treasures left after the months of battle. To her bitterness, she could only stagger backward, blood oozing out of her mouth, her vision fading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I really going to die here...?” she thought. Gritting her teeth, she performed an incantation gesture to unleash a magical technique. As she did, the faint scar on the back of her hand was clearly visible....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntense, murderous gleams could be seen in the eyes of the four Profound Stream Sect cultivators. As they closed in, chaotic fighting broke out, and Xuemei was sent staggering backward over and over again. Clearly, she was weakening, and more wounds could be seen on her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow of death loomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in that exact same moment that Bai Xiaochun looked over from his position 3,000 meters away....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant he saw her, his mind trembled. Clearly, she was in mortal danger, and there was absolutely no time for him to ponder the situation. The only thing he could think of was...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to save Xuemei!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the four Foundation Establishment cultivators were of secondary importance in the situation: the 3,000-meter-distance between himself and Xuemei was filled with numerous Profound Stream Sect puppets, making it impossible for him to draw upon the full potential of his speed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis only option was to smash his way through!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes turning bloodshot, he yelled out at the top of his voice:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Middle Peak cultivators, to me!” With that, the heavenly demon leaped up into the air, letting out a roar that echoed like thunder from heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowerful blood qi erupted out of Bai Xiaochun, forming a pillar of blood-colored light that shot high up into the sky. Everything began to tremble, and even the patriarchs looked over in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first people to feel the effects of the sudden eruption of blood qi were the cultivators from Middle Peak. That was because, in addition to being the Blood Lord, Bai Xiaochun was also their blood master!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the Middle Peak cultivators on the battlefield trembled as their blood qi seemed to resonate with Bai Xiaochun’s shout. Almost immediately, they were filled with the impulse to get as close to him as they could!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impulse was impossible to suppress; if they tried, it would destabilize their cultivation base. Furthermore, by not suppressing it, they found to their delight that their cultivation base power was rapidly increasing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took the blink of an eye for all of the Middle Peak cultivators to be flashing through the sky toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they gathered around him, their blood qi spread out to swirl around the heavenly demon, gradually forming into the shape of an enormous blood sword!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun took a deep breath as he burst into motion, joined by the increasing numbers of Middle Peak cultivators as he charged toward Xuemei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance, the hordes of Middle Peak cultivators and the sword-wielding heavenly demon looked like a sea of blood!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther off on the battlefield, Bruiser let out a piercing cry as he led a huge group of battle beasts along, causing the earth to quake and the sky to distort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were also cultivators from the Spirit Stream Sect who, when they saw what was happening, felt their blood beginning to boil. In a very short period of time, there were already thousands of cultivators surrounding Bai Xiaochun, slashing across the battlefield like a sharp blade!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering the battlefield as a whole, this was a shocking development that left even the patriarchs gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blood Stream Sect and the Spirit Stream Sect were only in the initial stages of joining forces. Although many of the disciples had already become friends, overall, the two sects were still clearly divided, and mostly fought their own fights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was that only about fifty percent of the full fighting potential of the two sects was being unleashed on the battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was also one of the reasons why the Profound Stream Sect had been able to struggle along up to this point. The Spirit and Blood Stream Sects were aware of this situation, but there was nothing they could do to change it at the moment. After all, they had only been allies for a short period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as soon as Bai Xiaochun appeared, he let out a long cry and sent blood qi raging up into the sky, and it completely changed the situation!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWherever he went, the Blood Stream Sect’s battle prowess increased, and the Spirit Stream Sect’s battle beasts gathered around him and fought proudly with all the power they could muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the increase to the Blood Stream Sect cultivators’ battle prowess was not limited to any particular cultivation base. Everyone from the Outer Sect to the patriarchs benefited!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost instantly, the battle prowess of the Blood Stream Sect as a whole increased by about thirty percent. The Blood Stream Sect gasped in shock, and as for the Spirit Stream Sect, although they received no such boost, when they saw the elation of the Blood Stream Sect cultivators, they fought even harder than they had before. When the two sides joined forces, they could unleash incredible crushing power!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was the center of it all, and cultivators were grouping around him rapidly, increasing the force from thousands to over ten thousand!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost were from the Blood Stream Sect, and the closer they got to Bai Xiaochun, the better and more powerful their techniques worked!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the battlefield, there were many things that could be relied upon to stay alive, but one’s own strength was one of the most important!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was like the glue between the blood qi and the Blood Stream Sect, and was also the force which bound the Spirit Stream Sect and the Blood Stream Sect together. That was now more apparent than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patriarchs of the Spirit Stream Sect, the Blood Stream Sect, and even the embattled Profound Stream Sect were all shaken. Even the patriarchs who were still holed up inside the city were astonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, he’s Bai Xiaochun?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s the one responsible for this war?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patriarch Thousand-Faces said that if Bai Xiaochun died, the alliance between the Spirit Stream Sect and the Blood Stream Sect would collapse!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs all eyes were turning to look at Bai Xiaochun as he led the surrounding 10,000 cultivators in a charge across the battlefield. All Profound Stream Sect disciples who saw what was happening were left completely shaken, and without even thinking about it, began to back up. Within the space of a few breaths of time, the 3,000-meter distance leading up to Xuemei was being closed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs more people arrived to join the charge, more blood qi fueled the enormous blood sword, which was almost completely formed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuemei heard the rumbling sounds, and could sense her cultivation base recovering. She even felt her battle prowess rising, enabling her to fight back against the Profound Stream Sect’s Foundation Establishment cultivators. As for her four opponents, they were stunned. Although they weren’t sure of the relationship between Xuemei and Bai Xiaochun, they exchanged glances, and then gritted their teeth and called upon their ultimate trump cards. As of this point, they had to kill Xuemei as quickly as possible so that they could flee from Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the cultivators performed an incantation gesture to summon a black dragon. Another of them suddenly blurred as he produced a clone. The other two pulled out powerful magical treasures, one of them a long rope, the other, a black candle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Du Xuemei, prepare to die!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black dragon roared as it shot toward her, followed by the clone, which wielded a long, sharp sword. The rope twirled through the air, emitting a powerful aura, followed by the candle, the smoke of which seemed as sharp as blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds echoed out as more blood spilled from Xuemei’s mouth. The black dragon slammed into her, shoving her backward. As the clone closed in, she performed an incantation gesture, waving her right finger to summon a plum blossom symbol. The symbol destroyed the clone, and yet, she was sent flying backward like a kite with its string cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen came the rope and the candle, two deadly forces that quickly reached a position nine meters away from her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuemei chuckled bitterly as her vision began to fade. Time even seemed to slow down. As her thoughts began to descend into past memories, she suddenly heard an anxious, enraged roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat roar came from none other than Bai Xiaochun’s Heavenly Demon Body. Seeing Xuemei in such a deadly situation, he sent the heavenly demon’s hand shooting out with the gigantic blood-colored greatsword. Then, the sword slashed out toward the four Foundation Establishment cultivators!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Die!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-300\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-302\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-301","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM"}
