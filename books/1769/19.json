He moved toward the cell, paused, sucked in a breath. \"Fuck me. Look at him, Dev.\" The agent no longer whispered. There was too much shock in his tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn straightened and glanced over, not wanting to leave his perch beside Bride. Now that he had her within arm\u0027s reach again, he planned to keep her there. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t look sick. And if he doesn\u0027t look sick ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d had sex. Devyn\u0027s eyes narrowed on the otherworlder, taking in the clear skin, the even rise and fall of his chest. His gaze swung to Bride, still sleeping peacefully. Had they... they must have. It would also explain her fatigue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands curled into fists. There were no bruises under her eyes, no grayish tint to her skin. Teeth grinding, he reached down and shook her, no longer caring if he frightened her. \"Bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she gave no reaction, he shook her again. Harder. \"Bride!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly her eyelids fluttered open, hazel irises glazed. Hazel, no longer bright emerald. Either her mask was firmly back in place, or she\u0027d somehow lost her vibrancy. A moment passed while she oriented herself. When realization struck, she gasped. Jerked upright. Dark hair tumbled down her arms and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn leaned down, placing them nose to nose. \"Did you sleep with him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wh-what?\" She scrambled backward, only the arm of the couch stopping her. She reached behind her, probably meaning to grab the gun, but came up empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn moved with her, never letting more than an inch separate them. \"Did. You. Sleep. With. Him?\" The words snarled from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze roved wildly. Searching for a way out? Trying to figure out what had happened? \"What are you talking about? How did you find me? How did you get in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to ask you one more time, and you\u0027re going to answer, or I swear to God I\u0027m going to kill him in front of you. And you know I don\u0027t make threats. I make promises. Did you fuck Nolan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfusion flittered over her a split second before she shook her head. \"No. Of course not. He\u0027s diseased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn remained in place, studying her, gauging the truth of her words. The rage inside him ... he\u0027d never experienced so much. And for what? The thought of a woman in bed with another man? It was laughable. He never promised monogamy, and he never demanded it in return. He didn\u0027t stick around long enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously. What the hell was wrong with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s telling the truth,\" a grave voice said from behind him. Nolan had awoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDallas rubbed his finger over his gun\u0027s trigger. \"Try something, and your brains will end up on the wall. This isn\u0027t stun, asshole. This is copper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNolan kept his gaze on Devyn. \"It was the wine. She gave me two glasses of wine, and within an hour of drinking each, I felt healthier than I had in years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try again,\" Devyn snarled. \"Wine can\u0027t kill a disease as strong as yours.\" Nolan raised his chin. \"Hers can, and I want more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t wine, you sellout,\" Bride gritted. With a shaky hand, she smoothed the hair from her cheek and hooked it behind her ear. \"Not exactly. I, well, I mixed my ... blood with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three men stared over at her in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened her shoulders. \"Well, it helps me heal, and he was so near death, I thought I\u0027d give it to him and see what happened. He didn\u0027t turn into a vampire, though,\" she rushed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if anyone cared about that. Her blood. Her vampire blood had taken a dying man and propelled him into health. That, Devyn could believe. The hottest fires of his rage seeped from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here, Devyn?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe splayed his arms. \"Isn\u0027t it obvious? I\u0027m winning the game we were playing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like a bomb detonated in her eyes, hazel scattering and leaving only emerald fury. Mask gone, he thought with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew it! You tricked me. Lied to me. Told me to meet you at the pier, and then you followed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\" He shook his head. \"I didn\u0027t follow you, and I didn\u0027t have anyone else follow you. Try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how ...\" Her features scrunched adorably as she pondered what could have happened. A moment passed. She gasped. \"Somehow you tagged me with a GPS, didn\u0027t you, you bastard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep.\" A slow smile curled the corners of his mouth. \"Your bra. Remember the way I licked you ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed bloomed on her cheeks, the prettiest blush he\u0027d ever seen. \"You are such a cheater.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That hurts, darling. Really it does.\" He tugged a long, thin black case from his back pocket and popped the lid, revealing a syringe of glowing crimson liquid. Bride would have leaped from the couch, but he held her down with his mind. \"And how did I cheat? There were no rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared up at him. \"Let me go, damn it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. See, with this baby I\u0027ll know where you are every second of every day for the next three months. I see you\u0027re wondering what it is. Well, it\u0027s my pleasure to tell you. This is an isotope tracker, and all I\u0027ll have to do to find you is log on to my computer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jabbed the needle into her thigh, and her mouth fell open on a pained gasp. \"Sorry for the sting,\" he said. \"Ask nicely, and I\u0027ll kiss it better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have done that.\" A look of utter concentration descended her features. Determination. \"Soon you\u0027ll wish you hadn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d seen that expression on her before, seconds before she\u0027d exploded into mist. \"Don\u0027t you dare think about misting and leaving. I have your friend, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe determination fell away, vulnerability taking its place. She fingered the necklace she still wore. \"You\u0027ve treated her well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Treating women well is a hobby of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparks of anger returned to her eyes, but she never again looked as if she would mist. \"So what are you going to do to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get to that.\" The fact that her blood had healed Nolan—permanently? temporarily?—would be of great interest to AIR. They\u0027d take her from Devyn and turn her into a pincushion, no doubt about it. He wasn\u0027t ready for that to happen. \"Nolan, tell us about the changes in you.\" His attention never veered from Bride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe otherworlder was happy to obey. \"I\u0027m no longer clouded by the disease\u0027s thoughts. I can think clearly for the first time in years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo. Did that mean the disease was completely gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve lied and screwed us before.\" Dallas swiped his gun against the cage, rattling the bars. \"No way you expect us to trust you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNolan lifted his wide shoulders in a shrug. \"Trust me or not. Doesn\u0027t matter. But I know I\u0027m free. The queen, she—\" He pressed his lips together, waited, then scrunched his brow. \"I think I can talk about her,\" he said on a shocked gasp. \"I know she\u0027s ... infected the last of her captives...\" His eyes widened. \"That didn\u0027t hurt! I can. I can talk about her. She\u0027ll come to New Chicago within the week. Exactly where and when, though? I no longer sense her, so I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYep, truth or not, AIR was going to want Bride\u0027s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn looked over at his friend. \"Give me an hour,\" he said. \"And do whatever it takes to find out anything else he knows about his queen and her vacation here.\" Knowledge was power, and Devyn liked power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDallas flicked a good-luck glance at Bride, then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word, Devyn released her from his mind-hold. He picked her up and anchored her on his shoulder while she hit, bit, and kneed him, and then he carried her into the bedroom and kicked the door shut behind him. The true fun was about to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell are you doing? Put me down!\" Bride slammed her fists against the solid wall of Devyn\u0027s back. The hot silk of his skin was evident under the material of his shirt, causing her arms to tingle. A dangerous tingle. A tempting tingle. Something she should not feel for the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything you say, darling.\" He dropped her flat on her ass. \"You know I live only to please you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAir whooshed from her lungs, and when she caught her breath she glared up at him. \"You\u0027re such an ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clutched his chest, just above his heart. \"Oh, how you wound me. I gave you what you wanted, didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dramatic ass, at that.\" Biting the inside of her cheek, Bride popped to her feet. She could have misted—though she needed open space to leave a room—and could have hurriedly stripped and camouflaged her skin, but she didn\u0027t. Not only because his reminder that he held Aleaha still rang through her, but also because curiosity and something else, something she refused to name, flooded her. \"If you brought me in here to rape me ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his brows arched, and there was a definite sparkle in his eyes. \"It wouldn\u0027t be rape, and we both know it. Last night you were all over me, practically dripping in my hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer teeth clenched. \"You\u0027re an exaggerator, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"You don\u0027t have to worry about giving in to my wicked advances. Not yet. Right now you\u0027re going to strip and shower, and then we\u0027re going to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her chin. \"Like hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will. I\u0027ll force you if necessary. And Bride,\" he said, his voice dipping huskily, \"I hope it\u0027s necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he did. He was the only person on the planet who could see through a threat like that successfully. The only person who could possibly make her enjoy the fact that her will had been ignored. \"I don\u0027t need to be clean to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do. Right now the sight of you upsets me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been in the process of reaching behind her, feeling her dresser for a weapon. She had them stashed everywhere, just in case. But his words enraged her, and she ended up grabbing the first thing she encountered. A book. A paperback, at that. She hurled it at him, anyway, and the spine slapped against his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked in surprise, rubbed his cheek, and glanced down at the book. \"That was childish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, your perfect face was upsetting me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finally. You admit how perfect I am.\" Gently he toed the book aside. \"First rule of thievery, sweetheart. You shouldn\u0027t abuse items you work hard to steal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t steal it.\" Why she told him the truth, she didn\u0027t know. His opinion didn\u0027t matter. \"I saved it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again he arched a brow, his gaze sharpening. \"You were able to save it because you\u0027re human, and humans live for hundreds of years without aging?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I\u0027m not human,\" she grumbled. Misting in front of him had pretty much ruined her \"I\u0027m human\" argument. \"Now stop distracting me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t help myself. I\u0027m perfect, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArgh! Infuriating man. \"I will shower, but only because I really need one.\" The grumble had become churlish. \"But I\u0027ll do it with my clothes on.\" So there. Oh, God. I really am a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clothes off,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On. And that\u0027s that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I recommend that you strip.\" He sounded almost pleasant now, a sure sign his patience was at an end. The sweeter he seemed, she was coming to understand, the more violent he was feeling. Exhibit A: he\u0027d been smiling when he\u0027d taken Tom\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. I\u0027ll strip. But you and your stupid T-shirt have to leave.\" She pointed to the door. Not for a second did she think he\u0027d actually do it. It was worth a shot, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, no,\" he said. Big shocker. \"I plan to enjoy the show. And my T-shirt isn\u0027t stupid. It\u0027s a public service.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Size Dental Appliances Here\" with an arrow to his cock, meaning women could feel free to suck him. \"Devyn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bride. Last chance to act on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared over at him, taking in his determined expression, the hard line of his body. If she pushed, he really would force her to do as he wanted, and she would lose control of her own actions. If she gave in, she could dictate what angle to show him—and how badly to tantalize him with what he would never have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" she said, and sighed. \"You want a show, I\u0027ll give you a show.\" He would watch, and he could want, but she would not give. The last was a reminder to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave another of those surprised blinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpected her to continue to balk, had he? Chin lifting in challenge, she slowly shimmied out of her clothing. First the boots. She chucked them at him, and he easily sidestepped. Second, she removed her pants. Third, her shirt. His pupils dilated as she unsnapped her bra and let the syn-cotton float to the ground. The matching panties quickly followed, leaving her completely bare. Well, except for Aleaha\u0027s necklace, but that didn\u0027t count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was afraid I\u0027d imagined them, those blood red nipples. My new favorite color, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she replied, pleased, though she was sure she wasn\u0027t the first to hear such a compliment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gave him pause. \"Not embarrassed by my scrutiny?\" The question was almost... hesitant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Despite what she\u0027d told him while he\u0027d forced her to strip that first time, nudity didn\u0027t bother her. How could it, when she had to traipse the streets of New Chicago naked but camouflaged while she hunted? Besides, she liked her body. \"No reason to be. Of the two of us, I\u0027m the closer to perfection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips twitched. \"The only way to know for sure, of course, is to study you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-19.html","bookId":1769,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM"}
