One minute he had been kissing her until she was drowning in ecstacy, and the next he was ordering her to her room as if she were a naughty child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, she held her breath, her ears straining for some sound from the other room. Nothing. Adrenalin pumping, she began to pace the floor. Never in all her life had she heard a voice like that, felt such menace. Try as she might, she could find no explanation for his peculiar behavior, and as the minutes ticked by, she began to wonder if she hadn\u0027t overreacted, or perhaps imagined the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the clock on her bedside table. Twenty minutes had passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn silent feet, she crossed the floor, turned the lock, and opened the door. \"Navarre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer, but his name seemed to hover in the air, repeating itself over and over again.Navarre, Navarre, Navarre ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a cautious step down the hallway, her heart beating in triple time as she paused to listen, but all she heard was the pounding of her own heart, and the steady drip of the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer throat was dry, her palms damp, when she reached the doorway to the living room. \"Navarre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced around the room, then checked the kitchen and the den. He was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breath she\u0027d been holding escaped in a long sigh. She didn\u0027t know if it was disappointment or relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved through the house, double-checking to make sure all the doors and windows were locked, wondering at her sudden compulsion to check them yet a third time. Moreno Bay was a small town. Nothing ever happened there. There was no crime to speak of. Until the incident reported on TV that night, the last offense of any note had occurred when Milt Evans got drunk and drove his pickup through the front window of Mavis Harper\u0027s Dress shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, as she drew the shade over the kitchen window, she couldn\u0027t shake off the feeling that something evil was lurking outside in the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNavarre stood on the balcony of Cliff House, his hands clenched at his sides, his face turned up to the sky. He closed his eyes as the cold rain pelted his face and chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in years, he wished he had the right to pray, to plead with a loving God to protect Adrianna, to keep her safe. From himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should leave there, he thought, leave tonight while the memory of what he had almost done was still fresh in his mind. But all he could think of was how good it had been to hold her in his arms, the way her hands had felt as they caressed him. For the first time in centuries he had felt loved, cared for. For one brief moment, he had dared to hope that he could spend time with Adrianna without destroying her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, he couldn\u0027t leave town, not until he learned who, or what, had attacked the woman in the alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there until dawn, oblivious to the cold and the rain, his thoughts turned inward. Eons ago he had resigned himself to what he was. He had learned to appreciate his supernatural powers, to enjoy the increased physical strength, the constant good health. He didn\u0027t age. He was never sick. He had traveled the world time and time again. And when he grew weary of living, when the loneliness grew too great, he had only to go to ground for a decade or a century, and when he surfaced, the world was new again, fresh again. Perhaps he should go to ground now and sleep away the years of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeedless of the passing hours, he stood there, gazing in the direction of Adrianna\u0027s house, picturing her asleep in the bed that had once been his, imagining a lifestyle he had never known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain stopped with the coming of the dawn, and still he stood on the balcony, staring at the rainbow that stretched across the sky. He watched the sun rise, a brilliant burst of color that painted the horizon with vivid slashes of ocher and crimson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, he turned away and went into the house. Feeling drained of all hope, he changed into a pair of jeans and a black turtleneck sweater. Barefooted, he wandered through the house. He took a deep breath, and the faint floral scent of Adrianna\u0027s perfume filled his nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrianna...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even as her image rose in his mind, he sensed her presence, heard her knock at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore under his breath, wondering what madness had brought her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Navarre? Navarre! Open the door. I know you\u0027re in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngry that she had dared to seek him out, he stalked to the door and flung it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrianna took a step back, alarmed by the rage that glittered in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...\" She took another step backward, then straightened her shoulders and stood firm. \"I had to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go home, Adrianna. You\u0027re not safe here. You\u0027re not safe with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" She gazed up at him, her blue eyes shining with unshed tears. \"Tell me what\u0027s wrong. What have I done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done?\" He groaned deep in his throat. \"You\u0027ve done nothing. Please, Annie, please go home where you belong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer concern for her own safety dissolved when she heard the anguish in his voice, saw the pain in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell me what\u0027s wrong,\" she urged. \"Let me help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t help me. No one can.\" He stared past her, judging the time, knowing he would have to seek his rest soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving, Navarre. Whether you want to admit it or not, there\u0027s something special between us, something I don\u0027t want to lose.\" She laid her hand on his forearm, felt his muscle flex and tighten at her touch. \"I\u0027m falling in love with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t the reaction she had hoped for. She had expected him to be surprised, perhaps disbelieving, since they had known each other such a short time. A part of her had hoped he would be happy, that he would sweep her into his arms and tell her that he loved her, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no joy in his expression, only a soul-deep misery. She felt suddenly foolish and a little embarrassed. She\u0027d never thrown herself at a man before, never realized how devastating unrequited love could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up at him, wanting to run away, to crawl into a hole and hide, but she seemed rooted to the spot, unable to move, unable to think of anything but the way she\u0027d felt in his arms the night before, the way he\u0027d held her and kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened last night?\" she asked. \"Just tell me that, and I\u0027ll go away and never bother you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in,\" he said, and turned away without waiting to see if she followed him or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver crept up her spine as she entered the house. As usual, all the drapes were drawn and the interior of the house was dark and cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed Navarre into the front parlor and sat down on the edge of an Early American sofa, her hands folded in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNavarre stood at the hearth with his back to her. \"I\u0027m going to tell you something you probably won\u0027t believe,\" he said, still not facing her. \"And then I want you to leave. No questions asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardly daring to breathe, she waited for him to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel her watching him, and he stared into the fireplace, wondering how to tell her what he was. Should he just blurt it out? Or should he let her see him as he really was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Navarre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe in the supernatural, Adrianna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The supernatural? You mean like ESP and psychic phenomena, stuff like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, he shook his head, and then he turned around to face her. \"I\u0027m not like you,\" he said flatly. \"I\u0027m not mortal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to laugh at the absurdity of what he was saying, but then she looked into his eyes, and in their fathomless depths, she saw that he was telling the truth, or at least what he believed to be the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was born almost two thousand years ago, on a small island off the coast of Greece.\" He lifted his hand in a broad gesture that encompassed the house and its contents. \"All this furniture, the bed you bought, is mine, collected over hundreds of lifetimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She shook her head. \"That\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I wish it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re trying to tell me you\u0027re immortal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a manner of speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true nonetheless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to believe you\u0027ve lived for almost two thousand years?\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not alive, Adrianna. I\u0027ve been dead for close to two thousand years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them was insane, she thought, not certain which of them it was. Him for speaking such nonsense, or her for listening, and almost believing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you doing this?\" She fisted the tears from her eyes. \"If you don\u0027t want to see me again, just say so! You don\u0027t have to make up some outrageous lie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not lying. Look at me, Adrianna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly, she met his gaze, felt the blood in her veins turn to ice as his eyes took on an eerie red glow and his lips drew back, exposing two long teeth that could only be called fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now do you believe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can\u0027t be. There\u0027s no such thing as... as a...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe vampire is the word you\u0027re looking for, and I can assure you, they do exist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, and he was beside her, his hand closing on her arm. She felt the steel-like strength of his grip, the coolness of his skin, as he guided her into the next room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle throbbed in his jaw as he placed her in front of a large oval mirror, then stood beside her and removed the cloth that had covered the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrianna stared at her reflection, hardly recognizing the face that stared back at her, her eyes wide and afraid, her lips parted as she drew in a shaky breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNavarre cast no reflection at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... but it\u0027s daylight, and you\u0027re awake.\" She shook her head, her mind refusing to believe what she knew to be true. \"I saw you eat... we walked on the beach...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to look at him, then glanced at the mirror again, and all the color drained from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her expression turn to one of horror and disbelief, and then, with a wordless cry, she fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her in his arms, held her effortlessly to his chest. He would hold her for just a minute, he thought, then take her outside and put her in her car. He glanced around the room, knowing he dared not stay at Cliff House any longer. If he left now, he would have time to find a place to go to ground before the heat of the sun became unbearable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut one minute stretched into two, and then three, and still he held her close, his heart aching at the thought of never seeing her again. Would she betray him, now that she knew what he was? And if she did, who would believe her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder rumbled across the sky. A jagged bolt of lightning ripped through the clouds. He couldn\u0027t leave her in her car, not in this storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he carried her upstairs and put her to bed in his bed. Unable to help himself, he lay down beside her and gathered her into his arms. He would hold her close a few minutes more, and then he would leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sun stayed hidden in the clouds, giving him a reprieve, and he continued to hold her, his gaze never leaving her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me,\" he murmured. \"I never meant to cause you pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stirred at the sound of his voice. He watched her eyelids flutter open, saw the confusion in her eyes turn to fear when she looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me it isn\u0027t true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you... Did you... ?\" She licked her lips, then raised a trembling hand to the side of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re fine, Adrianna. You fainted, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him through eyes filled with terror. It was an expression he had seen on countless faces when the one he had chosen to drink from realized what he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear. He could smell it on her. It sickened him that he was the cause of it. \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brushed a wisp of hair from her brow, a muscle flexing in his jaw when she recoiled from his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly and deliberately, he put her from him and stood up. \"You can stay here until the rain stops,\" he said, unable to keep the bitterness from his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to find a place to spend the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced around the room. It was large, but sparsely furnished, containing only a large dresser, a chest of black lacquer, and the bed. \"I thought vampires slept in coffins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some do,\" he said, his voice gruff. \"I don\u0027t care for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the questions in her eyes, the doubts that lingered even in the face of reality. \"Good-bye, Adrianna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words were soft, and final. He was leaving, and she knew that if she let him go, she would never see him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him turn away. Now she understood the loneliness she had so often seen in his eyes, heard in his voice. She had a sudden, inexplicable need to hold him, to comfort him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door, and she saw him hesitate, take a deep breath, and then take the first step that would carry him away from her forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Navarre! Wait!\" Jumping out of bed, she ran after him. \"Wait! Please wait!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stiffened as he felt her arms wrap around his waist, felt the warmth of her body pressing against his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t leave me,\" she whispered. \"Please don\u0027t leave me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annie, you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what you are. I don\u0027t want you to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to go.\" The words came from deep within, as if they\u0027d been dredged from the very bottom of his soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then don\u0027t go.\" She dragged him around to face her. \"I love you. I\u0027ve never loved anyone before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, amused and amazed by the woman standing before him. \"Annie, my sweet Annie, don\u0027t you know you\u0027re not safe here, not safe with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve never hurt me before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t hurt you now, not intentionally.\" He sighed, resisting the urge to pull her into his arms. \"Do you know the story of the rattlesnake who offered to carry a rabbit across a river?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rabbit said no, because he was afraid the snake would eat him, but the snake promised he wouldn\u0027t, and the rabbit believed him. When they reached the other side of the river, the snake bit the rabbit. \u0027Why?\u0027 the rabbit asked. \u0027You promised!\u0027 \u0027I couldn\u0027t help it\u0027 the rattler explained with a smile. \u0027I\u0027m a snake\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNavarre\u0027s eyes begged for her understanding. \"I\u0027m a vampire, Annie. And sometimes, even after all these years, the hunger is stronger than I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me to leave, then.\" She looked up at him through wide blue eyes filled with love and trust. \"Tell me you never want to see me again, and I won\u0027t bother you any more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth, but his tongue refused to obey his mind\u0027s command. \"I can\u0027t. Heaven help me, I can\u0027t send you out of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the window. Even though boards covered the window, he knew the clouds had passed, knew the sun was high in the sky, as a familiar heaviness began to steal over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go home, Annie. I\u0027ll come to you tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFighting the lethargy creeping over him, he stood in the doorway staring after her. Never before had he taken his rest in a place known to another. Never, in the near two thousand years of his existence, had he trusted anyone, male or female, mortal or vampire, to know where he passed the hours of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt grieved him to think she might betray him, but he knew it was possible. Once she was away from him, once she\u0027d had time to think about what he\u0027d told her, there was always a chance she would decide he was a danger to her, a danger to the town. Given time to think, she might come to the conclusion that he was evil and should be destroyed. And though he wasn\u0027t totally helpless during the hours of daylight, he was still weak, still at his most vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, he closed and bolted the door, then settled back on his bed, knowing that if Annie betrayed him, nothing else would matter anyway. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sunlight-moonlight/page-46.html","bookId":2306,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:52 PM"}
