How they Voyaged on Love-quest to Isen-land","content":"\u0026nbsp;Now over the Rhine came a story of none heard theretofore, \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A tale of the marvellous beauty of maids on a far-away shore.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then stirred was the spirit of Gunther to win such an one for his bride:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the hope thereof uplifted was his heart in kingly pride.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a Queen of Beauty enthroned beyond the sea;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through all the world’s wide compass was none so fair as she.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In loveliness was she peerless, and of measureless bodily might;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For she matched her with champions that wooed her in speeding the lance’s flight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in hurling the stone, and in leaping far as it flew through the air.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whosoever to wife would win her, that terrible test must dare,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in contests three overcome her, that champion-maid high-born.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let him fail in but one of the trials, and his head from his shoulders was shorn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Full oft that Daughter of Princes had done this ruthless thing:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But now by the Rhine her rumour came to a knightly king,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he turned his whole heart’s longing to win that fair one to wife.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —Ah, many a knight thereafter for her sake lost his life!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) As once in the midst of his people the noble Gunther sat,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Much question arose, as the speech-tide flowed swiftly this way and that,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What queen among women was worthy that the King should choose her for bride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who should be Queen of Burgundia, and sit enthroned at his side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake the Lord of Rhineland: “I will take ship down to the sea,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And will sail to the Lady Brunhild, howsoever it fare with me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the love of that Queen of Women will I venture limb and life:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, ready I stand to lose them, an I win her not to my wife.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 45}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I give my counsel against it,” cried Siegfried with earnest mien;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Such deadly-ruthless customs be practised of that dread queen,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That whoever is her love’s suitor, his head he imperilleth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Well mayst thou advise thee rather to turn from this path of death.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Answered and spake King Gunther: “Never was woman born\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So strong and so fierce of spirit, but her might were by mine outworn\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lightly, in any contest, by my single hand alone!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah hush!” made answer Siegfried, “unto thee is this woman unknown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Though four such as thou withstood her, the strength of them all were as nought\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Against her terrible fury: thou therefore renounce that thought;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In loyal faith I advise thee. If with death thou be not in love,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Travail not thou to win her, for nought can come thereof.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) “Be she as strong as she may be, on that journey I needs must fare\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hence unto Brunhild, befall me what may befall me there!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the sake of her peerless beauty no peril will I decline.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Peradventure may God yet move her to follow us to the Rhine.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then will I counsel,” made answer Hagen, “if this must be,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That thou make thy request unto Siegfried, that he will bear with thee\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The burden of this sore travail: this rede remaineth the best,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seeing he hath alone clear knowledge of Brunhild’s perilous test.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Said the King, “O Siegfried belovèd, mine helper wilt thou fare\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In my wooing of Brunhild the lovely? Do according to this my prayer,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And if for my bride I win her, and crown her my queenly wife,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For thee at all times will I venture honour and limb and life.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered him Siegfried, the scion of Siegmund the Lowland’s lord:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “This will I do, if thou promise to give me for reward\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Lovely, the Queen of Women, Kriemhild thy sister, for bride:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For my toil for thee nor guerdon nor thank I desire beside.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Even this do I promise,” said Gunther, “O Siegfried, on thine hand;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And if Brunhild the lovely cometh hither to this my land,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then will I give thee my sister to wife in requital for this;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So mayest thou with thy fair one for ever live in bliss.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 46}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then by an oath did they pledge them, those noble warriors twain;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But thereof unto both was begotten exceeding toil and strain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Or ever they brought into Rhineland that lady of princely blood,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In peril exceeding grievous those valiant heroes stood.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Now concerning the tameless Earth-dwarfs this thing have I heard folk say,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That they dwell in the mountain-caverns, and about their heads they lay\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For helmets the Hoods of Darkness, and a strange power floweth thence;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For who weareth such on his body, therein hath perfect defence\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) From stroke of sword and from spear-thrust; while resteth on him this pall,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No man may in any wise see him, but he heareth and seeth all\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So much as his soul desireth, yet himself may none behold;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And his strength to a giant’s waxeth, as the tale in our ears hath been told.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now the Hood of Darkness Siegfried for their help at need hath ta’en,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even that which the valiant warrior had wrested with toil and strain\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From Alberich, Dwarf of the Mountain, in the stormy days gone by.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So these to their journey addressed them in their fearless chivalry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now whene’er the stalwart Siegfried had donned that Hood of Night,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He gat from its overscreening exceeding fulness of might;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In twelve men’s strength he clad him, as the runes of the old songs run.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So it fell, by the Dwarf-lords’ cunning that glorious bride was won.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, and so wondrous-shapen was that strange cloudy Hood,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That a man overpalled by its shrouding might do even that which he would,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, after his heart’s good pleasure, for of none was he espied:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Therewith did he win Queen Brunhild—and through her at the last he died.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now, ere we set forth on our journey, unto me, O Siegfried, declare\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How best for our honour and glory over the sea we may fare.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Shall we lead ’neath our banners a war-host of knights unto Brunhild’s land?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Swiftly may thrice ten thousand be arrayed in our warrior-band.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How great soever the war-host that we take,” spake Siegfried to him,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The might of that queen and her fury be so exceeding grim,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That all our array should be blasted ’neath the storm of her battle-mood.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I will give to you better counsel, O valiant thanes and good:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 47}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In guise as of lone knights-errant let us sail adown the Rhine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Touching who in our band shall be numbered, hear this counsel of mine:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With thee and with me two only let there go, none other beside,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That with these we may woo this lady, whatsoever thereafter betide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even I am one in the venture, the second must needs be thou,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And let the third be Hagen—fear not, we shall prosper now;—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the fourth be chosen Dankwart, that lord of battle-might;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then not a thousand aliens shall ever withstand us in fight.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of this too,” spake King Gunther, “would I fain be certified—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For thereof should mine heart be gladdened—or ever forth we ride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What manner of raiment in presence of Brunhild befits that we wear\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Such as shall meetly beseem us: this, O Siegfried, declare.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In the richest of all rich vesture that is found in any land\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Be arrayed evermore the people that in Brunhild’s presence stand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let us therefore appear before her in silk and in ermine and gold,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That none think scorn of our splendour when the tale thereafter is told.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered the good thane Gunther: “Myself will go forthright\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To my well-belovèd mother, if haply good in her sight\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It shall be that her comely maidens may fashion attire so fair\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As before that queenly lady with honour we may wear.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then out spake Hagen of Troneg, that lord of stately port:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What boots it to trouble thy mother for service in such a sort?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Breathe but a word to thy sister of thy thought and thy desire,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And cunning fingers shall frame you exceeding rich attire.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the King sent word to his sister that fain would he confer\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With her, even he and Siegfried. But, or ever they came unto her,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That lovely one had adorned her in such royal-rich array\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That with right scant heart-misgivings their coming did she stay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stood the ladies that waited upon her clad richly in their degree:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then came to her bower the Princes: at their entering-in rose she\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To meet them, from her high seat: ah, with what queenly grace\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She greeted the noble stranger and her brother with radiant face!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 48}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Blithe welcome unto my brother, and welcome to his friend!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I am fain,” spake on that sweet one, “I am fain to know the end\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of your coming to this bower royal, what thing your hearts would crave.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I beseech you, let me hearken what the noble knights would have.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake King Gunther: “Lady, this will I tell:—we bear,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For all our knightly courage, the burden of a care.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We be minded to ride a-wooing to a strange land far away,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And fain would we have for our journey exceeding goodly array.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now seat thee, belovèd brother,” that child of kings ’gan say,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And of this thing first instruct me, what fairest of fair ones be they\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whom ye are so fain to be wooing in a strange king’s far-off land.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And therewith those chosen chieftains did the maiden take by the hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with these twain onward paced she, and seated them royally\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On splendour-gleaming couches—nought passing the truth tell I—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With imagery fair-fashioned with the red gold threads entwined:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of a truth, in that bower of ladies fair pleasure might they find!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Flashes of swift love-lightning and of yearning of the heart,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the eyes of each unto other, well might they ofttimes dart!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For shrined in his soul he bare her; she was more unto him than life,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And ere long by noble service he won her to be his wife.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake that goodly war-king: “Belovèd sister mine,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Our desire may be nowise accomplished saving with help of thine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We would fare forth pleasure-questing to the Lady Brunhild’s land,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And knights need fair arrayal that in presence of ladies stand.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake that Daughter of Princes: “Belovèd brother mine,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If aught mine help may avail you to compass your design,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hereof have utter assurance, I am ready to bear my part.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, if another denied thee, it were pain unto Kriemhild’s heart.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n O noble knight, it needs not that ye ask as in fear and doubt:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What best ye bring soever in lordly wise tell out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whatsoever may do you a pleasure, ready awaiteth mine aid,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with all mine heart I do it.” So spake that winsome maid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 49}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Our will is, sister belovèd, to array us in vesture fair,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And we pray that thine own white fingers may this our apparel prepare.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And let these thy maidens be heedful that each man be arrayed like a king;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For no gainsaying shall turn us from this our journeying.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered and spake that Fair One: “To this my request give heed:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Silks have we beside us in plenty; command that one bring for our need\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The gemstones that gleam on your bucklers; these on the silk will we lay.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thereunto Gunther and Siegfried glad-hearted answered yea.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now who be the journeying-fellows,” the Princess asked again,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who shall wend so goodly-apparelled unto where this queen doth reign?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Myself am the fourth: first Siegfried; two of my liegemen withal,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dankwart and Hagen, shall journey with us to her palace-hall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Heed well, O sister belovèd, what now unto thee we say:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n See to it, that we four comrades three several times a day\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n May through four days change our raiment, and still go gorgeously,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So that none, when we pass from her country, may scoff at our bravery.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With outpouring of thanks, from her chamber then passed they in knightly wise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then to seek help of her women did Kriemhild the princess arise,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And of all her bower-maidens thirty summoned she\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Which above all others were cunning in needle-mastery.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On white Arabian samite—as the snow was its pearly sheen—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And on far-fetched velvet of Orient, as the springtide clover green,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Laid they the flashing gemstones,—O rich was the vesture and rare,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For by hands of Kriemhild the lovely were the garments shapen fair.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sea-otter furs and sealskins for lining thereof chose they,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A marvel to all beholders—was never such rich array!—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with silk did they overlay them, and drew the seams with gold.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sooth, many a marvellous story of the splendour thereof hath been told.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Out of the land of the Morians came the goodliest silk on earth,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And from sun-smitten plains of Libya: on children of royal birth\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Was ne’er seen costlier vesture; and of these was enough and to spare.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And through all the threadwork woven was the love that Kriemhild bare.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 50}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the costly raiment craved for by those far-voyagers\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She lavished with love ungrudging the ermine’s argent furs—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Soft whiteness gleaming whiter for its flecks of coal-black hue—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Such as valorous knights wear proudly in a great king’s retinue.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Out of bezels of gold of Arabia the glorious gemstones gleamed:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For those watchful eyes no smallest pearl too tiny seemed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So fashioned they all that raiment ere seven weeks fleeted away:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And withal for the good knights ready by this was their war-array.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now when all at the last lay ready, men saw by the Rhine-river strand\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A galley of stout oak builded by the cunning craftsman’s hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wherein down Rhine-flood the heroes on to the sea should be borne.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And by this were the noble maidens by their labour of love outworn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then they sent to the knights the message that ready all things were\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the which they would fain go bravely, that raiment passing-fair;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Accomplished was all they had prayed for, and the labour of love was done.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now therefore beside Rhine-river no more would they linger on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So then to those gallant comrades was a message from Kriemhild brought\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To come and behold the apparel that her hands had newly wrought,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If perchance for the heroes’ wearing it were over short or long:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And behold, it was all just measure, and they thanked that maiden-throng.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Into whosesoever presence they came, all men must say\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That never on earth had they looked on more passing-fair array.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Blithe-hearted might they wear it in the palace of proudest queen,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For of goodlier knights’ apparel had none or heard or seen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So then to these noble maidens all-courteous thanks they gave.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now must the bold knights-errant for leave of parting crave.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With courtesy right gentle they spake their last farewell:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ah, then were there bright eyes troubled and dim as the tears fast fell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She spake: “O brother belovèd, ’twere better that here ye stayed—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, wiselier done I account it—and wooed some other maid\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Where ye should not thus be enforcèd to hazard limb and life:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ye should find in a land near-lying no less a high-born wife.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 51}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Already their hearts foreboded the trouble darkening near.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All needs must weep, whatsoever words were spoken of cheer:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The gold on their bosoms gleaming grew dim with the hot tears stained,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With the tears that aye fell earthward from sorrowing eyes down-rained.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake she: “O Lord Siegfried, to thy love and thy loyalty\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hereby do I commit him, this brother belovèd of me,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That nothing of peril harm him afar in Brunhild’s land.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the hero pledged him, and swore it on the Lady Kriemhild’s hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he spake, that noble war-thane: “So long as endure my days,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No shadow of trouble, Princess, shall fall across thy ways.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I will bring him back into Rhineland—I swear it by life and limb!—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By peril unscathed.” Low bowed she with soft eyes thanking him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Their shields with the red gold gleaming down to the shore bare they;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they laid withal in the galley their goodly war-array;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And aboard men led their horses: on the decks now stand their feet—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n O me, what bitter weeping brake forth from maidens sweet!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now thronged was many a casement with ladies lovely-eyed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And a great wind lifted the galley as they shook the white sails wide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So out on the Rhine they floated, those proud hearts, bound for the sea.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then answered and spake King Gunther: “Our pilot, who shall he be?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Even that will I,” said Siegfried: “from hence on can I steer\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Your ship on the flood, stout heroes; thereof have ye no fear;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the printless paths of the waters unto me be throughly known.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So are these from the land Burgundian with hearts exultant gone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Siegfried set hand to a massy staff such as shipmen wield,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the ship at his mighty thrusting out from the wharf-side reeled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gunther the dauntless hero on the tiller hath laid his hand:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So the glorious war-swift champions swung out clear from the land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of meats they bare rich plenty, and therewithal good wine,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The best that from foaming wine-fats was pressed beside the Rhine;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The while their horses rested each tethered safe in stall:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The keel slid onward so smoothly, no hurt might to these befall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 52}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The wind in the strong-twined sail-ropes drew with unresting might:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Twice ten miles onward they fleeted ere sank over earth the night;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Down stream so slid they seaward with a breeze that followed fast.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —Ah me, but their stalwart labour brought sorrow enow at the last!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now with the twelfth day’s dawning, as singeth the ancient lay,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The wind in the white sails straining had borne them far on their way\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto Isenstein the fortress, the hold in Brunhild’s land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All strange, save only to Siegfried, it seemed to that warrior-band.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When its coronal of towers was beheld of Gunther the King,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the land’s wide-sweeping marches, he spake sore marvelling:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Make answer to me, friend Siegfried, dost thou know yonder strand?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto whom appertain these castles, unto whom that lordly land?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never in all my life-days—this thing I needs must own—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fortress so goodly-builded mine eyes unto me have shown,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No, not in any country, as this that here we see.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He which could rear it skyward, a mighty man was he!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered and spake to him Siegfried: “Yea, well do I know all these:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The land and its diadem fortress, they be Brunhild’s seignories,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Isenstein yon fortress, even that whereof I have told:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There many a lovely lady this day shall your eyes behold.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now hearken my counsel, ye heroes: be ye one and all in a tale,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with one accord affirm ye—this only, I trow, shall avail:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For if to the presence of Brunhild this day we go, I ween,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We must needs be exceeding wary who stand before that queen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When we see that lovely lady amidst her knightly train,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One thing, O far-famed heroes, must ye for truth maintain,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How that Gunther is my liege-lord, and I his vassal alone:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So that which his heart hath longed for shall by this device be won[7].”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 53}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the heroes all consented, even as he counselled, to do.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Was none so proud of spirit that he dared say nay thereto.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So they spake even after his bidding; and for them full well was it done,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Gunther the King beheld her, Brunhild the lovely one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thus I abase me,” said Siegfried, “not for thy love alone,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But to win thy sister, the fairest of maidens, for mine own.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She is unto me as mine own soul, she is dear unto me as my life.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Blithe am I to render service that shall get her to me for wife.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90333.html","bookId":422,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM","modification":"Aug
