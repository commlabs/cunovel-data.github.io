Intense fury exploded out from within his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heavenly Pursuit Tribe!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huyan Yunming, you cretin!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Violet Sea roared and coldness spread out in all directions, causing something that appeared like snowflakes to appear in the air. Within the outpost, all of the Cultivators were incapable of preventing a shudder from passing through their bodies. As for the ones near Meng Hao, they started to shake as they looked over at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFigures appeared, surrounding Meng Hao, nine Nascent Soul Cultivators. The two old experts who were in charge of the outpost also appeared, floating in mid-air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, the spell formation in the outpost activated completely. Roaring sounds echoed about as the entire area was enveloped with an enormous pressure that constantly pushed down on Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng Hao,” said the black-robed old man, “you ruthlessly slaughtered Conclave members of the Heavenly Court Alliance. Now you dare to show your face in this outpost? We have come here today to take your head!” Even as his voice echoed about the city, dozens of Alliance members appeared in the area. They sat there cross-legged, maintaining the rotation of the spell formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes were bright red, and his heart dripped with blood. He did not kill Huyan Qing; in fact, in an attempt to prevent any misunderstandings, he annihilated the Black Bat and brought its head to offer explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe simply didn’t believe that Patriarch Huyan, with his level of Cultivation base and powers of insight, would not be able to read the clues surrounding Huyan Qing’s death. Now he could see clearly that the damnable Huyan had no intention of discussing matters rationally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patriarch Huyan, since you’re so dead set on dragging me into the matter, then… go ahead and consider Huyan Qing to have been killed by Meng Hao!” Setting his jaw with determination, he slapped his bag of holding to produce the head of the Black Bat. Before, he had viewed the head as all the proof needed to explain things clearly. Now, he simply waved his hand, causing it to explode into ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the head transformed into ash, the killing intent in Meng Hao’s eyes exploded to incredible heights. His aura suddenly became icy to a shocking extent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, as long as I, Meng Hao, am alive on this earth, I will wipe out your Tribe and all your bloodlines!” With that, Meng Hao waved his sleeve, causing a powerful wind to kick up. It swept the dozens of Golden Crow Tribe members up off the racks and then deposited them on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, the wind transformed into life force, which nourished Wu Ling and the others, restoring them to health. As for the dead Tribe members, there was nothing that could be done for them now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncluding Wu Ling, there were four or five original Crow Divinity Tribe members who had traveled the long campaign trail with Meng Hao. When they saw Meng Hao, their bodies trembled and their eyes filled with intense excitement and determination. They immediately knelt and kowtowed to Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the loudest voices they could possibly muster, they shouted out, releasing all the pressure and hope that existed within their hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Sacred Ancient!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Tribe members were people who had been born in the past hundred years. They had never seen Meng Hao before, but they had seen his statue. Now that they were able to personally lay eyes on this most senior member of the Tribe, they began to tremble. Their faces pale, they ignored the weakened state of their body to drop to their knees and kowtow. They too shouted:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Sacred Ancient!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir voices echoed out in all directions. When you added the words spoken by the black-robed old man, whose tone made it sound as if he were facing a mortal enemy, the rest of the Cultivators in the seventh outpost felt their hearts shaking. Their eyes went wide as they looked at Meng Hao. Now that they thought about it, all of them had heard legends about Meng Hao during the past hundred years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a single exception, the legends spoke of how Meng Hao had single-handedly led his Tribe out from the Western Desert North region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That really is Meng Hao!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The totemic Sacred Ancient of the Golden Crow Tribe! So, that’s him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meng Hao’s aura billowed up, and the surrounding Cultivators recognized who he was, cries of alarm could be heard. The faces of the nine Nascent Soul Cultivators from the Heavenly Court Alliance, as well as the two old men, instantly changed. They clenched their teeth and attacked, shooting directly toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the roaring power of the spell formation descended onto Meng Hao. It was like some sort of intense pressure that caused his Cultivation base to weaken, limiting him to the mid Nascent Soul stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the full power of a spell formation that had been constructed by a Spirit Severing Patriarch of the Heavenly Court Alliance. Its power was extraordinary. Were it not, it wouldn’t have been set up as the ultimate weapon of the great outpost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven someone of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage would be severely weakened by the intense pressure from the spell formation. It was also this incredible power that caused the two old men stationed here to be so confident in being able to fight Meng Hao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time that the power of the spell formation descended, eleven Nascent Soul Cultivators appeared near Meng Hao, filled with killing intent. A blast of brilliant color could be seen as magical items, divine abilities, magical techniques, and totems were all unleashed in attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might be a totemic Sacred Ancient, but once you enter our outpost’s spell formation, your fate is sealed…. You’re dead for sure!” Cold laughter rang out, only to be interrupted by a shocking roar that exploded out from none other than Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the sound roared out, Meng Hao’s voice could be heard, filled with sinister coldness and killing intent: “Third Anima!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice could be heard almost at the same time that the attacks of the incoming eleven Nascent Soul Cultivators appeared. These men were clearly going all out against Meng Hao. It was also then that all of their faces instantly flickered, and their hearts filled with an unprecedented feeling of terror. The feeling was such that they had no choice but to instantly retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they retreated, the light caused by the various divine abilities and magical items dissipated to reveal, right there in the middle of the spell formation, a man who looked like somewhat like an Immortal Devil. Meng Hao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hair whipped about his head. Now that he was in the Third Anima, he was filled with the power of four great circle Nascent Soul Cultivators. The spell formation which enveloped him, while previously invisible, could now be seen in the form of a large net.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe net glittered brightly and emitted groaning sounds as if it were under great strain. Popping sounds rang out, and fissures appeared. As the fissures spread out, Meng Hao’s aura exploded out fearsomely. The aura caused all of the Cultivators in the city to be completely astonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was especially true of the eleven Nascent Soul Cultivators. Their faces immediately filled with looks of disbelief, and they gasped. They couldn’t imagine how a Nascent Soul Cultivator could possibly fight back so strongly against the spell formation. From the look of it… the spell formation would be able to pin him down for only a very short period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately for them… their guesses were incorrect. Even as their faces fell and they speculated that Meng Hao wouldn’t be held in the spell formation for very long, the gigantic web suddenly collapsed into pieces and vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the spell formation vanished, the entire outpost suddenly shook. Blood sprayed from the mouths of the ten Alliance Tribe members who had been maintaining the spell formation. A moment later, their bodies directly exploded, transforming into hazes of blood and gore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spell formation was simply not qualified to hold out against Meng Hao. In the blink of an eye, it was completely destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment the spell formation was wiped out, Meng Hao strode forward and waved his arm toward the astonished eleven Nascent Soul Cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waving of his arm caused four times the battle prowess of a great circle Nascent Soul to explode out. It fused into the raging wind and exploded out. Bloodcurdling screams drifted out as nine of the eleven Nascent Soul Cultivators… were incapable of avoiding a force like that of crushing mountain. They could not dodge, nor could they resist. The wind cleaved the flesh from their bones and wiped away their screaming Nascent Souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine people… dead in an instant!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood sprayed from the mouths of the most powerful Cultivators, the two old men, as they tumbled backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just what kind of Cultivator is he!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not an ordinary great circle Nascent Soul Cultivation base…. That’s halfway to Spirit Severing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they tumbled backward, their physical bodies were shredded into pieces, leaving behind only their Nascent Souls. Letting out unprecedented shrieks of regret, they spared nothing in their attempts to flee at top speed, their hearts filled with ultimate terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene caused the rest of the Cultivators in the city to be filled with shock. They began trembling, their gazes filled with intense alarm and astonishment as they looked at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there, tall, hair flying about, his aura shocking to the extreme. The berserk aura of an Immortal Demon rose up, filled with killing intent. All of his fury had transformed into the desire to kill. All of that killing intent was focused on one thing…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiping out the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you kill one of my people, I’ll kill a hundred of yours. You kill a hundred of mine, I will wipe out all of yours!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI didn’t want to fight. I wanted to resolve the issue. I even came to this place with the head of the Black Bat for that very purpose. But, you place yourself on a pedestal. You believe yourself to be invincible. You saw no reason to talk reasonably with me. Well then, I might as well go to war!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s body suddenly flew up into the air. His eyes were red as he looked toward the two fleeing old men. He did not pursue them. Instead, he closed his eyes. His fury, his desire to kill, his determination, all transformed into an intense stimulation. It was a stimulation like tidewaters which poured into the blood-colored mask that rested inside his bag of holding. It reached inside and touched… the Blood Mastiff which had been asleep for nearly two hundred years!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had now slept until the point that it was ready to awaken. The sensation had continued to grow stronger to Meng Hao after the Heavenly Tribulation. At that time, he felt that even without outside stimulation, the Mastiff would awaken within a few months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you, my mastiff….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Awaken, my Blood Mastiff…. Together, we will bring war to the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mastiff… AWAKEN!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, the blood-colored mask inside his bag of holding began to shudder. The mastiff could sense Meng Hao’s wrath. It could feel how much he desired to slaughter the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe. It could tell that Meng Hao needed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, a tremor ran through the mastiff’s body. The blood-colored eyes which it had not opened for nearly two hundred years, suddenly… completely opened!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mastiff had awakened!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as it opened its eyes, a boundless bloody glow erupted out from Meng Hao. It filled the sky in all directions, rapidly covering the entire area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the two fleeing Nascent Souls could get very far, they were covered over by the bloody light. Piercing screams could be heard as the Nascent Souls melted into nothingness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a phrase that goes like this: “rewards come only with risk.” However, there is a second line to the phrase: “Risk can also bring death!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis chapter was sponsored by Anthony Guyomard\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-536\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-538\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-537","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
