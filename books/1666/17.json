My gaze traveled down the elegant slope of her neck, beyond the flimsy straps of her top. Her chest rose and fell erratically. The air around her was a dark violet, the sign of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was drawn to the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremor ran down the back of my neck, shooting down to the tips of my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really shouldn’t be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eased my hip onto the mattress, careful not to disturb her. What I did next was one of those things I knew I shouldn’t do but did anyway. Reaching out, I placed the tips of my fingers on her cheek and followed the straight line of the bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena’s breathing settled and deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight smile tipped my lips up. So trusting in her sleep that a simple touch comforted her? I wondered if she’d feel that way if she were awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not touch to comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze followed the path of my fingers, drifting over the curve of her stubborn jaw, down the fragile expanse of her neck. And she was fragile, more so than she knew, especially considering whom she and her unfortunate friend had pissed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd considering that I was in the same space as her, the statistics of her surviving any of this was really looking bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena stirred a little when my fingers edged under the thin strap. I waited, wondering if she’d wake up. The energy around her was calming, but specks of red were beginning to appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArousal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my other hand, I eased the sheet down and was supremely rewarded for hanging around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena didn’t sleep nude, but a tank top was a poor choice when it came to concealing her body. The heart-shaped neckline had slipped down on one side, revealing the soft swell and dusky peach tip of one breast. Now I knew I was right on the whole curves thing. This little adventure was proving to be fruitful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Touch me,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe moaned softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stilled, head cocked to the side as I studied. She was still asleep and definitely didn’t know what she was asking for, but that soft plea was my undoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t a flicker of hesitation when it came to what I did next. I wasn’t fooling myself or anyone. I wanted to touch her and so I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweeping the very tips of my fingers down to the sweet swell, I discovered that her skin felt like satin and was warm—so incredibly warm and unlike my own kind. And that was why she was in such a precarious position. We flocked toward warmth, and with all that glorious sunlight-colored hair spilled across the pillows, she was in a world of trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned over her, inhaling deeply. Vanilla… and peach filled my senses. One belonged to the bottles in the bathroom, but the peachy scent was hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI traced a circle around her hardening nipple. With each pass, I drew closer to the puckering bud and pushed the annoying material farther down until finally my thumb brushed over the tight bead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena moaned sweetly, and I bit back a growl as my sex swelled in response. It wasn’t the only thing swelling. As she threw off more energy, a different kind of hunger was building inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth were equally powerful, and although I had learned to deny the latter, I hadn’t figured out how to resist the call of the cock yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably never would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted more. Hell, I wanted to spread her thighs and sink deep inside her, but as I trailed my fingers over the dip of her concave belly, Serena’s body started to move languidly. Caught by the sensual slide of her hips, thoughts of completely taking her slipped into the back of my mind. My cock was stiff and erect, but I was fascinated by her response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer movements caused the hem of her tank top to inch up, baring her to my eager gaze, and, goddamn, this adventure was more than just fruitful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena was bare under the top, the delicate valley of her sex there for me to feast upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo feast? Fuck that. I wanted to devour her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands were on her thighs, savoring the supple skin as I spread them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the tips of my fingers brushed the apex, her back arched, bowing completely off the bed. Her moan of pleasure broke the silence. I couldn’t stop my response, not for the life of me. A violent jolt of lust fired through my veins and my answering growl shattered the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena gasped and her eyes snapped open; the air around her crackling with reds and violets as she jerked up in bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled back, slipping into the deep shadows of the room, easily becoming a part of them. I remained there, torn between wanting to kick myself in the balls for having to expel the power required to stay hidden, and the other option, which involved us, the bed, and possibly the wall, and a lot of body slamming sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena stared hard into the darkness of the room, one hand scrambling to adjust her top while the other smacked around for the blanket. It was almost cute, I thought, except I didn’t do cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wanted to do her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTugging the blanket all the way up to her chin, her gaze bounced around the room, but I knew it was useless. She couldn’t see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?” she said, voice thick and husky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr possibly she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the fuckadeefuck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena couldn’t see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way, but then her eyes fixed on where I stood, and I knew she could feel me watching her, probably even wanting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, shit was real awkward the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Serena knew what went on the night before, she didn’t say anything, but the slivers of red sliding through her aura was driving me bat-shit crazy with unquenched lust. And that need fed another. It wasn’t like I could leave. So I was stuck here, and with every passing hour I was getting more and more agitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn’t going to last long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like winning the lottery when Serena dozed off on the couch in the afternoon, sleeping away several hours, providing a respite of sorts. I checked my cell a dozen times over. Nothing from the dipshit officers, and the only way I could get the officers here and Serena out of my house was to get information from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I needed to get her out of the house sooner than later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanting to crawl out of my human skin, I started to make dinner. Cooking… cooking was one of the few calming things in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother gave me shit about it, so did Dex. Fuck them, because I was a great cook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I really needed to do was take my true form for a few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena entered the kitchen then, looking disheveled and rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. She bent over in front of the fridge and grabbed a bottle of water. The thin material of her cotton shorts strained over her ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNah, what I really needed was to fuck Serena senseless and then take my true form for a few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cock was all kinds of happy about the idea, and I wanted to pick her up, strip the clothes off her, and lay her bare on the kitchen island. Discover a different kind of taste, and then sink into her repeatedly. Lose myself in her softness and warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re making dinner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena’s voice shattered my fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked and looked down. There was a knife in my hands, chicken cutlets on the cutting board, and a box of pasta ready to be boiled. Huh. I’d completely forgotten what I’d been doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess so,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pasta with chicken.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood on the other side of the island, sliding the water bottle back and forth in her hands. “Can I help?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first response was to tell her no, but this could be beneficial. I’d wasted enough time fucking around, staring at sandwiches, stealing kisses and touches, and feeding from a human female. Yeah, it was time to get this show on the road. “You can grab the skillet and the olive oil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena grabbed a pan from the rack, placed it on the stove, and then started rummaging through the cabinets. When she found the bottle of oil, she regarded me cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you like to cook?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing the thick length of hair over her shoulder, she then poured the oil. I wondered how dark her hair was wet. I bet it was a light brown, matching the delicate brows arched over her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDELICATE BROWS? What the fuck was happening to my brain? Returning my attention to the last chicken breasts, I slammed the knife through them, nearly embedding the blade into the cutting board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like to cook, too,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena said tentatively, as if she wasn’t sure if she should continue to speak after my samurai swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not that good, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried making Rice Krispies treats once while Footloose was on the TV, and it was the big dance scene in the warehouse, so I didn’t want to miss it. I left the spatula in the pan and when I got back, half of it had melted into the mix.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arched a brow. “That will happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In my defense, I was fourteen and easily distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom wouldn’t let me near the stove for years after that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inched her way to the island and went back to messing with the water bottle. A faint blue aura shimmered around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was nervous. “I’m mostly a microwave and carry-out type of girl, but I always wished I could be like the cooks on TV.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze slid over her downturned face. A faint blush covered her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThick lashes swept up and her eyes met mine for a moment, then she quickly looked away. Tucking her hair back behind one ear, she pressed her lips together. The air around her vibrated a deeper blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here,” I said, my mouth doing the flapping thing again as I pointed the knife toward the chicken and then the two bowls. “Dip the chicken in the eggs first, then roll them in the bowl with the bread crumbs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer chin jerked up, surprise flickering across her face. For a moment, she didn’t move and then she nodded. “Let me wash my hands first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t worried about germs. Wasn’t like I could get sick, not like Serena could. When she returned to the island, she squeezed in next to me as she arranged the bowls— eggs first and then the crumbs. The space was crowded and I could’ve moved over to give her more room, but I didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked crowding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead,” I urged when her hands hovered over the chicken. “It’s not that hard and I won’t turn the TV on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile played over her lips. “I’m not that easily distracted now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bent down, so that my lips were a hairbreadth from her cheek. “I bet you’re just as easily distracted as you were at fourteen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena dropped the slice of chicken in the bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatery yolk splattered across the counter as her cheeks went bloodred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are so wrong,” she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckled. “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching Serena dutifully dip the slices of chicken was sort of amusing in a weird way. I never cooked with anyone before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, I never cooked for anyone before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I was cooking for Serena in the first place. I was hungry and I ate a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I turned the stove on and watched the oil start to bubble, Serena chatted about her mom, stopping every few moments to glance at me, as if she were testing my annoyance level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you never met your father?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head as she carried the plate of breaded chicken to the stove. “Nope. Absentee sperm donor. What about you? I mean, your kind has parents, right?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsession/page-17.html","bookId":1666,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM"}
