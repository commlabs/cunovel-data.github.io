It is not your place to step in here, Stephan. I let that happen once, but I will be damned if it happens again. No one stands between me and Bianca, and that includes you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not up to you. I’ll be here for Bianca whenever she needs me.” Stephan looked at me, having to crane his neck to do so. “You okay, Bee?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, hoping that would be enough to defuse the situation. It wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Walk away, Stephan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephan shook his head. “No. I can’t do that. I don’t feel comfortable with this. You look like you’re ready to kill somebody, James. I’ve never seen you like this, and I’m not leaving my girl alone with you until you’ve calmed down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your girl?” James growled, gripping the other man’s shirt in his fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw that things were going to quickly get out of hand. I laid a hand on Mr. Cavendish’s back. It wasn’t comforting that a tremor ran through him at my touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“James. Take me upstairs. Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did the trick, thank God. James released the other man, taking a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Stephan. “We’re okay, Stephan. He’s upset, but he has impeccable self-control. You never have to worry about me with James, and he and I have some issues that we need to work out on our own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephan studied me carefully, trying to figure me out, but he took my words in and finally just nodded. “I’m here for you if you need me. Always.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “I know it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames hooked a finger into my collar, gripped the back of my neck lightly and began to lead me upstairs without a word. He was in a state, and every obstacle between us and privacy was just antagonizing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut and locked the bedroom door behind us with a sharp and very definitive click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him loosening his tie as he strode directly to the elevator. He pressed the button and it opened instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get in,” he said brusquely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped out of my shoes and walked inside. He followed me in, and we descended to the fourth floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reticent\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hooked a finger into my collar when the car opened, leading me down that long hallway. He stopped short of the playground, instead opening a door just before it on the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven feeling nervous and anxious, I was beyond curious to see what was in there. It didn’t bode well though, that he was only taking me there now that he was in this mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a rather small and nondescript room, holding nothing but one twin bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get on the bed,” he said in that worrisome voice. “On your stomach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did it, turning my head to look up at him as he approached my prone figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t look at me,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my head away quickly, feeling stung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Arms above your head,” he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI complied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe secured my hands and feet together and to the small bed. I tugged experimentally, and saw that he’d left me quite a bit of slack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tensed when I felt him pulling at my clothes. A loud tearing sound told me that he was cutting them off. I was bare when he was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“James,” I began again. Maybe now that I was restrained he would feel calmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t. I don’t trust myself right now,” he said in a gruff voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe adjusted my head, wedging a soft pillow there. “Go to sleep. You were up all night, and I need to go get myself in hand. We’ll talk later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could respond he was turning out the light, shutting the door and a loud lock was clicking into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t believe it. After all of that rage, he’d just left me. He knew that this was the punishment I hated the most, with the suspense and the unanswered questions, and he’d left me in the dark. In a cell. The bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had some dark thoughts about him for quite a while in that pitch-black room before I was able to relax my mind enough to let sleep take me. He hadn’t left me so much as a light under the locked door. I was shut in tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI awoke as the door opened and a stream of light from the hallway fell across me. I turned my face away. The overhead light switched on. My restraints were already loose, but Mr. Cavendish added some slack to the rope, pulling me up by the shoulders until I was sitting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squinted at him, my eyes still adjusting to the sudden light. He was shirtless and sweaty, his hair tied back. He held a plate of food on his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe untied my hands, put the plate in my lap, and turned away. I watched his stiff back for a while, wondering what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ate. Because I was hungry, and because I was hoping that if I ate that James would start talking when I was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ate maybe half of the seasoned chicken, brown rice, and spinach before I handed it back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took it without a word, stood up, and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had turned off the light then shut and locked the door before I realized his intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“James!” I shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so frustrated that I screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so furious and anxious that it took me even longer to relax into sleep that time. Eventually my body just gave into the relentless darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I woke again it was still dark, but there was the faintest line of light showing through the side of the door. It was ajar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up, testing my wrists and ankles. I was free. I moved slowly to the door, pushing it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to squint against the bright hallway light. I blinked away the darkness for long moments while I took in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames sat in a chair that was set against the wall, wearing nothing but his boxers. He was slumped forward, his head in his hands, his elbows on his knees. It was such a defeated posture for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI approached him slowly, tentatively. I couldn’t tell if he was napping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“James,” I said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call me Mr. Cavendish,” he said in a low voice. He didn’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d been so angry with him, furious really, but it drained from me more quickly than I would have thought possible as I took him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was like a wounded animal just then, and I only wanted to make it better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt in front of him. I touched his head, and he sat up, giving me a very mean look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted closer, moving between his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped my throat. “Why?” he asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, wetting my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched the action with rapt attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did I go see Sven without security?” I asked, for clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. That.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was nervous about meeting him. I had a hard time even going. I knew it would be perfectly safe, since we’d be in a crowded public place in broad daylight. I saw no threat, and I wanted to have a normal meeting. My security team makes me nervous. I can’t even imagine what an outsider looking in would think of the whole mess. I just wanted some semblance of a normal first meeting with him. That’s all. I’m sorry I worried you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Worried me? Is that what you call it? I have that team guarding you, Bianca, because it’s the only way that I can bear for you to leave my sight. There is a man out there, a man who has killed at least two women, and he wants to kill you. He is unhinged, and completely unpredictable. The only thing we can predict is his grudge against you. Do you know what that does to me? You are more precious to me than my own life, by far. It’s not even a question. I would do anything for you. All I ask is that you let me protect you from a known threat. How could you be so careless, Bianca? So insensitive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to respond and he covered it with his other hand, his lip curling into a snarl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your father has been missing for weeks. We can only place his whereabouts at one place almost a week ago, and that is because a body marked the spot. He could be literally anywhere. And all he would have to do to see that you were in New York would be to look online. The paparazzi have mapped your weekly route with neon lights. I understand that you wanted to meet your half-brother. I wasn’t trying to keep you from it. All I asked was that you take your bodyguards with you. Your father and brother could have been working together. Your brother could have been luring you there. They could have taken you before anyone could have stopped them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to protest even through his hand, but his eyes stopped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t. Just because it didn’t happen doesn’t mean that you were safe. You weren’t safe. A man with a gun wants you dead. It would only take one fucking bullet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were terrible with anguish, and I knew that the fear was getting to him. He was doing everything he could, and I was still in danger. He felt like he was failing me, and it was eating him up inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe uncovered my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spoke quietly. “I’m sorry. I thought I’d be there and back before you knew. I didn’t mean to do that to you. I swear I won’t ditch my security again. At least, not until my father is found.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut his eyes and nodded. “When I couldn’t get ahold of you, and Blake told me she’d found your phone by our bed, I thought you’d left me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brow furrowed. “Why would you think I’d left you? I don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand at my neck moved and gripped into my hair. “No. No answers until you’ve been punished.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI licked my lips nervously. “That cell back there wasn’t a punishment?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “That was a nap. And a chance for me to work off some aggression at the gym. No more questions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis other hand began to tug off his boxer briefs, and I tried to look down at what he was doing, but the hand in my hair held me fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed my head down to his bared erection. He pushed himself into my mouth, and I sucked at him, thinking that this part was no punishment at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe guided my head up and down no more than four times before he was coming deep in my throat. I nearly gagged, I was so surprised. It was unusual for him to come so fast. His control over his own release constantly amazed me, though I supposed that it shouldn’t have, since he was so good at controlling mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me off him mid-cum, pulling me up to my feet while I could see his cock still twitching with his orgasm. I murmured a protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slapped my ass, hard, then hooked his finger into my collar. He began to pull me, but not to the playground. He headed in the opposite direction, back to that cell. I had to swallow a protest. I didn’t want to be left in there again, but I knew that it was all in his hands now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kneel on the ground,” he told me as he let go of my collar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI obeyed, watching him. He moved to the small bed. He had it retracting into the wall with one touch of his finger. I hadn’t known it was that kind of bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne touch to the wall and he had something large descending from the ceiling. I watched with wide eyes as a large X lowered in front of me. It was the same height as James, which gave me a good idea what it was for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is what’s called a St. Andrew’s cross,” he told me quietly. That was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me up with a finger in my collar and a fist in my hair. He pressed my front hard into that ominous X. He strapped my wrists and ankles to it nice and quick, before pressing his body hard to my back. I felt his erection against my butt and tried to arch into it. He slapped my ass hard before moving away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/grounded-up-in-the-air-3/page-32.html","bookId":1928,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:16 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:16 AM"}
