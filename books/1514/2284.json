Never did they imagine that this domineering Mo Luo would actually allow Lin Dong to enter…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Esteemed one.” The grey haired old man involuntarily parted his mouth as he tried to speak up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before he could finish his sentence, Mo Luo immediately turned and stared at him. A red glow flickered in his scarlet-red eyes, sufficiently frightening the grey haired man into quickly shutting his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have already spoken. Anyone else who dares to enter the Thunder World will die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMo Luo’s eyes slowly swept over the many experts present in the hall. His indifferent voice caused their scalps to turn numb. However, no one dared to retort. Even the Huo Yuan trio, whom now wore gloomy expression on their faces, did not dare to speak up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I also wish to enter.” Mu Lingshan curled her small mouth and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong nodded gently. He was a little worried about leaving Mu Lingshan alone in this place. After all, the Mysterious Sky Hall, Nine Serene Gate, Huo Yuan and the rest, had malicious intent towards him. Hence, they might end up dragging Mu Lingshan into the fight because of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMo Luo hesitated for a moment before nodding. Without further ado, he turned around and headed into the spatial vortex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong cried out softly towards Mu Lingshan before he also quickly followed behind. Both of them turned into two rays of bright light, which closely followed Mo Luo and entered the spatial vortex in front of countless pairs of jealous eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuzz!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red light suddenly surged on the swirl after the trio entered. Immediately, crimson flames rose and spread, covering the entire swirl. Clearly, Mo Luo had sealed the entrance. As such, this completely dismissed the possibility for anyone else to enter the swirl...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damnit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grey haired old man and the others were so furious that their faces turned green upon witnessing this scene. Fury flashed across their eyes as they involuntarily cursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as they were about to reach the prized treasure hidden in the deepest part of the cave, Mo Luo’s appearance stripped them of the rights to do so. How could this not drive them insane?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough they were furious, none of them could resist under Mo Luo’s pressure. Hence, all they could do now was to stare at spatial entrance, which was now sealed by flames, and wallow in despair…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything in Lin Dong’s vision turned dark the moment he charged into the spatial vortex. In an instant, a glaring silver light suddenly appeared in his vision. Soon after, a continuous stream of thunder, accompanied by an indescribable might, reverberated beside Lin Dong’s ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s narrowed eyes slowly widened up. After which, he surveyed this seemingly endless vast space that had appeared before his eyes. This was the Thunder World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless hundred thousand feet large thunderbolts, that looked like ancient lightning dragons, whistled and flashed across this place. Suddenly, a thunder roar spread, making this scene so spectacular that it could not be described with words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the Thunder World, huh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong lifted his head. His dark black eyes reflected countless number of thunderbolts. He quickly inhaled a deep breath of air as he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. This is the Thunder World created by the owner of the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol.” Standing in front of him, Mo Luo calmly surveyed the Thunder World. Those thunderbolts, that were powerful enough to reduce a Profound Death stage expert into dust, would automatically disappear when they landed within a thousand feet radius around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lin Dong, I need your help.” Mo Luo turned his head, looked at Lin Dong and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong was startled upon hearing this. Given his current strength, what could he possibly do for Mo Luo?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since you are aware of the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol, I believe that you should also know why this cave was wrecked till such an extent, am I right?” Mo Luo asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is because of the Yimos...” Lin Dong nodded and replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was a king grade and three general grade Yimos who attacked the Lightning Cave back then. The three general grade Yimos were killed by the Lightning Emperor, while the king grade Yimo was sealed by him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The goal of my trip is that sealed king grade Yimo.” Mo Luo spoke casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elder Mo Luo is planning… on killing the sealed king grade Yimo?” Lin Dong’s heart shuddered as he spoke in a startled voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMo Luo slowly nodded. Both his eyes were scarlet red as he stared at the deep parts of this Thunder World. He said, “Since you are the Devouring Ancestral Symbol’s owner, it is likely that you should know about the Yimo. These creatures do not belong on our plane. They are natural born destroyers and they are the common enemies of everyone in this plane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong nodded. He was aware of the terrifying erosion properties these Yimo had based on some of the memory fragments from the ancient times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These Yimo are not only powerful, but they are also extremely tough. It is no easy feat to kill them. An Yimo, which had stepped into the king grade, is even harder to kill…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong mused and said, “In order to kill an Yimo of such level… it seems like it will require the strength of two Ancestral Symbols.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis piece of information was naturally something that Lin Dong had obtained from the Great Desolate Tablet. Moreover, he had even promised the latter that he would find a second Ancestral Symbol and head back to help it completely eliminate the king grade Yimo sealed within the Great Desolate Tablet...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since you possess the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, together with my Blazing Ancestral Symbol, we should be able to kill that king grade Yimo.” Mo Luo nodded and replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold sweat appeared on Lin Dong’s head. Mo Luo truly thought too highly of him. He actually wanted him to assist him in killing a king grade Yimo. That was a Reincarnation Stage expert…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax, that king level Yimo has already been sealed for thousands of years. Although it is still alive, its strength has been greatly reduced. I will be the main attacker this time around. All you need to do is to assist me from the side.” Mo Luo said after seemingly having spotted the uncertainty in Lin Dong’s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong nodded. What else could he say now? Mo Luo did not mention the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol, but Lin Dong understood that Mo Luo likely had some designs on the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol as well. Moreover, the latter should also be clearly aware that, Lin Dong, who possessed the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, had the ability to own multiple Ancestral Symbols...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe offensive strength of the Devouring Ancestral Symbol might not match the Blazing Ancestral Symbol, but it possessed a terrifying ability. That was the ability to absorb other Ancestral Symbols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe both of them had a tacit understanding and they did not mention what they were going to do with the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol. This was because they, the owners of the Ancestral Symbols, could be considered sworn enemies of the Yimo. Naturally, dealing with the Yimo was the top priority in such a situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol could be discussed after finishing off that king grade Yimo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lingshan, be careful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong turned his head and reminded Mu Lingshan. Their opponent was not going to be some mediocre pushover…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, a solemn expression uncharacteristically appeared on Mu Lingshan’s. It was likely that she had also vaguely detected the dangers of this Thunder World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMo Luo waved his sleeve before a fire sphere spread from within his body. After which, it wrapped the Lin Dong duo inside it. His body moved and he carried the two of them as they rushed towards the deep parts of the Thunder World, which was densely packed with lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMo Luo was extremely fast. He seemed to have teleported as he gradually approached the deep parts of the Thunder World within a few minutes. Soon after, the lightning sea region appeared in front of Lin Dong’s sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis lightning sea was vast and boundless and thunderbolts surged on this sea. There were also silver thunderbolts covering the sky above. The explosive rumbling thunder sound was just like the might of the heavens, stirring one’s soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bodies of the Lin Dong trio gradually hovered in mid-air above this lightning sea. After which, he lifted his head and saw that the sky above the lightning sea region had a silver coloured altar. The altar had ten thousand lightning steps and there was a throne located at the peak of the altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTens of thousands of lightning fell around the throne and the space was distorted. A human figure seemed to be seated alone on the throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat human figure did not look extremely muscular and he even looked a little scrawny. However, this scrawny figure was emitting a terrifying aura that caused even the sky and earth to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is the owner of the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol… the Lightning Emperor huh…” Lin Dong looked at the figure on the throne. The monstrous aura of the latter however, was void of life. It was obvious that he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMo Luo nodded. However, his eyes were looking at the air above the altar. There was an unknown ripple in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thought passed through Lin Dong’s heart before he promptly lifted his head. After which, he saw a ten thousand feet large lightning cluster suspended in the distant sky. At a glance, it appeared as though it was a sun created from lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong could sense an extremely terrifying, yet familiar fluctuation from within the lightning sun…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunderbolt Ancestral Symbol!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s eyes suddenly turned searing hot!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-970\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-972\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-971","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM"}
