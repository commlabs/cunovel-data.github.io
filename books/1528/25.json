The rare ones. True chovihanis. Those with the gift. Those were who he sought.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth shifted straighter. “My father was doing the same with yogis of India. Taking DNA samples, looking for some commonality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray remembered how her father sought out those rare cases of documented yogis and mystics, those who demonstrated heightened abilities of intuition or instinct. The fortune-telling and tarot-card reading of the Gypsies would fit that mold. But the genetic angle was new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt raised another question in Gray’s mind. “Why the sudden switch from studying yogis to Gypsies? What’s the connection?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca stared at him as if he were dense. “Where do you think the Romani clans come from?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Gray’s turn to be baffled. He actually didn’t know much about the nomadic Gypsy clans, certainly not their origins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca noted his confusion. “Not many know our story. When our clans first moved into Europe, we were thought to have come from Egypt.” He rubbed the back of his hand across his burnished face. “Because of our dark skin, dark eyes. We were called aigyptoi or Gyptians, which later became the word Gypsies. Until only recently, even our clans were unsure of our origins. But linguists recently discovered that the Romani tongue has its roots in Sanskrit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The language of ancient India,” Gray said, surprised, but he was beginning to understand the connection now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We arose from India. That is amaro baro them, our ancestral homeland. Northern India, to be precise, the Punjab region.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But why did you migrate away?” Elizabeth asked. “From what I understand of your history, you had a hard time in Europe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hard time? We were persecuted, hunted, killed.” Fire entered his voice. “We died by the hundreds of thousands at the hands of the Nazis, forced to wear the Black Triangle. Bengesko niamso!” This last was plainly a curse at the Nazis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth glanced away from his vehemence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca shook his head, calming himself. “Not much is known about our early past. Even historians can’t say for certain why the clans left India. From old records, we know the Romani clans fled India sometime in the tenth century, passing through Persia to the empire of Byzantium and beyond. War plagued northwest India during that time. Also India had come to adopt a strict caste system. Those left at the bottom, classified as casteless, were deemed untouchable. These included thieves, musicians, dishonored warriors, but also magicians, those whose abilities were considered heretical by the local religions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your chovihanis,” Gray said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca nodded. “Life became unbearable, unsafe. So the casteless banded together into clans and left India, headed west, for more welcoming lands.” He snorted bitterly. “We are still searching.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s get back to Dr. Polk,” Gray said, redirecting the conversation. “Did you cooperate with the professor’s request? Did you supply him with those samples?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We did. A payment in blood. In exchange for his help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray studied the man. “Help in doing what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice fired up again. “To find something stolen most brutally from us. The very heart of our people. We—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane bumped violently. Glasses rose in the air, as did Kowalski. He scrabbled from his blanket with a shout of surprise. Gray, belted in his seat, felt his stomach climb into his throat. They lost elevation fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot came on over the intercom. “Sorry about that, folks. Hard air ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole plane shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Buckle in tight,” the pilot continued. “We’ll have you on the ground in another hour. And, Commander Pierce, we have a land-to-air call for you coming from Director Crowe. I’ll patch it back to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray motioned everyone into their seats. Kowalski had raised his seat back and was already snugging his belt tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwiveling his own chair away from the others, Gray removed the phone from his armrest and lifted it to his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Commander Pierce here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gray, I thought I’d brief you on what Lisa and Malcolm learned about the device attached to the skull.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Gray listened to the director explain about microelectrodes and autistic savants, he stared out the window. He watched the sun settle to the west as the jet screamed to the east. He pictured the girl’s small face, her fragility, her innocence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least she was safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a question nagged at Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre there others like her out there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12:22 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouthern Ural Mountains\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk ran with Pyotr in his arms alongside the streambed. The boy clung to him. His eyes were still glassy, his face damp with both sweat and tears. Kiska raced ahead, following the long lope of Marta, who knuckled with both arms. Konstantin kept to Monk’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do we know what Pyotr saw was real?” Monk gasped out to Konstantin. “Tigers? Maybe it was just a daydream, a waking nightmare.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older boy turned slightly and pulled his wool cap up. He combed back his hair to reveal a shiny curve of steel behind his ear. “You were not the only one operated on.” He pulled down his cap and nodded to Pyotr. “What he saw was no dream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk struggled to comprehend. Konstantin had already explained how Monk had ended up here, rescued from a sinking cruise ship, based on a drawing done by Pyotr’s sister. It made no sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he was the one dreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin continued, “There are two Siberian tigers kept at the Menagerie. Arkady and Zakhar. The soldiers sometimes hunt with them in the deep forest. Wild boar and elk. They are very smart. Not easy to fool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How far away?” Monk asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin spoke in Russian to the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyotr answered in the same tongue. As he spoke, his voice grew firmer, coming more fully out of his trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin finally nodded. “He does not know. Only that they are coming. He can taste their hunger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk hurried them down the stream to where it emptied into a wider river. He heard the rush of water before seeing the course. It dug a deep channel. If they could get across—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething screamed into the air. High overhead and farther back up the narrow valley. It kept on wailing, piercing like a siren. It made his teeth ache and vibrated his bones. The children dropped flat to the ground, covering their heads and rolling in agony. Marta hooted and trotted a protective ring around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCringing against the noise, Monk peered up between spruce branches. Something wafted down into the back half of the valley. It drifted on a red parachute, like a flare, but it carried a round metal object the size of a baseball. The piercing wail came from it. Some sort of sonic flare. Climbing on a boulder, Monk spotted other red pinpricks in the distance. More flares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hopped down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey must be blindly strafing in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frantic crashing erupted on the far side of the stream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk caught a flash of tawny fur. His heart thudded in panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, two roe deer smashed into view, and with a flash of dancing hooves, they darted away. Monk forced his heart out of his throat and crossed to the children. The sonic blast had flattened them. The hunters knew of the kids’ hypersensitivity and were trying to immobilize them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk scooped Pyotr up with his stumped arm and tossed him across his shoulder. He dragged Kiska to her feet and supported her around the waist, hiking her up. Burdened, Monk crossed to Konstantin, intending to kick the boy into action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dared not stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarta intervened. She nosed under Konstantin’s chest and pulled one of his arms over her back. Supporting him with her shoulders, she sidled down toward the river below. The boy’s legs dragged behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk followed with the other two children. While deafened by the sonic flare, Monk still felt the boy’s trembling moans of agony. He hobbled faster and reached the river’s course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water flowed through a steep-banked channel, a full four meters wide. It churned and gurgled, loud enough to dull the sharper ranges of the sonic flare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk waved to Marta. He pointed downriver. She swung in that direction. They continued, following the twisting course. After a few turns, the steep ridges blocked more and more of the wailing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiska stirred first. She knocked free of Monk’s arm and gained her own feet. She still covered her ears with her hands. Konstantin soon followed, freeing Marta, who panted and gasped, knuckling on both arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they fled from the screams, Monk kept a watch behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpecting at any moment to see a pair of tigers loping after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistracted, he ran into Kiska, who had stopped. Tangled, he toppled to his knees, dropping the boy to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin had also halted at his sister’s side, frozen in place with Marta. It seemed they had more to fear than just the hunters behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the pair, a massive brown bear rose up from the riverbank. It had to weigh six hundred pounds, damp from the river and plainly tense from the caterwauling of the flares. Black eyes stared back at their party. It rose up on its hind limbs, stretching eight feet tall, bristling, growling, baring yellow teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Russian grizzly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe symbol of Mother Russia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roar, it fell and charged straight at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:03 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWashington, D.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man woke into brightness. It stung his eyes and pounded into his skull. He groaned and turned his head away. Nausea spilled burning gorge up into his throat. He choked it back down with a gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked away the glare and found himself strapped to a bed. Though a sheet covered him, he knew he was naked. The room was stark white, clinical, sterile. No windows. A single door with a small barred window. Closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure sat in a chair beside the bed, in a suit, the jacket hung on the seat back, sleeves rolled up. His legs were crossed, his hands folded primly on his lap. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-oracle-sigma-force-5/page-25.html","bookId":1528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM"}
