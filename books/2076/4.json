{"id":111733,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u003cp\u003ePoppy was staring without appetite at a dinner tray of chicken nuggets and french fries when Dr. Franklin came in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tests were over. The CAT scan had been all right, if claustrophobic, but the ERCP had been awful. Poppy could still feel the ghost of the tube in her throat every time she swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re leaving all this great hospital food,\" Dr. Franklin said with gentle humor. Poppy managed a smile for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on talking about innocuous things. He didn\u0027t say anything about the test results, and Poppy had no idea when they were supposed to come in. She was suspicious of Dr. Franklin, though. Something about him, the gentle way he patted her foot under the blanket or the shadows around his eyes . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he casually suggested that Poppy\u0027s mother might want to \"come for a little walk down the hall,\" Poppy\u0027s suspicion crystallized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s going to tell her. He\u0027s got the results, but he doesn\u0027t want me to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer plan was made in the same instant. She yawned and said, \"Go on, Mom; I\u0027m a little bit sleepy.\" Then she lay back and shut her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they were gone, she got off the bed. She watched their retreating backs as they went down the hall into another doorway. Then, in her stocking feet, she quietly followed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was delayed for several minutes at the nursing station. \"Just stretching my legs,\" she said to a nurse who looked inquiringly at her, and she pretended to be walking at random. When the nurse picked up a clipboard and went into one of the patients\u0027 rooms, Poppy hurried on down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room at the end was the waiting room - she\u0027d seen it earlier. It had a TV and a complete kitchen setup so relatives could hang out in comfort. The door was ajar and Poppy approached it stealthily. She could hear the low rumble of Dr. Franklin\u0027s voice, but she couldn\u0027t hear what he was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery cautiously Poppy edged closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chanced one look around the door.She saw at once that there was no need for caution. Everyone in that room was completely occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Franklin was sitting on one of the couches. Beside him was an African-American woman with glasses on a chain around her neck. She was wearing the white coat of a doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other couch was Poppy\u0027s stepfather, Cliff. His normally perfect dark hair was slightly mussed, his rock-steady jaw was working. He had his arm around her mother. Dr. Franklin was talking to both of them, his hand on her mother\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Poppy\u0027s mother was sobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy pulled back from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my God. I\u0027ve got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never seen her mother cry before. Not when Poppy\u0027s grandmother had died, not during the divorce from Poppy\u0027s father. Her mother\u0027s specialty was coping with things; she was the best coper Poppy had ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got it. I\u0027ve definitely got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, maybe it wasn\u0027t so bad. Her mom was shocked, okay, that was natural. But it didn\u0027t mean that Poppy was going to die or anything. Poppy had all of modern medicine on her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept telling herself this as she edged away from the waiting room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t edge fast enough, though. Before she got out of earshot, she heard her mother\u0027s voice, raised in something like anguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My baby. Oh, my little girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Cliff, loud and angry: \"You\u0027re trying to tell me there\u0027s nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy couldn\u0027t feel her own breathing. Against her will, she moved back to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Loftus is an oncologist; an expert on this sort of cancer. She can explain better than I can,\" Dr. Franklin was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a new voice came - the other doctor. At first Poppy could only catch scattered phrases that didn\u0027t seem to mean anything: adenocarcinoma, splenic venous occlusion, Stage Three. Medical jargon. Then Dr. Loftus said, \"To put it simply, the problem is that the tumor has spread. It\u0027s spread to the liver and the lymph nodes around the pancreas. That means it\u0027s unresectable - we can\u0027t operate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff said, \"But chemotherapy . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We might try a combination of radiation and chemotherapy with something called 5-fluorouracil. We\u0027ve had some results with that. But I won\u0027t mislead you. At best it may improve her survival time by a few weeks. At this point, we\u0027re looking at palliative measures - ways to reduce her pain and improve the qualityof the time she has left. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy could hear choking sobs from her mother, but she couldn\u0027t seem to move. She felt as if she were listening to some play on the radio. As if it had nothing to do with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Franklin said, \"There are some research protocols right here in southern California. They\u0027re experimenting with immunotherapy and cryogenic surgery. Again, we\u0027re talking about palliation rather than a cure - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it!\" Cliff\u0027s voice was explosive. \"You\u0027re talking about a little girl! How did this get to - to Stage Three - without anybody noticing? This kid was dancing all night two days ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Hilgard, I\u0027m sorry,\" Dr. Loftus said so softly that Poppy could barely pick up the words. \"This kind of cancer is called a silent disease, because there are very few symptoms until it\u0027s very far advanced. That\u0027s why the survival rate is so low. And I have to tell you that Poppy is only the second teenager I\u0027ve seen with this kind of tumor. Dr. Franklin made an extremely acute diagnosis when he decided to send her in for testing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have known,\" Poppy\u0027s mother said in a thick voice. \"I should have made her come in sooner. I should have - I should have - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a banging sound. Poppy looked around the door, forgetting to be inconspicuous. Her mother was hitting the Formica table over and over. Cliff was trying to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy reeled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, I\u0027ve got to get out of here. I can\u0027t see this. I can\u0027t look at this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and walked back down the hall. Her legs moved. Just like always. Amazing that they still worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd everything around her was just like always. The nursing station was still decorated for the Fourth of July. Her suitcase was still on the padded window seat in her room. The hardwood floor was still solid underneath her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was the same - but how could it be? How could the walls be still standing? How could the TV be blaring in the next room?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to die, Poppy thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely enough, she didn\u0027t feel frightened. What she felt was vastly surprised. And the surprise kept coming, over and over, with every thought being interrupted by those four words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s my fault because (I\u0027m going to die) I didn\u0027t go to the doctor\u0027s sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff said \"damn\" for me (I\u0027m going to die). I didn\u0027t know he liked me enough to swear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind was racing wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in me, she thought. I\u0027m going to die because of something that\u0027s inside me, like that alien in the movie. It\u0027s in me right now. Right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put both hands to her stomach, then pulled up her T-shirt to stare at her abdomen. The skin was smooth, unblemished. She didn\u0027t feel any pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0027s in there and I\u0027m going to die because of it. Die soon. I wonder how soon? I didn\u0027t hear them talk about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need James.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy reached for the phone with a feeling that her hand was detached from her body. She dialed, thinking, Please be there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this time it didn\u0027t work. The phone rang and rang. When the answering machine came on, Poppy said, \"Call me at the hospital.\" Then she hung up and stared at the plastic pitcher of ice water by her bedside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027ll get in later, she thought. And then he\u0027ll call me. I just have to hang on until then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy wasn\u0027t sure why she thought this, but suddenly it was her goal. To hang on until she could talk to James. She didn\u0027t need to think about anything until then; she just had to survive. Once she talked to James, she could figure out what she was supposed to be feeling, what she was supposed to do now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a light knock at the door. Startled, Poppy looked up to see her mother and Cliff. For a moment all she could focus on was their faces, which gave her the strange illusion that the faces were floating in midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother had red and swollen eyes. Cliff was pale, like a piece of crumpled white paper, and his jaw looked stubbly and dark in contrast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my God, are they going to tell me? They can\u0027t; they can\u0027t make me listen to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy had the wild impulse to run. She was on the verge of panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her mother said, \"Sweetie, some of your friends are here to see you. Phil called them this afternoon to let them know you were in the hospital, and they just arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames, Poppy thought, something springing free in her chest. But James wasn\u0027t part of the group that came crowding through the doorway. It was mostly girls from school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0027t matter. He\u0027ll call later. I don\u0027t have to think now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a matter of fact, it was impossible to think with so many visitors in the room. And that was good. It was incredible that Poppy could sit there and talk to them when part of her was farther away than Neptune, but she did talk and that kept her brain turned off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them had any idea that something serious was wrong with her. Not even Phil, who was at his brotherly best, very kind and considerate. They talked about ordinary things, about parties and Rollerblading and music and books. Things from Poppy\u0027s old life, which suddenly seemed to have been a hundred years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff talked, too, nicer than he had been since the days when he was courting Poppy\u0027s mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut finally the visitors left, and Poppy\u0027s mother stayed. She touched Poppy every so often with hands that shook slightly. If I didn\u0027t know, I\u0027d know, Poppy thought. She isn\u0027t acting like Mom at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ll stay here tonight,\" her mother said. Not quite managing to sound offhand. \"The nurse said I can sleep on the window seat; it\u0027s really a couch for parents. I\u0027m just trying to decide whether I should run back to the house and get some things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, go,\" Poppy said. There was nothing else she could say and still pretend that she didn\u0027t know. Besides, her mom undoubtedly needed some time by herself, away from this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as her mother left, a nurse in a flowered blouse and green scrub pants came in to take Poppy\u0027s temperature and blood pressure. And then Poppy was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late. She could still hear a TV, but it was far away. The door was ajar, but the hallway outside was dim. A hush seemed to have fallen over the ward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt very alone, and the pain was gnawing deep inside her. Beneath the smooth skin of her abdomen, the tumor was making itself known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorst of all, James hadn\u0027t called. How could he not call? Didn\u0027t he know she needed him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t sure how long she could go on not thinking about It.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe the best thing would be to try to sleep. Get unconscious. Then she couldn\u0027t think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as soon as she turned out the light and closed her eyes, phantoms swirled around her. Not images of pretty bald girls; skeletons. Coffins. And worst of all, an endless darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I die, I won\u0027t be here. Will I be anywhere? Or will I just Not Be at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the scariest thing she\u0027d ever imagined, Not-Being. And she was definitely thinking now, she couldn\u0027t help it. She\u0027d lost control. A galloping fear consumed her, made her shiver under the rough sheet and thin blankets. I\u0027m going to die, I\u0027m going to die, I\u0027m going to -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poppy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flew open. For a second she couldn\u0027t identify the black silhouette in the darkened room. She had a wild idea that it was Death itself coming to get her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she said, \"James?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t sure if you were asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy reached for the bedside button that turned on the light, but James said, \"No, leave it off. I had to sneak past the nurses, and I don\u0027t want them to throw me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy swallowed, her hands clenched on a fold of blanket. \"I\u0027m glad you came,\" she said. \"I thought you weren\u0027t going to come.\" What she really wanted was to throw herself into his arms and sob and scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t just that she\u0027d never done anything like that with him before; it was something about him that stopped her. Something she couldn\u0027t put her finger on, but that made her feel almost . . . frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he was standing? The fact that she couldn\u0027t see his face? All she knew was that James suddenly seemed like a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around and very slowly closed the heavy door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness. Now the only light came in through the window. Poppy felt curiously isolated from the rest of the hospital, from the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that should have been good, to be alone with James, protected from everything else. If only she weren\u0027t having this weird feeling of not recognizing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the test results,\" he said quietly. It wasn\u0027t a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom doesn\u0027t know I know,\" Poppy said. How could she be talking coherently when all she wanted to do was scream? \"I overheard the doctors telling her. . . . James, I\u0027ve got it. And . . . it\u0027s bad; it\u0027s a bad kind of cancer. They said it\u0027s already spread. They said I\u0027m going to . . .\" She couldn\u0027t get the last word out, even though it was shrieking through her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to die,\" James said. He still seemed quiet and centered. Detached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read up on it,\" James went on, walking over to the window and looking out. \"I know how bad it is. The articles said there was a lot of pain. Serious pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"James,\" Poppy gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes they have to do surgery just to try to stop the pain. But whatever they do, it won\u0027t save you. They can fill you full of chemicals and irradiate you, and you\u0027ll still die. Probably before the end of summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"James - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be your last summer - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"James, for God\u0027s sake!\" It was almost a scream. Poppy was breathing in great shaking gulps, clinging to the blankets. \"Why are you doing this to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and in one movement seized her wrist, his fingers closing over the plastic hospital bracelet. \"I want you to understand that they can\u0027t help you,\" he said, ragged and intense. \"Do you understand that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I understand,\" Poppy said. She could hear the mounting hysteria in her own voice. \"But is that what you came here to say? Do you want to kill me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers tightened painfully. \"No! I want to save you.\" Then he let out a breath and repeated it more quietly, but with no less intensity. \"I want to save you, Poppy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy spent a few moments just getting air in and out of her lungs. It was hard to do it without dissolving into sobs. \"Well, you can\u0027t,\" she said at last. \"Nobody can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong.\" Slowly he released her wrist and gripped the bed rail instead. \"Poppy, there\u0027s something I\u0027ve got to tell you. Something about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"James . . .\" Poppy could breathe now, but she didn\u0027t know what to say. As far as she could tell, James had gone crazy. In a way, if everything else hadn\u0027t been so awful, she might have been flattered. James had lost his consummate cool - over her. He was upset enough about her situation to go completely nonlinear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really do care,\" she said softly, with a laugh that was half a sob. She put a hand on his where it rested on the bed rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed shortly in turn. His hand flipped over to grasp hers roughly; then he pulled away. \"You have no idea,\" he said in a terse, strained voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking out the window, he added, \"You think you know everything about me, but you don\u0027t. There\u0027s something very important that you don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now Poppy just felt numb. She couldn\u0027t understand why James kept harping on himself, when she was the one about to die. But she tried to conjure up some sort of gentleness for him as she said, \"You can tell me anything. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this is something you won\u0027t believe. Not to mention that it\u0027s breaking the laws.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The law?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The laws. I go by different laws than you. Human laws don\u0027t mean much to us, but our own are supposed to be unbreakable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"James,\" Poppy said, with blank terror. He really was losing his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know the right way to say it. I feel like somebody in a bad horror movie.\" He shrugged, and said without turning, \"I know how this sounds, but . . . Poppy, I\u0027m a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy sat still on the bed for a moment. Then she groped out wildly toward the bedside table. Her fingers closed on a stack of little crescent-shaped plastic basins and she threw the whole stack at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bastard !\" she screamed, and reached for something else to throw. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-secret-vampire-night-world-1/page-4.html","bookId":2076,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:34:35 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:34:35 AM"}
