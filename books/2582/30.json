{"id":94456,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroken and more than half-crazy from loss, Sally headed south in a Humvee she took out of a used car lot. The salesmen at the dealership were long past caring. Sally made it as far as Portland before the electromagnetic pulses released by the nukes killed her car. She raided a sporting goods store for weapons. Previous looters had already taken the guns, so she loaded up with knives, including the two bowie knives that eventually became her trademark and her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nearly two years before she made it into Mariposa County, where she met Tom and discovered that there were towns filled with survivors. Tom remembered the Sally he’d first met: filthy, wild-eyed, almost feral, and more than half-dead from a bacterial infection she’d picked up from drinking bad water. He had gotten her first to Brother David’s and then into town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom knew that Sally felt she owed him a debt, but in his view, if she helped someone else, then a different kind of infection would spread. Generosity could be as contagious as the zombie plague as long as enough people were willing to be carriers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom rose from where he’d been crouching as he studied the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men had indeed been quieted and left to rot. Tom wasted no sympathy on them. However, something caught his eye, and he parted some weeds and saw Chong’s bokken lying there. He picked it up. It was undamaged. Tom rigged a sling and hung the sword across his chest. As he did so he walked slowly around the clearing, looking at the prints. There were five distinct sets. Chong’s waffle-soled shoes. Sally’s cross-grained hiking boots. Prints that matched the shoes of the two dead men. And a fifth set that entered the camp from upslope. Tom placed his foot into one of the prints, and it dwarfed his. Tom was not a big man, and he wore a size nine-and-a-half shoe. This print had to be at least a fourteen extra wide, and the impression was ground well into the topsoil. A big man. Tall and heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Charlie. Charlie Pink-eye had worn size fourteens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom continued to walk the edges of the clearing until he found an even deeper set of footprints leading away. Same shoes, but clearly a heavier footfall. The answer was there to be read. There were no traces of Chong’s waffle soles, which meant that the big man had carried the boy off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gave Tom some hope. If Chong was dead, he would have been quieted and left for the crows. If he was alive and being carried, then even a big man could not move at top speed. And it was virtually impossible to cover your tracks while carrying a burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom was not carrying a burden. He could move very fast, and even a blind man could follow those tracks. He set out, moving quickly. He had the kind of lean and wiry body that was built for running, and he knew how to run. Two hours later he found the remains of a campfire and the clear and distinct marks of Chong’s waffle soles. The campfire was almost cold. Dirt had been kicked over the small blaze, and it had cooled more slowly than if it had been doused with water. Tom judged that he was now no more than four hours behind the big man. He was making up the time he’d lost by tending to Sally last night; and the big man had stopped to rest. When they’d started out again, Chong was walking instead of being carried. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on, Chong,” he murmured aloud. “I’m coming for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e52\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHONG FLUNG HIMSELF TO ONE SIDE AS THE BIG ZOMBIE LUNGED. He hit the ground in a sloppy roll, coming up too fast, slamming into the opposite wall. He’d tried to snatch the pipe as he rolled, but his fingers merely brushed the cold length of it, sending it rolling away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd cheered, though Chong couldn’t tell if they were in favor of his attempt or its failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zom turned, much faster than Chong thought it could, and instead of a dead moan, the creature hissed at him. The sound was full of hatred. Chong’s mind stalled. Hatred was an emotion. Zoms didn’t have any. But he could see the menace and malevolence etched into the snarling face of the living dead thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd must have heard him. They burst into raucous laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Surprise, surprise, little man!” taunted the Burned Man. “Bet you never seen a freshie like Big Joe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zom—Big Joe—took a lumbering step toward Chong. However, its foot came down on the pipe and it rolled under the creature’s weight. Chong seized the opportunity and jumped forward, trying to land one of the kicks Tom had taught them. A jumping front thrust, intended to slam the flat of the foot against the opponent’s center of mass and knock him backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong’s foot missed the big zom’s stomach and struck him in the left hip. Instead of knocking the zombie backward, it spun his mass, and with his weight already unstable from stepping on the pipe, the creature toppled off balance and fell. The pipe went skipping off the ground and struck the wall with a dull thud. Chong fell hard on his butt, and pain shot from his tailbone all the way up his spine and ignited fireworks in his brain. This new hurt, stacked on top of all his other aches, made Chong feel like he was toppling into a world where nothing but hurt existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven through the pain and disorientation, he knew that if he just sat there, he’d be dead. With sparks still flashing in his eyes, he twisted around onto his hands and knees and fished for the pipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roar of the crowd blocked out the moan of the zombie and the sounds it made getting back to its feet. Just as Chong’s fingers closed around the cold iron, the icy hand of Big Joe closed around the back of Chong’s neck. The zom plucked him off the ground as if he weighed nothing. Cold spittle splattered on his naked shoulders as he was pulled toward that awful mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong shrieked in pain and fear and swung the pipe with both hands up and over his head. It struck the big zom’s forehead hard enough to send a jarring vibration down through the metal and into Chong’s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zom did not let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-oh!” jeered the Burned Man, sparking more laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong felt the rough edges of the zom’s teeth begin to close around his shoulder. He screamed and swung the pipe again and again and again. The teeth pinched him, and the pain was unbelievable. But with the next swing of the club the zom lost its grip on him, and Chong dropped to the floor. He landed hard and instantly scuttled away like a spider, craning his neck to look over his shoulder as the zombie staggered backward, its eyes becoming dull with confusion. The front of its skull had a grooved look where the pipe had hammered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was bright, fresh blood on its lips!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong went crazy. He rushed the monster, swinging the pipe with so much force that he could feel his own muscles pulling and tearing. Spit flew from his mouth; the world seemed to vanish behind a red haze as he brought the Motor City Hammer’s black pipe club down over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zom fell against the wall and still Chong hammered it. The creature’s feet slipped out from under it, and Chong beat on it as it slid down to the dirt floor. Its hands fell limply to the ground, and Chong never let up. Only when the creature slumped and fell sideways, his head a lumpy mass that no longer resembled a skull, did Chong pause, the gory club held high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Joe was dead. The crowd cheered. Chong dropped the pipe and twisted his head to look at his shoulder. The flesh was raw and puckered and torn. Blood poured down his chest and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh God,” Chong whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been bitten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e53\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBENNY THREW HIS WEIGHT FORWARD JUST AS NIX BROUGHT HER BOKKEN down with all her strength. The white fingers shattered under the impact, and Benny was free. He fell onto hands and knees but got to his feet in a heartbeat and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix backed away, still holding the wooden sword out in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on!” yelled Benny, clumsily snatching up their carpet coats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother David was trying to climb over the broken stone wall. Two other zoms shambled around the sides. Sister Shanti and Sister Sarah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix’s face went pale with horror and grief. “Oh … Benny … no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t help them,” cried Benny. “Nix, come on … there’s nothing we can do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t just leave them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, we can. Come on!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zoms were coming toward them, but they were slow and awkward. Nix kept backing up until she stood with Benny near the wall of the old barn, a hundred yards away from the three zoms. Behind them the road unrolled into the distance toward Yosemite. Here … there was nothing left but tragedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd more questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nix,” Benny said softly. “Please …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her sword. The zoms were picking their way through tall weeds and stones. The faces of the two young women were empty of all the light and peace that had been there the last time Nix and Benny had seen them. All the vitality and personality and joy that had made these women what they were, that had brought them a measure of contentment even out here in the Rot and Ruin, were gone. Stolen from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone did this to them,” Nix said, her eyes fierce with hurt and anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” He handed over her carpet coat. They quickly put them on, looking at each other, their eyes speaking volumes. So much would have to be left unsaid for now. And if they kept going east, so many things might remain unanswered. Unanswered and unpunished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom had said that the Children of God believed that zoms—the Children of Lazarus—were the meek who had been intended to inherit the earth. Benny did not know if that was true. At that moment he hoped so, because at least it meant that Brother David, Sister Shanti, and Sister Sarah were where and what they had always wanted to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat did not make the hurt any less for Benny and Nix. It did not make the rage burn any less hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three zoms continued to lumber toward them. Benny and Nix kept backing up, moving past the rust-colored wall of the barn. Then they froze when they heard the squeal of ancient hinges as the barn door swung outward. Benny whirled, but he was a second too late as a zom lunged at him from the shadows. Waxy lips pulled back to reveal rotting teeth. Benny and the monster crashed to the ground, rolling over and over in the weeds. Two more zoms rushed at Nix. She swung her bokken, catching one across the face; but the second crowded past and grabbed Nix’s red hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all so fast. Even as Benny fought with the zom, a part of his mind was trying to understand what was happening. The zoms weren’t slow. They were rotted and decayed, but they weren’t slow; and the burly creature trying to tear his throat out was strong. Far stronger than any zom Benny had fought; stronger than any zom he had heard about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray teeth snapped at the neckline of his carpet coat. Benny drove his knee into the zom’s groin, not that he thought he could hurt it, but because Tom had taught him to always try and lift his opponent’s mass. The zom’s hips bucked up from the impact, and Benny tried to turn, but then he felt cold fingers wrap tightly around his ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother zom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore of them were staggering out of the barn. Farmers and women dressed in nurses’ uniforms and men in logger’s shirts. Kids, too, one of whom still clutched a stuffed bear to her chest. It was horrible and heartbreaking and absolutely terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Benny!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Nix scream his name, but there were three zombies clawing at him now—the big one on top of him, the one holding his ankle, and the little girl with the stuffed bear, who had dropped to her knees and was trying to chew through the sleeve of his carpet coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny thought, We’re going to die. His inner voice could offer no argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then a sound split the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“WOOOOOOOOOOO-HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a huge, barrel-chested war whoop. The kind Morgie let loose when he hit a homer out past the line on McGoran Field. Benny could hardly see past the growling, biting zom, but he caught a flash of movement as something came from his left and slammed into the burly monster. The zom flipped off him. The figure kicked and stomped and then the other two zoms were rolling away and Benny was free. He spun around on the ground, coming up on all fours, the name rising to his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morgie!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as soon as he said it, even before he saw who it was, Benny knew that it wasn’t Morgie. It couldn’t be Morgie. The man who stood over him grinned through the grille of a New Orleans Saints football helmet. He was tall, thin, but wiry, with a carpet coat augmented with metal cut from license plates, each from a different state. He had a spear almost like Lilah’s, except that on the end opposite the blade was a round metal ball as big as Benny’s fist. He wore a pair of cheap black sunglasses and a good Cheshire cat grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny knew him from the Zombie Cards. Dr. Skillz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a yell and a grunt, and Benny turned to see another man in similar garb taking the head off a zom with a powerful two-handed stroke of a heavy logging ax. J-Dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two bounty hunters grinned at Benny. They were a little younger than Tom, so Benny figured that they had been teenagers during First Night. Tom had said they’d been surfers and beach bums once upon a time, but Benny had only a vague idea what a “surfer” was, and he’d never seen a beach except in books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Far out,” said Dr. Skillz. “Benjamin Imura and Phoenix Riley. Wassssabi?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Skillz nodded. “Seriously, brah, and Jessie’s daughter’s gone all aliham.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Babelini!” agreed J-Dog, though he was smiling, not leering, when he said it. The surfers gave Benny the thumbs-up. “Good call, dude.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” asked Benny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Skillz nodded. “Where’s the big kahuna? And … besides that, what are you Menehunes doing out here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trying not to die,” grunted Nix as she swung her bokken at a zom who charged at her from J-Dog’s blind side. The zom went flying backward with a shattered jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dudette’s no Barbie, brah,” said J-Dog, and his partner nodded. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dust-and-decay-benny-imura-2/page-30.html","bookId":2582,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:44 PM"}
