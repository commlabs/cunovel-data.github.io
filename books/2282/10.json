Ethan Oxford was like a distant grandfather, Sarah was like the family old-maid aunt—even though she’d been married. She was high-strung. And Cherry was…Cherry. She always considered herself a cut above the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was grateful that Nathan was going to speak with the other board members, but she did have to call Jason Lawrence and Annette Fanning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason still seemed stunned by the whole thing. She told him about the attic but said they were keeping that information from the media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe, too, wanted to make sure she was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that she called Annette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnette was smart and fun and usually logical, so Allison was shocked by the tremor in her friend’s voice and the view she seemed to be taking of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not surprising, is it? Oh, Allison, I thank God for that root canal, and I never thought I’d say that. I wonder what happened. Did Julian freak out? One toke too many? But he’s never been out of it at work. That’s just the heavy-metal image he likes to portray. It’s the house, Allison. It terrifies me! I can always feel it when I’m there, like…like the house itself is breathing. I mean, when you’re out on the street, the windows seem like eyes, watching you. Maybe so much evil did happen there and it continues, on and on. Like something malevolent that waits and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annette! No! The house is a pile of brick and wood and stone. It’s a house. Horrible things take place everywhere. We go through life grateful when they don’t happen to us, and either sad or broken when they do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I for one am glad they’re closing it down. No, wait—do we get unemployment or anything? I’m out of a job! I don’t think they’ll be able to pay us—there won’t be any money coming into the house without the tours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not out of work, Annette. They’re closing it temporarily for an investigation. I’m sure they’ll provide us with some kind of compensation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The house needs an exorcism!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Annette, it doesn’t. The house isn’t possessed. Or evil. And if the house could feel anything, it would be grateful to us for keeping it alive. Annette—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ohhhhh,” Annette broke in. “You have another job. I don’t. In fact, you have a cool job, a real job. You’re a professor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annette, you do have a real job. The house will open again. It’ll just be closed for a few weeks. They’ll shore up the alarm system, and we’ll be bombarded when we reopen because people are ghoulish and they’ll want to stare at the place where Julian died. Besides, you work at the tavern as a singing waitress sometimes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, thank God! I was there last night. I went for a drink after my root canal and to hang with some of my friends. I can ask for a few more nights.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The house won’t be closed that long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you alone? Oh! You’re not still at the police station, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw some government guy on the news—not an interview, just a shot of him talking to the police. The U.S. government is in on this, Allison. It’s scary, scary. But, hey, have you met him? My God, he’s gorgeous! Whoops, excuse me, Barrie heard that. Barrie, he’s not as gorgeous as you, just, um, pretty gorgeous!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annette, pay attention. Those guys are here because of Adam Harrison. You know, the nice elderly gentleman who’s been to a few functions at the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember him. Maybe there is going to be an exorcism! I heard that his people look into strange stuff. Like paranormal events.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annette, if Barrie’s there and has the day off, please go and spend some time with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of friend do you think I am? I’ll be right there—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, please! I’m fine by myself. I’m going to try to get some rest. Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnette was silent. “I’m not sure you should be alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annette, I’m fine. I promise. I’m going to curl up on the couch and try to doze off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call if you need me, Ally. I can be there in five minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will,” Allison said. “Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was able to hang up at last. Setting the phone down, she rose and headed into the kitchen to make a cup of tea. She really hoped she could doze off for a while, and hot tea and an inane comedy on TV should help her quell some of the thoughts and images racing through her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loved her new pod machine; a cup of English Breakfast tea brewed as swiftly as a cup of coffee. Mug in hand, she left the kitchen and came around the counter—and froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t alone in the house. There was someone sitting in the chair by the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark-haired young man in Colonial dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Julian Mitchell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cup fell from her hand. She heard it shatter on the tile floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she followed it down. She was vaguely aware that a few body parts hurt but not for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercifully, the world went black as she passed out cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler stood in the attic of the Tarleton-Dandridge House looking at the disarray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had been searching—for what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to straighten up the room; it was far easier to figure out what was missing when everything else was in the right place. He’d need to involve others with that, which he didn’t want to do quite yet. He’d had offers from the board to come in and help, but he’d turned them down. He’d actually lied to Nathan Pierson, telling him he preferred to wait until he was sure the police were finished with their forensics before bringing anyone else in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police were finished. And after speaking with Detective Jenson, he knew they weren’t expecting to find anything useful, unless by some unlikely chance they were to lift foreign prints—those not associated with the four guides or the board members, whose prints they’d already taken. If they were really lucky, they’d come up with prints belonging to someone with a criminal record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to work with Allison Leigh for the obvious reasons. She was the one who’d found the body and who knew this house backward and forward, along with the history. He’d gone through the biographies and résumés of the employees and the board, and there was no one better qualified to help him than Allison. She was in denial right now; he assumed that would change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, although he had a sense of being watched in the house, Tyler hadn’t seen a single movement, felt a brush of cold air or even heard an old board creak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was waiting—or those within it were. Waiting and watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the attic and walked back down to the second floor, taking a few minutes to go into every room. He’d been glad to hear from Nathan Pierson that there was no plan by the board to give up the house. It was on the national historic register, of course, so there was virtually no threat that it would be bulldozed. Meticulously restored, the Tarleton-Dandridge House was one of the finest examples of early Americana he’d ever seen. It would be a shame if it was closed to the public to become the offices of an accounting agency or a bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler paused at Lucy Tarleton’s room. He walked inside to look at the painting of Beast Bradley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, as Tyler had observed before, he was portrayed as a thoughtful man. He appeared to be strong, but almost saddened by the weight of responsibility. He’d been a man with well-arranged features, handsome in youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext he studied the painting of a young and innocent Lucy Tarleton, a woman as yet untouched by death and bloodshed. He noted that there was something about Lucy’s eyes that made him think of Allison. There was definitely a resemblance, although it was true that many young women, dressed as Lucy, might look like the long-gone heroine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler stood very still, allowing himself to feel the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain he experienced the sensation of being watched, but there were no sounds from the old place, nor did he see anything or notice any drafts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed down to the study where he’d left his briefcase with his computer and the records Adam had arranged for him to receive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey recorded many instances of normal life and death—many births had taken place in the house, although sadly two of the mothers had died in childbirth. A number of people had died in their beds of natural causes, one Dandridge at the grand old age of a hundred and five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the War of 1812, Sophia Tarleton-Dandridge and her husband had owned the house; they’d taken in a wounded soldier and he had passed away. He was buried with the family in the graveyard behind the stables. A family friend had come to the house after the Battle of Gettysburg. He was also buried in the family graveyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSad and tragic deaths due to warfare, Tyler thought. Not unexpected and not the kind of thing that would produce anything terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, Beast Bradley had been the terror that touched the house....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking further into the family history, Tyler saw that another death had been that of a young Dandridge girl in 1863. He wondered if she’d been in love with the Civil War soldier who’d died. She’d taken rat poison and killed herself soon after his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shuddered. Hard way to die, rat poison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd another hard way to die—a bayonet through the chin. He tried to imagine how it had happened. Julian had sat down, his musket held between his legs. He’d leaned forward and set the soft flesh behind his jawbone on the blade of the bayonet. Then he’d lowered his head with enough force for the blade to go through that soft flesh and his throat? It seemed almost impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless he’d been helped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFascinating though the historical events were, Tyler was more interested in Julian’s death and the deaths of people who had died closer to the present. There’d been several of those, starting in the late 1970s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the docents, Bill Hall, had been found at the foot of the staircase. While closing up at night, he’d apparently tripped and fallen down the stairs, landing at an angle that had snapped his neck. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-uninvited-krewe-of-hunters-8/page-10.html","bookId":2282,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:29 PM"}
