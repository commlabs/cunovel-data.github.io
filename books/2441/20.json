He slumped against the wall and stared at the knife sticking out of his belly. He dropped his own knives, gripped the handle, and tried to pull it out, but his strength deserted him, and he slid to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Gavner and I were shocked, the vampaneze didn\u0027t seem the least bit surprised. They relaxed, and those at the rear returned to their cave. The one with the red birthmark on his cheek stepped forward, stood beside Kurda, and studied the dying vampire. \"I thought for a minute you were coming to his aid,\" the vampaneze said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Kurda replied. He sounded mournful. \"I\u0027d have knocked him out and taken him away somewhere if possible, but others could have tracked down his mental signals. There\u0027s a boy up ahead, a half-vampire. He\u0027s injured, so he won\u0027t be hard to catch. I want him taken alive. They won\u0027t be able to track him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mean the boy behind you?\" the vampaneze asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda swiveled sharply. \"Darren!\" he gasped. \"How long have you been there? How much have you -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner groaned. I jolted into action, ducked forward, ignored Kurda and the vampaneze, and crouched beside my dying friend. His eyes were wide open but he didn\u0027t seem to see anything. \"Gavner?\" I asked, holding his hands, which were bloody from trying to take out the knife. The Vampire General coughed and trembled. I could feel the life slipping out of him. \"I\u0027m with you, Gavner,\" I whispered, crying. \"You\u0027re not alone. I\u0027ll -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suh-suh-suh,\" he stuttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" I wept. \"Don\u0027t hurry. You\u0027ve got plenty of time.\" That was a barefaced lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suh-sorry if muh-muh-my snoring... kuh-kept you... awake,\" he wheezed. I didn\u0027t know if the words were meant for me or someone else, and before I could ask, his expression froze on his face, and his spirit passed on to Paradise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my forehead to Gavner\u0027s and howled pitifully, clutching his dead body to mine. The vampaneze could have taken me easily then, but they were embarrassed, and nobody moved forward to capture me. They just stood around, waiting for me to stop crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally raised my head, nobody dared meet my gaze. All eyes dropped to the floor, Kurda\u0027s quickest of all. \"You killed him!\" I hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda gulped deeply. \"I had to,\" he croaked. \"There was no time to let him die a noble death - you might have gotten away if I\u0027d left him for the vampaneze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew they were here all along,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t want to take the route under the stream,\" he said. \"I feared this would happen. Everything would have been OK if we\u0027d gone the way I wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in league with them!\" I shouted. \"You\u0027re a traitor!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening,\" he sighed. \"This looks terrible, but it\u0027s not what you think. I\u0027m trying to save our race, not condemn it. There are things you don\u0027t know - things no vampire knows. Gavner\u0027s death is regrettable, but when I explain prop-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell with your explanations!\" I screamed. \"You\u0027re a traitor and a murderer - scum!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saved your life,\" Kurda reminded me gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the expense of Gavner\u0027s,\" I sobbed. \"Why did you do it? He was your friend. He...\" I shook my head and stopped myself before he could answer. \"Never mind. I don\u0027t want to hear.\" Stooping, I picked up one of Gavner\u0027s knives and brandished it in front of me. The vampaneze raised their weapons immediately and closed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Kurda shouted, stepping in their way. \"I said I wanted him taken alive!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a knife,\" the vampaneze with the birthmark growled. \"Do you want us to let him chop off our fingers while we get it away from him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, Glalda,\" Kurda said. \"I\u0027m in control of the situation.\" Dropping his knife, he spread his hands and walked slowly towards me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" I yelled. \"Don\u0027t come any closer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m unarmed,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care. I\u0027ll kill you anyway. You deserve it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe so,\" Kurda agreed, \"but I don\u0027t think you\u0027d kill an unarmed man, no matter what he\u0027d done. If I\u0027m wrong, I\u0027ll pay for my error of judgment in the severest way possible - but I don\u0027t think I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drew back the knife to stab him, then lowered my hand. He was right - even though he\u0027d killed Gavner in cold blood, I couldn\u0027t bring myself to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate you!\" I cried, then threw my knife at him. As he ducked, I spun and sped back up the tunnel, turned right, and fled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the vampaneze surged after me, I heard Kurda roaring at them not to harm me. He told them I was injured and couldn\u0027t get far. One roared back that he was cutting ahead with a few others to block off the tunnels leading to the Halls. Another wanted to know if I was carrying any other weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I passed out of earshot of the enemies and the traitor and was racing through darkness, fleeing blindly, crying for my sacrificed friend - the poor, dead Gavner Purl. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trials-of-death-the-saga-of-darren-shan-5/page-20.html","bookId":2441,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:40 PM"}
