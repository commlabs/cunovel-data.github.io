Grunting, he pushed himself upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the slope to his left, a hundred or more paces away, sprawled the skeleton of a dragon. Something had shattered its ribcage, puncturing blows driving shards and fragments inward-fatally so, he could see even from this distance. The bones looked strange, sheathed one and all in something like black, smoky glass. Glass that webbed down to the ground, then ran in frozen streams through furrows on the slope. As if the beast’s melting flesh had somehow vitrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had seen the same on the two other dragon remains he had come across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, luxuriating in his conceit-in the dull pain in his lower back, the vague earache from the insistent wind, and the dryness at the back of his throat that forced him to repeatedly clear it. Which he did, before saying, ‘All the wonders and miseries of a body, wind, that is what you have forgotten. What you long for. You want me to join you? Ha, it’s the other way round.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will never win this game, my love-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then why play it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set off at an angle up the hillside. On the summit, he could see more stone rubble, the remnants of a temple that had dropped through a hole in the earth, plucked from mortal eyes in a conflagration of dust and thunder. Like cutting the feet out from under a god. Like obliterating a faith with a single slash of the knife. A hole in the earth, then, the temple’s pieces tumbling through the Abyss, the ethered layers of realm after realm, until they ran out of worlds to plunge through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnock knock, right on Hood’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour irreverence will deliver unto you profoundest regret, beloved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My profoundest regret, wind, is that it never rains here. No crashing descent of water-to drown your every word.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour mood is foul today. This is not like you. We have played so many games together, you and I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your breath is getting cold.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause you are walking the wrong way!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah. Thank you, wind.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden bitter gust buffeted him, evincing its displeasure. Grit stung his eyes, and he laughed. ‘Hood’s secret revealed, at last. Scurry on back to him, wind, you have lost (his game.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou fool. Ponder this question: among the fallen, among the dead, will you find more soldiers-more fighters than non-fighters? Will you find more men than women? More gods than mortals? More fools than the wise? Among the Fallen, my friend, does the echo of marching armies drown all else? Or the moans of the diseased, the cries of the starving?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I expect, in the end,’ he said after a moment, ‘it all evens out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are wrong. I must answer you, even though it will break your heart. I must.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There is no need,’ he replied. ‘I already know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you? whispered the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You want me to falter. In despair. I know your tricks, wind. And I know, too, that you are probably all that remains of some ancient, long-forgotten god. Hood knows, maybe you are all of them, their every voice a tangled mess, pushing dust and sand and little else. You want me to fall to my knees before you. In abject worship, because maybe then some trickle of power will come to you. Enough to make your escape.’ He grunted a laugh. ‘But this is for you to ponder, wind. Among all the fallen, why do you haunt me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not? You boldly assert bone and flesh. You would spit in I lood’s face-you would spit in mine if you could think of a way to dodge my spitting it right back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAye, I would at that. Which is my point. You chose wrongly, wind. Because I am a soldier.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s play a game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Let’s not.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the Fallen, who-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The answer is children, wind. More children than anyone else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen where is your despair?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You understand nothing,’ he said, pausing to spit. ‘For a man or a woman to reach adulthood, they must first kill the child within them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are a most vicious man, soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You still understand nothing. I have just confessed my despair, wind. You win the game. You win every game. But I will march on, into your icy breath, because that’s what soldiers do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdd, it does not feel as if I have won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a flat stretch of cold but not yet frozen mud, he came upon tracks. Broad, flattened and bony feet, one set, heading in the same direction. Someone… seeking perhaps what he sought. Water pooled in the deep prints, motionless and reflecting the pewter sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crouched down, studying the deep impressions. ‘Be useful, wind. Tell me who walks ahead of me.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-136.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
