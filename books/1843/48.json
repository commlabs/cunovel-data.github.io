We\u0027ll have to hurry if we\u0027re going to find them before dark. Which way did Anthony go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"South,\" he answered. \"Laird, I take full responsibility for this. If I had been here instead—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey cut him off. \"You were needed at home,\" he snapped. \"No one saw them leave?\" he asked then. Incredulous, he shook his head. \"How was it possible for them to get away without anyone seeing them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon didn\u0027t have any answers. Brodick swung onto his stallion\u0027s back. \"We\u0027re wasting time,\" he muttered. \"I\u0027ll search the west. Gideon, take soldiers and search the east, and Ramsey, you go north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no reason to go north,\" Ramsey argued. \"If they went out alone, they wouldn\u0027t have gone into the wilderness. Bridgid knows better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo scared young MacPherson soldiers waited on their horses near the base of the valley. They watched Gideon lead a band of soldiers down the hill and then head east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell Laird Buchanan,\" Alan whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKer shook his head. \"You tell him. I don\u0027t want him to break my nose again. I\u0027ll tell Ramsey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick and Black Robert took the lead, followed by Dylan, Liam, and Aaron. They had just crossed the grassy plain when they heard a shout. Dylan turned back when he saw the MacPherson soldier chasing them, but the others continued on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan\u0027s freckled face was bloodred, more from fear than exertion as he blurted out his important news. \"Proster… he followed the ladies, and they went north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan whistled and within seconds Brodick and the others surrounded the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Proster followed my wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe steely gaze of the laird so unnerved the soldier, he could barely get the words out. \"He saw your wife and Bridgid KirkConnell riding north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were there any soldiers with them?\" Aaron demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they went out alone, and that\u0027s why Proster followed them. He said he was going to bring them back… that it wasn\u0027t safe…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why the hell didn\u0027t he bring them back?\" Liam demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Alan stammered. \"Something must have happened to delay them. Ker and I were going to look for them, but then Gideon arrived, and on his heels, you and Ramsey returned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you aren\u0027t telling us the truth, I swear I\u0027ll flay you alive,\" Black Robert threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As God is my witness, I\u0027m telling you the truth. I swear it on my mother\u0027s grave. My friend… Ker… he went to tell Ramsey to go north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring him with us,\" Brodick ordered. Goading his stallion into a gallop, he raced toward the forest. He kept telling himself not to panic, but it didn\u0027t do any good. My God, what was she thinking to ride out into the wilderness without protection? One boy protecting two women? Something had happened all right, or Proster would have brought them back by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in his life, Brodick prayed. Dear God, let her be all right. I need her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian had had enough. She simply couldn\u0027t go on, and it was too dangerous anyway, as darkness was fast approaching and the gray mist was getting thicker. They had stopped beside a creek, and she was about to tell Proster that with or without his help she was going to get rid of the arrow, but then she heard a rumbling in the distance. Within seconds the ground beneath her began to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProster grabbed his sword as Bridgid frantically reached for her bow and arrows. Gillian pulled her dagger from her belt and moved closer to Bridgid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get ready,\" Proster called, grimacing over the tremor he heard in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s Ker and Alan.\" Bridgid whispered the hope out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many horses,\" Proster said as he nudged his horse forward to put himself in front of the women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, Brodick emerged from the mist. He saw the three of them and pulled hard on the reins. The sight of his wife, apparently safe and sound, filled him with such relief, his knees almost buckled when he leapt to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis soldiers followed. They, too, dismounted and headed straight for Proster. They boy was shaking so violently it looked as though he was waving at them with his sword. But he didn\u0027t back down or run. As terrified as he was, he held his ground, willing to risk his life for the women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put your sword away, boy,\" Dylan commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick rushed to his wife. \"Gillian, you are all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe expected a quick yes, and then he was going to give her hell. Didn\u0027t the woman understand how much she meant to him? How dare she take such a risk? By God, he would demand that she beg his forgiveness for putting him through such torture. And it would be a month of Sundays before he forgave her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so overwhelmed with relief and joy that Brodick had found her, she didn\u0027t care that he was furious. \"No, I\u0027m not all right, but Brodick, I\u0027m so happy to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProster, his hands still trembling, after three attempts had finally gotten his sword back into its sheath. He had just swung one leg over and was jumping off his horse when Brodick reached for his wife. The soldier lunged at the laird and shouted, \"Don\u0027t touch her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick reacted with amazing speed. Proster\u0027s feet hadn\u0027t even touched the ground before he was thrown backward with such force he landed on his backside in the grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell\u0027s the matter with him?\" Brodick demanded as he turned back to his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan grabbed the crazed soldier by the scruff of his neck and hauled him to his feet. Then he began to shake him. \"You dare to give my laird orders?\" he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s pinned to the saddle,\" Proster shouted. \"An arrow—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the words registered, Dylan let go of the soldier. Brodick had already noticed the arrow and had moved to the right side of the horses to get a closer look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian put her hand against Brodick\u0027s cheek. \"I\u0027m so happy to see you,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m happy to see you,\" he whispered back. \"Now let me see what you\u0027ve done to yourself,\" he ordered gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer spine stiffened. \"I didn\u0027t do anything,\" she cried out. \"Except try to get away. If it weren\u0027t for Proster, Bridgid and I would have been killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the three of them were talking at the same time as each tried to explain what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were Sinclairs,\" Proster announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They weren\u0027t trying to kill me,\" Bridgid said. \"They were after Gillian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They would have killed you too,\" Gillian countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Proster killed one of them,\" Bridgid told Brodick then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their names were Durston and Faudron,\" Proster said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick was taken aback when he heard the name of one of Ramsey\u0027s most valued commanders. \"Faudron tried to kill you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Bridgid answered for Gillian. \"He and Durston were waiting for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was an ambush,\" Gillian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I killed Durston,\" Proster boasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Faudron? Did he get away?\" Brodick asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay,\" Proster answered. \"Your wife killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick\u0027s gaze flew to Gillian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One arrow, Laird, that went through his forehead. Her aim was true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick was trying to wedge his hand beneath Gillian\u0027s thigh so that he could get a proper grip on the arrow, but when he saw her flinch, he pulled his hand back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Proster tried to get the arrow out, but he couldn\u0027t,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier began to move away from the commander, but Dylan grabbed him by the neck again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExasperated, Gillian called out, \"Dylan, please let go of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick took Gillian\u0027s dagger, lifted her plaid, and then slit her underskirts all the way up to the top of her thigh. The soldiers crowded around their laird to watch what he was doing and Gillian, trying to maintain some semblance of modesty and decorum, hastily tugged the plaid down over her leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t the time for shyness,\" Brodick told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew he was upset. \"It isn\u0027t as bad as it looks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could have fooled me,\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She might wish to sleep through this, Laird,\" Robert suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to wait until she falls asleep?\" Bridgid asked. She\u0027d pushed her way through the men so that she could take hold of Gillian\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian was more astute than her friend. She was also outraged by Robert\u0027s suggestion. \"No one\u0027s going to knock me out. Have I made myself clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But milady,\" Robert began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped him cold. \"I cannot believe you would suggest such a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A light tap is all it would take,\" Aaron argued. \"You wouldn\u0027t feel a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t like seeing you in pain, milady,\" Liam rasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then close your eyes,\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick finally noticed Bridgid squeezed up against him. She had tears in her eyes as she stared at Gillian. He told her to move back so that he could, do what was needed, but Bridgid didn\u0027t budge, and Aaron had to lift her out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\" Robert asked from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer, Brodick pulled his sword free. \"Dylan, hold the arrow steady. Liam, grab the reins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan moved forward, grabbed the arrow with both hands and pressed down against Gillian\u0027s thigh to keep it from moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAaron pulled Bridgid out of the way, while Robert hurried to the other side of the horse and told Gillian to lean toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you still thinking about punching me, Robert?\" she asked suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, milady, I would never strike you without gaining permission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to trust him and put her hands on his shoulders as she slowly leaned down toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brodick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t miss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she closed her eyes and waited. She heard the whistle of the sword as it sliced through the air, felt only a slight jarring as the blade cut the arrow, and then it was over. When she opened her eyes again she saw that the arrow had been cleanly cut in half just a thumb\u0027s width above Dylan\u0027s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew what was going to happen next, and, Lord, how she dreaded it. Brodick was slipping his arms under her knees. \"Put your hands on my shoulders,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to go back to Annie Drummond\u0027s cottage. Do you hear me? I don\u0027t want to go back there ever again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tightened his grip. \"I thought you liked Annie\u0027s house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid was wringing her hands in agitation. She could barely stand to watch her friend in such pain. \"You\u0027ll feel better if you scream,\" she blurted. \"I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick looked into his wife\u0027s eyes, saw the tears, and said, \"She will not make a sound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got just the reaction he wanted. Instantly furious, she shouted, \"I\u0027m supposed to say that, not you. If you tell me to be brave, then when I am, it doesn\u0027t count. I…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t make a sound, except her deep indrawn breath when Brodick lifted her and the arrow slid through her leg. She threw her arms around him and held tight, and when the tears fell, she buried her face in the crook of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t sure which one of them was shaking more. Without a word, he turned and carried her to the creek. Bridgid tried to follow them, thinking she could help bind the injury, but Dylan grabbed her and told her to wait until they returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s over with,\" Brodick whispered, and his voice was hoarse with relief. He held her tight against him and couldn\u0027t seem to make himself let go. It was going to take some time for him to get over the scare of losing her. He kissed her forehead and then begged her to stop crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiped her face with his plaid. \"You\u0027re dying to yell at me, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn right I am,\" he admitted. \"But I\u0027m a thoughtful man, and so I\u0027ll wait until you have recovered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t believe a word of it. \"That is thoughtful of you,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in God\u0027s name were you thinking, to leave without… my God, Gillian, you could have been killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had only just gotten warmed up, and he continued to rant at her all the while he splashed cold water over her leg to wash off any dirt or dried blood. He stopped long enough to grudgingly admit the wound wasn\u0027t nearly as awful as he\u0027d first thought, but he went right back to shouting at her while he tore strips from her skirt and wrapped them around her thigh to stop the bleeding. By the time he was finished, her thigh didn\u0027t hurt much at all, but her pride had taken quite a blistering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t let her walk, and she wouldn\u0027t let him carry her anywhere until he had finished giving her a piece of his mind. She wasn\u0027t about to let him scold her in front of the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScooping her up into his arms, his tirade continued. \"When we get home, I swear I\u0027m putting two guards in front of you and two behind you. You\u0027re never going to get another chance to scare me like this again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hand against his cheek, a simple caress that magically calmed him. Then she ruined it by trying to explain her actions, inadvertently getting him riled up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t deliberately leave the holding in hopes of getting attacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you did leave the holding, didn\u0027t you? And without a proper guard to protect you. How could you leave Sinclair land without—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know I was leaving Ramsey\u0027s territory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and told himself for the hundredth time that she was all right. The thought of losing her scared the hell out of him and infuriated him at the same time. How had he allowed himself to become so vulnerable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouting at me isn\u0027t going to accomplish anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure it is,\" he snapped. \"It\u0027s making me feel a hell of a lot better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t dare smile, guessing he would take grave offense if she did. She wanted to soothe him now, not incite his wrath further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you please be reasonable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am being reasonable. Haven\u0027t you figured it out yet? It took me a while, but by God, I finally have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figured out what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trouble follows you like a shadow, Gillian. You\u0027re prone to injuries.
