{"id":36850,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII—THE MAN","content":"\u0026nbsp;On the Scoriac Harold An Wolf, now John Robinson, kept aloof from every one. \u0026nbsp;He did not make any acquaintances, did not try to. \u0026nbsp;Some of those at table with him, being ladies and gentlemen, now and again made a polite remark; to which he answered with equal politeness. \u0026nbsp;Being what he was he could not willingly offend any one; and there was nothing in his manner to repel any kindly overture to acquaintance. \u0026nbsp;But this was the full length his acquaintanceship went; so he gradually felt himself practically alone. \u0026nbsp;This was just what he wished; he sat all day silent and alone, or else walked up and down the great deck that ran from stem to stern, still always alone. \u0026nbsp;As there were no second-class or steerage passengers on the Scoriac, there were no deck restraints, and so there was ample room for individual solitude. \u0026nbsp;The travellers, however, were a sociable lot, and a general feeling of friendliness was abroad. \u0026nbsp;The first four days of the journey were ideally fine, and life was a joy. \u0026nbsp;The great ship, with bilge keels, was as steady as a rock. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Among the other passengers was an American family consisting of Andrew Stonehouse, the great ironmaster and contractor, with his wife and little daughter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stonehouse was a remarkable man in his way, a typical product of the Anglo-Saxon under American conditions. \u0026nbsp;He had started in young manhood with nothing but a good education, due in chief to his own industry and his having taken advantage to the full of such opportunities as life had afforded to him. \u0026nbsp;By unremitting work he had at thirty achieved a great fortune, which had, however; been up to then entirely invested and involved in his businesses. \u0026nbsp;With, however, the colossal plant at his disposal, and by aid of the fine character he had won for honesty and good work, he was able within the next ten years to pile up a fortune vast even in a nation where multi-millionaires are scattered freely. \u0026nbsp;Then he had married, wisely and happily. \u0026nbsp;But no child had come to crown the happiness of the pair who so loved each other till a good many years had come and gone. \u0026nbsp;Then, when the hope of issue had almost passed away, a little daughter came. \u0026nbsp;Naturally the child was idolised by her parents, and thereafter every step taken by either was with an eye to her good. \u0026nbsp;When the rigour of winter and the heat of summer told on the child in a way which the more hardy parents had never felt, she was whirled away to some place with more promising conditions of health and happiness. \u0026nbsp;When the doctors hinted that an ocean voyage and a winter in Italy would be good, those too were duly undertaken. \u0026nbsp;And now, the child being in perfect health, the family was returning before the weather should get too hot to spend the summer at their chalet amongst the great pines on the slopes of Mount Ranier. \u0026nbsp;Like the others on board, Mr. and Mrs. Stonehouse had proffered travellers’ civilities to the sad, lonely young man. \u0026nbsp;As to the others, he had shown thanks for their gracious courtesy; but friendship, as in other cases, did not advance. \u0026nbsp;The Stonehouses were not in any way chagrined; their lives were too happy and too full for them to take needless offence. \u0026nbsp;They respected the young man’s manifest desire for privacy; and there, so far as they were concerned, the matter rested.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But this did not suit the child. \u0026nbsp;Pearl was a sweet little thing, a real blue-eyed, golden-haired little fairy, full of loving-kindness. \u0026nbsp;All the mother-instinct in her, and even at six a woman-child can be a mother—theoretically, went out towards the huge, lonely, sad, silent young man. \u0026nbsp;She insisted on friendship with him; insisted shamelessly, with the natural inclination of innocence which rises high above shame. \u0026nbsp;Even the half-hearted protests of the mother, who loved to see the child happy, did not deter her; after the second occasion of Pearl’s seeking him, as she persisted, Harold could but remonstrate with the mother in turn; the ease of the gentle lady and the happiness of her child were more or less at stake. \u0026nbsp;When Mrs. Stonehouse would say:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘There, darling! \u0026nbsp;You must be careful not to annoy the gentleman,’ Pearl would turn a rosy all-commanding face to her and answer:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘But, mother, I want him to play with me. \u0026nbsp;You must play with me!’ \u0026nbsp;Then, as the mother would look at him, he would say quickly, and with genuine heartiness too:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Oh please, madam, do let her play with me! \u0026nbsp;Come, Pearl, shall you ride a cock-horse or go to market the way the gentleman rides?’ \u0026nbsp;Then the child would spring on his knee with a cry of delight, and their games began.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The presence of the child and her loving ways were unutterably sweet to Harold; but his pleasure was always followed by a pain that rent him as he thought of that other little one, now so far away, and of those times that seemed so long since gone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the child never relaxed in her efforts to please; and in the long hours of the sea voyage the friendship between her and the man grew, and grew. \u0026nbsp;He was the biggest and strongest and therefore most lovely thing on board the ship, and that sufficed her. \u0026nbsp;As for him, the child manifestly loved and trusted him, and that was all-in-all to his weary, desolate heart.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The fifth day out the weather began to change; the waves grew more and more mountainous as the day wore on and the ship advanced west. \u0026nbsp;Not even the great bulk and weight of the ship, which ordinarily drove through the seas without pitch or roll, were proof against waves so gigantic. \u0026nbsp;Then the wind grew fiercer and fiercer, coming in roaring squalls from the south-west. \u0026nbsp;Most of those on board were alarmed, for the great waves were dreadful to see, and the sound of the wind was a trumpet-call to fear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The sick stayed in their cabins; the rest found an interest if not a pleasure on deck. \u0026nbsp;Among the latter were the Stonehouses, who were old travellers. \u0026nbsp;Even Pearl had already had more sea-voyages than fall to most people in their lives. \u0026nbsp;As for Harold, the storm seemed to come quite naturally to him and he paced the deck like a ship-master.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was fortunate for the passengers that most of them had at this period of the voyage got their sea legs; otherwise walking on the slippery deck, that seemed to heave as the rolling of the vessel threw its slopes up or down, would have been impossible. \u0026nbsp;Pearl was, like most children, pretty sure-footed; holding fast to Harold’s hand she managed to move about ceaselessly. \u0026nbsp;She absolutely refused to go with any one else. \u0026nbsp;When her mother said that she had better sit still she answered:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘But, mother, I am quite safe with The Man!’ \u0026nbsp;‘The Man’ was the name she had given Harold, and by which she always now spoke of him. \u0026nbsp;They had had a good many turns together, and Harold had, with the captain’s permission, taken her up on the bridge and showed her how to look out over the ‘dodger’ without the wind hurting her eyes. \u0026nbsp;Then came the welcome beef-tea hour, and all who had come on deck were cheered and warmed with the hot soup. \u0026nbsp;Pearl went below, and Harold, in the shelter of the charthouse, together with a good many others, looked out over the wild sea.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold, despite the wild turmoil of winds and seas around him, which usually lifted his spirits, was sad, feeling lonely and wretched; he was suffering from the recoil of his little friend’s charming presence. \u0026nbsp;Pearl came on deck again looking for him. \u0026nbsp;He did not see her, and the child, seeing an opening for a new game, avoided both her father and mother, who also stood in the shelter of the charthouse, and ran round behind it on the weather side, calling a loud ‘Boo!’ to attract Harold’s attention as she ran.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A few seconds later the Scoriac put her nose into a coming wave at just the angle which makes for the full exercise of the opposing forces. \u0026nbsp;The great wave seemed to strike the ship on the port quarter like a giant hammer; and for an instant she stood still, trembling. \u0026nbsp;Then the top of the wave seemed to leap up and deluge her. \u0026nbsp;The wind took the flying water and threw it high in volumes of broken spray, which swept not only the deck but the rigging as high as the top of the funnels. \u0026nbsp;The child saw the mass of water coming, and shrieking flew round the port side of the charthouse. \u0026nbsp;But just as she turned down the open space between it and the funnel the vessel rolled to starboard. \u0026nbsp;At the same moment came a puff of wind of greater violence than ever. \u0026nbsp;The child, calling out, half in simulated half in real fear, flew down the slope. \u0026nbsp;As she did so the gale took her, and in an instant whirled her, almost touching her mother, over the rail into the sea.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Stonehouse shrieked and sprang forward as though to follow her child. \u0026nbsp;She was held back by the strong arm of her husband. \u0026nbsp;They both slipped on the sloping deck and fell together into the scuppers. \u0026nbsp;There was a chorus of screams from all the women present. \u0026nbsp;Harold, with an instinctive understanding of the dangers yet to be encountered, seized a red tam-o’-shanter from the head of a young girl who stood near.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her exclamation of surprise was drowned in the fearful cry ‘Man overboard!’ and all rushed down to the rail and saw Harold, as he emerged from the water, pull the red cap over his head and then swim desperately towards the child, whose golden hair was spread on the rising wave.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The instant after Pearl’s being swept overboard might be seen the splendid discipline of a well-ordered ship. \u0026nbsp;Every man to his post, and every man with a knowledge of his duty. \u0026nbsp;The First Officer called to the Quartermaster at the wheel in a voice which cut through the gale like a trumpet:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Hard a port! \u0026nbsp;Hard!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The stern of the great ship swung away to port in time to clear the floating child from the whirling screw, which would have cut her to pieces in an instant. \u0026nbsp;Then the Officer after tearing the engine-room signal to ‘Starboard engine full speed astern,’ ran for the lifebuoy hanging at the starboard end of the bridge. \u0026nbsp;This he hurled far into the sea. \u0026nbsp;As it fell the attached rope dragged with it the signal, which so soon as it reaches water bursts into smoke and flame—signal by day and night. \u0026nbsp;This done, and it had all been done in a couple of seconds, he worked the electric switch of the syren, which screamed out quickly once, twice, thrice. \u0026nbsp;This is the dread sound which means ‘man overboard,’ and draws to his post every man on the ship, waking or sleeping.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Captain was now on the bridge and in command, and the First Officer, freed from his duty there, ran to the emergency boat, swung out on its davits on the port side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All this time, though only numbered by seconds, the Scoriac was turning hard to starboard, making a great figure of eight; for it is quicker to turn one of these great sea monsters round than to stop her in mid career. \u0026nbsp;The aim of her Captain in such cases is to bring her back to the weather side of the floating buoy before launching the boat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On deck the anguish of the child’s parents was pitiable. \u0026nbsp;Close to the rail, with her husband’s arms holding her tight to it, the distressed mother leaned out; but always moving so that she was at the nearest point of the ship to her child. \u0026nbsp;As the ship passed on it became more difficult to see the heads. \u0026nbsp;In the greater distance they seemed to be quite close together. \u0026nbsp;All at once, just as a great wave which had hidden them in the farther trough passed on, the mother screamed out:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘She’s sinking! she’s sinking! \u0026nbsp;Oh, God! \u0026nbsp;Oh, God!’ and she fell on her knees, her horrified eyes, set in a face of ashen grey, looking out between the rails.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But at the instant all eyes saw the man’s figure rise in the water as he began to dive. \u0026nbsp;There was a hush which seemed deadly; the onlookers feared to draw breath. \u0026nbsp;And then the mother’s heart leaped and her cry rang out again as two heads rose together in the waste of sea:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘He has her! \u0026nbsp;He has her! \u0026nbsp;He has her! \u0026nbsp;Oh, thank God! \u0026nbsp;Thank God!’ and for a single instant she hid her face in her hands.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then when the fierce ‘hurrah’ of all on board had been hushed in expectation, the comments broke forth. \u0026nbsp;Most of the passengers had by this time got glasses of one kind or another.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘See! \u0026nbsp;He’s putting the cap on the child’s head. \u0026nbsp;He’s a cool one that. \u0026nbsp;Fancy him thinking of a red cap at such a time!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Ay! we could see that cap, when it might be we couldn’t see anything else.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Look!’ this from an old sailor standing by his boat, ‘how he’s raisin’ in the water. \u0026nbsp;He’s keeping his body between her an’ the spindrift till the squall has passed. \u0026nbsp;That would choke them both in a wind like this if he didn’t know how to guard against it. \u0026nbsp;He’s all right; he is! \u0026nbsp;The little maid is safe wi’ him.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Oh, bless you! \u0026nbsp;Bless you for those words,’ said the mother, turning towards him. \u0026nbsp;‘At this moment the Second Officer, who had run down from the bridge, touched Mr. Stonehouse on the shoulder.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘The captain asked me to tell you, sir, that you and Mrs. Stonehouse had better come to him on the bridge. \u0026nbsp;You’ll see better from there.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They both hurried up, and the mother again peered out with fixed eyes. \u0026nbsp;The Captain tried to comfort her; laying his strong hand on her shoulder, he said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘There, there! \u0026nbsp;Take comfort, ma’am. \u0026nbsp;She is in the hands of God! \u0026nbsp;All that mortal man can do is being done. \u0026nbsp;And she is safer with that gallant young giant than she could be with any other man on the ship. \u0026nbsp;Look, how he is protecting her! \u0026nbsp;Why he knows that all that can be done is being done. \u0026nbsp;He is waiting for us to get to him, and is saving himself for it. \u0026nbsp;Any other man who didn’t know so much about swimming as he does would try to reach the lifebuoy; and would choke the two of them with the spindrift in the trying. \u0026nbsp;Mind how he took the red cap to help us see them. \u0026nbsp;He’s a fine lad that; a gallant lad!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3234/88504.html","bookId":683,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:30:08 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:30:08 AM"}
