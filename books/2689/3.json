No pizza. ’Cause I know you’ve got a milk allergy, that’s why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee you soon.” Kane snapped the phone shut and wandered to Ginger’s bedside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. I’m sorry if I seemed ungrateful, I’m very grateful, it’s just…I’m not used to needing help, let alone asking anyone for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re being so sweet and thoughtful, volunteering to take care of my son, my dad and me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally interesting that she put herself last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t help but worry that you’re getting roped into something you didn’t want and you’re too much of a gentleman to say no.” Tears seeped from the corners of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDammit. What was he supposed to do when she cried? Kane had little experience with women’s tears, except the manipulative variety. And these were borne of pain and frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed a Kleenex. “Come on, sugar, you’re breakin’ my heart here.” He gently blotted her tear-dampened face. “You in a lot of pain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. It’s like my whole body is throbbing. Not a good kind of throbbing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed softly. “I do believe the drugs are finally kickin’ in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe.” Ginger blinked at him. It didn’t help; her eyes had taken on a dreamy, unfocused look. “Can I ask you something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suspect you will ask me regardless if I say no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you kiss me that night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane’s heart skipped a beat. His gaze dropped to her lips. God, he still fantasized about that lush mouth. How aggressive he’d been with the kiss, how eagerly she’d welcomed it. How his wanting of her overrode his common sense, but he had zero regrets. Even now. Months later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kane?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe met her eyes again. “Why you askin’ me this now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because we’ve never talked about it. We both pretended it never happened. Or was that kiss so easy for you to forget, McKay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe angled close enough that her breath teased his lips. “Not. Even. Fucking. Close. You have no idea how much I still…” Crave you. Fantasize about you. Wish I would’ve taken what we both wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Kane said none of that. He backed off just like he had that night. “Never mind. This definitely ain’t the time or the place to talk about this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Tell me. Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I kissed you because you needed to be kissed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips formed a half pout. “That’s all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddammit she was beautiful, even in pain, and Kane couldn’t resist touching her. “No, that ain’t all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that’s all I’m gonna admit to when you’re drugged up and hurtin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lashes fluttered coquettishly. “See? Just like I thought.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you think?” Did you imagine I came this close to fucking you up against that wall until you screamed loud enough to wake your kid and your dad?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlikely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinger gifted him with a dreamy smile. “I think that you are a gentleman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no idea how badly I want to challenge that statement,” he murmured, moving his thumb up to caress the arch of her cheekbone and the dark circle beneath her closed eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bring it, cowboy. Maybe I’m not as much the prim and proper mother that you see me as.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. Kane doubted she’d be on board with some of the kinkier things that did it for him. “Sugar, you’re babbling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I’ll remember every word of this conversation. I have perfect recall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t doubt that a bit, counselor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed a spare blanket from the dresser and covered her completely. “Better?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh. Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Get some rest. I’ll be back to get you tomorrow.” Kane made it to the door when her raspy voice stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About the sleeping arrangements.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad to be the drugs talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t even turn around. He just kept walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinger smiled at Hayden when he skidded to a stop in front of her. “It’s okay. You can hug me. Just don’t squeeze too hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe buried his face in her neck and heaved a deep sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe placed her forehead on the top of his damp head, breathing him in. The scent of her little boy, baby shampoo beneath the hint of sweat and the cold tang of the outdoors. “I missed you, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not a baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mistake.” She smooched his crown before he squirmed back. He never used to try and escape her hugs, but from the day he’d turned eight, he’d gotten stingy with maternal affection. She looked over at Kane, lounging in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood thing she wasn’t hooked up to a heart rate monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly buckets the man looked commanding, even leaning nonchalantly against the doorjamb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommanding and an utterly striking example of masculine perfection. Scuffed black boots crossed at the ankle anchored the long line of his denim-clad legs. He wore a shaggy sheepskin coat and folded his arms over his broad chest. His ever-present black cowboy hat shadowed his face—a shame really, because Kane McKay had a beautiful face. Sharp angles defined his strong jawline. The neatly trimmed dark mustache and goatee framed those perfectly kissable lips. And his eyes. Lord have mercy on her soul. She could lose her train of thought in a heartbeat, gazing into those dark blue depths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t you mean you could lose your panties in a heartbeat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man epitomized rugged cowboy, down to the inscrutable way he looked at her, so she wasn’t quite sure what he was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was probably why she’d never made a move on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that and it was against the rules of the Big Buddies/Little Buddies program for them to fraternize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd man, she’d thought about fraternizing with him naked a whole lot. Ever since the night last year that she’d gone out and found trouble with his assorted McKay cousins’ wives at the Twin Pines. Not only had she ended up drinking too much, she’d found herself in the middle of a bar fight, and coming home in the backseat of a cop car, courtesy of Deputy Cam McKay. She’d panicked to see Kane’s truck parked in Lorelei James\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher driveway, fearing something had happened to Hayden, but Kane had calmed her down immediately…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he revved her back up, with his sexy whispered, “How about if you let me take you to bed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling guilty about her impure thoughts, she said, “Aren’t you supposed to be in school?” to Hayden and then shot a questioning glance at Kane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane shrugged. “I wanted to swing by and tell Libby you were goin’ home, so I just picked him up early.” His gaze moved over her at a snail’s pace and she shivered. “You ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I signed myself out. Got my cache of drugs. Just waiting on the wheelchair.” She scowled. Seemed an unnecessary rule in her opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHayden’s eyes grew big. “You have to be in a wheelchair?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sweetie. They’ll wheel me out in one, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too bad. I thought maybe you and Gramps could have wheelchair races.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’d beat me for sure. He’s pretty speedy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHayden crouched over the pink plaster. “Buck said you had a cast. Can I sign it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First thing when we get home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse wheeled in the chair and Kane left to pull his pickup around. Hayden didn’t say a word as the nurse helped Ginger into the chair. At least they’d removed the full bandage on her left hand so she wasn’t a total invalid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFace it. You are completely helpless for the next few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce they reached the patient pickup area, Ginger debated on how she’d climb into Kane’s monster truck. Hayden had no such qualms; he clambered into the back seat like a monkey. Good idea. Maybe she should just go for it. She attempted to stand and Kane was right there, gently shouldering aside the nurse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.” He smiled at the nurse. “I got it from here.” He put his mouth on Ginger’s ear. Tingles ran from neck to her midsection, tightening everything in its wake. “Trust me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On three I’m gonna lift you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kane—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arm slipped behind the bend of her knee. He gently cradled the right side of her body to the hard strength of his. “One. Two. Three.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she was airborne, efficiently being stuffed in the front seat of Kane’s truck. “You’re lucky you didn’t wind up in the hospital yourself, McKay, with my weight straining your back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah. I’m used to movin’ around heifers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would’ve snapped at him if not for the twinkle in his eye and the smirk curling his lips. “You are a regular riot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you can take a joke,” he murmured. “I’d wondered. Besides, you smell way better than heifers and you didn’t try to knock me on my ass. That’s always a plus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s always next time,” she said sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lookin’ forward to it.” He fiddled with the seatbelt. “I’m thinkin’ we’d better put this strap behind your head so it don’t strain your shoulder and only use the lap belt.” The intimate way Kane’s fingers straightened the belt across her abdomen sent her heart galloping and a small gasp escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Twinkling Blue Eyes was right in her face. “Shit, sorry, I thought I was bein’ careful. Did I hurt you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Umm. No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squinted at her. “Then what’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just discovered my whole body goes haywire from your slightest touch. “Ah. Nothing. I’m just anxious to get home.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/raising-kane-rough-riders-9/page-3.html","bookId":2689,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:18 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:18 AM"}
