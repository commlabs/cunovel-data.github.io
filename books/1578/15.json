Up until a year ago, that was the model for all the clubs. But we started something here and also at the Joey\u0027s in Wilmington. We turned the Joey\u0027s store into a sort of brokerage, and instead of selling goods directly to the consumer, we\u0027ve become wholesalers. An example: We bought several tons of cotton from a grower in Mississippi. We\u0027ve been selling to tailors who have in turn opened clothing stores in the village. We paid the cotton grower in Armageddon dollars, most of which he spent to resupply himself down in the village, so the cash went right back into the local economy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped Lookout Mountain on the map and traced an outward spiral with his finger. \"What started as a single economic location-Joey Armageddon\u0027s-has now widened into an economic zone. If similar zones expand around the other Joey\u0027s locations, the ever-increasing circles will eventually meet and overlap. A working, growing civilized economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Europe during the Middle Ages, a single institution stood against ignorance and barbarism-the Roman Catholic Church, as I\u0027ve already told you. In our time, we also have an institution that has come to our rescue: the franchise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmageddon sat back at the desk, sipped his own coffee. \"It all has to be gradual, of course. We still own half the merchants in the village and subsidize others. But there are merchants who have opened shops on the edge of the village, and I have no idea where they came from. They simply showed up one day to join the economy. People aren\u0027t waiting to be led anymore. They\u0027re taking initiative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer thought about it, absorbed what he\u0027d heard. Impressive. Still, it seemed odd, hard to swallow, that civilization could be reborn through a franchise of nudie bars. \"It\u0027s great...really...but...\" He trailed off with an embarrassed smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to speak freely,\" Armageddon said. \"I\u0027m not a dictator, and I\u0027m not perfect. I want to hear if you have concerns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand why a go-go club,\" Mortimer said. \"If you\u0027re setting out to save civilization, or build some kind of new civilization, then why not...well...anything but a titty bar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmageddon cracked up laughing, genuinely amused. \"Hell, man, you think I started all this to save the world? Hell, no. It was an accident. And it\u0027s not a titty bar. It\u0027s a go-go club. It might not make any difference to you, but it\u0027s an important distinction to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\" Don\u0027t poke the bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We try to strike a certain tone. But I was going to tell you how it started. It\u0027s still early but I think I could use a drink after all. Join me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything but Jack Daniel\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went out to the porch, a table and chairs overlooking the valley. Mild, only a chill in the air but not cold. Mortimer definitely anticipated an early spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey smoked cigars, and Armageddon drank Jack Daniel\u0027s over ice. Mortimer almost could not stand the smell of it, but a cold draft beer helped take the edge off his hangover. The cigar smelled good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was never part of any grand scheme,\" Armageddon began. \"Like so many people back then, I found myself running for my life. Talk to anyone who lived through those first years, listen to their stories. They\u0027ll always be stories of running.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer wondered if he would forever be separated from the rest of humanity by this lack of experience. He\u0027d hidden during those times. He\u0027d been lonely, but he hadn\u0027t been hunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just coming out of a looted Ruby Tuesday\u0027s in Birmingham when they spotted me.\" Armageddon cradled his drink, a faraway look coming into his eyes as if he were trying to picture the episode, recall each detail precisely. \"I\u0027d been scavenging for food, hadn\u0027t found any and was on my way out when I saw the three of them. They had that raider look about them. You learned the type fast enough if you wanted to live. You saw them coming, and you found a hiding place. Fast. But they saw me a second later, and I dashed back into the Ruby Tuesday\u0027s. I ducked behind the bar, knowing that wasn\u0027t good enough. So I\u0027m looking around for something, anything, an idea of how I\u0027m going to get out of this, but knowing I am truly fucked. And my eyes land on a bottle. I can\u0027t believe it. In the midst of destruction is one unopened bottle of Captain Morgan spiced rum. I take out my pocket handkerchief and wipe the dust out of three shot glasses, just as I hear boots crunching through the rubble on the floor, and I know they\u0027re creeping through the place looking for me. They\u0027re coming slowly because maybe I have a gun, or who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmageddon sipped his Jack and shook his head like he couldn\u0027t believe what he was going to say next. \"So I popped up, started wiping the bar with the handkerchief and said, \u0027Gentlemen, how are you doing today?\u0027 And I lined up the shot glasses and put the bottle on the bar. I was about to wet myself, and my legs felt like noodles. But you couldn\u0027t guess it. On the outside, I was steady as a rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The three of them looked at each other like they weren\u0027t sure what was going on. Two of them had knives and one had a huge wooden baseball bat with nails sticking out of it. I didn\u0027t look at the weapons, just smiled. There was this long, silent ten seconds. And they came over to the bar. Just came right over and nodded at the shot glasses. I kept filling the glasses and made small talk. Yes, it was a hot day. No, I hadn\u0027t thought to cook rats that way. And I kept smiling and kept pouring and let myself believe I might actually bluff my way through this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then the booze ran out. I figured that was it, but I smiled and said, \u0027Thanks for coming in, gentlemen. I hope you stop back again soon.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer found he was hanging on Armageddon\u0027s every word. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They left. I shit you not, they waved good-bye and were on their way. They didn\u0027t offer to pay, and I didn\u0027t ask, but I thought about it a lot over the next few days. I think I reached something in them, triggered by the familiar sight of a neighborhood saloon. I realized that the most comforting thing a person could see was a place open for business, even if it was just pretend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat in silence, sipped drinks and smoked cigars. Mortimer thought he could understand. More than anything, people were desperate for normalcy. The comfort of routine and familiarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you see,\" Armageddon said, \"I didn\u0027t plan anything. It all evolved. And try to imagine if I had set out with the sole intention of helping my fellow man. Maybe I should have given away food to all who needed it. But where would the food have come from? How would it be replaced? Never give to the needy. They take and take and use and use and never put back. I could give it all away and feel like a hero for a day, but then we\u0027d be right back at square one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer frowned, tried to hide it by sticking the cigar in his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t seem convinced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just hard to believe the best way to help people is not to help people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What political persuasion were you?\" Armageddon asked. \"Back when such things mattered, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was a registered independent. My wife was a Democrat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, one of the independents.\" Armageddon grinned. \"The luxury of blaming everyone but taking no responsibility. Forgive my little jibe. The point is that none of that matters now. Nobody\u0027s pandering for anyone\u0027s vote anymore. There is only what works and what doesn\u0027t work, and the difference is life and death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take your word for it,\" Mortimer said. \"This is all still new to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s a beautiful day,\" Armageddon said. \"Let\u0027s drink our drinks and smoke our cigars and I promise not to bore you with any more of my amateur babble on politics and economics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not boring,\" Mortimer said. \"But you are keeping me in suspense. You said we might be useful to each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve heard of this Red Czar, I\u0027m sure,\" Armageddon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leader of the Red Stripes. I saw some of his handiwork in Cleveland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the man,\" Armageddon said. \"Little is known about him. What we\u0027d like you to do is infiltrate his organization, find out what he\u0027s planning.\" Armageddon took a long, slow drink of his iced Jack, smacked his lips. \"And if you can get close enough, we\u0027d like you to kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXXXVII\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer sat in stunned silence for nearly a full minute before saying, \"Is that all? Anything else? Would you like the moon a little bit to the left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious,\" Armageddon said. \"You\u0027re uniquely qualified for the task.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, no way,\" Mortimer said flatly. \"Second, how the hell do you figure I\u0027m uniquely qualified? And third, no fucking way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be hasty. Let\u0027s consider this from all angles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have people for this?\" Mortimer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve already lost six good men,\" came a deep voice from behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer started, turned his head to look at the newcomer. A tall, broad-shouldered black man in his middle forties, fit, but with patches of gray in his close-cropped hair, hard features and piercing alert eyes of light brown. He wore an olive-green dress army uniform, but of what army Mortimer could only guess. He wore a star on each shoulder, but the pink Joey\u0027s mushroom cloud on each lapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve sent spies and assassins,\" the black man said. \"None have returned. One was a navy SEAL and another a former FBI agent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. Malcolm, just in time,\" Armageddon said. \"Please join us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm approached the table, bent suddenly and kissed Armageddon on the lips. \"Sorry I\u0027m late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t give it a second thought.\" Armageddon gave Malcolm\u0027s arm a gentle squeeze. \"We\u0027re having a drink if you want something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm shook his head and pulled up a chair. \"It\u0027s a bit early, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm turned his attention back to Mortimer. \"I briefed those men myself and sent them into enemy territory. I feel responsible for them. We only found out later that there are spies among us, men sending the details of our every move back to the Czar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer sat up, cleared his throat and tried to look apologetic. \"Look, I\u0027m flattered you thought of me, but if trained men couldn\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmageddon held up a placating hand. \"Let General Malcolm explain. Then you\u0027ll understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For months now, we\u0027ve had reason to believe the Czar is brewing something pretty big,\" Malcolm said. \"And we\u0027ve been brewing our own little rebuttal. We received word that a refinery has begun production again just outside the malaria zone of New Orleans. Think about what I\u0027m saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gasoline.\" Mortimer remembered all the dead cars along the interstate, the uncomfortable ride in the mule wagon. A plentiful supply of gasoline would change the world. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With a steady supply of gasoline, the sky\u0027s the limit for what the Czar can throw at us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s not just what he can do to us in a military way,\" put in Armageddon. \"Shipping will change, the flow of goods and services.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer said, \"That would be good, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he would play along, it would be very good,\" Armageddon said. \"I would gladly pay Armageddon dollars for gasoline. Others would trade too. If he were smart that\u0027s what he\u0027d do. But tyrants never think like that. No, his Red Stripes have already shown they\u0027d rather take what they need than trade for it. Fueled with unlimited gasoline, they\u0027ll plow through here like locusts and leave nothing, destroying everything we\u0027ve worked so hard to build.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would he do that? It doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmageddon shrugged. \"How can one understand the twisted mind of the megalomaniac? He is the Napoleon of our time, the Hitler, the Stalin. Every so many years, these men come along and ruin it for the rest of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That still doesn\u0027t explain why you think I\u0027m the man for the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allow me to give you a quick bullet-point list of why we want you involved,\" Malcolm said. \"One: you\u0027ve proven resourceful, having come through a number of unique dangers just to get here. Two: as a Platinum member, it\u0027s in your best interest to protect Joey Armageddon\u0027s, not destroy it. Three: since you\u0027ve only just arrived, you\u0027re an outsider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that a plus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I said,\" continued Malcolm, \"we have spies among us. Even if I picked one of my most trusted men, I don\u0027t think we can prevent word getting out. The Red Stripes would be waiting for him, and I\u0027m not losing another man if I can help it. We\u0027ve already fabricated a story for your arrest. We plan to stage your escape. Then the Czar and his men won\u0027t suspect we\u0027ve sent you. We have strong evidence that one of our guards is on the Czar\u0027s payroll, and I\u0027ll arrange for him to be on duty when you break out. He\u0027ll report to the Czar that you\u0027re not one of my soldiers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer shook his head. \"No, I don\u0027t think so. Just because I\u0027m not one of your soldiers doesn\u0027t mean the Red Stripes are going to throw me a welcome party. Why should they care if I got drunk and thrown in jail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve thought of that,\" Armageddon said. \"Tell him, Malcolm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to let it leak that you\u0027ve stolen our defense plans,\" Malcolm said. \"The Czar won\u0027t be able to resist that.\" To Armageddon he said, \"I\u0027ll have one of my people leak it to the kitchen staff. That\u0027ll be like broadcasting it on the radio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally, we\u0027ll supply you with everything you need,\" Armageddon assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s my motivation to say yes to this suicide mission?\" Mortimer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beyond defending our tenuous grasp on civilization from the marauding forces of darkness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Way beyond that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would compensate you, of course. Say twenty thousand Armageddon dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No amount of money will-how much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty thousand,\" said Joey Armageddon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t make sense.\" Mortimer rubbed his eyes. His hangover was coming back double. \"It still doesn\u0027t have to be me. You could bribe anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We thought you\u0027d want to undertake the mission, considering certain personal reasons,\" Malcolm said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are no personal reasons,\" Mortimer said. \"There are personal reasons not to do it. To keep my person from getting killed, for example.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid there are personal reasons. Reasons that you might find compelling,\" said Armageddon. \"The Czar has Anne. Your wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXXXVIII\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of man would leave his wife in the evil clutches of somebody called the Red Czar?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would, damn it. I had an epiphany. Doesn\u0027t anyone respect my goddamn epiphany?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody respected his epiphany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoey Armageddon and his gay general were right. They had Mortimer\u0027s number. He had to try to help Anne. Mortimer waffled. But eventually he agreed to do it. He\u0027d see this thing through to the end. He would find Anne. For better or for worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027m going to do this,\" Mortimer said, \"then I\u0027m going to do it my way. And I\u0027m going to need some things. Get a pen and paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer told them what he needed, and the general briefed him on how it would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll arrange a contact who will guide you when you get there. He\u0027s trustworthy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How will I know him?\" Mortimer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Malcolm told him. \"He\u0027ll know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmageddon took Mortimer\u0027s hand, shook it firmly, looked him straight in the eye. \"I know you\u0027re not crazy about this, probably even feel somewhat coerced, but you\u0027re going to do some good. Frankly, you\u0027ll be a hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer returned the handshake, could only nod and smile weakly. Hooray for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t take him back to his cell like this,\" Malcolm said. \"He looks too good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" Armageddon said. \"We\u0027re supposed to have interrogated him to get our defense plans back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Mortimer didn\u0027t like where this was headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm came up behind him. \"I\u0027ll hold his arms. Work over his face a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in his cell, Mortimer prodded at his puffy eye with his fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey enjoyed that. Assholes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black eye and a swollen lip. He could live with it. He\u0027d had worse. Mortimer rubbed the stump where the Beast had taken his little finger. It seemed an eternity since he\u0027d come down the mountain. Events had swept him along, pushed him forward. Fate was a terrified horse dragging him over rocky ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake it easy, man. It\u0027ll be okay. All you have to do is bust out of Armageddon\u0027s prison, meet up with the mysterious guide, foil the Red Czar, assassinate him if possible while fighting off hordes of Red Stripes (no problem, since they seem to have only one bullet each). Oh, yeah, find your wife and tell her where the hell you ran off to nine years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChild\u0027s play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer waited patiently until finally the expected controlled explosion blew back the cell door, ripping it partway off the hinges. Smoke filled the cell and the hallway beyond. Shouting. Confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuffalo Bill leapt through the smoke and landed in the cell. \"Come on, man. They\u0027re waiting for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer followed him out of the cell, down the smoky hall. They burst out of the bunker, where Mortimer spotted Sheila behind the wheel of a golf cart. That surprised him. Mortimer had told Armageddon he wasn\u0027t going anywhere without his partner, Bill, but he hadn\u0027t said a thing about the girl. No time to wonder about it now. They hopped into the cart, the sound of machine-gun fire cracking behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drive!\" shouted Mortimer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheila stomped the accelerator, and they shot down the narrow path, twisted in and out of the trees until the bunker was well behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where we\u0027re going?\" Mortimer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of,\" Sheila said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were told where to drive the cart,\" Bill said. \"After that we don\u0027t have a fucking clue. I was hoping you\u0027d fill us in. We were instructed to bust you out of jail, and the rest is a mystery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got us a gig,\" Mortimer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said we should be partners, right? I\u0027ll tell you all about it when we\u0027re in the clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheila turned off the road and headed into the forest. They soon came to a ring of stones, some kind of long-unused camping area. Sheila parked the cart. They held their breath and listened. A moment later, they heard footsteps through dry leaves. Lars stepped into view. He\u0027d been hiding behind a stand of trees and wore a camouflage poncho over his black suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way,\" Lars said. \"It\u0027s all here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crowded around and Lars directed them to a pile of luggage hidden among the shrubs, six backpacks. They were mismatched but all of good quality and stuffed with supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll need to put on a bit of a show as if we\u0027re looking for you,\" Lars told them. \"But the pursuit won\u0027t make it this way for a while, and they won\u0027t look for you very hard. Still, I would advise you not to linger.\" He handed Mortimer a folded map. \"We\u0027ve marked the best route on here, but you might have to improvise as events dictate.\" He shook Mortimer\u0027s hand. \"I wish you luck, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Lars. It\u0027s been grand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer, Bill and Sheila slung the backpacks over their shoulders, headed south into the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back on the road again. I\u0027m going to miss that soft bed,\" Bill said. \"Where we headed anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE LOST CITY OF ATLANTA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXXXIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was already a notorious place of legend and peril throughout the new world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtlanta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust the name of the place sent shivers through some of the old-timers. Mothers frightened naughty children by threatening to send them south to Atlanta. Stories became more colorful in the telling and retelling. The Headless Zombies of Buckhead was a favorite tale for those who enjoyed loose talk in saloons, as was the myth of the entire Braves baseball team turning cannibal and roaming the city in search of people to deep-fry in hot canola oil. It was generally understood that the ghosts of Delta flight attendants haunted the airport, and that anyone spending the night in or near the airport experienced vivid, disturbing dreams often resembling footage from Airport 1975. It was commonly known that various gangs, almost like tribes, ruled sections of the city. This was not uncommon for many metropolitan areas where food shortages were sudden and devastating, a situation that encouraged the strong and ruthless to prey upon the weak. No citrus had come up from Florida for years, nor anything else from merchants traveling in or too close to the forbidden city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther stories, while unconfirmed, were widely believed nevertheless. The most popular rumor claimed Atlanta was the headquarters of the Red Czar. Furthermore, the Czar himself was credited with killing all the gang chiefs in the city one by one, by challenging them to duels, beheading them with a fireman\u0027s axe and putting their heads on spikes as a warning to any who might defy him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s what you\u0027ve gotten us into,\" Bill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell was I supposed to know?\" Mortimer pushed aside a tree branch, followed the narrow game trail. \"It\u0027s not like anyone pulled me aside and said oh, by the way, the city of Atlanta is now instant death, so don\u0027t go there, whatever you do. Next you\u0027ll tell me they don\u0027t make Coke anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha ha. I\u0027m serious about this, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard there\u0027s a rapist grizzly bear,\" Sheila said. \"He escaped from the zoo, and he catches people camping and rapes them from behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, now, come on!\" Another branch slapped Mortimer in the face. Fucking bullshit map. Where the hell\u0027s the road?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know about no rapist bear,\" Bill said. \"But I know people who go there don\u0027t come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend of a guy of somebody I talked to in Nashville.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend of a guy of somebody you talked to, huh?\" Mortimer squinted at the map, hoped he hadn\u0027t gotten them lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just saying it would have been nice if you consulted me first is all,\" Bill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" Sheila said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t very well consult you from my prison cell.\" To Sheila Mortimer said, \"And what are you even doing here? I thought you were going to try to talk them into letting you be a Joey Girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheila made a disgusted sound. \"I had a change of heart about that. I don\u0027t want any sweaty men climbing on me unless I say so. A whore is a whore no matter how fancy. I want to kick ass and explore like you guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear that, Mort?\" Bill asked. \"We kick ass and explore. I think we should put that on our business cards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheila stuck out her tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer stopped, sat down on a log, dropped his gear. They each carried two backpacks stuffed with supplies, and Mortimer wiped sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand. Spring had definitely come early. \"Take five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheila and Bill dropped their backpacks too, sat on the ground, visibly relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do we find the road?\" Sheila asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much farther.\" I hope. Mortimer swigged water from his canteen. \"Okay, let\u0027s redistribute some of this stuff.\" He clapped his hands. \"Gather \u0027round, kids. Christmas time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened three backpacks before he found what he was looking for, a slightly dented Union cavalryman\u0027s hat, blue with gold trim. He handed it to Bill. \"Not quite like the one you lost, but it\u0027s the best I could do on short notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa.\" Bill took the hat, tried it on. It fit well. \"Hell, now I do look like George Custer. Where\u0027d you find it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Museum display. But wait, there\u0027s more. Armageddon said he\u0027d get whatever I needed for the journey, so I put in an order for these.\" Mortimer went into the backpack and came out with a pair of pistols with belt and holsters, handed them to Bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my,\" Bill said, taking the pistols. \"Oh, my goodness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer wasn\u0027t sure, but he thought he saw the cowboy\u0027s eyes go watery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill cleared his throat. \"These are beautiful.\" The.45-caliber Colt Peacemakers were handsomely made, well oiled, the finish a deep blue. He strapped them on, performed a couple of experimental quick-draws, a wide grin splitting his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope these are to your liking,\" Mortimer said. \"Of course, I didn\u0027t have time to consult you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell.\" Bill looked mildly embarrassed. \"You know I\u0027m not going to let you run off into danger all by yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe backpacks also contained three.45 MAC-10 machine pistols with shoulder straps and extra magazines and two.45 automatics with shoulder holsters. He handed the weapons around, and they spent a few minutes strapping them on and getting the feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued to search the backpacks until they found food, and Mortimer was delighted to discover a pound of ground coffee and a small supply of cigars. When Armageddon paid them the twenty thousand, Mortimer would damn well lay in a supply of coffee, whatever the cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate, drank more water from the canteens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Mortimer said. \"Let\u0027s get moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road was only another ten minutes\u0027 march. They checked the map again and set off. They were armed, fed and headed to Atlanta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the time before chaos and destruction, one could streak down I-75 from Chattanooga to Atlanta in under two hours. Now the world was again an enormous place, and from Lookout Mountain, via the zigzag \"safe\" route Lars had outlined on the map, the forbidden city of Atlanta was a good week\u0027s hard hike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth day, it began to rain and didn\u0027t stop. They shivered in the bone-numbing cold. Staying dry was an impossible task. They tried to stay positive. Mortimer and his companions trudged on undaunted, spirits refusing to be dampened. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/go-go-girls-of-the-apocalypse/page-15.html","bookId":1578,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:01:17 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:01:17 AM"}
