There were the walls and the window and the grass outside. They had no names. They were just things. There was a bed and a chair an books that developed themselves idly on the screen at the foot of his bed. There was the nurse who brought him his food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first he had made efforts to piece together the scraps of things he had heard. Such as those two men talking together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne had said: \"Complete aphasia now. It\u0027s cleaned out, and I think without damage. It will only be necessary to return the recording of his original brain-wave makeup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered the sounds by rote, and for some reason they seemed peculiar sounds - as if they meant something. But why bother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter to watch the pretty changing colors on the screen at the foot of the thing he lay on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then someone entered and did things to him and for a long time, he slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when that had passed, the bed was suddenly a bed and he knew he was in a hospital, and the words he remembered made sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up: \"What\u0027s happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe First Speaker was beside him, \"You\u0027re on the Second Foundation, and you have your mind back - your original mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! Yes!\" Channis came to the realization that he was himself, and there was incredible triumph and joy in that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now tell me,\" said the First Speaker, \"do you know where the Second Foundation is now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the truth came flooding down in one enormous wave and Channis did not answer. Like Ebling Mis before him, he was conscious of only one vast, numbing surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil he finally nodded, and said: \"By the Stars of the Galaxy - now, I know.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/second-foundation-foundation-3/page-8.html","bookId":2017,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:33 PM"}
