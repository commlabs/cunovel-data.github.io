With whom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An old friend.\" An exasperated sigh escaped Sara\u0027s lips. \"If you must know, I\u0027m meeting Gabriel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding replaced confusion in Maurice\u0027s eyes, but only for a moment as jealousy quickly took its place. \"So, he\u0027s finally come to see you after all these years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it\u0027s wise for you to meet with him alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How will it look, the two of you being alone together in your room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara felt a blush stain her cheeks. It wasn\u0027t proper to entertain a man alone in her apartment. But Gabriel wasn\u0027t just any man. He was her benefactor; but, more than that, he was her friend, the closest thing to a family that she had. But it wasn\u0027t that thought that brought the flush to her cheeks. It was the knowledge that she wanted to be more to him than a protegee. Much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be all right,\" Sara said, keeping her voice carefully cool and calm. \"After all, he\u0027s been supporting me for the past five years. I can hardly refuse to see him.\" She hated lying to Maurice. It wasn\u0027t Gabriel who had insisted on seeing her. Quite the opposite, in fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone should be there with you,\" Maurice insisted. \"A chaperon, if you will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Babette will be there,\" Sara lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice laid his hand on her arm. \"I love you, Sara. I only want what\u0027s best for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" She gazed into his eyes, wishing she could return his affection, but she belonged to Gabriel heart and soul, had been his since the first time she saw him on her veranda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marry me, Sara,\" Maurice implored. He dropped to one knee and took her hand in his. \"I know I\u0027m not nearly good enough for you, but you\u0027ll be rich in love if nothing else, I promise you that. Only say yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maurice...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s him, isn\u0027t it?\" Maurice rose to his feet, his eyes blazing with anger and jealousy. \"You\u0027re infatuated with that old man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you think he\u0027s old?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara frowned. She\u0027d never given any serious thought to Gabriel\u0027s age. Thinking of it now, she realized she truly had no idea how old he was. To look at him, one would guess him to be in his late twenties, and yet he seemed much older, much wiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how old he is, and I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m not running off with him, Maurice. He\u0027s only coming by to see how I\u0027m doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it won\u0027t matter if I\u0027m there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid it will matter very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t wish to discuss it any further, Maurice. Quick, give me a kiss for luck. There\u0027s my music.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe danced that night as never before, certain that Gabriel was somewhere in the audience. Her solo was for him and him alone. When she looked at the prince, it was Gabriel\u0027s face that loomed in her mind; it was Gabriel\u0027s kiss that awakened her from her enchanted sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had hoped he would be waiting for her outside the theater, but he was nowhere to be seen. Maurice insisted on walking her home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bade him good night at the door, assuring him she would be fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dismissed Babette for the night, bathed quickly, slipped into a modest dark blue velvet dressing gown with a froth of lace at the throat. She lit several candles, filled a bowl with apples and cheese, placed a bottle of wine and two glasses on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was all aquiver by the time she heard his knock at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, she crossed the room and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood in the shadows as before, his face hidden in a hooded cloak as dark as the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel,\" she exclaimed, her voice filled with joy. \"Come in.\" She closed the door behind him, wishing she could keep him there forever. \"Let me take your cloak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You needn\u0027t hide your face from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked toward him, her hand out. \"Let me take your cloak, Gabriel. It\u0027s warm in here, and you\u0027ll be more comfortable without it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking of your comfort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your face doesn\u0027t distress me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh of resignation, he removed his cloak and handed it to her. He knew how hideous he must look, the skin on his face and arms discolored and puckered by the heat of the sun, yet her smile faltered hardly at all as she looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara carried his cloak into her bedroom. For a moment, she pressed her face to the finely woven wool, breathing in his scent, and then she placed it carefully on the bed, her hands running over the material, pretending it was Gabriel her hand caressed and not his cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she returned to the parlor, he was sitting on the far end of the sofa, away from the candles that flickered on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like something to eat?\" Sara asked, gesturing toward the bowl of fruit and cheese. \"Some wine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A glass of wine,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe filled two glasses, then sat down beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were wonderful tonight,\" Gabriel remarked. \"I have never seen anyone dance with such intensity, such joy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was for you,\" Sara confessed quietly. \"I knew you were out there, watching me, and I wanted to make you proud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve done well, Sara Jayne. You are a ballerina without equal, just as you always dreamed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I owe it all to you, and I thank you for it with all my heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, cara. It was always there, within you. So, tell me, where do you go from here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s talk that the company will go on tour in the fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel nodded. \"All the world should see you dance, cara,\" he said, and then frowned. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love dancing,\" Sara said, \"but it isn\u0027t enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the world at your feet. What more do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you at my side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, he retreated from her at the mention of anything personal between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing on her courage, she put her goblet aside and then, taking his untouched glass from his hand and placing it on the table, she slid across the sofa and placed her hand on his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me you don\u0027t care,\" she said, her gaze intent upon his face. \"Tell me you don\u0027t want me, and I\u0027ll never speak of it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know better than that,\" Gabriel replied, his voice rough. \"I\u0027ve wanted you, hungered for you, for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are we apart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it is for the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For whom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you, cara. You must trust me in this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! You must trust mein this. It makes no sense for us to be apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes more sense than you will ever know. You would do well to forget you ever knew me. Marry your young man. Dance for the world. Have children, and teach them to dance. It\u0027s what you were born for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara shook her head. \"No, Gabriel,\" she said fervently. \"I was born for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith slow deliberation, she moved closer, until only a breath of air separated them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she said the words he could not resist, and he knew he was lost. \"Let me hold you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis resolve melted like warm wax as she drew him into her arms. If he had any weakness besides his need to avoid the sun, it was his need to be held by this woman. She was sunlight to his darkness, eternal life to his infinite damnation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long while, she held him close, and then she kissed him. She didn\u0027t close her eyes, nor did he. She saw the flame, bright as molten gold, that leaped into his eyes, felt the raw animal power, the naked hunger, the overwhelming need that engulfed him as her mouth closed on his. He wanted her. Oh, yes, he definitely wanted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she wanted him. She wanted to feel his strength, wanted him to possess her, fully, completely, masterfully. Wanted him to take her with all the power at his command, to show her what it meant to be loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked into his eyes and she felt herself drowning, sinking down, down, into darkness, into light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel moaned her name as he drew her closer, his arms wrapping around her, strong and sure. Her breasts were crushed against his chest, his hands stroked her back, slipped under her gown to caress the curve of her calf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped, startled by the intimacy of his touch, by the pleasure that shot clear through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was drowning in sensation, helpless to resist the power of his touch, the hunger in his eyes. Eyes that burned fever bright, igniting tiny flames within her heart, her soul, filling her with a warmth that flowed through her veins, making her restless for something she didn\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh of surrender, she closed her eyes and gave herself up to the magic of his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her total lack of fear, her complete trust in him, that was his undoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn animal-like growl of pain rose in his throat as he devoured her mouth with his. She was sunshine and light, goodness and hope, the innocence of youth, everything that was forever lost to him. He kissed her deeply, searching for salvation, wishing for humanity. She was soft and supple in his arms, willing, eager, a foolish moth racing toward the flames of destruction, and he didn\u0027t have the strength to protect her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands delved beneath her gown to find living flesh and skin softer than velvet, smoother than satin. In moments, her gown was on the floor. In another moment, his clothes joined hers. And then she was in his arms, a study in perfection from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet. And she was his. His for the taking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved her gently, his hands trembling, his voice ragged with the effort to hold back, until his body was on fire for her. He was on the verge of making her his when he heard her soft cry of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorrified, he froze, his body poised over hers. Only then did he realize that the hunger was also burning through him, that his kisses were no longer gentle, that his fangs had almost pierced the fragile skin at her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot knowing how close she was to danger, she arched beneath him, seeking fulfillment for the restless wanting of her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a growl, he drew away and turned his back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was low and uneven, filled with confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me,\" he said gruffly. \"I didn\u0027t mean...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel.\" She placed a tentative hand on his back, felt his whole body shudder at her touch. \"I want you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Sara,\" he replied, his voice ragged. \"Don\u0027t ask me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please let me go.\" It was a cry of anguish, a plea for her to be strong because his need for her made him weak and vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s for the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not!\" Embarrassed and hurt by his rejection, she sat up, her arms crossed over her breasts. \"I wish I\u0027d never left England,\" she said, fighting back her tears. \"I wish I was still in that awful chair. You loved me then. I know you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, his hands balling into fists, as her unhappiness washed over him. He never should have come here, he thought. Never should have seen her again. He hadn\u0027t meant to cause her pain, only to ease his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could wipe it all from her mind. He had only to look into her eyes, to bend her will to his. He could make her forget that he existed... but to do so would be like ending his existence, he thought bleakly, because if he didn\u0027t exist for Sara, there was no point in going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd because he was basically a selfish man, because he\u0027d been alone for too long, he turned around and took her hand in his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, and he cringed before the misery in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Gabriel,\" she murmured. \"Please don\u0027t leave me. I need you so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I need you. Tell me, cara, if I stay, will you do as I ask without question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything I say? Even if it makes no sense to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight frown lined her brow. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s quite simple. I\u0027ll stay, but only if you promise to do whatever I ask, without question, no matter how odd it might seem at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you must dismiss your maid from your employ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Babette?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, but why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Without question, cara, remember? Now,\" he said quietly, \"put on your gown. It\u0027s late, and you need your rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" Sara bit off the word. She would do whatever he asked, without question, just as she had promised. But not asking questions was far harder than she had anticipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not too late to change your mind,\" Gabriel remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara shook her head, and he turned away to don his own clothing. He heard the soft rustling of her gown as she slipped it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then did he turn to face her. \"You\u0027re so young, Sara. I don\u0027t want to hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his hand, silencing her. \"It\u0027s late. I want you to go to bed. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow night, at the theater.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, cara. Sleep well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, my angel. Will you dream of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As always,\" he replied, bending to kiss her cheek. \"As always.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/embrace-the-night/page-13.html","bookId":2307,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM"}
