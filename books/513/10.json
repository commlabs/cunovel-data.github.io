A shadow covered the dim light behind the glass-plated door, and the Ron-body entered the silent room. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He saw his own hand reaching out to flick on the light switch. He saw his own face register dismay and annoyance at the quiet scene.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the Ron-body turned and was about to leave.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stay awhile,\" Ron said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He stood up, revealing the weapon, holding it in both of his small hands for firm control of the trigger.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" his voice said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, well,\" Ron answered. \"Very well, thanks. Only I won\u0027t speak for you, Scholar. Because I don\u0027t think you\u0027re well at all.

It\u0027s one of the deep-rooted convictions of the human ego. It reflects their suspicion, their distrust of the superintelligent ...

I\u0027m too ordinary myself. I\u0027m killing you for me, for Ron Carver! Because I\u0027m sore!
