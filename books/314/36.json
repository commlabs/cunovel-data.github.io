{"id":21010,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 36","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Enforcers turn the entire block into a mobile cop headquarters with cars and paddy wagons and satellite links on flatbed trucks. Dudes with white coats are walking up and down through the hop field with Geiger counters. Squeaky is wandering around with his headset, staring into space, carrying on conversations with people who aren\u0027t there. A tow truck shows up, towing T-Bone\u0027s black BMW behind it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo, pod.\" Hiro turns around and looks. It\u0027s Y.T. She\u0027s just come out of a Hunan place across the street. She hands Hiro a little white box and a pair of chopsticks. \"Spicy chicken with black bean sauce, no MSG. You know how to use chopsticks?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro shrugs off this insult.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a double order,\" Y.T. continues, \"\u0027cause I figure we got some good intel tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you aware of what happened here?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I mean, some people obviously got hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But you weren\u0027t an eyewitness.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I couldn\u0027t keep up with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good,\" Hiro says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What did happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro just shakes his head. The spicy chicken is glistening darkly under the lights; he has never been less hungry in his life. \"If I had known, I wouldn\u0027t have gotten you involved. I just thought it was a surveillance job.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to get into it. Look. Stay away from Raven, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" she says. She says it in the chirpy tone of voice that she uses when she\u0027s lying and she wants to make sure you know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSqueaky hauls open the back door of the BMW and looks into the back seat. Hiro steps a little closer, gets a nasty whiff of cold smoke. It is the smell of burnt plastic.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe aluminum briefcase that Raven earlier gave to T-Bone is sitting in the middle of the seat. It looks like it has been thrown into a fire; it has black smoke stains splaying out around the locks, and its plastic handle is partially melted. The buttery leather that covers the BMW\u0027s seats has burn marks on it. No wonder T-Bone was pissed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSqueaky pulls on a pair of latex gloves. He hauls the briefcase out, sets it on the trunk lid, and rips the latches open with a small prybar.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhatever it is, it is complicated and highly designed. The top half of the case has several rows of the small red-capped tubes that Hiro saw at the U-Stor-It. There are five rows with maybe twenty tubes in each row.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe bottom half of the case appears to be some kind of miniaturized, old-fashioned computer terminal. Most of it is occupied by a keyboard. There is a small liquid-crystal display screen that can probably handle about five lines of text at a time. There is a penlike object attached to the case by a cable, maybe three feet long uncoiled. It looks like it might be a light pen or a bar-code scanner. Above the keyboard is a lens, set at an angle so that it is aimed at whoever is typing on the keyboard. There are other features whose purpose is not so obvious: a slot, which might be a place to insert a credit or ID card, and a cylindrical socket that is about the size of one of those little tubes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is Hiro\u0027s reconstruction of how the thing looked at one time. When Hiro sees it, it is melted together. Judging from the pattern of smoke marks on the outside of the case -- which appear to be jetting outward from the crack between the top and bottom -- the source of the flame was inside, not outside.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSqueaky reaches down and unsnaps one of the tubes from the bracket, holds it up in front of the bright lights of Chinatown. It had been transparent but was now smirched by heat and smoke. From a distance, it looks like a simple vial, but stepping up to look at it more closely Hiro can see at least half a dozen tiny individual compartments inside the thing, all connected to each other by capillary tubes. It has a red plastic cap on one end of it. The cap has a black rectangular window, and as Squeaky rotates it, Hiro can see the dark red glint of an inactive LED display inside, like looking at the display on a turned-off calculator. Underneath this is a small perforation. It isn\u0027t just a simple drilled hole. It is wide at the surface, rapidly narrowing to a nearly invisible pinpoint opening, like the bell of a trumpet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe compartments inside the vial are all partially filled with liquids. Some of them are transparent and some are blackish brown. The brown ones have to be organics of some kind, now reduced by the heat into chicken soup. The transparent ones could be anything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"He got out to go into a bar and have a drink,\" Squeaky mumbles. \"What an asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"T-Bone. See, T-Bone was, like, the registered owner of this unit. The suitcase. And as soon as he got more than about ten feet away from it -- *foosh* -- it self-destructed.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSqueaky looks at Hiro like he\u0027s stupid. \"Well, it\u0027s not like I work for Central Intelligence or anything. But I would guess that whoever makes this drug -- they call it Countdown, or Redcap, or Snow Crash -- has a real thing about trade secrets. So if the pusher abandons the suitcase, or loses it, or tries to transfer ownership to someone else -- *foosh*.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You think the Crips are going to catch up with Raven?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in Chinatown. Shit,\" Squeaky says, getting pissed again in retrospect, \"I can\u0027t believe that guy. I could have killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Raven?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No. That Crip. Chasing Raven. He\u0027s lucky Raven got to him first, not me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You were chasing the Crip?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I was chasing the Crip. What, did you think I was trying to catch Raven?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of, yeah. I mean, he\u0027s the bad guy, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely. So I\u0027d be chasing Raven if I was a cop and it was my job to catch bad guys. But I\u0027m an Enforcer, and it\u0027s my job to enforce order. So I\u0027m doing everything I can -- and so is every other Enforcer in town -- to protect Raven. And if you have any ideas about trying to go and find Raven yourself and get revenge for that colleague of yours that he offed, you can forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Offed? What colleague?\" Y.T. breaks in. She didn\u0027t see what happened with Lagos.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro is mortified by this idea. \"Is that why everyone was telling me not to fuck with Raven? They were afraid I was going to attack him?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSqueaky eyes the swords. \"You got the means.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should anyone protect Raven?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSqueaky smiles, as though we have just crossed the border into the realm of kidding around. \"He\u0027s a Sovereign.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"So declare war on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a good idea to declare war on a nuclear power.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ,\" Squeaky says, shaking his head, \"if I had any idea how little you knew about this shit, I never would have let you into my car. I thought you were some kind of a serious CIC wet-operations guy. Are you telling me you really didn\u0027t know about Raven?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s what I\u0027m telling you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I\u0027m gonna tell you this so you don\u0027t go out and cause any more trouble. Raven\u0027s packing a torpedo warhead that he boosted from an old Soviet nuke sub. It was a torpedo that was designed to take out a carrier battle group with one shot. A nuclear torpedo. You know that funny-looking sidecar that Raven has on his Harley? Well, it\u0027s a hydrogen bomb, man. Armed and ready. The trigger\u0027s hooked up to EEC trodes embedded in his skull. If Raven dies, the bomb goes off. So when Raven comes into town, we do everything in our power to make the man feel welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro\u0027s just gaping. Y.T. has to step in on his behalf. \"Okay,\" she says. \"Speaking for my partner and myself, we\u0027ll stay away from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/701.html","bookId":314,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM"}
