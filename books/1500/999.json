The gravity that was already increased to an inconceivable level was still increasing, space even starting to show signs of being unstable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe Spider Empress’ eight limbs already completely unfolded. Her enormous body slowly rose, increased its speed, and then it smashed head first into the starship. When her hands completely unfolded, just the length of her arms alone already exceeded a kilometer! The Spider Empress’ hands stabbed firmly into the starship, grabbed it, and then forcefully tore it apart! This starship that could travel through the cosmos unexpectedly couldn’t resist the ripping force of her hands, the belly of the ship directly torn apart! A blinding ball of flame suddenly lit up in the night sky, as if a sun rose in the darkness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe starship completely exploded, and then it began to burn. The twisted gravitational field recovered. Within the several dozen kilometers diameter black hole that originally appeared in the great sea, a huge amount of saltwater returned, waves rumbling like thunder, momentarily overwhelming all sound! A giant whirlpool appeared above the sea surface once more, as if it was the end of the world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eTen million mechanical units still surrounded the Spider Empress’ body, attacking tirelessly. They were like flies around a giant beast, tangling about without scattering.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe Spider Empress’ face was ice-cold, her eyes starting to turn a pure golden color. Then, two streaks of golden light shot out from her pupils, extending several dozen kilometers out! Spider Empress’ giant body began to rotate, and as a result, the two streaks of golden light drew out a perfect circle. Thus, under the curtain of night, a massive golden disk appeared.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe disk was instantly covered in cracks, slowly breaking apart. Every single fragment tumbled about, flying in all different directions. In the fragments’ surroundings, all scenery began to twist and distort, including those mechanical combat units in the sky. The closer the mechanical units were, the more severe they warped. However, not even this degree of warping made these combat units made mostly of metal break apart, as if they instantly became much softer. The distortion wasn’t the only thing that happened, as the fragments scattered, there were even mechanical units whose outer shells began to melt!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eWhen the first distorted combat unit released flames, Fitzdurk couldn’t help but cry out, “Doomsday Storm!

Less than a century ago, this planet was but an extremely primitive place!” Fitzdurk was still hesitating.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“It isn’t strange for anything to happen on this world already. Don’t you feel like such a massive biological body shouldn’t have appeared on this planet in the first place?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eFitzdurk expressed his agreement. On this planet, if there really was a life as massive as the Spider Empress, it would still only appear in the sea. On a continent, just the body’s weight alone would crush all of their bones. Not even ultra life forms would choose to evolve to such a massive degree, even if there were any, it would still be done in preparation to fully enter outer space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe Spider Empress’ surroundings were already covered in golden fragments. Mechanical units began to burn one after another, regardless of what their bodies were made of, they all began to burn, even metal melting into liquid, and then releasing flames. Large amounts of flames covered everything within a several dozen kilometers radius. From time to time, scorching metal would drop from the sky and enter the great sea, creating surging steam.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eIn the Spider Empress’ surroundings, no life could exist, all matter burned under the over ten thousand degrees temperature. The ten million mechanical units’ attacks originally turned everything within a kilometer radius around the Spider Empress into a high temperature zone, but now, wherever the golden fragments were, the temperature still suddenly rose, blazing flames covering every corner of this place, turning the several hundred square kilometers sea region into a domain of death. Meanwhile, the mechanical units couldn’t tolerate such high temperature at all, exploding and falling one after another as a result, turning into a dazzling meteor shower.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eNo mechanical units could escape Doomsday Storm’s range. When the last four energy motherships also exploded, the four giant balls of flame presented the climax of destruction!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eDoomsday Storm, Magic Domain twelfth level ability, its power was above all abilities. It was originally an ability that shouldn’t have appeared on a low level planet like this, yet now, it reemerged in the Spider Empress’ hands. Within Doomsday Storm’s radius, the close to ten thousand degrees flames could burn almost all matter, from this creating a dead zone. Magic Domain was originally the inheritor apostle’s domain, Doomsday Storm also his ultimate ability. However, even in the apostle’s hands, Doomsday Storm wouldn’t possess the extraordinary power the Spider Empress displayed at this moment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eWhen the last of the remains fell into the great sea, there was nothing left in the Spider Empress’ surroundings.
