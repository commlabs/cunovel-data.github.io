{"id":39795,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V GOING DOWN.","content":"\u0026nbsp;On the evening of the day appointed for the dinner, Mr. Philip Deane stood on the steps of Barton\u0027s restaurant in the Strand, in anything but a contented frame of mind. His face, never too frank or genial in its expression, was puckered and set in rigid lines; his right hand was perpetually diving into his waistcoat-pocket for his watch, to which he constantly referred; while with, a light stick which he carried in his left, he kept striking his leg in an irritable and irritating manner. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Deane had cause for annoyance; it was a quarter past seven, and neither of the guests whom he had invited had as yet appeared, though the dinner had been appointed for seven sharp. Crowds of men were pouring into and out of the restaurant, the first hungry and expectant, the last placid and replete; and Mr. Deane envied the first for what they were about to receive, and the last for what they had received. Moreover, the intended diners had in several cases pushed against him with scant ceremony, and Mr. Deane was not accustomed to be pushed against; while the people who had dined eyed him, as they stood on the steps lighting their cigars, with something like compassion, and Mr. Deane was unused to be pitied. So he stood there fretting and fuming, and biting his lips and flicking his legs, until his shoulder was grasped by George Dallas, who, with as much breath as he could command--not much, for he had been running--said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My dear Deane! a thousand apologies for being so late!

I went round to the Mercury office to look at some proofs, and they kept me to do an article on a subject which I had had the handling of before, and which--\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No one else could handle arter you, eh?

Dallas, who followed him closely, noticed him pause for an instant before one of the looking-glasses in the passage, put his hat a little more on one side, and throw open the folds of his fur-lined coat. Beneath this noticeable garment Mr. Deane wore a large baggy suit of black, an open-worked shirt-front with three large diamond studs in it, a heavy gold watch-chain. There was a large diamond ring on the little finger of each hand. Thus tastefully attired, Mr. Deane, swaggering easily up the centre of the coffee-room and slapping his leg with his stick as he went, at length stopped at a vacant table, and clinked a knife against a tumbler.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now, waiter! Just look smart and slippy, and bring up our dinner right away. One of my friends is here, and I\u0027m not a-goin\u0027 to wait for the other.

Following Mr. Deane\u0027s glance, the waiter\u0027s eyes lighted on \"this,\" and that functionary immediately fell into wrathful vernacular.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hullo! what are you doing here?\" said he. \"Come, you get out of this, d\u0027ye hear?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hear,\" said the boy, without moving a muscle. \"Don\u0027t you flurry yourself in that way often, or you\u0027ll bust!

You should think of your precious family, you should!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will you--\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I won\u0027t, and that\u0027s all about it. Here, guv\u0027nor \"--to Deane--\"you\u0027re my pitch; I\u0027ve brought this for you.\" As he said this, the boy produced from his pocket a bit of string, a pair of musical bones, and a crumpled note, and handed the latter to Deane, who stepped aside to the nearest gas-jet to read it. To the great indignation of the waiter, the boy sat himself down on the edge of a chair, and, kicking his legs to and fro, surveyed the assembled company with calm deliberation. He appeared to be taking stock generally of everything round him. Between his dirty finger and thumb he took up a corner of the table-cloth, then he passed his hand lightly over Dallas\u0027s overcoat, which was lying on an adjacent chair. This gave the waiter his chance of bursting out again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Leave that coat alone, can\u0027t you? Can\u0027t you keep your fingers off things that don\u0027t belong to you? Thought it was your own, perhaps, didn\u0027t you?\" This last remark, in a highly sarcastic tone, as he lifted the coat from the chair and was about to carry it to a row of pegs by the door. \"This ain\u0027t your mark, I believe? Your tailor don\u0027t live at Hamherst, does he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Never mind my tailor, old cock!

Jim Swain\u0027s my name--Strike-a-light Jim--60 Fullwood\u0027s-rents. Now, tell me who\u0027s your barber!\" The waiter, who had a head as bald as a billiard-ball, was highly incensed at this remark (which sent some young men at an adjoining table into roars of laughter), and he would probably have found some means of venting his wrath, had not a sharp exclamation from Deane called off his attention.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Get up dinner, waiter, at once, and clear off this third place, d\u0027ye hear?

He wants me to come to his rooms to-morrow night--that\u0027s for his pleasure and profit, I guess, not mine--just depends on the humour I\u0027m in. Now here\u0027s the dinner. Let\u0027s get at it at once. There\u0027s been no screwin\u0027 nor scrapin\u0027 in the ordering of it, and you can just give Routh a back-hander next time you see him by telling him how much you liked it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Deane unfolded his table napkin with a flourish, and cleared a space in front of him for his plate. There was an evil expression on his face; a mordant, bitter, savage expression, which Dallas did not fail to remark. However, he took no notice of it, and the conversation during dinner was confined to ordinary commonplaces.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Deane had not boasted without reason; the dinner was excellent, the wines were choice and abundant, and with another kind of companion George Dallas would have enjoyed himself. But even in the discussion of the most ordinary topics there was a low coarseness in Deane\u0027s conversation, a vulgar self-sufficiency and delight at his own shrewdness, a miserable mistrust of every one, and a general arrogance and conceit which were highly nettling and repulsive. During dinner these amiable qualities displayed themselves in Mr. Deane\u0027s communication with the waiter; it was not until the cloth had been removed, and they were taking their first glass of port, that Deane reverted to what had annoyed him before they sat down.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That Routh\u0027s what they call a mean cuss, t\u0027other side the water,\" he commenced; \"a mean cuss he is, and nothing else. Throwing me over in this way at the last minute, and never sending word before, so that I might have said we shall only be two instead of three, and saved paying for him! He thinks he\u0027s cruel wide awake, he does; but though he\u0027s been at it all his life, and it\u0027s not six months since I first caught sight of this little village nominated London, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much he could put me up to now!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He looked so expectant of a compliment, that Dallas felt bound to say: \"You certainly seem to have made the most of your time!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Made the most of my time!

They know me, and they know I pay my way as I go, and that I\u0027ve got plenty of money. Help yourself--good port this, ain\u0027t it?--ought to be, for they charge eight shillings a bottle for it. Why people out t\u0027other side the water, sir, they think I\u0027m staying in titled country-houses, and dining in Portland-place, and going to hear oratorios. I\u0027ve got letters of introduction in my desk which would do all that, and more. Never mind!

If you do that, you\u0027ll generally find yourself not a loser in the end. We\u0027ll have another bottle of this eight-shilling port.
