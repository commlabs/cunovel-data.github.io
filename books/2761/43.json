His hands, his face, his eyes… his aching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of it wraps around me and I inhale it. I want to free him of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this moment, he wants to change, and I want to help him do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be with me, Dom.” I breathe. “Be with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe energy in the room is palpable as he fluidly slips his fingers into me, cool and long. His body hovers over me in the dark, his breath warm on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure I can do this,” he says again, uncertainly. “I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can,” I assure him firmly. “You can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slip from under him and flip over on top of him, straddling his hips as I stare down at him. His face is beautiful in the dark, even as it is tortured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want me?” I whisper softly, leaning forward to trail my fingers down his cheek. I can feel his erection pressing against me, rigid and hard. “I know you do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and I raise an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes or no?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles ever so slightly, but I can see the pain behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he murmurs, his hands gripping my hips and pulling me closer. With one movement, I lift and sink onto him, burying him deep within me. He glides into me easily, deeply, completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment is frozen in time, like the world stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike it’s so fucking reverent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the universe knows how significant this is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe gasp at the same time, then Dominic groans, closing his eyes as my warmth surrounds him, as he sinks into a woman’s body for the first time in six years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus,” he mumbles, his fingers digging into my skin as I rock on top of him. I start out slow, but I can’t keep from growing frantic. I want to please him, to pleasure him… to save him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a whole, what we’re doing is so much more than this simple action. It’s more than a simple fuck. And we both know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s significant on a thousand different levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords escape me as I watch his face… at the look of wonder, amazement, and raw pleasure. I realize in this moment that he actually thought he couldn’t do it. He had an actual mental block and he thought he’d never get past it. It took me pushing him… taking matters into my own hands to make him do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, you feel good,” he murmurs, opening his eyes and staring into mine. I lean down and kiss him, my tongue tangling with his, my heat pouring into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See?” I ask him, rocking softly atop him once again. He reaches up and cups my breasts, kneading my skin, his thumbs rubbing over my nipples, gentle at first, then harder. “You thought that only the dark and taboo worked for you. You thought you deserved that. You thought you deserved dark corners and hidden rooms. But you deserve this too, Dom. You deserve to be loved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDom stops and looks at me, his eyes widening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You love me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice is quiet and shocked. And he’s no more shocked than I am that I said the words out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop all movement, shoving my hair away from my face as I stare at him. The idea of putting myself out there like that is terrifying. But I have to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you,” I whisper hesitantly. “I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic closes his eyes, squeezes them closed as his hands slide lightly down my back, his fingernails grazing my skin. “Don’t,” he whispers. “Don’t love me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bend and cup his face in my hands, kissing him on the mouth. “Too late,” I whisper against his lips. “It’s too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny bit of wetness escapes from Dominic’s eye, streaking down his cheek. I wipe it away as he opens his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, god help you then,” he says simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groans and flips me over, pinning me against the bed before he plunges into me, hard and fast, deep inside of me, as far inside as he can be. He throws his head back and practically growls. I grip his back, scratching into him as I kiss his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More,” I tell him urgently. “Give me more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thrusts harder and faster, moaning into my neck, nipping at my skin. I feel his heart beating, I feel his heat, I feel the moisture from his skin. His scent surrounds me, uniquely him, and I inhale it, pulling it into me along with the rest of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More,” I say again, and he thrusts again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes are glued to mine as he thrusts. His green eyes are almost black and all the hidden things that usually linger there are gone. His intense gaze is open, and it’s all for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI limply cling to his back until finally he shudders, throwing his head back before he collapses on top of me, pulling me close. He breathes into my neck as his hands caress my back. It’s a long time before he speaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what to say,” he finally admits quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t say anything,” I answer softly. “You don’t need to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I mean it. Words aren’t necessary right now. I know what he’s afraid of. I know what he thinks he is. It’s up to me to show him that there’s nothing to fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic’s eyes fly open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We didn’t use protection,” he says shakily. “Jesus. I didn’t think about it. I haven’t had to worry about that in a long time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And don’t worry about it now,” I tell him calmly. “I’m on the pill and I haven’t had unprotected sex in a very long time. I’m healthy. You don’t need to worry about me getting pregnant. You won’t have to go through that again. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closes his eyes and I feel him relax into the bed next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ok. I’ll just worry about fucking you up with my fucked-uppedness,” he mutters as he pulls me into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry about that, either,” I tell him softly, pressing a kiss to his damp brow. “I’m fucked up enough on my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles, his eyes still closed, and I have to wonder if I should worry. Closing my eyes, I decide that I won’t. Not tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can start that shit tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, I fall asleep in the arms of the man I love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rejected me, but he came back. I stood my ground and he’s willing to try. Maybe there’s hope for us both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s sad and broken and amazing and sexy and haunted. He’s all of those things and I love him. It’s a wonderment to me and it’s the last thing I can think of as I drift into sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean up on my elbow and watch Jacey sleep. The sunlight shines across her face and it makes her look almost angelic. I smile at what would be her surprise if I told her that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at the clock, then pick up the phone to call Joe. There’s no way Jacey needs to go into work today, not after I had to wake her up every couple of hours in the night. She’s going to be exhausted. Thankfully, Joe understands and even tells me to take the day off to look after her. I hang up and look back at Jacey, and when I do, she’s staring at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning,” she says lightly, but her gaze is heavy. “So… last night was… something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, just a little, and shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If by ‘something’ you mean an earth-shattering breakthrough for me, then yeah. It was something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey smiles and reaches for me, pulling me down to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last night was intense,” she rephrases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart feels oddly numb, but beneath the numb layers it feels happy for the first time in years. I feel Jacey’s lips curve into a smile against my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do we go from here?” Jacey asks quietly, her face still buried against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” I answer honestly. “This is all new ground for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll figure it out,” she says confidently. “Don’t worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not,” I tell her. And I find that I mean it. It’s such a good fucking feeling. “I don’t know how I’m going to work through what happened, but I was able to talk about it for the first time last night. You and I are… a step in the right direction. That’s got to mean something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know it does. We’ll figure it out. And you don’t have to stay with me today,” she says with her lips against my neck. “I feel fine. I have a headache, but that’s it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, really,” I drawl, running my hands up her back, trying to lighten the situation. “You’ve been wanting me in your bed for a month, and now I’m here and you want me gone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey pulls away and looks at me, her expression serious. “I do want you in my bed,” she confirms. “But I want a lot of things. We’re going to have to talk about it, Dominic. Last night was amazing, but it’s only the beginning. I want you, Dom. And we’re going to have to talk about how much of you you’re willing to give.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her, at her wide brown eyes, her slender shoulders, her full lips. “You can have all of me,” I tell her simply. “I don’t know why you want it, but you can have it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares at me, her lip quivering, then she dives into my arms, burying her head next to my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I’ll take it,” she announces. “But it’s going to be work, Dom. It will be a process. You’re hurting inside. And you’re not going to heal overnight. You know that, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and nod. “I know. For now, I’ll be satisfied with just being with you. Is that fine with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, then hesitates. “Yes. But there’s something else. Cris said that there’s things you don’t know. I really think that in order to really start moving forward, you need to know everything there is to know. Don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes, unable to contain my disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never want to look at Cris again,” I tell her truthfully. “I’m not transferring my blame to him, trust me. I blame myself plenty. But he’s just as at fault. And he won’t admit it. I don’t want to talk to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he knows something you need to know,” Jacey points out. “And you need to heal. Please, Dom. I want to be with you. I do. But I need for you to start out with an open mind, ready to be in a relationship with me. To do that, you need to put your relationship with Emma to bed once and for all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words float in the room around us, on the sun, on the air, and I know she’s right. But that doesn’t mean I can do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I can’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI throw back the covers and stand up, pulling on my clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t,” I tell her simply. “I’m willing to try with you, but I can’t do that. Not yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk out, leaving her alone in her bedroom as I slide into my car and drive away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel empty and crushed as I drive, oddly disjointed from the situation. But I’ve always been good at that, at detaching myself when I have to. It’s what I’ve always had to do to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven’t even reached the end of the street when Jacey texts me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t throw this away, Dom. You deserve to be happy. Don’t run from me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/before-we-fall-beautifully-broken-3/page-43.html","bookId":2761,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:30 PM"}
