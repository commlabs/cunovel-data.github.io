I hastened to help her sit up so she would not choke. Holding a cloth to her mouth, I felt her body shuddering with the violence of the hacking cough. At last, she was done and slumped in my arms. Her eyes were slightly open, but I knew she did not see me. She was not truly awake, but in a twilight world. It frightened me almost as much as the blood staining the cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning over her, I wept ever harder, tears flowing down my cheeks. I whispered her name like a litany, lost in my emotions. My bloodied tears fell onto her lips and I reached for my handkerchief to wipe them away. I was so overwhelmed by grief, I did not hear the door open behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Countess Dracula?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy’s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasping, I quickly wiped at Laura’s mouth and face, erasing the traces of my tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glynis?” His voice was softer as his hands touched my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly rubbed the handkerchief over my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is coughing blood,” he said in a sorrowful tone. “Let me help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling me about, he used his own silk handkerchief to clean my face. I was confused by his lack of surprise at my blood streaked face, but then I realized he most likely believed I had been spattered by Laura’s blood as she coughed. His hands were tender and careful as he gently dabbed away the blood. I restrained myself from crying and allowed him to sit me down. Kneeling before me, he took my hands in his own. In silence, he kissed my palms then rested his forehead against them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re so cold, Glynis. You have not been taking care of yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I stay at night so her mother may sleep.” I had been so obsessed with Laura’s care, I knew I had been neglecting myself. I only fed because Adem insisted every night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising, Percy moved to Laura’s side. Taking her hand, he held it to his chest. His blue eyes were full of tears. “I only heard the news tonight when I arrived. I am grateful the snowstorm weakened long enough for me to return. I would not want Laura to leave this world without seeing her one last time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI covered my face with my hands, struggling to restrain my tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy came to me immediately and enfolded me in his arms. “Glynis, I’m so sorry! I did not mean to make you cry!” He held me as I wept piteously. I knew my face was streaked with blood, but could not contain myself. After a few long minutes, he tucked his fingers under my chin and raised my face. I tried to pull away, but he saw the blood tears staining my cheeks. Shocked, he released his grip and staggered back from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do not look at me!” I cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re ill,” he gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped my shoulder and spun me about. Seizing my arms he gazed down into my face with an expression I could not fathom. Then, to my surprise, he clutched me close to him, his fingers tangled in my hair. He held me against his chest as though he were attempting to protect me from all the ills in the world. My fingers gripped his coat as I collapsed into his embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Glynis. Darling, Glynis,” he murmured. He set his cheek upon my head and held me with a father’s gentleness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last we dried our tears. Together we returned to Laura’s beside, sitting across from each other, each taking hold of her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew you suffered a condition,” Percy said in a low voice. “The aversion to sunlight, the pale complexion, the difficulty eating...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my eyes to gaze upon him. I felt a pang of fear. Percy had been far more observant than I had realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently rubbing Laura’s fingers, he met my gaze. “You hide it well. I do not believe that anyone else even noted the symptoms of your condition. I am just an observant man. It is an asset in business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t wish to discuss my condition,” I said. “Laura’s is much direr than my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know this. But I am your friend and I shall endeavor to be your supporter through all adversity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he had alarmed me by sharing his observations, I was also comforted by his words. I would not correct him. It was best if he believed I was suffering a blood malady then suspect the truth of my nature. I had no wish to bring him under my power and tamper with his memories. It was preferable that he believe that I was ill than remove the memory of my bloodied tears. “I appreciate your friendship. I am so relieved you are here tonight. It has been difficult.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir Stephan was quite inebriated when I arrived. Maria was courteous and urged me to come up, but Sir Stephan was incoherent. In his ramblings, it seemed he was blaming your husband for Laura’s condition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head sadly, attempting to hide my frustration. “He seems quite intent to blame my husband for all the ills in his life. They do not always get along very well. I believe he thought my husband could somehow find a remedy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“During his travels?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose. Does grief ever make men sensible?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy acknowledged my point with a sigh. “True words.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just don’t understand how she could have been so healthy just a short time ago and is now so horribly ill. How can this be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maria explained that previous illnesses have compromised her health.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s pneumonia.” My voice quivered. “It’s an illness that kills young and old. Laura’s brother succumbed to it as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing his lips to Laura’s knuckles, Percy gazed at her face solemnly. “During my travels I pondered returning and asking for Laura’s hand in marriage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Percy!” I was shocked by this announcement and gaped at him in astonishment. “I never imagined you had such feelings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t,” Percy said with a sorrowful smile. “I merely thought that perhaps we could enter into a marriage of convenience for both of us. She could live her life as she saw fit and be my companion when I returned from traveling. I am often quite lonely in my flat. I thought I could buy a house for her to fill with whatever she desired. I would not expect a consummation of the marriage, of course, but merely provide a safe haven for both of us to live our lives as we saw fit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Percy, that is so kind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or perhaps selfish. Laura is a dear girl and I enjoy her friendship. I know she does not love me. She doesn’t love any man. She loves you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I love her! She is my dearest friend. But I know she does love you, Percy. Not as a lover, but as a true a noble friend. She has always said as much.” I reached across the bed to rest my fingers over his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis beautiful blue eyes regarded me with infinite sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords failed us and we lapsed into silence. We tended to Laura as she thrashed about, the fever ravaging her body. We held snow against her face and held her as she was seized with terrible coughing fits. She was never truly lucid and it was nearly impossible to have her drink her tea or take the medicine the doctor had left for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was well past midnight when Percy finally wearily rose to leave. I walked him to the door as the maids came in to change Laura’s bedding and watch over her until I returned. The house was eerily devoid of sound. I suspected Maria had fallen asleep while tending to her husband. The candles were burning low and cast grim shadows along the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shall return tomorrow as soon as I can,” Percy vowed as he donned his coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for your kindness, Percy. It means so much to all of us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapping his scarf about his neck and setting his hat upon his blond hair, he appeared lost in his thoughts. He pressed a long, firm kiss against my cheek, his warm hand pressed to my neck. “Laura is blessed to have you with her. I know you shall do all you can to bring her back from death’s door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pray for us,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, he turned, stepped out into the snow, and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the door closed behind him, I felt my barely beating heart lurch within my chest. I was certain it was breaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a heavy heart, I returned to Laura’s room to sit at her side until the hour before sunrise. Adem, my constant shadow, watched as I neared the room from where he sat on a chair near the door. I faltered in my step and leaned heavily against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Death is a part of life, Countess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To defy death is to curse her to the fate you and I share.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my hand over my tangled hair. “For all the pain I endure, there is a measure of love and comfort that I enjoy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yet, if you could choose to be what you are now, or the young woman you once were?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel his dark eyes upon me as I shook my head. “I do not know.” I opened the door and entered the room. The maids hurried out once I arrived, leaving me alone with my dearest friend gasping for breath as she lay on a mound of fresh pillows. The clean blankets covered her seizing body to her chin. Mucous and blood flecked her dry lips and I hurried to the wash basin to dampen a cloth to clean her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glynis,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked, I turned to see her eyes were open. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-52.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
