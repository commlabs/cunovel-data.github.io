Subsequently, as if she wanted to disperse Lin Dong’s terrible aura, she hastily added in, “The current Great Yan Empire cannot compare to before. Their power is likely not weaker than other super empires.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong was immediately a little stunned. When he had left back then, the Great Yan Empire was merely a tiny low rank empire. How could they now possess a power that was comparable to super empires?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Isn’t this mostly thanks to you? Even since you were forced to leave, Dao Sect would send a tremendous amount of natural treasures to the Great Yan Empire every year. Of course, most of these were given to the Lin Clan. Additionally, Dao Sect was worried that something might happen to your parents, hence they dispatched several experts to the Great Yan Empire. This was also why the Great Yan Empire was able to endure for so long in the current chaos.” Lan Ying explained.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong slightly nodded his head. His expression was complicated. Dao Sect was not unkind to him, and he knew that this was perhaps a kind of compensation from Ying Xuanzi. However, Lin Dong had never blamed Ying Xuanzi for what had happened in Unique Devil Region back then. As the sect master of an entire sect, the burdens he carried was not limited to his personal honour. He needed to be responsible for each and every one of the over ten thousand disciples of Dao Sect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHence, his actions could never be swayed by his feelings like Ying Huanhuan. Moreover, Lin Dong had witnessed how he had acted to help later on. Even though Lin Dong’s strength and status were vastly different from three years ago, he had always felt respect towards this Dao Sect master.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“There are a total of three super empires that have encircled and are attacking the Great Yan Empire. They are all subordinate to Yuan Gate, and have some prior conflicts with the Great Yan Empire. Therefore, they have taken advantage of this opportunity. However, the current Great Yan Empire is not weak and have managed to maintain a deadlock with them until recently, when the Yuan Gant dispatched some experts over. This has resulted in the Great Yan Empire being steadily pushed back in retreat, before finally being forced into critical situation of being entrenched in their capital city.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong nodded his head. Chilling anger swirled within his black pupils. He did not care if these super empires were being used. If his parents or relatives had suffered even the slightest injury, he would make them know what a price paid in blood meant.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn addition… the main cause of this disaster, Yuan Gate.
