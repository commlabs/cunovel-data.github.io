The thread binding her to an unaging corpse was weaker than since her death. Her body was a hotel, suddenly emptied by a change of season or the outbreak of international crisis. No longer a home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFierce heartburn told her feeding was a matter of urgency. Extreme urgency. Her swollen and jagged fang-teeth were broken marbles in her mouth. She was drooling, losing needed fluid. With a gulp, she swallowed spit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eye-gum cracked. It was night. She was still in Edwin\u0027s billet. In addition to her dress, a sheet had been tucked around her. The makeshift sleep-clothes smelled off. She wasn\u0027t wearing her specs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man sat on the bed. In the unlighted room, a cigar end burned like a distant sun. His silhouette was slumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Edwin,\u0027 she croaked. Her dry throat hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silhouette turned up a lamp. It was Charles, his face shockingly aged by the lamp\u0027s deep-etched shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What have you done now, Kate?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStabbing pain pierced her burning heart, as if she had been roused from lassitude by a die-hard Van Helsingite with a stake of hot iron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Edwin ...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Winthrop is a changed man. A much-changed man, though not perhaps quite as you expected.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not fair! Charles assumed too much, reached wrong conclusions. Blame was being unequally assigned. She could not make her voice work. She could not explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought we agreed you were to leave France?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate made fists and thumped her chest. She was embarrassed Charles should find her in this condition. Apart from wretched feebleness, she was unclothed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You are a sorry creature,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles stubbed his cigar out in a saucer and stood. He creaked a little like an old man, and hung his head so as not to bump the ceiling. He knelt by her, letting out a breath of exertion as his knees locked. There was an enamel basin under the bedside table. Charles found a damp flannel and applied it to her face, wiping dried trails from around her mouth and grit from her eyes. Satisfied, he took her glasses from the table, unfolded them, and eased them on to her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the room in dizzying, sharp focus. Up close, the tiny lines around Charles\u0027s eyes were crevasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thirsty,\u0027 she said, deliberately. The word was unrecognisable, even to her own ears. She was furious with herself. She must be captain of her vessel. \u0027Thirsty,\u0027 she said again, clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles half-understood and reached for a jug of water that had been beside the basin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \u0027 Thirsty.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Kate, you presume a great deal on our friendship.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t tell him what she meant. She could not explain why her red thirst was so urgent. She had lost too much blood, to Arrowsmith\u0027s Blighty cases, to Edwin ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched her throat. A spark passed between them. Charles understood. His time with Genevieve had taught him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You are close to starved. Bled white.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the lamp close to her face. She blinked as he peered at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s grey in your hair, Katie,\u0027 he said, harmlessly gloating. \u0027You look as you would if you\u0027d not turned. A shame you can never see the effect.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate had no reflection. She did not show up in photographs. Sketches made of her could have been of a stranger. In warmth, she was hardly remembered for her looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If you\u0027d lived, you\u0027d have been a fine woman,\u0027 Charles said kindly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I look like a mole, Charles. With untidy hair and freckles.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, surprised she could manage a sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You underestimate yourself. Girls thought prettier than you grew fat and bad-tempered. You\u0027d have become beautiful in your thirties. Character would have shown in your face.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nonsense.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How would you know, Kate?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027When we were all alive, you proposed to pretty Penelope and hardly noticed mole-face Kate.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld hurt wrinkled his brow. \u0027Young men make mistakes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027d such a crush on you, Charles. When you announced your engagement to Penny, I cried for days. I was driven to the arms of Frank Harris. And look what he made of me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put fingers through her stringy hair, combing away settled dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I wish I could stay angry with you for any length of time, Kate.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed his knees as he stood, and sat on the stool. She squirrelled back, hugging her sheet to her chest, propping herself against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What happened here?\u0027 he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What has happened to Edwin?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver the harbourer of secrets, he didn\u0027t want to give anything away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You first.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He took blood from me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But I took none from him.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He seemed to have some idea of assuming vampire strength without actually turning.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is that possible?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t know. Ask an elder or a scientist. Or look in your heart.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not pretend not to understand her. In his time with Genevieve, Charles had gained some of her strengths. Through love, Kate thought, or osmosis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What has ... become of him?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles was concerned for his protege. That was why he sat in vigil, waiting for her to wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He seems in good health. He has graduated from flying school. He will be the Diogenes Club\u0027s man in Condor Squadron. He has created a unique position and trained himself to fill it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But you\u0027re worried?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027As I said, he\u0027s changed. I do not say this lightly, but he frightens me. He reminds me of Caleb Croft.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pain-burst racked her chest. Ribs constricted her heart like a bone fist. Hugging herself, she fought to control her twitching limbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles took out his right cuff-link, skinned his coat sleeve up to his elbow and rolled back his shirt sleeve. She shook her head, lips tight over jutting, aching fangs. Her heart yearned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Am I too old a vintage, Miss Connoisseur? Gone to vinegar, perhaps?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Genevieve, Charles had not allowed himself to be bled. Kate knew this with certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on the floor and pulled her on to his lap. She was shocked by the warmth of him, realising how cold she was, how close to truly dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You must, Kate.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe presented his inner wrist to her. There were tiny, long- healed marks where Genevieve had suckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis came too late in their lives to be what she had once wished for, but it would mean survival. And with survival came unexpected second and third chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll take vanilla,\u0027 she said. He smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took his hand and licked his wrist with her rough, long tongue. A healing agent in her saliva would smooth his wound within the hour. Charles smiled. He was familiar with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Go ahead, pretty creature,\u0027 he said, gently. \u0027Drink.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sucked a fold of skin between her upper and lower incisors. Her fang-teeth gnashed. Blood filled her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red taste exploded. Jolts ran throughout her body, more intense than a conventional act of love. Time concertinaed: Charles\u0027s blood sparkled on her tongue and against the roof of her mouth, trickled down her dry gullet and soothed her burning heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppressing shudders of pleasure, Kate was distanced enough to measure her feeding. If she drank from Charles\u0027s neck, there would be more to it. The wrist was far enough from heart and soul and head. Only sensations came through. His mind, with its secrets, was curtained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe detached her mouth from his fresh wound and looked up at his face. His smile was tight. A pulse throbbed below his jaw, a blue finger beckoning. Her hands hooked into his coat. She might climb up him, drink from the source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer nose stung with the scent of blood. The trickle from his wrist called her. She drank, losing herself...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... she was in a reverie, blood warming her throat, stickily smeared around her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thank you, Charles,\u0027 she breathed, lapping again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked her hair gently. Her glasses skewed as she pressed her face to his wrist. He set them straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not take much from him. But he shared the strength of his spirit. She was no longer a stranger in her body. Her aches eased. She took command of her limbs. Her muscles were supple, comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snuggled against Charles as he rolled down his shirt sleeve and retrieved a cuff-link from his waistcoat pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up the lamp again and looked at her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The grey is gone. Red as rust.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood, steady on her feet, holding up her dress to preserve some measure of modesty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A pity,\u0027 Charles said. \u0027I liked you older.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flicked him in the face with her sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ll have no more of your cheek, Mr Beauregard.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re much more Irish when you\u0027re cross.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was blushing. After feeding, she was ruddy as a labourer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles tried to stand, but could not. She had forgotten he\u0027d be the weaker, temporarily, for their communion. She helped him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There now, grandfather,\u0027 she teased. \u0027You should not tire yourself so. Not at your age.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed his cheek and, modesty abandoned, wriggled into her gamey dress, settling it on her hips. There were catches up the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Could you do me up, Charles?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I doubt if anyone could, Kate.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-32.html","bookId":1619,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:29 PM"}
