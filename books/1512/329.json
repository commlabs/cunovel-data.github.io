This was the result of Xuan, WangXia and Kampa\u0027s cooperation along with Lan\u0027s psyche scan. Otherwise, the number of casualties would have doubled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is a great result. The numbers are better than expected. Looks like these troopers gone through rigorous training, although there are issues with their training. They lack actual combat experience. These surviving troopers will become the bone of the federal armed forces. They will be the only army who lived through actual combat since the third world war.\" Xuan sat on a rock and said to the others around him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The army went up the mountain. Xuan ordered the troopers to use tactical nukes on the thousands of bugs chasing after them. The tactical nukes had a range of 5km, a weapon that the federation never gave up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The environment at the top of the mountain wasn\u0027t great. The wind on this planet was strong, and its temperature over ten degrees lower than Earth. There were snow accumulated on the top. The sharp wind made them shiver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Though the federation was quite capable in areas outside the military. The troopers\u0027 uniforms contained mini portable air conditioners that could adjust temperature to one comfortable for the human body. This enabled them to continue fighting in freezing conditions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A type of black rock scattered over the mountain top and in the ground. This type of rock had similar toughness to granite. There was only one road leading up the mountain. The troopers cheered and the officers led them to sit or lie down for rests. They had been fighting for hours already. They heated up simple military ration and water. A delicious scent filled the mountain top. Those guarding by the road turned their heads around to look as they drooled. Though their past training kept them guarding the place. Xuan had told everyone that each rotation was twenty minutes with one and half hour of rests. They just needed to persevere for twenty minutes and steaming food and water was waiting for them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Take a good rest. Our priority is to raise morale. The current result is decent. These people at least have hope. Adequate food and resting will recover 80% of strength for those who aren\u0027t injured. But that\u0027s not enough. We won\u0027t last six hours with this.\" Xuan was writing on a piece of paper and explained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng asked in confusion. \"What other problem? The wind is strong here. Those hopper bugs wouldn\u0027t be able to fly up here. There\u0027s only one road and with the black rocks on the ground, this place should be safe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa and WangXia smiled bitterly. WangXia replied. \"You have learned to grasp the situation through life and death situations so your arrangements are timely and on point in combat involving small groups. However, it isn\u0027t so simple for an army. We don\u0027t have enough ammunition.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ammunition?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan raised his head. The paper was filled with numbers and formulas. He continued. \"Correct. We don\u0027t have much ammunition remaining. The ideal arrangement to guarding the road is with a thousand people. That can push back even the tanker bugs. But that\u0027s not viable. We only have forty two tactical nukes left, 13,000 magazines. Dividing them among the whole army only leaves each person with two to three magazines. So unless there aren\u0027t many bugs or they only come in few waves...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng also fell in silence. The scan showed that the bugs had surrounded the foot of the mountain and their numbers extended up to tens of kilometers away. That was only the surface. Countless bugs were moving under the ground. The total was well over millions. Aside from tanker bugs, there was a type with thick exoskeleton and two large pincers. Their numbers were less than the tanker bugs and they weren\u0027t among the list God had noted. It seemed like this type of bugs belonged to a hidden level and extremely threatening.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng smiled bitterly. \"You\u0027re right. This amount of bugs can drown us in six hours by just charging at us. Fortunately, the visibility here is low. Otherwise these troopers would lose all their confidence in staying alive.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa and WangXia sighed. Kampa suddenly said. \"Then just bring out our weapons. If I can use the EMP rifle in situation, I can kill all the bugs. Haha. The only problem is if they can block off the bugs while the gun overheats.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No!\" Zheng and Xuan both yelled. Xuan then said. \"Can\u0027t show our weapons. The other team won\u0027t attack us since a few of our members are still hidden to them. However, if our weapons are exposed to other people, the whole federation will become our enemy. Governments are the most ruthless entity in front of interests. This is a war genre movie that takes place in space. The chances of us surviving against the government is zero!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa sighed. \"So we are just going to sit around like this? How is it different than fighting outside by ourselves?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan took a look at the troopers and gave a cold smile. \"Of course there is a difference. There are so many people here dying with us. We will only get into danger after they are all dead. Back to ammunition. We should have enough to last four hours under intense fires with five hundred troopers. The next hour will require other defensive methods. The first thing we can use are the rocks. The incline is steep enough. A rock with a diameter of one to two meters can killed all the bugs on the way down. It is slightly more powerful than bullets. With several thousand people digging and pushing down rocks, we can last about an hour. However, one shortcoming is its effect against larger bugs such as the tanker bugs and the ones with pincers. That\u0027s when we use the forty two tactical nukes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng, Kampa, and WangXia was planning their role in the battle as they listened to Xuan. Zheng nodded. \"Then I will assign our roles. Kampa teach the troopers how to maximize ammunition efficiency and not fire aimlessly. WangXia go collect all the grenades. See if you can modify them. I need more powerful grenades. Their size isn\u0027t an issue. Xuan stay here and coordinate the army. I will stand by the road entrance and take care of the larger bugs. Zero stay connected with my mind. Use the sniper rifle from this army to snipe the eyes of the larger bugs. Their eyes are the most fragile. The army\u0027s sniper rifles have a rather short range and low power so you are the only one that can take this task.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lan coordinate our soul link and keep scanning, especially at the cliffs. They are steep but we should be prepared. Gando you have to protect Lan with your life. She\u0027s the most important person in this team, more so than me. If the situation gets dangerous, you have to carry her and run. If need be... Sigh. That\u0027s it. Take care of your role and defend. Six more hours left.\" \n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both;\"\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-14-chapter-9-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-14-chapter-9-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-14-chapter-9-02","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM"}
