I told her we\u0027d be right over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we arrived at Abby\u0027s, our friend was waiting outside on her porch. She was only slightly bundled up, and her breath was visible in the cool air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pumpkin is missing,\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePumpkin was Abby\u0027s five-year-old golden retriever with an orangey-rust coat and a white spot that looked like an earring on her left ear. Pumpkin was gentle and friendly and wasn\u0027t prone to running off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like Pumpkin to stay away,\" she said anxiously. \"We can\u0027t find her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe began knocking on Ivy and Abby\u0027s neighbors\u0027 doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby was distraught. She was usually strong but today she was frazzled. She loved Pumpkin as much as I loved Champ, and I knew if Champ were missing, I\u0027d be devastated, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy and I tried to console her with talk of new fashion trends, but nothing was distracting her. We knocked on every door, asking if anyone had spotted her golden retriever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few hours, exhausted, frozen, and dogless, we returned to Abby\u0027s house. We scarfed down pizza as we downloaded photos of Pumpkin on the computer and duplicated them on her dad\u0027s state-of-the-art jumbo home copier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll post these tomorrow,\" Ivy said, taking a stack with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really appreciate this,\" Abby said. \"I miss her so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know she\u0027ll come home,\" Ivy said, giving her a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet she\u0027s somewhere safe,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so,\" she said. \"She\u0027s my best friend\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;besides you two, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Ivy and I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy put the stack of pictures in the back of her car. Ivy was sweet and drove me back to my house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That dog is as good as dead, I\u0027m afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ivy!\" I said, shocked at her morbid remark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not trying to be heartless,\" she said. \"It\u0027s just with roaming wolves and a werewolf on the loose, she should have kept her locked in the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolves were bad enough preying on defenseless felines. But a werewolf? My werewolf?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following afternoon I went with Ivy, Abby, their boyfriends, and Nash to post Pumpkin\u0027s picture on every telephone pole and in every coffee shop. We hung our fliers next to ones for other dogs that had gone missing in the past few months. Any reason for Pumpkin\u0027s absence wasn\u0027t good, but to me, if Brandon was the reason\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he\u0027d be beside himself. He was devoted to animal rights and I\u0027d seen how great he was with them\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;even wild animals. I was distracted by this concern, but as I didn\u0027t want to steal the focus from Abby\u0027s circumstances, I overcompensated by being lively and chatty with my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know why you\u0027ve been so happy today,\" Ivy said, taking me aside. \"It\u0027s because of Nash. You are always so happy when you are with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to analyze her diagnosis of my emotional state. In a way, my best friend was right. I knew we all had a blast hanging out as a sixsome, and there was incredible bliss in having a boyfriend. But I\u0027d never felt such depths of feelings for Nash as I did for Brandon. And because Brandon was a Westsider\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and now a werewolf\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;there were so many difficulties to our happiness together. I knew that no matter what, I could be happier with Brandon than I could be with Nash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy dropped me off at home and I saw a strange car waiting at the end of our street. I was opening our front door when someone got out and scurried toward me. I recognized the long gray hair pouring out from under a red hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Meadows?\" I said. I hurried toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you heard?\" she said, breathless. \"He\u0027s been discovered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, everyone is spotting him. I\u0027m really worried. And it\u0027s not even the full moon. What\u0027s happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but I must see him, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am trying to convince him, but it\u0027s not easy. He\u0027s skeptical, and also really wants to keep his secret from the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but you must let me see him. It is imperative. If people are coming in contact with him\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he could be in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want him to be hurt - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I don\u0027t get to him before someone else does, there could be dire consequences. No one is safe. That\u0027s all I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t like Dr. Meadows\u0027s dramatics, but I knew her concern was real. And I feared for Brandon, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he doesn\u0027t come to me, I\u0027ll have to go to him,\" Dr. Meadows said urgently. \"I won\u0027t be able to wait for your permission any longer. I will have to find him on my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want him to be cured and safe. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do. You love him,\" she said in a soft voice. She drew my hair back from my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows was the only one who knew my true feelings toward Brandon. I was surprised to find I felt relieved with someone else holding my secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens if he kisses me,\" I asked, \"when he\u0027s a...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused with a cold, hard stare. \"You mustn\u0027t. That is all I can tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows scurried away before I could say another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I let myself into the house, Frank Sinatra was serenading me from my back pocket. I scrambled for my cell and hurried up to my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good to hear your voice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yours, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I miss you,\" Brandon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words melted my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I miss you, too. How have you been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better. I\u0027d prefer if I could see you at school\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but you can. We can,\" I insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too risky. I\u0027ve been overhearing students - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if it\u0027s not a full moon, it can\u0027t be you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if it is? I dream I\u0027m a wolf every night,\" he said, his voice filled with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only on a full moon that I\u0027ve seen you turn. I\u0027ve recorded everything in my notebook. You haven\u0027t tried to harm or scare anyone on the other nights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can\u0027t remember the other nights. So how do we really know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if it\u0027s a hoax? Someone trying to cash in on the werewolf folklore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or what if it\u0027s another werewolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another one?\" He sighed. \"I\u0027d hate for anyone else to be going through what I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want anyone to hurt you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? That\u0027s not what I\u0027m worried about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon was always concerned with others before himself. It was one of the traits that made him so alluring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you with Nash. He\u0027s been doting on you lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not dating him,\" I assured Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah... but just seeing you together. It\u0027s hard. I want us to be the ones hanging out together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" I wasn\u0027t totally sure of Brandon\u0027s wishes. I felt like he kept me at a distance, and I was afraid to stick my neck out too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I want to be with you. It\u0027s just... we have a few obstacles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I hadn\u0027t gotten lost that day - \" I lamented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean that in any way - \" he said sincerely. \"I know for some reason you blame yourself. I thought knowing Mr. Worthington\u0027s story, and getting my family\u0027s history, would make you feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if I hadn\u0027t been lost in the woods, then you wouldn\u0027t have been bitten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then I wouldn\u0027t have gotten the best brownies of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile broke free from my frown. Brandon was brave in many ways. I admired his strength, and it felt impossible for me to feel anything for him but adoration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy encounter with the Westside fortune-teller entered my mind. \"Dr. Meadows... she might be coming for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With a cure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She keeps saying she has to see you first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then that means she doesn\u0027t have one.\" He couldn\u0027t hide the disappointment in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to let you know. You might have a psychic stalker on your hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only stalker I want is you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing my best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go. It\u0027s almost sundown, but I wanted to call and let you know...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I can\u0027t stop thinking about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too. I want us to have that date in the woods again,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I jotted down as much as I could when I woke up. I wrote down that the snow sparkled like diamonds in your hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all I needed. If Brandon took the time to jot down notes about me at the same time I was recording my memories, then it confirmed to me that our connection was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got off the phone and I reveled in the fact that he was even more creative and dreamy than my overactive imagination could have imagined. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-26.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
