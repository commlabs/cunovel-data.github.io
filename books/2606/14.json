He didn\u0027t mean you in person. He looked into the eyes of his imaginary viewer, waved his arms about like an eagle flapping its wings and yelled: \u0027Minotaure! Minotaure, c\u0027est toi!! Tu es Minotaure!!!\u0027 Then he calmed down. He said you simply have to understand that the Minotaur is a projection of your mind and therefore he is nobody else but you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he say what we ought to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else?

So you can\u0027t get it off again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t frighten me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re the one who\u0027s been frightening me for the last hour. Were there any women candidates?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. There was one very attractive little heifer who looked like a psychiatrist. Her symbol was right for that, too: a bull on a chain lying on a couch. I don\u0027t remember everything she said now, but the main idea was that the only way to defeat the Minotaur is to stop thinking of yourself as a victim. Then he\u0027ll simply disappear. Everyone has his own Minotaur, she said, but in reality it\u0027s not he who pursues us, we pursue him. And the labyrinth in which we seek him is the dopamine chains of pleasure linking up into rings in the human brain\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;they\u0027re different for everyone, as unique as fingerprints. And as for which turns to make in the labyrinth, it\u0027s all very simple. Suppose you\u0027re standing at an intersection with ten identical corridors leading in different directions. Then of course your choice of which corridor to follow should not be determined by fears and superstitions, but by the promptings of simple common sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo did you make a choice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you mean? Between corridors?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not really sure what position I\u0027d be choosing the candidate for. Or what institution, or what term. Or how he\u0027d be going to lead me out of the labyrinth, when the room has no doors or windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027ll lead you out through the television. How else? You of all people should understand that. Is there anything else you remember?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched it all on fast forward, just listened to each one for about five minutes to get the general idea. As long as they\u0027re talking it all seems interesting and new. Then you wind on the cassette and you\u0027ve forgotten it all. Some American or other said that the labyrinth is the Internet. That it\u0027s inhabited by a some being that hacks into the mind, and that\u0027s the Minotaur. It\u0027s not really a bull-man, it\u0027s a spider-man. He said if there\u0027s a worldwide web, then there must be a soul-sucking spider. He also explained why the Minotaur has two names. It seems that \u0027Minotaur\u0027 is the politically correct version of the name \u0027Asterisk\u0027. So every time we want to say \u0027Asterisk\u0027, we should say \u0027Minotaur\u0027. But then \u0027Asterisk\u0027 is the politically correct version of the name \u0027Minotaur\u0027, and every time we want to say \u0027Minotaur\u0027 we should say \u0027Asterisk\u0027. And so in principle we can use both names, only not when we want to, but the other way round. There was an interesting German who said that the Minotaur is the spirit of the time, the Zeitgeist , which has manifested itself in the form of mad cow disease, hence its symbolic representation in the form of a man with a bull\u0027s head. Its counterpart in art is postmodernism, which is the mad cow disease of a culture forced to feed on its own powdered bones. And in politics it\u0027s all that stuff you see and feel when you switch on the television. Then there was an Italian, dressed in black, who announced that the Minotaur\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he said \u0027Mondotaur\u0027\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;is a being whose physical body is the gross dollar supply. It\u0027s stupid to believe that everything is controlled through money, he said\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;why through it and not by money itself? The Mondotaur is the evil spirit that reigns over the world, and compels every single one of us to wander aimlessly through the foul, stinking labyrinth of his intestines. And his two horns are ... I\u0027ve forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0027t matter, I can imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a priest with kind eyes spoke and explained that the creator of the labyrinth is also our saviour, who loves us greatly. In much the same way as we love little children, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what proposals did they all have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all came down to how many times to turn right and how many times to turn left, and in which order. Everyone wanted to do it his own way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps that\u0027s the whole point. Not to think about where the way out is, but to realise that life is the crossroads where you\u0027re standing at this precise moment. Then the labyrinth will disappear as well. After all it only exists as a complete whole in our minds, and in reality there is nothing but a simple choice\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;which way to go next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUhuh. And the Minotaur won\u0027t do anything to us, because the present \u0027us\u0027 will no longer exist when he catches up with us. One of them said that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizm(-:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now what\u0027s outside your door, Monstradamus? It\u0027s about time you told us, you\u0027re the only one left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll be disappointed, Organism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll see. So what have you got?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dead-end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA corridor a few metres long ending in a blank concrete wall with a single depressing graffito . Or at least I find it depressing. The imprint of a gigantic seal drawn in fluorescent lilac paint, like something on an official document from Hell. In the centre is the Roman numeral \u0027VII\u0027 and running out from it in a spiral is an endless string of symbols like the ones that street-gangs leave on walls. Nothing but zigzags, intricate curls, arrows and brackets\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;impossible to make out a single word. But all very suggestive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a dead-end?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s all there is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll there is?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, not quite. There\u0027s a table standing against the wall directly under the seal. And a stool by the table. And on the table there\u0027s a blank sheet of paper, a pencil and a pistol with a single bullet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about the labyrinth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think that starts afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizm(-:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruly magnificent simplicity and elegance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s nothing for you to be envious of. You\u0027ve got a dead-end too, only it\u0027s longer and it has plywood partitions. And Nutcracker\u0027s got a television instead of plywood. We\u0027ve all got dead-ends. Only it\u0027s not obvious straightaway, it just takes a little while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that\u0027s the whole point\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;whether it\u0027s obvious straightaway or not. Don\u0027t you think the \u0027little while\u0027 it takes might just be life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe so. But I\u0027m fed up of these labyrinths you can\u0027t get lost in or escape from. And all these Minotaurs with horns on their xxx who promise to lead us out to the stars in just a moment. I wonder what Theseus will see instead of all this. I\u0027d give a lot to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you care what he\u0027ll see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIMHO, Nutcracker, the possibility of escape is determined by whether you can see the way out or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already told you, for the Helmholtz that\u0027s not exactly the way it is. The Helmholtz can see anything you like. Even the plan of his own helmet. For all the good it will do him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I wonder is, has he got a head on his shoulders or a helmet of horror? Hey, Theseus!

Without the person there won\u0027t be any hat or any veil, or any lilies-of-the-valley. Nothing. Get it?
