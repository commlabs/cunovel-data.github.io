{"id":58146,"no":425,"title":"Vol 16 Chapter 7-2","content":"\u003cp\u003eCharge into Rivendell? If the elves were as weak as they were portrayed in the movie, the final Ringwraith could actually enact a massacre in Rivendell. Though the elves weren\u0027t weak either. The elves\u0027 leader who was merely a side character in the movie could Explosive shot, even if it was only with two arrows. This fact still surprised the players. The arrows the elves used were equivalent to enchanted arrows. There might be more powerful archery techniques in Rivendell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, under Aragorn\u0027s suggestion, they left Bree on the say day and headed east. The journey to Rivendell was going to be seven days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAragorn had a mount. He thought everyone in the group should have mounts but everyone other than Zheng was empty handed. He had no choice but to walk along with his horse. Bree was a little town. There weren\u0027t thirty horses theey could buy. And of course, Zheng\u0027s mount seriously shocked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAragorn yelled. \"That\u0027s a Skeleton Nightmare! You seized the Ringwraith\u0027s mount! Ha. Unfortunately, only wizards can ride them. They were created by wizards in the Second Age. The method has been long lost but Sauron obtained this method and created nine Nightmares for the Ringwraiths after he lost his physical body. Thus, the Ringwraiths were undefeatable to man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng laughed. He pulled the lead rope and the horse ran at full speed. The crimson mist and burning flame on the horse\u0027s hooves and eyes made it seem execeptionally handsome. Many in the group stared straight at it. Aragorn also exclaimed. A mount with such speed and anti-gravity was the dream of every warrior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so they advanced toward Rivendell with Zheng guarding the group on his mount. He seemed in love with his current form, holding onto the rope in one hand and a half translucent crimson blade on the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan glanced at Zheng with an expression of disdain then he looked over the other two teams\u0027 members. It felt like there was something behind his gaze. Anyone he looked over felt a chill like a prey targeted by a snake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened for three days since the Ringwraith had returned to Mordor. It would take him at least ten days run back. The group wasn\u0027t in a hurry as such without the danger. Aragorn acted like he was waiting for someone. He frequently stood on higher places and looked east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are here. So this is The Lord of the Rings\u0027s world.\" This was a handsome man with long hair. He stood on the edge of a cliff and said with a smile. Fourteen men and women stood behind him. Eleven of them looked confused. They asked the people around concerning their whereabouts but the answers were all disappointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a snowy mountain they were standing on. Cliffs surrounded them. There was seemingly no way to go. It wasn\u0027t snowing but the ground was covered in a thick layer of snow. The man standing on the edge wasn\u0027t affected by the snow as he stood on top of them instead of sinking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is troublesome. A five way team battle. Interesting, there\u0027s also team Celestial. Hoho.\" The man turned around. He maintained a smile the whole time but his eyes felt cold as ice. They were like a pair of daggers that could easily pierce your heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ZhuiKong, don\u0027t you have any advices? You are the formally acknowledged leader after our previous leader went to team Celestial.\" A beautiful girl stood with her arms akimbo. Two long swords hung by her hips. She looked like a dual wield user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuiKong laughed. He disappeared and reappeared behind the girl. A beautiful head lay on his hand. It was the girl\u0027s head. She looked shocked, in disbelief, and terrified. A second later, blood sprayed out from the headless corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember I told you to not think of yourself as anyone important to me with a sexual relationship. The burden to killing you is nothing compared to the burden of killing my friends. So you are not qualified to talk to me like this. Where did you get the courage?\" He said to the head then brought it closer and kissed it. The eleven people were completely shocked. They screamed in terror but there was nowhere to run on this cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuiKong flicked his hand. The head turned into a paste then he let it fall off the cliff. There was no blood on his hand. He turned to the other two people who were calm and said with a smile. \"Same rules for team battles. Kill all our newbies. Let\u0027s see. Negative 11 points. We have to kill eleven people to stay alive. Hoho. The game is only fun when we can test our limits and capacities like this. Isn\u0027t it? Why aren\u0027t you two talking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf one looked carefully, you could see their arms and legs trembling. They were a Caucasian man and a black young man. The Caucasain carried a spear. The black young man carried a circular weapons. After they heard ZhuiKong\u0027s words, they roared and leaped at the newbies. Ten seconds later, all the newbies died in their hands. They turned back to ZhuiKong not daring to make an extra sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuiKong smiled contentedly. He looked down the cliff. After a while, he said. \"Let\u0027s first confirm our location. Then we can find somewhere within the plot and wait there or we can head to Mordor and kill everything there. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Caucasian carefully said. \"We, we can find a human town first. If you kill all the creatures in Mordor, the other teams could complete their missions without effort. We can watch how they struggle. Isn\u0027t that more interesting than killing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watching the weak struggle and perhaps grow? That\u0027s an interesting scene. Watch the fruit slowly ripen then crush it. Okay. We will look for a human town first and find our location. I am making it clear, don\u0027t kill without a good reason on the way. Since we decided to watch a show, we have to follow our rules. Is that right?\" He raised his leg and stepped off the cliff. There was nothing on his body other than his clothes. He disappeared in the bottom of the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two veterans let out a sigh of relief and ZhuiKong was gone. They gave a bitter smile to each other. The black young man said. \"Maybe we are also the fruits he was talking about. This guy became more insane after the battle against team Devil. Is it really interesting to fight yourself then with that monster that\u0027s even stronger than you? Only monsters can understand monsters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Caucasian patted him and said. \"Shhh. Don\u0027t say anything more. We have confirmed he doesnâ€™t have psyche force attribute but it feels uncomfortable talking behind him like this. Sigh. Do our best to stay alive. Even if he kills eleven people, we are still several thousand points down. We have to kill some people from other teams to survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped talking. One person brought out two bottles. He pressed the buttons on them and threw them on the ground. The bottles turned into two gliders with parachutes. They equipped the gliders and jumped off the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few hours later, the two found themselves using their communication device. They then walked a long way in the mountain before getting out. ZhuiKong was already waiting for them in the plains. He patted their shoulders with a smile. It looked like meeting up with an old friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey knew that once ZhuiKong decided on the rules, he would absolutely follow them. They were safe for now. The black young man finally said. \"It isn\u0027t easy to get a psyche force user. You killed her too fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuiKong said. \"It\u0027s fine. God will keep replenishing certain types of members. We will see a replacement soon. Let\u0027s go look for a human town.\" He began walking at a direction. His eyes were cold as ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-16-chapter-7-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-16-chapter-8-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-16-chapter-7-02","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM"}
