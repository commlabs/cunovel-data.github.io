I was sitting by Sam\u0027s side, too tired to howl anymore, staring blankly into space, feeling his blood settle in my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the story?\"Mr. Tall asked Mr. Crepsley. \"How did the wolf-man get free?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not know, Hibernius,\"Mr. Crepsley replied. \"I have not asked and do not intend to, not for a night or two at least. Darren is in no shape for an interrogation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is the wolf-man dead?\"Mr. Tall asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"I merely knocked him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank heaven for small mercies.\"Mr. Tall sighed. He clicked his fingers and the Little People chained up the unconscious wolf-man. A van from the show pulled up and they bundled him into the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about demanding the wolf-man\u0027s death, but what good would it have been? He wasn\u0027t evil, just naturally mad. Killing him would have been pointless and cruel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they\u0027d finished with the wolf-man, the Little People\u0027s attention turned to Sam\u0027s shredded remains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\"I said, as they bent to pick him up and cart him away. \"What are they going to do with Sam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Tall coughed uncomfortably. \"I, ah, imagine they intend to dispose of him,\"he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a moment to realize what that meant. \"They\u0027re going to eat him?\"I shrieked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t just leave him here,\"Mr. Tall reasoned, \"and we don\u0027t have time to bury him. This is the easiest -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"I said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren,\"Mr. Crepsley said, \"we should not interfere with -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"I shouted, striding over to shove the Little People backward. \"If they want to eat Sam, they\u0027ll have to eat me first!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Little People stared at me wordlessly, with hungry green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they\u0027d be quite happy to accommodate you,\"Mr. Tall said drily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it,\"I growled. \"I won\u0027t let them eat Sam. He deserves a proper burial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that worms can devour him?\"Mr. Tall asked, then sighed when I glared at him, and shook his head irritably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let the boy have his way, Hibernius,\"Mr. Crepsley said quietly. \"You may return to the Cirque with the others. I will stay and help dig the grave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well.\"Mr. Tall shrugged. He whistled and pointed a finger at the Little People. They hesitated, then backed away and crowded around the owner of the Cirque Du Freak, leaving me alone with the dead Sam Grest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Tall and his assistants left. Mr. Crepsley sat down beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you?\"he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. There was no simple answer to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you feel stronger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\"I said softly. Even though it hadn\u0027t been long since I\u0027d drank Sam\u0027s blood, already I noticed a difference. My eyesight had improved and so had my hearing, and my battered body didn\u0027t hurt nearly as much as it should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will not have to drink again for a long time,\"he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care. I didn\u0027t do it for me. I did it for Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you angry with me?\"he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"I said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren,\"he said, \"I hope -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk about it!\"I snapped. \"I\u0027m cold, sore, miserable, and lonely. I want to think about Sam, not waste words on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish,\"he said, and began digging in the soil with his fingers. I dug beside him in silence for a few minutes, then paused and looked over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a real vampire\u0027s assistant now, aren\u0027t I?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded sadly. \"Yes. You are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that make you glad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"he said. \"It makes me feel ashamed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stared at him, confused, a figure appeared above us. It was the Little Person with the limp. \"If you think you\u0027re taking Sam...\"I warned him, raising a dirt-encrusted hand. Before I got any further, he jumped into the shallow hole, stuck his wide, gray-skinned fingers into the soil, and clawed up large clumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s helping us?\"I asked, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems like it,\"Mr. Crepsley said, and laid a hand on my back. \"Rest,\"he advised. \"We can dig faster by ourselves. I will call you when it is time to bury your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, crawled out, and lay down on the bank beside the quickly forming grave. After a while I shuffled out of the way and sat, waiting, in the shadows of the old railroad station. Just me and my thoughts. And Sam\u0027s dark, red blood on my lips and between my teeth. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-33.html","bookId":2438,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:08 PM"}
