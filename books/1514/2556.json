Immediately, thunder clouds came from all directions and gathered in the sky above him. After which, a rumbling sound appeared, before a tens of thousands of feet large lightning dragon came whistling forward.

Clearly, she knew about Lin Dong’s current condition. Therefore, after she spoke, a faint light rushed onto the longsword in her hand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Lin Dong saw this, he felt anxious immediately. Although he managed to hurt the Seventh Seat King, these Yimo had an extremely strong lifeforce and they were still able to fight even with such injuries. Therefore, how could Ling Qingzhu possibly fight against them head-on with her current strength?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Humph.

After which, a streak of light flashed across the horizon, before the entire place darkened immediately. In the next instant, a delicate little figure hurried over together with two other figures. Finally, they appeared beside Lin Dong. They were actually Qingtan and the two grand elders from Darkness Palace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Qingtan?!” Lin Dong was startled when he saw these sudden reinforcements.

Then, she quickly said, “We searched the area within a five hundred kilometres radius of the Darkness City, but we could not find you. Fortunately, an energy fluctuation was transmitted from this place previously and we came over immediately.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong shook his head. Then, he lifted his head and looked at the sky. Now that Qingtan and the rest have arrived, there was no longer a need for him to be overly fearful of the Seventh Seat King.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eStanding in the sky, amidst the churning demonic sea, the Seventh Seat King and the five other Yimo stopped. Then, they looked at Qingtan’s group, which had hurried over, before their expressions darkened. Initially, they thought that they would be able to kill Lin Dong easily. However, reality did not play out according to their expectations. Not only were they unable to kill the latter, but the Seventh Seat King was also severely wounded by the latter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Seventh Seat King, what should we do?” The five Yimo kings looked at the Seventh Seat King before they softly asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith a brutal glint glimmering within his eyes, the Seventh Seat King held his chest before a pale expression flashed across his face.

Immediately, everyone present was startled. Then, they hurriedly lifted their heads and looked afar. At the edge of their sight, it was possible to see the darkened sky suddenly turning bright. Meanwhile, a world of thunder began to spread at a frightening rate. In the middle of that Thunder World, stood a tall and muscular figure. He was stepping on a thunderbolt as he streaked across the sky.
