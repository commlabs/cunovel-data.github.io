Julian is no longer next to me. The rain is pouring through the grates, long, twisting gray ribbons of it, and he is standing underneath them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis back is turned to me, and he has stripped down to a pair of faded cotton shorts he must have found when we scavenged for clothing and supplies. My breath catches in my throat. I know I should look away, but I can’t. I’m transfixed by the sight of the rain coursing over his back—broad and muscled and strong, just like Alex’s was—the rolling landscapes of his arms and shoulders; his hair, now dark with water; the way he tips his head back and lets the rain run into his open mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Wilds, I finally got used to seeing men naked or half-naked. I got used to the strangeness of their bodies, the bits of curling hair on their chests, and sometimes on their backs and shoulders, to the broad, flat panes of their stomachs and wings of their hipbones, arcing over the waistband of their pants. But this is different. There is a perfect stillness to him, and in the pallid gray light he seems to glow slightly, like a statue carved out of white rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head a bit and water pinwheels from his hair, a glittering semicircle: Happy and unaware, he starts to hum quietly. All of a sudden I am horribly embarrassed: I’m trespassing on a private moment. I clear my throat loudly. He whips around. When he sees me awake, he jumps out of the stream of water and scoops his clothes up off the platform lip, covering himself with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t know you were awake,” he says, fighting to get his T-shirt on, even though he’s soaking wet. He accidentally gets his head caught in an armhole and has to try again. I would laugh if he didn’t look so desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that he has cleaned away the blood, I can see his face clearly. His eyes are no longer swollen, but they are ringed with deep purple bruises. The cuts on his lip and forehead are scabbing over. That’s a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just woke up,” I say as he finally gets his shirt on. “Did you sleep at all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he’s wrestling with his jeans. His hair makes a pattern of water spots around the neck of his T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little,” he says guiltily. “I didn’t mean to. I must have dropped off around five. It was already getting light.” His jeans are on. He hauls himself up onto the platform, surprisingly graceful. “Ready to move on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a bit,” I say. “I’d like—I’d like to get clean, like you did. Under the grates.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” Julian nods, but doesn’t move. I can feel myself blushing again. It has been a long time since I’ve felt this way, so open and exposed. I’m losing the thread of the new Lena, the hard one, the warrior made in the Wilds. I can’t seem to pull myself back into her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll need to get undressed,” I blurt out, since Julian doesn’t seem to be taking the hint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh—oh, right,” he stammers, backing away. “Of course. I’ll just—I’ll go scout ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be quick,” I say. “We should get moving again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait until Julian’s footsteps are a faint echo in the cavernous space before stepping out of my clothes. For a minute it’s possible to forget that the Scavengers are somewhere out there in the dark, looking for us. For a minute it’s possible to forget what I’ve done—what I’ve had to do—to escape, to forget the pattern of blood seeping across the storeroom floor, the Scavenger’s eyes, surprised, accusatory. I stand naked on the lip of the platform, reaching my arms up toward the sky, as ribbons of water continue twisting through the grates: liquid gray, as though the sky has begun to melt. The cold air raises goose bumps on my skin. I lower myself to a crouch and ease myself off the platform, splashing into the tracks, feeling the bite of metal and wood on my bare feet. I slosh my way over to the grates. Then I tip my head back so the rain hits me square in the face and courses down my hair, my back, my aching shoulders and chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have never felt anything so amazing in my life. I want to cry out for joy, or sing. The water is icy cold, and smells fresh, as though it has carried some of the scents of its spiraling journey past stripped branches and tiny, new March buds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I’ve let the water drive over my face and pool in my eyes and mouth, I lean forward and feel it beat a rhythm on my back, like the drumming of a thousand tiny feet. I haven’t realized until right now how sore I am all over: Everything hurts. My legs and arms are covered with dark bruises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I’m as clean as I’m going to get, but I can’t bring myself to move out of the stream of water, even though the cold makes me shiver. It’s a good cold, purifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I wade back to the platform. It takes me two tries to heave myself up off the tracks—that’s how weak I am—and I’m dripping water everywhere, leaving a person-sized splatter pattern on the dark concrete. I wrap the long coil of my hair around one hand and squeeze, and even this brings me joy; the normalcy of the action, routine and familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step into the jeans I took from the Scavengers, rolling them once at the waist to keep them from falling off; even so, they hang loose from my hipbones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen: footsteps behind me. I whip around, covering my breasts with my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian steps out of the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping one arm wrapped around my chest, I grab for my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” he calls out, and something about the tone of his voice—a note of command, and also of urgency—stops me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” he repeats, more softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re separated by twenty feet of space, but the way he’s looking at me makes me feel as though we’re chest to chest. I can feel his eyes on my skin like a prickling touch. I know I should put on my shirt, but I can’t move. I can hardly even breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never been able to look before,” Julian says simply, and takes one more step toward me. The light falls differently across his face, and now I can see a softness in his eyes, a blur, and it makes the roaring heat in my body melt away into warmth, a steady, wonderful feeling. At the same time, a tiny voice in the back of my head pipes up: Danger, danger, danger. Beneath it, a fainter echo: Alex, Alex, Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex used to look at me like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your waist is so small.” That’s all Julian says: in a voice so quiet I barely hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force myself to turn away from him. My hands are shaking as I wrestle the sports bra, and then my shirt, over my head. When I turn around again, I feel afraid of him for some reason. He has come even closer. He smells like rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw me topless, exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me like I was beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Feeling better?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I say, dropping my eyes. I finger the cut along my neck carefully. It is about a half-inch long, and clotted with dried blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me see.” Julian reaches out and then hesitates, his fingers an inch from my face. I look up at him. He seems to be asking permission. I nod, and he slips his hand, gently, under my chin, tipping it up so he can look at my neck. “We should bandage it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe. We are on the same side now. He is refusing to say anything more about the fact that I lied to him, and the fact that I’m uncured. I wonder how long it will last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian moves over to the backpack. He rummages for the first-aid materials we stole, and returns to me with a large bandage, a bottle of peroxide, some antibacterial ointment, and several cotton puffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can do it,” I say, but Julian shakes his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me,” he says. First he dips the cotton balls in the peroxide and dabs the cut carefully. It stings and I jerk back, yelping. He raises his eyebrows. “Come on,” he says, hitching his mouth into a smile. “It doesn’t hurt that badly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It does,” I insist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yesterday you went head-to-head with two homicidal maniacs. Now you can’t take a little burn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s different,” I say, glaring at him. I can tell he’s making fun of me, and I don’t like it. “That was a question of survival.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian raises his eyebrows but doesn’t say anything. He blots my cut one more time with the cotton ball, and this time I grit my teeth and bear it. Then he squeezes a thin line of ointment onto the bandage and affixes it carefully to my neck. Alex fixed me once, just like this. It was on raid night, and we were hiding in a tiny tool shed, and a dog had just taken a chunk out of my leg. I haven’t thought about that night in a long time, and as Julian’s hands skate over my skin, I feel suddenly breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if this is how people always get close: They heal each other’s wounds; they repair the broken skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There. As good as new.” His eyes have taken on the gray of the sky above the grates. “You okay to move on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, even though I’m still weak, and pretty dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian reaches out and squeezes my shoulder. I wonder what he thinks when he touches me, whether he feels the electric pulse that runs through my body. He is unused to having contact with girls, but he doesn’t seem bothered by it. He has crossed a boundary. I wonder what he’ll do when we finally get out of here. He’ll no doubt go back to his old life—to his father, to the DFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he’ll have me arrested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a surge of nausea and close my eyes, swaying a little on my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure you’re okay to move?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian’s voice is so gentle, it makes my chest break up into a thousand fluttering pieces. This was not part of the plan. This was not supposed to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about what I told him last night: You’re not supposed to know. The hard, unbearable, beautiful truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Julian”—I open my eyes, wishing my voice sounded less shaky—“we’re not the same. We’re on different sides. You know that, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes get a little harder, more intense: even in the half-light, a blazing blue. But when he speaks, his voice is still soft and quiet. “I don’t know what side I’m on anymore,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes another step toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Julian—” I can barely squeeze out his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when we hear it: a muffled shout from one of the tunnels, the sound of drumming feet. Julian stiffens and in that second, when we look at each other, there’s no need to speak at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Scavengers are here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terror is a sudden jolt. The voices are coming from one of the tunnels we came through last night. Julian scoops up the backpack, and I stuff my feet quickly into my sneakers, not even bothering with socks. I grab the knife from the ground; Julian reaches for my other hand and pulls me forward, past the wooden crates and to the far end of the platform. Even fifty feet away from the grates, it’s almost impossible to see. We are swallowed again in murk and darkness. It feels like stepping into a mouth, and I try to beat back the feeling of terror winging through me. I know I should be grateful for the darkness and all the chances to hide, but I can’t help thinking of what the darkness could be hiding: stealthy, silent steppers; bodies swinging from the pipes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pandemonium-delirium-2/page-30.html","bookId":1717,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:21 AM"}
