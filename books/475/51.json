C. G. Moule.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe may have as much of God as we will. Christ puts the key of the treasure-chamber into our hand, and bids us take all that we want. If a man is admitted into the bullion vault of a bank, and told to help himself, and comes out with one cent, whose fault is it that he is poor? Whose fault is it that Christian people generally have such scanty portions of the free riches of God? ━McLaren\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e二月二十日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“你们没有一件不能作的事了“ （太十七：20）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　有了信心，我们就没有一件不能的事了。只要我们真相信神有保守和得胜的能力，我们就能看见祂所说的话语和应许，都是实在的。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　我们能天天把我们一切的罣虑和重担卸给神，享受平安和喜乐。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　我们能管辖头脑中的思想，昼夜系念神的话语。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　我们能在每一件事情上清楚神的旨意；不是用叹息，乃是用赞美去接受。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　我们能靠神的恩典刚强；我们以前的软弱，以前叫我们不能忍耐，圣洁与谦卑的罪，今天都能靠着爱我们的主胜过了，使罪完全失去它在我们身上的权势。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　这些都是神恩典中可能的事，如果我们有了这些经历，就会更愿意俯伏在神脚前，也就会更渴慕最高的灵命。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　我们如果不能每天，每小时，每分钟，在基督里，藉着圣灵的能力与神同行，我们就不会得到满足。━慕\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　在基督里，我们能有神一切的丰富。主已经把神宝库的钥匙放在我们手中了，祂吩咐我们去无限制地领取一切我们所要的。若是一个银行的行长，准许一个穷人到银行库中去任意取他所要的；假定那个穷人出来的时侯，只带了一文钱，这是谁的过失呢？基督徒能得到神完全的丰富，而仍过着极穷的生活，这是谁的过失呢？━马克拉伦\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4866.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:39:19 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:39:19 AM"}
