They understand that they\u0027ve chosen a career where the divorce and burnout rates are high, the demands many, and the emotional toll extreme. Phone calls spoil dinner parties, sex, and sleep. It\u0027s part of the job description.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the phone rang, Tess reached over automatically. And picked up a candlestick. On the other side of the bed Ben swore, knocked over an ashtray, and found the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Paris.\" In the dark he ran a hand over his face as if to wipe away sleep. \"Where?\" Instantly awake, he switched on the lamp. The cat curled on Tess\u0027s stomach growled a complaint then leaped aside as she braced herself on her elbows. \"Keep him there. I\u0027m on my way.\" Ben hung up the phone and stared at the light sheen of frost on the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t wait, did he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light fell harshly over his face as he turned to look at her. She gave a quick, involuntary shudder. His eyes were hard-not weary, not regretful, but hard. \"No, he didn\u0027t wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they have him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but it looks like we\u0027ve got a witness.\" As he rolled out of bed he grabbed his jeans. \"I don\u0027t know how long I\u0027ll be but you can wait here, get some more sleep. I\u0027ll fill you in when... What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood on the opposite side of the bed, dragging on her sweater. \"Going with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it.\" His legs disappeared into the jeans, but he left the pants unsnapped as he pulled open a drawer for a sweater. \"There\u0027s nothing you can do at a murder scene but get in the way.\" In the mirror above his dresser he saw her head snap up. \"Its still shy of five, for Christ\u0027s sake. Go back to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, I\u0027m involved in this case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned. She wore only the sweater that skimmed her thighs. He remembered the material had been thick and soft when he\u0027d drawn it off of her. Her slacks were balled in her hands and her hair was rumpled from the pillow, but it was the psychiatrist facing him, not the woman. Something inside of him curdled. He yanked his own sweater on, then walked to the closet for his shoulder holster. \"This is a homicide. It\u0027s not like going to look at somebody\u0027s who\u0027s been painted up nice to lie in a casket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you are.\" He checked his gun, then hitched the holster on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, it\u0027s possible I could see something, some detail that would give me a clue to his mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck his mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaying nothing, she shook out her slacks, stepped into them, then fastened them in place. \"I understand how you feel, and I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" He sat down to pull on his boots but continued to watch her. \"You think you know how I feel? Well, let me tell you anyway. There\u0027s a dead woman a few miles from here. Somebody put a scarf around her neck and pulled until she couldn\u0027t breathe anymore. She\u0027d have kicked and pulled at the scarf with her hands and tried to scream, but she wouldn\u0027t have been able to. So she\u0027s dead, but she\u0027s not a name on a list yet. She\u0027s still a person. For a little while longer she\u0027s still a person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have reached out to him if she\u0027d thought there was a chance he\u0027d accept it. Instead she fastened her belt and kept her voice neutral. \"Don\u0027t you think I understand that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey studied each other a moment longer, each dedicated, each frustrated, each coming from different backgrounds and beliefs. It was Tess who accepted it first. \"I either go with you now or I call the mayor and end up five minutes behind you. Sooner or later you\u0027ve got to start working with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d just spent the night with her. He\u0027d poured himself into her three times during the night. He\u0027d felt her body rock and buck and shudder. Now they were talking murder and politics. The femininity, the softness, even the shyness he\u0027d taken to bed were still there, but beneath was a core of toughness, a self-possession he\u0027d recognized from the first. Studying her, he saw she would go no matter what he said, what he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. You go with me and get an up-close look. Maybe after you see her, you\u0027ll stop letting your heart bleed for the man who did her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bent for her shoes. The bed was between them, but it was as if they\u0027d never shared it. \"I suppose it\u0027s no use reminding you I\u0027m on your side.\" He was reaching for his wallet and shield, and said nothing. Tess saw her earrings on his nightstand, a little thing of great intimacy. She scooped them up and dropped them in her pocket. \"Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An alley near Twenty-third and M.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-third and M? That\u0027s only a couple of blocks from my place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t bother to look at her. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streets were deserted. The bars would have closed at one. Most private parties would have waned by three. Washington was a political town, and though its night spots ranged from the elite to the sleazy, it didn\u0027t have the energy of a New York or Chicago. Drug deals around Fourteenth and U were a life-style away. Even the hookers would have called it a night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow and then the leaves that had fallen rushed along the sidewalk then stopped, victims of the sporadic wind. They drove past blank storefronts and boutiques with neon sweaters in the windows. Ben lit a cigarette and let the familiar taste of Virginia tobacco ease some of the tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t want her there. Doctor or no doctor, he didn\u0027t want her to be a part of the hopeless ugliness of this part of his job. She could share in the paperwork, the fitting together of the puzzle, the step-by-step logic of an investigation, but she shouldn\u0027t be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to be here, Tess thought. It was time to face the results, and maybe, just maybe, get a better understanding of the motivation. She was a doctor. It was irrelevant that she wasn\u0027t the kind of doctor who prodded fingers in the human body. She was trained, she was capable, and she understood death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess saw the blue and red lights of the first police car and began to school her breathing to long inhales, slow exhales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alley and several feet on all sides were roped off, though there was no one on the predawn streets. Cruisers sat with their lights blinking and their radios on. A community of workers was already inside the official area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen pulled up to the curb. \"You stay with me,\" he told Tess, but still didn\u0027t look at her. \"We have a policy against civilians wandering around homicide scenes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t intend to get in your way. I intend to do my job. You\u0027ll find I\u0027m as good at it as you are at yours.\" She pushed open her door and nearly collided with Ed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, Dr. Court.\" Her hands were icy. He patted them without thinking. \"You\u0027re going to want your gloves.\" He stuck his own in his pockets as he looked at Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have we got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lab boys are in there now. Sly\u0027s getting pictures. Coroner\u0027s en route.\" His breath came out in a white puffy steam. The tips of his ears were already red from the cold, but he\u0027d forgotten to button his coat. \"Some kid stumbled across her about four-thirty. Uniforms haven\u0027t got much out of him yet. He\u0027s been pretty busy whooshing up about a half case of beer.\" He glanced at Tess again. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t apologize,\" Ben said briefly. \"She\u0027ll remind you she\u0027s a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain\u0027s coming in on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terrific.\" Ben shot the butt of his cigarette into the street. \"Let\u0027s get to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started toward the alley, passed a cruiser where someone sat in the backseat sobbing. Tess glanced over, pulled toward the sound of despair. Then her arm brushed Ben\u0027s and she continued toward the alley. A small man with horn-rimmed glasses and a camera stepped out. He took out a blue bandanna and rubbed it over his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all yours. Get him, for Christ\u0027s sake. I don\u0027t want to photograph any more dead blondes. A man\u0027s got to have a little variety in his work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a riot, Sly.\" Ben brushed by him, leaving the photographer sneezing into the bandanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d taken only a few steps into the alley when the scent of death rose up. They all recognized it, that bitter, fetid stench which was both offensive and eerily compelling to the living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body had emptied itself. Her blood had settled. Her arms had been folded neatly across her body, but she didn\u0027t look at peace. Sightless, her eyes were locked open. There was a smear of dried blood on her chin. Her own, Tess thought. Sometime during the struggle to live, she had sawed her teeth through her bottom lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d worn a long, serviceable wool coat in olive drab. The white silk amice stood out starkly against it. It had been taken from around her neck, where bruises had already formed, and smoothed over her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe note was pinned there, the message the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sins are forgiven her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this time the letters weren\u0027t printed neatly. They were wavery, and the paper was crumpled a bit, as though his hands had mashed it. The word sins was printed larger than the rest, the markings darker, almost going through the paper. Tess crouched down beside the body for a closer look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cry for help? she wondered. Was it a plea for someone to stop him from sinning again? The shaky handwriting was a deviation, however slight, from his routine. It meant, to Tess, that he was losing his hold, perhaps doubting himself even as he fulfilled his mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t been so sure this time, she decided. His mind was becoming a logjam of thoughts, memories, and voices. He must be terrified, she thought, and almost certainly physically ill by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer coat had been left open rather than neatly arranged. There wasn\u0027t enough of a breeze in the alley to have flapped it open. So he hadn\u0027t tidied it as he had the clothing of the others. Perhaps he hadn\u0027t been able to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she saw the lapel pin against the green wool, a gold heart with the name Anne scrolled inside. She had been Anne. A wave of pity washed over her, for Anne, and for the man who had been driven to kill her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen saw the way she studied the body, clinically, dispassionately, without revulsion. He\u0027d wanted to shield her from the reality of death, but also wanted to press her face into it until she\u0027d wept and ran the other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027ve gotten yourself a good look, Dr. Court, why don\u0027t you back off and let us do our job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at Ben, then rose slowly to her feet. \"He\u0027s nearly finished. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s going to be able to take much more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell that to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kid puked all over the place,\" Ed said lightly, and breathed through his mouth to try to combat the stench. With a pencil he flipped open the woman\u0027s wallet, which had spilled out of her purse. \"Anne Reasoner,\" he said, reading her driver\u0027s license. \"Twenty-seven. Lives about a block up on M.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA block up, Tess thought. A block closer to her own apartment. She pressed her lips together and looked out of the alley until the fear passed. \"It\u0027s a ritual,\" she said clearly enough. \"From everything I\u0027ve read, ritual, rites, traditions, are an intricate part of the Catholic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChurch. He\u0027s performing his own ritual here, saving them then absolving them and leaving them with this.\" She indicated the amice. \"The symbol of that salvation and absolution. He folds the amice exactly the same way each time. He positions their bodies exactly the same way. But this time he didn\u0027t tidy her clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Playing detective?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess balled her hands in her pockets, fighting to overlook Ben\u0027s sarcasm. \"This is devotion, blind devotion to the Church, obsession with ritual. But the handwriting shows that he\u0027s beginning to question what he\u0027s doing, what he\u0027s driven to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine.\" Unreasonable anger rushed into him at her lack of emotional response. Ben turned his back to her and bent over the body. \"Why don\u0027t you go out to the car and write that up? We\u0027ll be sure to pass on your professional opinion to her family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t see her face, the quick hurt then the slow anger that came into her eyes. But he heard her walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Little rough on her, weren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen didn\u0027t look at his partner either, but at the woman who had been Anne. She stared back at him. Serve and protect. No one had protected Anne Reasoner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t belong here,\" he murmured, and thought as much of Anne Reasoner as of Tess. He shook his head, still studying the almost saintlike pose of the body. \"What was she doing in an alley in the middle of the night?\" An alley that was close, too damn close, to Tess\u0027s apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she wasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing his brows together, Ben lifted up one of her feet. She\u0027d worn loafers. The kind that last through college, your first marriage and divorce. The leather fit her feet like gloves and was well polished. The back of the heel was freshly scraped and scarred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he killed her on the street and dragged her in.\" Ben looked over at Ed as his partner crouched and examined the other shoe. \"He strangled her out on the fucking street. We got streetlights about every ten goddamn feet in this neighborhood. We got black and whites cruising every thirty minutes, and he kills her on the street.\" He looked at her hands. Her nails were medium length and well shaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly three of them were broken. The coral-colored polish was un-chipped. \"Doesn\u0027t look like she put up much of a fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light was turning gray, awashed-out, milky gray that promised overcast skies and cold autumn rain. Dawn floated over the city without any beauty. Sunday morning. People were sleeping in. Hangovers were brewing. The first church services would begin soon with raw-eyed, weekend-dazed congregations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess leaned against the hood of Ben\u0027s car. The suede jacket wasn\u0027t warm enough in the chilled dawn, but she was too restless to get inside the car. She watched a round man with a medical bag and blue-paisley pajama bottoms under a flapping overcoat go into the alley. The coroner\u0027s day had started early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom somewhere blocks away came the grinding metallic sound of a truck changing gears. A single cab rode by without slowing down. One of the uniformed cops brought a big Styrofoam cup with steam and the scent of coffee rising off the top, and handed it to the figure in back of the cruiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess looked toward the alley again. She\u0027d held up, she told herself, though her stomach was roiling now in reaction. She\u0027d been professional, as she\u0027d promised herself she would be. But she wouldn\u0027t forget Anne Reasoner for a long time. Death wasn\u0027t a neatly printed statistic when you looked it in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have kicked and pulled at the scarf with her hands and tried to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess took a long gulp of air that hurt her throat, raw from swallowing nausea. She was a doctor. She repeated it over and over until the cramp in her stomach eased. She\u0027d been trained to deal with death. And she had dealt with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning away from the alley, she faced the empty street. Who was she trying to fool? She dealt with despair, with phobias, neuroses, even violence, but she\u0027d never been face-to-face with the victim of a murder. Her life was ordered, protected because she\u0027d made certain of it. Pastel walls and questions and answers. Even her hours at the clinic were tame compared to the day-to-day violence on the streets of the city where she lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew about ugliness, violence, and perversion, but she\u0027d always been neatly separated from all of it by her own background. The senator\u0027s granddaughter, the bright young student, the cool-headed doctor. She had her degree, her successful practice, and three published papers. She\u0027d treated the helpless, the hopeless, and the pitiful, but she\u0027d never knelt down beside murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Court?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back and saw Ed. Instinctively she looked past him and spotted Ben talking to the coroner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wrangled you some coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" She took the cup and sipped slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want a bagel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She laid a hand on her stomach. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did okay in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coffee settled and seemed content to stay down. Looking over the cup, she met his eyes. He understood, she realized, and neither condemned nor pitied. \"I hope I never have to do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black plastic bag was carried out of the alley. Tess found herself able to watch as it was loaded into the morgue van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It never gets any easier,\" Ed murmured. \"I used to wish it would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I figure if it gets easier, it means you\u0027ve lost the edge that makes you want to find out why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. Common sense and common compassion in his quiet voice were soothing. \"How long have you and Ben been partners?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five, almost six years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You suit each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a low, humorless laugh. \"There\u0027s a difference between attraction and suitability.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. There\u0027s also a difference between stubbornness and stupidity.\" His look remained bland as her head came around. \"Anyway, Dr. Court,\" he went on before she had a chance to react. \"I was hoping you might talk to the witness for a couple of minutes. He\u0027s pretty shook up, and we\u0027re not getting anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" She nodded at the cruiser. \"That\u0027s him in the car, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Name\u0027s Gil Norton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess walked to the car and crouched at the open door. He was hardly more than a boy, she thought. Twenty, maybe twenty-two. While he shivered and gulped coffee, his face was pale, with a high flush of color over the cheekbones. His eyes were puffed and red from weeping, and his teeth clattered. He\u0027d put dents with his thumbs in the sides of the Styrofoam cup. He smelt of beer and vomit and terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a jolt, he turned his head. She hadn\u0027t any doubt he was stone sober now, but she could see a bit too much white around his irises. His pupils were dilated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Dr. Court. How are you feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go home. I\u0027ve been sick. My stomach hurts.\" There was a trace of the whining self-pity of a drunk who\u0027d had cold water dumped in his face. Under it was plain fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finding her must have been pretty dreadful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\" His mouth contracted into a thin white line. \"I want to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call someone for you if you like. Your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears began to squeeze out of his eyes again. His hands trembled until the coffee sloshed in his cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gil, why don\u0027t you step out of the car? You might feel better if you stood up in the fresh air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want a cigarette. I smoked all of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get some.\" She held out a hand. After a moment\u0027s hesitation, he took it. His fingers closed over hers like a vice. \"I don\u0027t want to talk to the cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have a lawyer. Shouldn\u0027t I have a lawyer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you can if you like, but you\u0027re not in trouble, Gil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Here, let me take that for you.\" Gently she took the half-empty cup before he could spill the remaining coffee over his pants. \"Gil, we need you to tell us whatever you know so we can find out who killed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around and saw the blue uniforms and impassive faces. \"They\u0027re going to dump it on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She spoke calmly, having anticipated him. Keeping close to his side, she began to lead him toward Ben. \"They don\u0027t think you killed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a record.\" He said it in a shaky whisper. \"Drug bust last year. Just petty shit, a little grass, but the cops\u0027ll figure I got a record, I found her, I killed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s natural to be scared. That\u0027s not going to go away until you talk about what happened. Try to be logical, Gil. Has anyone arrested you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has anyone asked you if you killed that woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I was there.\" He focused on the alley with blank, fascinated horror. \"And she was...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what you need to get out. Gil, this is Detective Paris.\" She stopped in front of Ben but kept her hand on Gil\u0027s arm. \"He\u0027s with Homicide, and too smart to think you killed anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the words the message was clear. Go easy. Ben\u0027s resentment communicated itself just as lucidly. He didn\u0027t have to be told how to handle a witness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, Gil could use a cigarette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" Ben reached for his pack and shook one out. \"Rough morning,\" he commented as he struck a match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGil\u0027s hands still shook, but he drew greedily on the cigarette. \"Yeah.\" His eyes darted over and up as Ed approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Detective Jackson,\" Tess continued in a soothing, introductory voice. \"They need you to tell them what you saw.\";\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will I have to go in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll need you to sign a statement.\" Ben shook out a cigarette of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, I just want to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get you home.\" Ben looked at Tess through the haze of his smoke. \"Just take it easy and tell it from the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was at a party.\" He stopped dead and looked at Tess. She gave him an encouraging nod. \"You can check, it was over on Twenty-sixth. Some friends of mine just got the apartment, see, and it was like a moving-in party. I can give you names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine.\" Ed had his notebook out. \"We\u0027ll get them from you later. When did you leave the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I had too much to drink and got into it with my girl. She doesn\u0027t like it when I party too hard. We had words, you know.\" He swallowed, drew in smoke again, then let it out on a shuddering breath. \"She got pissed and left, that was about one-thirty. Took the car, so I couldn\u0027t drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like she was looking out for you,\" Ed put in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, I was too wasted to see it that way.\" The rumblings of a heroic hangover were already beginning. Gil preferred it to the nausea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened after she left?\" Ed prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hung around. I think I crashed for a while. The party was winding down when I woke up. Lee-it was his apartment, Lee Grimes-he says I can sleep on the couch, but I... well, I needed air, you know? I was going to walk home. I guess I was already feeling pretty sick, so I stopped, just across the street there.\" He turned and pointed. \"My head was spinning, and I knew I was going to toss up some beer. I just rested there a minute and got it under control. And I see this guy come out of the alley-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw him come out,\" Ben interrupted. \"You didn\u0027t hear anything? See him go in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I swear. I don\u0027t know how long I\u0027d been standing there. Not too long, I think, \u0027cause it was cold as hell. Even drunk I was thinking I had to move to keep warm. I saw him come out, then he leaned up against the lamppost for a minute, like he was sick too. I thought it was kind of funny, two drunks weaving across the street from each other, like something out of a cartoon. And one of the drunks is a priest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\" Ben paused in the act of offering Gil another cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s wearing this priest\u0027s suit-the black dress with the white collar. I was laughing to myself. You know, looks like he\u0027s been hitting the communion wine. Anyway, I\u0027m standing there wondering if I\u0027m going to piss in my pants or barf, and he straightens himself up and walks away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toward M. Yeah, toward M Street. He went around the corner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see what he looked like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, I saw he was a priest.\" Gil pounced on the fresh cigarette. \"He was white.\" He pressed his fingers to his eyes. \"Yeah, he was a white dude. I think he had dark hair. Look, I was wasted, and he was standing with his face against the lamppost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. You\u0027re doing good.\" Ed flipped a page in his notebook. \"How about build? Could you tell if he was short, tall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGil screwed his face up in concentration. Though he still consumed the cigarette in great gulps, Tess saw he was calming. \"I guess he was pretty tall, not a little guy anyhow. He wasn\u0027t fat. Shit, it\u0027s like average, you know. About like you, I guess,\" he said to Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about age?\" Ben put in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. He wasn\u0027t old and feeble. His hair was dark.\" He said it quickly as it flashed into his memory. \"Yeah, I\u0027m sure it was dark, not gray or blond. He had his hands in it like this.\" He demonstrated, pressing his hands against the side of his head. \"Like his head was hurting him pretty bad. His hands were black, but his face was white. Like he had gloves on, you know. It was cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped again as the full implication hit him. He\u0027d seen a murderer. Fear doubled back, a personal thing. If he\u0027d seen, he was involved. The muscles in his face began to tremble. \"He\u0027s the one who\u0027s been doing all these women. He\u0027s the one. He\u0027s a priest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s finish this up,\" Ben said easily. \"How\u0027d you find the body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Christ.\" He closed his eyes, and Tess moved toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gil, try to remember it\u0027s over. What you\u0027re feeling is going to fade. It\u0027ll start to fade a little bit after you say it all out loud. Once you say it out loud, it\u0027ll be easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" He reached for her hand and held on. \"After the guy left I was feeling a little better, like maybe I was going to keep everything down after all. But I\u0027d had a lot of beer and I had to get rid of some, you know. I still had myself together enough to know I couldn\u0027t just piss all over the sidewalk. So I walked over to the alley. I almost tripped over her.\" He ran the back of his hand under his nose as it started to leak. \"I had my hand in my pants and I almost tripped over her. Jesus. There was enough light coming in from the street so that I saw her face, real good. I never saw anyone dead before. Not ever. It\u0027s not like the movies, man. It ain\u0027t nothing like the movies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a minute, sucking on the cigarette and crushing Tess\u0027s fingers. \"I gagged. I took a couple of steps trying to get out, and I just started throwing up. I thought my sides would bust before I stopped. My head was going around again, but I got out somehow. I think I fell down on the sidewalk. There were cops. A couple of them stopped their car. I told them... I just told them to go in the alley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did good, Gil.\" Ben took his pack of cigarettes and stuffed it the boy\u0027s pocket. \"We\u0027re going to have one of the officers take you home, let you get cleaned up and eat something. Then we need you at the station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I call my girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she hadn\u0027t taken the car, she\u0027d have been walking home. She might\u0027ve walked past here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call your girl,\" Ben told him. \"And ease off the beer. Whit-taker.\" Ben signaled to the driver of the first cruiser. \"Take Gil home, will you? And give him some time to clean up and pull it together before you bring him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could use some sleep, Ben,\" Tess murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to snap at her, then cut himself off. The kid looked ready to drop. \"Right. Drop him off, Whittaker. We\u0027ll send a car for you about noon. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He looked at Tess then. \"Thanks. I do feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If what happens gives you some trouble and you want to talk about it, call the station. They\u0027ll give you my number.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Gil was in the car, Ben had Tess by the arm, leading her away. \"The department doesn\u0027t approve of soliciting for patients at the scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess shook off his arm. \"Yes, you\u0027re welcome, Detective. I\u0027m glad I could help you get a coherent story out of your only witness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d have gotten it out of him.\" Ben cupped his hands around a match and lit a fresh cigarette. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Harris arrive on the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really hate it that I helped, don\u0027t you? Because I\u0027m a psychiatrist, I wonder, or because I\u0027m a woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t psychoanalyze me,\" he warned, tossed his cigarette into the street, and immediately wished it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have to psychoanalyze to see resentment, prejudice, and anger.\" She broke off, realizing how close she was to losing control in public and creating a scene. \"Ben, I know you didn\u0027t want me to come, but I didn\u0027t get in the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in the way?\" He laughed and studied her face. \"No, you\u0027re a real pro, lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it?\" she murmured. She wanted to shout, to sit down, to just walk away. It took the rest of her control not to do any of those things. Whatever you begin, you finish. That, too, was part of her training. \"I walked into that alley with you and stayed on the same level. I didn\u0027t fall apart, get sick, run away. I didn\u0027t get hysterical at the sight of a body, and that really bothers you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctors are objective, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" she said calmly, though Anne Reasoner\u0027s face flashed into her mind. \"But maybe it\u0027ll soothe your ego to know that it wasn\u0027t easy for me. I wanted to turn around and walk out of there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething inside him jerked, but he ignored it. \"You held up pretty good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that strips me of my femininity, maybe even my sexuality. You would have been happier if you\u0027d had to carry me out of that alley. Never mind the interference or inconvenience. That would, have been more comfortable for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s bullshit.\" He pulled out another cigarette, cursing himself because he realized it was true. \"I work with plenty of women cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t sleep with them, do you, Ben?\" She said it quietly, knowing she\u0027d hit a button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes narrowed, he drew in smoke, long and deep. \"Watch your step.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s just what I intend to do.\" She pulled her gloves out of her pockets, realizing for the first time that her hands were freezing. The sun was up now, but the light was still murky. She didn\u0027t think she\u0027d ever been so cold. \"Tell your captain that he\u0027ll have an updated report by tomorrow afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. I\u0027ll get someone to drive you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He took her arm before she could turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve mentioned that I\u0027m a civilian enough times to know you can\u0027t order me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Press charges of harassment if you want, but you\u0027re getting an escort home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s two blocks,\" she began, and his grip tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. Two blocks. Two blocks, and your name and picture have been in the paper.\" With his free hand he gathered up her hair. It was nearly the same shade as Anne Reasoner\u0027s. They both knew it. \"Use some of those brains you\u0027re so proud of, and think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to let you frighten me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, but you\u0027re getting an escort home.\" He kept his hand on her arm as he walked her to a cruiser. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sacred-sins/page-7.html","bookId":2413,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:02 AM"}
