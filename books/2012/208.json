He walked on to the trail the column had made, a road of sorts where the sharp stones had been kicked clear by the passage of thousands of boots. Twenty paces. Thirty, well away from the camp now. He halted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, then. Show yourselves .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, fingers combing through his beard, expecting to see the dust swirl up from the path, lift into the air, find shape. The simple act of setting eyes upon a T’lan Imass depressed Ruthan Gudd. There was shame in making the wrong choice – only a fool would deny that. And just as one had to live with the choice, so too was one forced to live with the shame. Well, perhaps live wasn’t the right word, not with the T’lan Imass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor fools. Make yourselves the servants of war. Surrender everything else. Bury your memories. Pretend that the choice was a noble one, and that this wretched existence is good enough. Since when did vengeance answer anything? Anything of worth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know all about punishment. Retribution. Wish I didn’t but I do. It all comes down to eliminating that which offends. As if one could empty the world of bastards, or scour it clean of evil acts. Well, that would be nice. Too bad it never works. And all that satisfaction, well, it proves short-lived. Tasting like … dust .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo poet could find a more powerful symbol of futility than the T’lan Imass. Futility and obstinate stupidity. In war you need something to fight for. But you took that away, didn’t you? All that you fought to preserve had ceased to exist. You condemned your entire world to oblivion, extinction. Leaving what? What shining purpose to drive you on and on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yes, I remember now. Vengeance .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo swirls of dust. Just two figures emerging from the lurid, dust-wreathed west, shambling on the trail of the Bonehunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male was huge, battered, hulking. His stone sword, carried loosely in one hand, was black with sun-baked blood. The female was more gracile than most T’lan Imass, dressed in rotted sealskins, and on her shoulder a small forest of wood, bone and ivory harpoons. The two figures halted five paces from Ruthan Gudd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male bowed his head. ‘Elder, we greet you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthan scowled. ‘How many more of you are out there?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am Kalt Urmanal, and the Bonecaster at my side is Nom Kala of the Brold. The two of us are all that are here. We are deserters.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are you now? Well, among the Bonehunters, desertion is punishable by death. Tell me, since that obviously won’t work, how do the T’lan Imass punish deserters, Kalt?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They don’t, Elder. Deserting is punishment enough.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, Ruthan Gudd looked away. ‘Who leads the T’lan Imass army, Kalt? The army you fled?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female, Nom Kala, answered. ‘First Sword Onos T’oolan. Elder, there is the smell of ice about you. Are you Jaghut?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Jaghut? No. Do I look like a Jaghut?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I do not know. I have never seen one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever – what? ‘I haven’t washed in some time, Nom Kala.’ He combed his beard. ‘Why did you follow us? What do you want with the Bonehunters? No, wait, let us return to that later. You say that Onos T’oolan, the First Sword, leads an army of T’lan Imass – which clans? How many Bonecasters? Do they walk this same desert? How far away?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalt Urmanal said, ‘Far to the south, Elder. Of Bonecasters there are few, but of warriors there are many. Forgotten clans, remnants of armies broken on this continent in ancient conflicts. Onos T’oolan summoned them—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ said Nom Kala, ‘the summons came from Olar Ethil, in the making of Onos—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Shit ,’ Ruthan swore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth T’lan Imass fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This is turning into a real mess.’ Ruthan clawed again at his beard, glared at the undead warriors. ‘What is she planning? Do you know?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She intends to wield the First Sword, Elder,’ Nom Kala replied. ‘She seeks … redemption.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She has said this to you, Bonecaster?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Elder, she has not. She remains distant from Onos T’oolan. For now. But I was born on this soil. She cannot walk it with impunity, nor hide the power of her desires. She journeys eastward, parallel with Onos T’oolan.’ Nom Kala hesitated, and then added, ‘The First Sword is also aware of her, but he remains defiant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He is a Childslayer, Elder,’ said Kalt Urmanal. ‘A black river has drowned his mind, and those who chose to follow him can no longer escape its terrible current. We do not know the First Sword’s intent. We do not know the enemy he will choose. But he seeks annihilation. Theirs or his own – he cares not how the bones will fall.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-208.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
