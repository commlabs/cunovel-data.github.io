Rain of light that saturated every new leaf of the trees in the street, every square of paving, drift of rain threading light through the empty darkness itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the ball in the Palais Royal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king and queen were there, dancing with the people. Talk in the shadows of intrigue. Who cares? Kingdoms rise and fall. Just don\u0027t burn the paintings in the Louvre, that\u0027s all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLost in a sea of mortals again; fresh complexions and ruddy cheeks, mounds of powdered hair atop feminine heads with all manner of millinery nonsense in them, even minute ships with three masts, tiny trees, little birds. Landscapes of pearl and ribbon. Broad-chested men like cocks in satin coats like feathered wings. The diamonds hurt my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices touched the surface of my skin at times, the laughter the echo of unholy laughter, wreaths of candles blinding, the froth of music positively lapping the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGusts of rain from the open doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScent of humans gently stoking my hunger. White shoulders, white necks, powerful hearts running at that eternal rhythm, so many gradations among these naked children hidden in riches, savages laboring beneath a swaddling of chenille, encrustations of embroidery, feet aching over high heels, masks like scabs about their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air comes out of one body and is breathed into another. The music, does it pass out of one ear and into another, as the old expression goes? We breathe the light, we breathe the music, we breathe the moment as it passes through us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow and then eyes settled on me with some vague air of expectation. My white skin made them pause, but what was that when they let blood out of their veins themselves to keep their delicate pallor? (Let me hold the basin for you and drink it afterwards.) And my eyes, what were those, in this sea of paste jewels?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet their whispers slithered around me. And those scents, ah, not a one was like another. And as clearly as if spoken aloud it came, the summons from mortals here and there, sensing what I was, and the lust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn some ancient language they welcomed death; they ached for death as death was passing through the room. But did they really know? Of course they didn\u0027t know. And I did not know! That was the perfect horror! And who am I to bear this secret, to hunger so to impart it, to want to take that slender woman there and suck the blood right out of the plump flesh of her round little breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music rushed on, human music. The colors of the room flamed for an instant as if the whole would melt. The hunger sharpened. It was no longer an idea. My veins were throbbing with it. Someone would die. Sucked dry in less than a moment. I cannot stand it, thinking of it, knowing it\u0027s about to happen, fingers on the throat feeling the blood in the vein, feeling the flesh give, give it to me! Where? This is my body, this is my blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSend out your power, Lestat, like a reptile tongue to gather in a flick the appropriate heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlump little arms ripe for the squeezing, men\u0027s faces on which the close-shaven blond beard all but glitters, muscle struggling in my fingers, you haven\u0027t got a chance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd beneath this divine chemistry suddenly, this panorama of the denial of decay, I saw the bones!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkulls under these preposterous wigs, two gaping holes peering from behind the uplifted fan. A room of wobbling skeletons waiting only for the tolling of the bell. Just as I had seen the audience that night in the pit of Renaud\u0027s when I had done the tricks that terrified them. The horror should be visited upon every other being in this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to get out. I\u0027d made a terrible miscalculation. This was death and I could get away from it, if I could just get out! But I was tangled in mortal beings as if this monstrous place were a snare for a vampire. If I bolted, I\u0027d send the entire ballroom into panic. As gently as I could I pushed to the open doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd against the far wall, a backdrop of satin and filigree, I saw, out of the corner of my eye, like something imagined, Armand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there had been a summons, I never heard it. If there was a greeting, I didn\u0027t sense it now. He was merely looking at me, a radiant creature in jewels and scalloped lace. And it was Cinderella revealed at the ball, this vision, Sleeping Beauty opening her eyes under a mesh of cobwebs and wiping them all away with one sweep of her warm hand. The sheer pitch of incarnate beauty made me gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, perfect mortal raiment, and yet he seemed all the more supernatural, his face too dazzling, his dark eyes fathomless and just for a split second glinting as if they were windows to the fires of hell. And when his voice came it was low and almost teasing, forcing me to concentrate to hear it: All night you\u0027ve been searching for me, he said, and here I am, waiting for you. I have been waiting for you all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I sensed even then, as I stood unable to look away, that never in my years of wandering this earth would I ever have such a rich revelation of the true horror that we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeartbreakingly innocent he seemed in the midst of the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet I saw crypts when I looked at him, and I heard the beat of the kettledrums. I saw torchlit fields where I had never been, heard vague incantations, felt the heat of raging fires on my face. And they didn\u0027t come out of him, these visions. Rather I drew them out on my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet never had Nicolas, mortal or immortal, been so alluring. Never had Gabrielle held me so in thrall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God, this is love. This is desire. And all my past amours have been but the shadow of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it seemed in a murmuring pulse of thought he gave me to know that I had been very foolish to think it would not be so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho can love us, you and I, as we can love each other, he whispered and it seemed his lips actually moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers looked at him. I saw them drifting with a ludicrous slowness; I saw their eyes pass over him, I saw the light fall on him at a rich new angle as he lowered his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was moving towards him. It seemed he raised his right hand and beckoned and then he didn\u0027t, and he had turned and I saw the figure of a young boy ahead of me, with narrow waist and straight shoulders and high firm calves under silk stockings, a boy who turned as he opened a door and beckoned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mad thought came to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was moving after him, and it seemed that none of the other things had happened. There was no crypt under les Innocents, and he had not been that ancient fearful fiend. We were somehow safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were the sum of our desires and this was saving us, and the vast untasted horror of my own immortality did not lie before me, and we were navigating calm seas with familiar beacons, and it was time to be in each other\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark room surrounded us, private, cold. The noise of the ball was far away. He was heated with the blood he\u0027d drunk and I could hear the strong force of his heart. He drew me closer to him, and beyond the high windows there flashed the passing lights of the carriages, with dim incessant sounds that spoke of safety and comfort, and all the things that Paris was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had never died. The world was beginning again. I put out my arms and felt his heart against me, and calling out to my Nicolas, I tried to warn him, to tell him we were all of us doomed. Our life was slipping inch by inch from us, and seeing the apple trees in the orchard, drenched in green sunlight, I felt I would go mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, my dearest one,\" he was whispering, \"nothing but peace and sweetness and your arms in mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know it was the damnedest luck!\" I whispered suddenly. \"I am an unwilling devil. I cry like some vagrant child. I want to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, yes, his lips tasted like blood, but it was not human blood. It was that elixir that Magnus had given me, and I felt myself recoil. I could get away this time. I had another chance. The wheel had turned full round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was crying out that I wouldn\u0027t drink; I wouldn\u0027t, and then I felt the two hot shafts driven hard through my neck and down to my soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t move. It was coming as it had come that night, the rapture, a thousandfold what it was when I held mortals in my arms. And I knew what he was doing! He was feeding upon me! He was draining me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd going down on my knees, I felt myself held by him, the blood pouring out of me with a monstrous volition I couldn\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Devil!\" I tried to scream. I forced the word up and up until it broke from my lips and the paralysis broke from my limbs. \"Devil!\" I roared again and I caught him in his swoon and hurled him backwards to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant, I had my hands upon him and, shattering the French doors, had dragged him out with me into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heels were scraping on the stones, his face had become pure fury. I clutched his right arm and swung him from side. to side so that his head snapped back and he could not see nor gauge where he was, nor catch hold of anything, and with my right hand I beat him and beat him, until the blood was running out of his ears and his eyes and his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dragged him through the trees away from the lights of the Palais. And as he struggled, as he sought to resurrect himself with a burst of force, he shot his declaration at me that he would kill me because he had my strength now. He\u0027d drunk it out of me and coupled with his own strength it would make him impossible to defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddened, I clutched at his neck, pushing his head down against the path beneath me. I pinned him down, strangling him, until the blood in great gushes poured out of his open mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have screamed if he could. My knees drove into his chest. His neck bulged under my fingers and the blood spurted and bubbled out of him and he turned his head from side to side, his eyes growing bigger and bigger, but seeing nothing, and then when I felt him weak and limp, I let him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI beat him again, turning him this way and that. And then I drew my sword to sever his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet him live like that if he can. Let him be immortal like that if he can. I raised the sword and when I looked down at him, the rain was pelting his face, and he was staring up at me, as one half alive, unable to plead for mercy, unable to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited. I wanted him to beg. I wanted him to give me that powerful voice full of lies and cunning, the voice that had made me believe for one pure and dazzling instant that I was alive and free and in the state of grace again. Damnable, unforgivable lie. Lie I\u0027d never forget for as long as I walked the earth. I wanted the rage to carry me over the threshold to his grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing came from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in this moment of stillness and misery for him, his beauty slowly returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lay a broken child on the gravel path, only yards from the passing traffic, the ring of horses\u0027 hooves, the rumble of the wooden wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in this broken child were centuries of evil and centuries of knowledge, and out of him there came no ignominious entreaty but merely the soft and bruised sense of what he was. Old, old evil, eyes that had seen dark ages of which I only dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him go, and I stood up and sheathed my sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked a few paces from him, and collapsed upon a wet stone bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar away, busy figures labored about the shattered window of the palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the night lay between us and those confused mortals, and I looked at him listlessly as he lay still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was turned to me, but not by design, his hair a tangle of curls and blood. And with his eyes closed, and his hand open beside him, he appeared the abandoned offspring of time and supernatural accident, someone as miserable as myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had he done to become what he was? Could one so young so long ago have guessed the meaning off any decision, let alone the vow to become this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose, and walking slowly to him, I stood over him and looked at him, at the blood that soaked his lace shirt and stained his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed he sighed, that I heard the passage of his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t open his eyes, and to mortals perhaps there would have been no expression there. But I felt his sorrow. I felt its immensity, and I wished I didn\u0027t feel it, and for one moment I understood the gulf that divided us, and the gulf that divided his attempt to overpower me from my rather simple defense of myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperately he had tried to vanquish what he did not comprehend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd impulsively and almost effortlessly I had beaten him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll my pain with Nicolas came back to me and Gabrielle\u0027s words and Nicolas\u0027s denunciations. My anger was nothing to his misery, his despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this perhaps was the reason that I reached down and gathered him up. And maybe I did it because he was so exquisitely beautiful and so lost, and we were after all of the same ilk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatural enough, wasn\u0027t it, that one of his own should take him away from this place where mortals would sooner or later have approached him, driven him stumbling away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave no resistance to me. In a moment he was standing on his own feet. And then he walked drowsily beside me, my arm about his shoulder, bolstering him and steadying him until we were moving away from the Palais Royal, towards the rue St. Honor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only half glanced at the figures passing us, until I saw a familiar shape under the trees, with no scent of mortality coming from it, and I realized that Gabrielle had been there for some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came forward hesitantly and silently, her face stricken when she saw the blood-drenched lace and the lacerations on his white skin, and she reached out as if to help me with the burden of him though she did not seem to know how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere far off in the darkened gardens, the others were near. I heard them before I saw them. Nicki was there too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had come as Gabrielle had come, drawn over the miles, it seemed, by the tumult, or what vague messages I could not imagine, and they merely waited and watched as we moved away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-lestat-the-vampire-chronicles-2/page-36.html","bookId":2210,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM"}
