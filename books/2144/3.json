This time I hung outside Aunt Libby`s apartment in the drizzling rain anticipating the arrival of the number seven. I paced back and forth for what seemed like an eternity, waiting for it to turn down my aunt`s street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to admit I wasn`t overly excited to be boarding another bus, having just ridden one for several hours, but it beat borrowing Aunt Libby`s bike and cycling across town in the rain. It was imperative that I reach the manor house before sunset, otherwise Alexander might be out for the evening and my surprise reunion would be delayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I saw a bus lumbering around the corner and almost cheered when I saw it displayed a yellow seven digitally. I shoved my money in the change receptacle and quickly grabbed the cold aluminum pole. Though the bus was half empty and many seats were vacant, I chose to stand for the duration of the ride. Having missed the Lennox Hill stop the last time, I refused to have anyone or anything blocking my view and further delay reaching Alexander. My heart beat faster with every stop and acceleration. I thought I`d caught a break since there weren`t that many passengers on the bus, but twice as many were waiting to board the number seven at the next stop. After what felt like the span of summer break itself, I spotted Lennox Hill Road. I remembered that to notify the driver of my desire to disembark, I needed to pull on the white wire that ran above the windows. I repeatedly tugged on the cord like I was signaling an SOS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard you! the driver shouted back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain had ceased. I hurried up Lennox Hill Road, scurrying through puddles and jumping over slimy but cool earthworms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain-soaked estates lined the street. The pristine grass lawns were drenched and several branches and leaves were scattered in the asphalt driveways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, at the end of the cul-de-sac, plain as a stormy day, sat the monstrous manor house. The gruesome estate appeared to be even more overgrown and unkempt than the last time I`d visited it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteam seeped into the air, creating a spooky fog around the palatial home. Moss and wild vines overtook the house like a giant spiderweb. Stone gargoyles sitting upon the jagged wrought-iron gates seemed to smile at me as I approached. Sticking in the half-dead, weed-filled lawn was a Happy Homes sign. I hurried past the broken birdbath and up the cracked rock path. My heart pounded as I reached the familiar arched wooden front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon-shaped knocker that had fallen into my hand upon my first visit had not been replaced. Perhaps it was still hidden in the untamed bushes where I`d tossed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knocked on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited. And waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson didn`t respond. I pounded my hand against the door again. Still no response. Not even a torn curtain rustled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned the rusty doorknob and pushed against the door, but it was bolted shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raced through the soggy grass, past the servants` door to the back of the house. I darted up the few cracked cement stairs and eyed the back wooden arched door. There wasn`t a bell to ring or a knocker to knock. I pounded my hand on the door. When no one answered, I looked around for another door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was becoming concerned that it wasn`t Alexander and Jameson who had rented the place after all. There were no signs of my boyfriend or his butler`s presence. I peeked in a basement window and it appeared to be in the same vacant state. I spotted the tree I had once climbed to see into Alexander`s room. I might have been able to confirm once again that he was inside, but climbing the rain-soaked tree was not a viable option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peered around the backyard to see if I saw Jameson`s Mercedes. The cracked asphalt drive was vacant of cars. I saw a concrete bench and a wrought-iron arched trellis overrun with creeping vines. A circular rock bed where a pond must have once been was now filled with rainwater. I spotted a decaying one-car detached garage that appeared as though it might collapse with a gentle nudge. I headed straight for it. My heart raced as I darted toward the garage. I noticed a lock on the door. It was brand-new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I was an expert at sneak-ins, I was lousy at picking locks. I`d need the help of Billy Boy`s nerd-mate gadget whiz, Henry, but he was obviously miles away. The dilapidated garage was sturdier than it looked. With all my strength, I couldn`t move any of the paint- chipped wooden boards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI examined the outside of the garage. There wasn`t a window on any side. I did notice a skinny crack between two boards about hip height from the ground on one side. Light from the setting sun illuminated the skinny space. With my best vision, I could barely make out a white sheet covering what must have been an old bike or lawn mower. And next to it, something sparkling in the light. On further inspection I noticed a Mercedes hood ornament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raced back to the manor house. I placed a discarded box underneath the kitchen window and stepped on it. I teetered on tiptoe, doing my best to see inside. The window was dusty, so it was almost impossible to see indoors. I tapped the glass pane relentlessly and peered through a hole the size of a quarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly a bulging eyeball gazed back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, I screamed and fell off the box, back onto my bottom in the wet grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the sound of locks being unlocked and the door being opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze. What if I`d been wrong when I`d spotted a Mercedes ornament that I was so certain had belonged to Jameson? I was so excited to see it, I hadn`t even considered my discovery. The stored car could have been any make or model, or white for all I knew. At any moment I would be caught trespassing, thrown in Hipsterville`s juvie jail, or forced to return to Dullsville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my black lip and held my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, at the screen door, Jameson appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander`s butler struggled to see me through the glare of the mesh door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson, it`s me, Raven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Raven? he asked, confused. He opened the door. It can`t be you. What are you doing here? In the backyard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped to my feet, dusted off my miniskirt, and raced up the uneven steps toward the Creepy Man. Jameson wrinkled his pale forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Raven, I`m surprised to see you here. But pleasantly, I might add, he said with a skinny-toothed smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI`m visiting my aunt Libby here in town, I said, relieved to see the bony butler. I wanted to tell Alexander, but there wasn`t a way to let him know. I seriously think it`s time you and Alexander got cell phones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease come in. It will be dark soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of sweet potatoes filled the high ceilings of the rustic kitchen. Jameson was preparing dinner, or, in Alexander`s case, breakfast. Will you be staying? he asked in his thick Romanian accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI`d love to, if it`s not a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is always room for you at our dinner table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart melted at Jameson`s kindness. I was dying to press the bony man for information on what they`d been doing in Hipsterville and why they had rented the manor house, but that would have to wait because there was something of more importance resting somewhere in the estate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan I see Alexander? I asked anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson, wearing oversized brown oven mitts, opened the door of the old-fashioned oven and pulled out a tray of aluminum-foil-covered sweet potatoes. Behind him, the dirt-stained window stared at me like a hotel oil painting--poking through intermittent clouds was the setting sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know Alexander prefers to sleep during the day, he reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course...I just thought...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it is quite a surprise you have arrived, he said, politely entertaining me. I`m sure Alexander will be very pleased you are here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope so! How long do you and Alexander plan to stay here? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson paused, then appeared distracted. Did I set the table? he wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am sorry to drop in on you like this, I apologized. Can I help you set it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat won`t be necessary, Miss Raven. Why don`t you sit and relax in the study. Alexander will come down soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay I take a quick peek around?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, but stay on the first floor. I didn`t have time to clean the other rooms today, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the first floor`s appearance was Jameson`s idea of cleaning, I could only imagine what the second floor was like. Dust balls clung to every corner, and cobwebs hung from the antique crystal chandeliers. The estate was far too grand for one creepy man to vacuum. The manor house was at least ten degrees colder than the Mansion and far emptier. The floorboards were uneven and watermarked. I wandered in the hallway; the walls were empty of portraits and the wallpaper was faded and patched with stains. All rooms and walls were bare, including what must have been a parlor and library. The only exception was the dining room, where a long rectangular stone table sat in the middle of the room, antique black velvet chairs at each end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson had warned me to remain on the first floor as if he were Glinda the good witch telling Dorothy to stay on the yellow brick road. From the foot of the grand staircase, I could only see a royal blue curtained window at the end of the first flight. I wondered what lay past the two flights out of view above me. Figuring I only had a moment before Jameson began setting the table, I crept up the once regal staircase. Like Dorothy, I betrayed the path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChills danced down my spine as I snuck through the narrow and lonely hallway. I opened door after door, revealing empty bedrooms and closets, my footsteps echoing in the cavernous and vacant space. Where the Mansion`s rooms were filled with furniture, books, and antique mementos, the manor house`s rooms were stripped of any memories. The only room that showed any sign of life was at the far end of the corridor. Its contents: a single bed and a cedar dresser. I presumed it was Jameson`s living quarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I softly shut the Creepy Man`s bedroom door, I noticed something dangling in the hallway ceiling above me. A short, wiry piece of white rope hung from a square door overhead. It was out of arm`s reach, but with a good jump I might have been able to grab it. I knew I should go back downstairs, but that went against my true nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first time I jumped, I didn`t even reach the cord. The second time, my fingers touched it. Finally, on the third try, I caught the cord between my fingers. With all my might, I quickly pulled the rope and snapped it securely in the palm of my hand. The door slowly creaked down toward me and a staircase folded out like a fire escape in a New York City alleyway. Surprisingly the wooden steps seemed to be in relatively good condition. Perhaps the former tenants didn`t see the need for a darkened attic hideaway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quietly ascended the stairs, curious to examine what lay at the top. A glow from the second floor shone like a small spotlight, illuminating a portion of the attic. A musty smell filled the gymnasium-sized room. The attic, like the rooms below, appeared bare. Alexander`s easel, art supplies, and mattress were nowhere to be found. A single ray of sunlight peeked through a circular window in the far end of the sloping attic walls. I tiptoed over and noticed an unpainted plain old oak armoire beneath the window. I tried to open its doors, only to discover they were locked. Perhaps the skeleton key was hiding in the attic somewhere with real skeletons. I glanced around, trying to adjust my vision in the darkness. It was then I saw something shrouded in the shadows--a black room divider. I crept over to the corner of the attic and peered behind the six- foot-tall wooden screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could barely make out a night table and a pewter candlestick with a half-melted white candle. Behind it stood an easel with a covered painting, art supplies scattered beneath. Then I noticed something familiar on the nightstand staring back at me. It was the picture Alexander had painted of me and kept on his nightstand at the Mansion. There next to the tiny table was a single black coffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was standing alongside my sleeping vampire boyfriend. I pressed my ear to the cold coffin lid. I could barely hear what I thought to be breathing. My heart raced with his every breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew the sun was setting because the cast of light from the attic window was slowly shrinking. It only took a few minutes for it to dwindle to the size of the nightstand. Finally it was as thin as a pencil, then it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small amount of light still appeared from the open door in the attic floor. It took my eyes a moment to adjust to the new illumination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then I heard someone stirring inside the coffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped back, and the heel of my boot snagged against a tiny nail protruding from the bottom of the screen. For several moments, the room divider and I teetered back and forth. I was about to cause a major commotion. I regained my balance and managed to return the screen upright and steal myself behind it. I peered through a tiny crack between the ruler-sized boards, my heart racing even harder now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top of the coffin lid began to creak open ever so slowly toward me, leaving me unable to see inside until it reached a ninety-degree angle. I didn`t see fingers, a hand, or anything opening it, nor could I make out anything--or anyone--behind it. I peeked around the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then I saw a sleepy Alexander staring right at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, I screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. His chocolate-colored eyes turned bloodred. Raven!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to catch my breath and regain my composure. I didn`t mean to scare you--or myself, I apologized. What are you doing here? he asked, shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came to see you--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander stepped out of the coffin barefoot, wearing a black T-shirt and black boxers. He paused by the nightstand. He didn`t run to me and scoop me up in his arms. It wasn`t the reaction I`d expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought you`d be glad to see me, I said. It took all my strength not to hug him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am, it`s just-- Alexander stood awkwardly. He fixed his hair with one hand and straightened out his clothes with the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you upset I`m here? I asked. I couldn`t wait another day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just woke up, he said self-consciously, wiping one eye with the back of his hand. I would have preferred a little warning. His stern demeanor then softened. He looked sexy, his long hair tousled and his clothes still askew. Even in the darkness Alexander lit up the room. A warm smile overcame his sleepy face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI missed you so much I couldn`t breathe, I said, daring to run to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe too, he said, now gazing down at me. He brushed my hair away from my cheek, pulled me into him, and swept me up in his arms. I hugged him around his neck, and my black- fingernailed hands coursed through his silky black hair. He leaned into me and kissed me, passionately, like I`d dreamed about night after night since he left the Mansion. Alexander took my neck in his mouth, like a wolf would a swan. The sharp edge of his teeth slid against my skin, then he suddenly pulled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Raven? Miss Raven? Jameson called from below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander let me down. His red eyes faded to their natural brown. He seemed shaken, but I held his hand reassuredly. I knew I was safe in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe`s up here with me, Jameson, Alexander answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought she might have gotten lost. Dinner is ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was just on my appetizer, he whispered to me with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesserts are even better, I said, and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt as tiny as a Polly Pocket doll in a Barbie Dream House as I sat alone at the limousine-length table in the stately and stark mile-high-ceilinged dining room. A black lace tablecloth was draped over the stone tabletop, and a single candelabra flickered as the centerpiece. The macabre table was set with Wedgwood china plates, sterling silver cutlery, and crystal goblets--everyday settings for my vampire boyfriend. The Madison family ate this fancy only once a year, when my grandmother dusted off her china and made Christmas dinner; otherwise it was strictly Pfaltzgraff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy combat boots grazed the patched wooden floor as I anxiously swung them back and forth underneath the table, impatiently waiting for Alexander`s entrance. I was hoping a ghost would float by to keep me company, but no specters arrived. Soon I sensed a familiar presence behind me, followed by hands caressing my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt two lips press against my neck. I grew so hot I thought I`d melt the ice cubes in my crystal goblet. The ends of Alexander`s midnight-colored hair were still damp from a quick shower and brushed against the back of my bare shoulder. He smelled heavenly with the sweet scents of Drakkar and Irish Spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn`t have barged in on you like that, I apologized as he stood next to me. You are a much better sport than I am, I added. I`m not sure how I would have reacted if I woke up and found you watching me. I know exactly how you would have reacted. Alexander made a Godzilla-like monster face and we both cracked up knowing he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander moved his chair and place setting next to mine. Jameson entered the room pushing a squeaky-wheeled metal cart carrying a covered sterling silver serving tray. He removed the lid to reveal two sizzling, dripping red steaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the liberty of cooking yours medium-well, Jameson said, serving me. I assumed you didn`t like yours as rare as Alexander`s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over at Alexander`s plate. The barely cooked strip steak was almost floating in a pool of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine is perfect, I said with an oversized grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsn`t it a nice surprise that Raven has come to town? Jameson asked, spooning out steaming-hot buttered peas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt`s the perfect way to wake up, Alexander said with a twinkle in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill there be anything else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think we are fine, Alexander stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scooted my chair even closer to Alexander`s. I couldn`t believe that my boyfriend, who had been so far away for so many days, was now by my side. All the pain I`d felt in the last month or so disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander seemed ravenous as he tore into his bloody steak. I was reminded each time I was in Alexander`s company that I was truly dating a vampire. He had just woken up, while I, on the other hand, had been awake for more than twelve hours. Upon awakening, my boyfriend craved blood the way I craved a caramel latte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was so much I wanted to ask Alexander I didn`t know where to begin. As we continued to cut into our steaks, I pried for the info I`d missed over our time apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs Valentine here? What have you been doing? When are you planning on coming home? I babbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlow down, he said, tapping my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell me about Valentine. Is he okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Valentine is fine. He returned to his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused, waiting to hear more. But Alexander just winked and took a bite of his sweet potato.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat`s it? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere Becky and I would begin retelling a juicy event by setting the scene, followed by a description of clothing and dialogue, finishing with overheard gossip and our biased commentary, Alexander would simply provide one-word answers. How was I supposed to get a nitty-gritty fleshed-out story this way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs Valentine here or in Romania? I continued to pry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomania, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you see Jagger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Alexander went back to cutting into his meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou did? What did he say? Was he threatening? Where did you meet? In Hipsterville`s graveyard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI showed up at his apartment at the Coffin Club. I have to admit, he was surprised, Alexander began. When he lifted the door open, he saw only me standing before him-- Valentine was hanging by the elevator. Jagger was primed for an encounter, his fists clenched, his fangs flashing. But when he saw Valentine next to me, a wave of relief overcame him. I`d never seen him like that. Jagger was so happy to have Valentine safe I think all the blood rushed out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, you really are a hero, I gushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was obvious Jagger had mixed feelings that I was the one who had returned Valentine to him. He`s spent so much time seeking revenge on me for not having a covenant ceremony with Luna he didn`t know how to respond. For the first time I can remember, Jagger and I weren`t rivals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I`d been there to see it, I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clutched my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he hugged his brother, Alexander continued, Jagger extended his hand to me. It was then that I knew a truce was formed--between him and me and our families. Returning Valentine safely was more important than completing any covenant ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you think you guys will be friends now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander shook his head. Sadly no. We`re polar opposites and don`t have much in common. But now that things are peaceful between the two of us, it`s probably best for him and me not to see each other for a while so we can keep it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander took a drink from his goblet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am really glad you are here, he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am too!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe locked eyes. For a moment it was as if we were the only two people in the world. Billions of people were shopping, driving, living, but the only person I was aware of was the gorgeous guy staring back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander leaned over and gently kissed me. I was so lost in his kiss, I didn`t realize my sleeve was sitting in my dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, let me, he said, dabbing his napkin in his water glass and brushing off the butter stain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan`t take me anywhere, I joked. So, when will you be returning to Dullsville? I hinted. Tomorrow? Next week?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just have one more thing to take care of. It shouldn`t take much longer. I promise. Believe me, it`s lonely not being around the people you care about most. Alexander gently smiled at me. I felt a twinge of sadness for him. In Romania he had his family. In Dullsville he had me and Jameson. But here in Hipsterville, he and Jameson were all alone. How is your family? he politely asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy misses you like crazy. You`re like a hero to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I return to Dullsville, we`ll have to take him to a science fair or a screening of the original Star Wars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. See? That is why you`re so special. You think about doing what he likes to do rather than doing something I\u0027d like to do--like dragging him to a rave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Becky? he continued. Is she still dating Matt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think she`s picking out her wedding dress as we speak. I`m sure she`s counting down the days until graduation so she can elope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander laughed. And you? Are you anything like Becky? His gaze was so deliberate, it nearly bore through my soul. For once I was speechless. I was as much of a giddy and googly-eyed girly girl as Becky ever was. But I couldn`t confess that I was weak-kneed in an I`d tattoo your name on my heart if only my parents would let me way. I had to appear at least remotely sophisticated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander, however, was waiting for my response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you hear that there are crop circles popping up in town? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander put down his fork. Where did you learn that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt`s all over the news. Do you think it`s aliens?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. I guess it could be...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, my aunt Libby and I had a major discussion about it. Guess what my theory is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractical jokers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it`s vampires, signaling the whereabouts of other vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander`s eyes widened and he choked on his water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded his head and covered his mouth with his napkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes perfect sense, I continued. Who else is up at night while most mortals sleep? And who can see the circles better than bats flying over the horizon? I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander gave me a blank look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was undeterred. The only thing I haven`t figured out is what the crop circles mean. I leaned into Alexander intently. Are they warning other vampires to stay away or inviting them in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander quickly broke our gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson burst into the room carrying a dessert tray, ending my investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust in time, Alexander said. We`re finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson presented us with two perfectly delectable cr\u0026amp;#65533;me br\u0026amp;#65533;l\u0026amp;#65533;es.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt`s like eating at a five-star restaurant! I complimented him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson`s pale flesh turned pink as he wheeled back our dinner plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is so much to do while we are here, I said excitedly, digging into my dessert. You`ll have to meet Aunt Libby. Then there`s Hot Gothics. And of course the Coffin Club!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander gave me a stern look. Not the Coffin Club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon`t worry, I can get in. I have a fake ID.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat`s not what I meant. A club like that is not a place a girl like you should frequent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl like me? I laughed in disbelief. It`s a goth club. It was made for me! Ever since I visited it last time, I dreamed that we could return there together. What could possibly happen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl in a bar? he asked, like I had two heads. Don`t you watch the news?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, I said, rolling my eyes like I was getting scolded by my parents. It`s not the safest place...but--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast time you met Jagger. Remember?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander had a point. I didn`t have the greatest track record with my decisions. My curiosity had drawn my boyfriend`s nemesis right to him, creating a lot of danger for him and my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, I finally admitted. Disappointed, I chiseled away at the burnt sugar topping stuck to the inside of the bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander placed his ghost white hand on my pale one. We will go, but together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan we go tonight? I asked, perking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about tomorrow. I wasn`t expecting company, remember? Oh, yes, of course. I remembered intruding on him. Then I furrowed my brow skeptically and challenged him. You don`t have a hot date, do you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. I do, as a matter of fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, and it is almost ending. Alexander glanced at an antique marble clock sitting on the mantel of the unused fireplace. The clock was barely ticking, and the minute hand was broken. I didn`t want my evening to end, but I knew of course it had to. He wiped his mouth with his linen napkin and then grabbed my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI`m so glad you did come, he said adoringly. You never fail to surprise me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou surprise me, too... I took a deep breath, then asked, Why are you both still here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Jameson returned to collect the dishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the time being, Alexander was off the hook. Allow me, Miss Raven, Jameson said. Alexander and his butler placed the dishes on the top shelf of the cart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson will drive you back to your aunt`s apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the broken clock, still struggling to figure out the correct time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson can drop me off at my aunt`s drumming class. It`s much closer. I believe you may have met my aunt Libby. She works at Happy Homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat beautiful woman is your aunt? I should have known. She is quite charming...just like her niece, said Jameson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look forward to meeting her, Alexander said. Then with a whisper: Although you`ll have to make a few excuses for me not being seen in the daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcuses? I wrote the book! I`ve got one for every occasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a Victorian gentleman minus the top hat, white gloves, and British accent, Alexander escorted me out the door and down the rock path while Jameson brought the car around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill I see you tomorrow? I asked my boyfriend as I snuggled in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss you already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander leaned into me and gave me a long, luxurious good-night kiss. He graciously opened the back door of the Mercedes and helped me step in. As we drove off, Alexander stood in the driveway, the mammoth-sized manor house looming behind him like a medieval monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson was kind enough to chauffeur me to Hipsterville`s Old Town Folk Music Center, but the short five-mile drive from the manor house to the hippie school of music seemed to take longer than the journey from Dullsville to Hipsterville. If I`d pushed the car myself, we`d have made it faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that Jameson and I had some quality time, I figured I`d make the most of it. I tried to pump the Creepy Man for info on Valentine and Jagger, but he was as evasive as Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was so kind of you and Alexander to reunite Valentine with his family, I began when we drove past Gerald`s Gas Station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the right thing to do, he said sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you see Jagger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited on pins, needles, and piercing, bracing for his response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I didn`t. I left that to Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for the facts on that conversation. I bet Ruby misses you, I said, referring to my former boss who was now dating Jameson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson`s bulgy eyes brightened in the rearview mirror and his pale face flushed bright red with the mention of her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHas she come for a visit? I pried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no. We are hoping to return to the Mansion shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, then why did you rent the manor house? You could have just stayed in a hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don`t stay anywhere that already has a housekeeper, Jameson joked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt as if I were playing a game of tennis with my dad. With all my might, I lobbed the ball over the net only to have it returned so hard I didn`t have a chance to swing. Frustrated, I always had to take a moment to collect myself. Time for another serve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you miss Romania? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yes, it`s so beautiful there. But I am also quite happy here, in America. I`ve met some people that I am quite fond of, Miss Raven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew he was politely referring to Ruby and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wanted more. What were Alexander`s and Jameson`s plans?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you think you`ll marry Ruby?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf so, will you live in the manor house? Or in the Mansion?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI`m not planning...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, if you did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose...it would be up to...Why all of the questions, Miss Raven?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were volleying steadily now, and it was time for me to end the match. I paused, then asked, I`m just wondering, what are you and Alexander doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson pulled the car to the curb in front of the Old Town Folk Music Center. I`d swung too hard, hitting the ball over the fence. The match ended, Jameson the obvious winner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain had subsided and the streetlights and lampposts were dripping wet. Jameson climbed out of the Mercedes and kindly held the door open for me, like I was an A-list starlet arriving at a premiere. The only thing missing were the paparazzi. I waved good-bye and was heading for Old Town when I noticed something flashing at the end of the block--the flickering neon red sign of the Coffin Club. As Jameson puttered down the street, I paused. The sounds of banging drums pulsed out of the music center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if the blinking neon coffins were drawing me to them, like a vulture to a corpse. No one would be the wiser if I just popped my head in for a nonalcoholic bubbly Execution...or two. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-coffin-club-vampire-kisses-5/page-3.html","bookId":2144,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:37 PM"}
