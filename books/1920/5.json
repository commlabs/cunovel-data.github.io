She looked at him with luminous eyes. \"More than anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit.\" He rubbed at his chest, trying to ease the ache that made it hard to breathe. \"If that was true, you would\u0027ve come with me. The fact is, you loved your family more. And this town, the shop - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have held you back even if I\u0027d g-gone with you!\" she cried, her voice breaking. \"Your parents thought I was after your money. Hanging on to you would only have proven them right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if I gave a shit what they thought. They would have come around eventually, and it wouldn\u0027t have mattered to me if they didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It mattered to me. You had years of college ahead of you - fraternities, sports, late night-studying... There was no place for me in that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed the beer away, feeling sick. \"I would have made a place for you. Or we could have agreed to a long-distance relationship. Phone calls, visits, holiday breaks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of which would have interrupted time with your father and curbed your freedom to network. You needed to create the contacts you could use in the future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate to break it to you, mi querida,\" he said coldly, \"but I was fucking miserable all through college. I might have continued being miserable afterward, if I hadn\u0027t become numb to everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith inhaled sharply. A tear slid down her cheek, pissing him off. She had no right to cry over his pain, not when she\u0027d caused it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, pushing out of the booth, unable to sit there and bleed over her tears, which he couldn\u0027t bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miguel.\" She stayed him with a hand on his arm. \"Wait. We\u0027ll go together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching her by the wrist, he yanked her toward him. \"You once told me you\u0027d love me forever. Was that a lie, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you ask me that, after tonight?\" she whispered, tears streaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, yes, we\u0027ll go together.\" He released her and stood. He dug into his pocket for his money clip and tossed cash on the table. \"Back to New York. Where you should have been the last eleven years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiped at her wet cheeks with both hands. \"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shot her a scathing look. \"What\u0027s the excuse now? I\u0027ve climbed the ladders I needed to. Now I\u0027ve got everything I want, except for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me? You\u0027re not seriously going to shovel that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s -\u0026nbsp; I...\" She took another deep breath. \"I have a son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground dropped out from beneath his feet. He swore the room tilted. The overly loud music pounded through his skull. He stumbled away from the booth, nearly toppling a waitress balancing a full-tray of food. Apologizing over his shoulder, he made his way outside, desperate for air in his burning lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spoke not a word on the ride back. The only concession Miguel made was to carry the to-go bag she\u0027d taken the time to order before they left the restaurant and to hold the door open for her when they got back to the bungalow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went into the bedroom, his body taut with a tension that told her to give him some time alone. She went to the kitchen and began unpacking the food, her hands shaking from the raw pain she\u0027d seen on his face. She had been half-afraid she wouldn\u0027t find him waiting by the car when she exited the sports pub, but she\u0027d known she would follow him if he called a cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis day of reckoning was long overdue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith made two plates of steak and shrimp fajitas with all the fixin\u0027s, then set them on the small round dining table. She began to eat, ravenous in a way only a stress-eater could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was nearly done by the time Miguel reappeared. He entered the living area dressed in striped silk pajama bottoms and nothing else. There was a new bottle of cognac on the table behind the couch and he went to it, opening it and pouring himself a glass. He glanced at her in silent inquiry, but she shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that he was in front of her - the beautiful boy she\u0027d loved now a formidably gorgeous man - she was struck by how much she stood to lose. There was nothing to be done about it, not with as disparate as their lives were. They\u0027d eventually make each other miserable. Resentment would grow in whichever one of them was forced to give up their lifestyle and livelihood for the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the tulip-shaped glass of amber liquid to his lips and drank, his eyes closing with a weariness that broke her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know you still cared,\" she said softly, pushing her plate away. \"I thought you\u0027d get to New York, meet some gorgeous supermodel, and realize you\u0027d dodged a bullet with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" he snapped. \"I don\u0027t need to be insulted on top of everything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t - \" The look on his face made her recoil back into the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You martyred yourself for our love, but I\u0027m so shallow any hot piece of ass would do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I meant.\" She inhaled deeply, taking the hit because she deserved it. \"I did it as much for me as for you. I did it for both of us, and no matter how pissed off you are - and I\u0027m not saying you don\u0027t have the right to be - I still believe I made the right decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguel tossed back his drink and poured another one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should eat something,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis quelling glance didn\u0027t scare her. And in the end, he set the refilled glass down and walked away from it. \"How old is your son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith\u0027s stomach flipped. She didn\u0027t want to lie to him. As it was, it was killing her to keep Michael away from his father, but she knew what would happen if Miguel knew. He would take over, force her to go with him to keep her son. But the life she was giving Michael now was the best for him. Later, when he was older, she expected to lose her son to his father just as she\u0027d lost Miguel. He would want to emulate his father and grandfather, follow in their footsteps. He would go to Princeton on the trust Mrs. Santos had created for him and he would eventually live in New York and join his father\u0027s world, she was certain of it. But first she wanted to give him a loving, stable home. She wanted him to learn the value of hard work, and to know what it felt like to covet something and not be able to afford it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe exhaled softly, steeling her resolve. \"He\u0027s still a boy,\" she hedged. \"Thank God. I\u0027m not ready to parent a teenager.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguel\u0027s arms crossed. \"Is Michael\u0027s father active in his life? Is he active in yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We went our separate ways some time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I don\u0027t see a problem.\" His eyes were dark and brilliant as he stared at her. \"He\u0027s your son, Faith. I\u0027ll take you both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith was glad to be sitting because her knees went weak. \"My god...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproaching the table, Miguel sat and dug into the food she\u0027d plated for him. His gaze was determined and challenging. So like him. Romance was in his blood. At heart, he believed love conquered all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was breathless with the need to cry. He was a warrior prince, set upon a quest to save his fair princess from a life of toil. He wanted to spirit her away to his tower, where he would drape her in jewels and see that her every whim was met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only she wanted to be rescued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguel wiped his mouth with a napkin, then drank from one of the bottles of water that had been artfully arranged in the center of the table. Pushing away from her place setting, Faith stood and went to him. He slid his chair back, making room for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting her skirt, she straddled him, cupping his face in her hands and trusting him to support her back with his tender grip. Her fingers brushed his hair from his forehead. His eyes closed as if her touch soothed him, but she knew it invariably caused him pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so angry,\" she whispered, brushing her lips over his brow, dying inside because she wished she could always be there to comfort him. She wanted that so much, she couldn\u0027t help but doubt her refusal to try... To take the risk...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was,\" he agreed, pulling her closer. \"For a moment, I regretted ever meeting you. It pissed me off to think that way. The years we were together were the happiest of my life. I would never change them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ve been so scared that you would regret it. That there was no way to avoid us falling apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers kneaded into her hips. \"I thought you grew out of being insecure about us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. The comment about the supermodel... it wasn\u0027t to say I was forgettable, just that first loves fade for most people.\" She wrinkled her nose at his arched brow. \"Well, they do. But really, I wasn\u0027t worried about you being the problem. I was worried about me. I was worried that I\u0027d screw it all up by being miserable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguel\u0027s head tilted to the side, his gaze narrowing. \"As if I would ever allow you to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at his arrogant assumption that nothing could go wrong if he said it couldn\u0027t. Placing her hand over his heart, she felt its strong and steady beat against her palm. A heart that beat for her alone, just as hers had been in his keeping for more than half her life. \"Do you know why I work at the shop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It supports your entire family and you\u0027re damned good at fixing cars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thank God, because I don\u0027t know how to do anything else. I\u0027m lucky that I enjoy it. I go to work every day knowing that my brothers are going to make me laugh, my mom is going to bring something delicious in for lunch, and I\u0027ll get to fuss over my dad. I honestly have no idea what I\u0027d do with myself if I didn\u0027t work, and I couldn\u0027t see how it would be possible for me to do so while you\u0027re making multimillion dollar deals. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d even enjoy wrenching if my family wasn\u0027t around while I did it. And part of the magic might be that I work on the cars of people I know and grew up around. I don\u0027t know. I just knew that imagining working in a cramped shop off a busy New York street with a bunch of guys I don\u0027t know and cars belonging to people I might not see again... it made me unhappy just thinking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand began to stroke up and down her back, gentling her, which made her realize she was trembling. \"I\u0027m listening.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/all-revved-up-dangerous-1/page-5.html","bookId":1920,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:01 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:01 AM"}
