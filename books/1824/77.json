Did you forget? How about I show you what I did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her again. She was ready to push harder this time. She absolutely was, until his mouth settled on top of hers. Then she was all in, her tongue rubbing against his, clinging to him while he robbed her of every thought but one. Lordy, did he know how to kiss! She was so swept away in the moment she didn\u0027t hear the door opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan called out to her, \"We\u0027ll take two cars. Alec will ride with Noah and me, and you can ride with-\" She stopped abruptly when she saw them. \"You two seem to be getting along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison could hear the laughter in her voice. Liam finally let go of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re blushing,\" he whispered, loud enough, she thought, for the neighbors to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like embarrassing me, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I kinda do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped away from him. \"Jordan, I should drive myself in case I get called in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you get called in, I\u0027ll drive you back,\" Liam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then her phone rang, and for the first time since she\u0027d started working for Agent Phillips, she hoped he was on the line. She knew she was acting like a wimp by trying to get out of spending the weekend with Liam, yet her reason made perfect sense to her. She was afraid of being alone with him. She was vulnerable with him, and she hated that feeling because she didn\u0027t know how to protect herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call was from Dan. \"Are you going to be available Monday evening around seven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I be?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You absolutely should be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away from Liam and walked to the side of the patio overlooking the garden while she waited for Dan to explain. He\u0027d sounded concerned and almost frazzled, which was totally out of character for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What has you so upset?\" she asked when he didn\u0027t immediately tell her what was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not upset. I\u0027m angry. Brett is doing a presentation of your program to potential buyers. There\u0027s a group of important company execs coming in, and Brett reserved one of the banquet rooms at the Adams Harbor Hotel. After the way you reacted at Basher\u0027s party, I\u0027m guessing he\u0027s keeping the time and place real hush-hush. He doesn\u0027t want you to find out until it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He came by the house, walked in like he owned the place, and asked if Mark or I had found his iPad. We told him no, and then he said he wanted to catch up. We knew he was up to something,\" he said, adding, \"He\u0027s such an ass. Anyway, he kept bringing the conversation back to you. Twice he asked where you were and what you were doing. Neither one of us answered the first time. Then Brett circled around to you again and said he wanted to talk to you and find out if you knew where his iPad was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you tell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lied and said you were in Seattle visiting your sister and wouldn\u0027t be back for two more weeks. He was out of there lickety-split. Looked relieved, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find out when this presentation is taking place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I said, I knew he was up to something, so I called a friend, and he called a friend who put some feelers out, and I finally got the information I was after. It\u0027s on Monday night at seven. Please tell me you\u0027re going to crash the party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"I wouldn\u0027t miss it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful. No telling what Brett\u0027s capable of. If he thinks this deal is worth millions, I\u0027ll bet he\u0027ll have a couple of bouncers with your photo standing at the doors. I\u0027d take some heat with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need an armed guard to crash the party,\" she protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know about that. Maybe take the armed FBI agent you\u0027ve been seeing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine on my own. Don\u0027t worry about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brett doesn\u0027t have any money. Someone has to be bankrolling him. The party is open bar with lots of food, and that hotel is expensive. I\u0027ll bet his money backer expects a big profit from the sale, too. Listen, I\u0027m reevaluating. Maybe you shouldn\u0027t go,\" he added worriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how about I go with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dan, if he sees you, I won\u0027t be able to sneak in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to be able to sneak in anyway,\" he argued. \"You\u0027re a knockout. Men are going to notice you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get in,\" she said, ignoring the comment about her appearance. \"And stop worrying. I can take care of myself.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-77.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
