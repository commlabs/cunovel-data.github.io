He re­ called someone saying that straight lines did not exist in nature. Here was the inversion. Infinitely unfolding intricacy, never fully straight, never simply curved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;The entirely artificial Mesh flowered in patterns one saw every­ where. In crackling electrical discharges, alive with writhing forks. In pale blue frost-flowers of crystal growth. In the bronchi of human lungs. In graphed market fluctuations. In whorls of streams, plunging ever forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Such harmony of large with small was beauty itself, even when processed by the skeptical eye of science.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;He felt Trantor’s Mesh. His chest was a map; Streeling Sector over his right nipple, Analytica over the left. Using neural plasticity, the primary sensory areas of his cortex “read” the Mesh through his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;But it was not like reading at all. No flat data here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Far better for a pan-derived species to take in the world through its evolved, whole neural bed! More fun, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Like the psychohistorical equations, the Mesh was N-dimensional. And even the number N changed with time, as parameters shifted in and out of application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;There was only one way to make sense of this in the narrow human sensorium. Every second, a fresh dimension sheared in over an older dimension. Freeze-framed, each instant looked like a ridicu­ lously complicated abstract sculpture running on overdrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Watch any one moment too hard and you got a lancing head­ ache, motion sickness, and zero understanding. Watch it like an entertainment, not an object of study—and in time came an exten­ ded perception, integrated by the long-suffering subconscious. In time…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Hari Seldon bestrode the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;The immediacy he had felt while being Ipan now returned—enhanced along perspectives he could not name. He tingled with total immersion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;He stamped and marched across the muddy field of chaotic Mesh interactions. His boot heels left deep scars. These healed immedi­ ately: subprograms at work, like cellular repair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;A landscape opened like the welcome of a mother’s lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Already he had used psychohistory to “postdict” pan tribal movements, behavior, outcomes. Hari had generalized this to the fitness/economic/ social topology of N-space landscapes. Now he applied it to the Mesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Fractal tentacles spread through the networks with blinding speed, penetrating. Trantor’s digital world yawned, a planetary spider-web…with something brooding and swollen at its center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Trantor’s electric jungle worked with prickly light below him. Somehow it was beneath the panoramas he traversed. From a dis­ tance the forty billion lives were like a carnival, neon-bright on the horizon, amid a black, cool desert: the colossal night of the Galaxy itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Hari strode across the tortured landscape of storm and ruin, to­ ward a colossal thunderhead. Two tiny humans stood below it. Hari stooped and picked them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“You took your time!” the little man called. “I waited less for the King of France.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Our deliverer! Did Saint Michael send you?” called the small Joan. “Oh, yes—do beware the clouds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“More’s to the point—here,” the man said/sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Hari stood frozen while an engorged chunk of data/learning/his-tory/wisdom seeped through him. Panting, he sped himself to his max. The glowering cumulus-creature, Joan and Voltaire—all now slow-stepped. He could see individual event-waves washing through their sims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;They were dispersed minds, hopping portions of themselves endlessly around Trantor. Clicking, clacking, zigzag computations. With the resources of a full brain running in a central location, his billions of microefficiencies added up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“You…know…Trantor…” Joan droned. “Use…that…against…them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;He blinked—and knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Streams of raw, squeezed recollection spun through him. Memories he could not claim but which instructed him instantly, reviewing all that had transpired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;His speed and supple grace felt wonderful. He was like an ice skater, zooming over the wrecked plain as the others lumbered like thick-headed beasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;And he saw why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Plaster holo screens against a mountain a full kilometer high, covering it until it glitters with a half million dan­ cing images. Each holo used a quarter of a million pixels to shape its image, so the array musters immense repres­ entational power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Now compress those screens on a sheet of aluminum foil a millimeter thick. Crumple it. Stuff it into a grapefruit. That is the brain, a hundred billion neurons firing at varying intensities. Nature had accomplished that miracle, and now machines labored to echo it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;The squirt of insight came to him directly from some hidden collaboration of himself with the Mesh. Information lashed up from dozens of libraries and merged with audible snaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;He knew and felt in the same instant of comprehension. Data as desire…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Staggering, he spun light-headed and faced the angry clouds. They pressed in like buzzing virulent bees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;He cast amazed eyes at the thunderhead, which lashed burnt-orange lightning at him, frying the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;The sting doubled him over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“That’s all…they can…do for…the moment,” the dwarf/Voltaire called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Seems…enough,” Hari gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Together…we…can…do…battle!” Joan shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Hari staggered. Convulsions wrenched his muscles. He devoted all his attention to mastering the shooting spasms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;This served to speed the sim-world relative to him. Voltaire spoke normally: “I suspect he came pursuing a spot of help himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“We fight the grand and holy battle here,” Joan insisted. “All else must give way—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Hari rasped, “Diplomacy…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Joan bridled. “Negotiate? What?

If I could but live my life over again, I would no doubt make the same mistakes—but sooner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Hari said, “If I knew what this storm wanted—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;[YOUR VARIETY OF VIVIFORM]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;[IS NOT OUR PRIMARY AIM]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“You certainly torture us enough!” Voltaire countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Hari took the tiny man in hand and lifted him.

He held Voltaire toward the sucking spout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;The cyclone battered them all with hammering grit. It yowled with banshee energy, so loud Hari had to shout. “You were the ‘apostle of reason’—to quote your own interior memories.
