I stretch my tongue as hard as I can, to reach the bottom of the bowl. The bowl is too deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab for the glass of tea and dump some in the bowl. I swirl it around and drink the last of the stew mixed with the tea. It makes me gag but I do it. I need the food. I drink the tea down and wipe my face off with my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy tattered and filthy t-shirt. The lock in the door turns. I turn my head like a feral cat. I scramble back to the corner. My old ways are all back. They were always there, hiding under the surface. I just never knew it. I never knew I could go back so easily. I\u0027m in dirty pants and a filthy shirt. I stink in ways I don’t remember being possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens. The blinding light is too much. I squint my eyes. The man walks in. I would know the slap of his shoes anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a deal to offer you today. One of you is going to be tortured. It’s a live feed for your friend, well benefactor. I suppose he never was your friend. Now Stuart, has had his fair share. He has volunteered everyday to spare your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat hurts me but only a little. My survival skills are something to be proud of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has been beaten, cut, flogged, whipped, burned and endured water torture. We are offering you the opportunity to take his place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis accent sounds like he should be offering me a picnic or reading a children\u0027s story. He should be saying happy jolly things to me. Instead, he is offering me the chance to save my friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t answer him. I watch his silhouette in the light of the doorframe. He turns and leaves the room. He\u0027s closing the door when I speak, \"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pokes his head back in, \"You will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snaps his fingers, \"Clean her up. I want to see her skin blush when I strike it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m about to change my mind when men come barreling into the room. I fight instantly. There is no point. I won\u0027t win. But I fight anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drag me out into the white hallway. It\u0027s stark and bright. I\u0027m carried down it. My feet drag. They can\u0027t walk. I didn’t have much fight in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m shoved into a room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl with dark hair and pretty grey eyes is waiting for me there. The men leave me in a heap on the floor. I realize how disgusting and filthy I am when I see how clean she is. She wears a long white dress. It\u0027s weird. Like she is an angel. She smiles. Her teeth are bright white against her dark-red lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello.\" She says softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes my dirty brown hand and lifts me off the ground. I stand on wobbly legs and let her pull me to a huge steal tub. Steam lifts off of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls my shirt off and tosses it in the bin. I can see myself in the mirror. I\u0027ve never looked more like the dead girl from the house. Not ever. She pulls my pants down. I should gasp and grab them. I should leap away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m too exhausted and sickly. I do nothing. I let her pull me into the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water burns my skin it\u0027s so hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re cold. It\u0027s not that hot.\" She says when she sees me flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step in, wincing and sucking air. My skin burns but my legs collapse into the tub. I sit as she washes me. It\u0027s the most frightening and yet amazing feeling I\u0027ve ever had. She washes my hair, scrubbing my scalp. She pours buckets of the hot water over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA disgusting film starts to sit on the water. She lifts me out and grabs a shower nozzle. She sprays me down. My hands cover my breasts and I cross my legs hard. I can see my nakedness in the mirror. I look weak and hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls me out and wraps me in a huge robe. It\u0027s soft and fluffy. She takes my hand and leads me down a different long white hallway. It\u0027s freaking me out. The hallways are baffling. But it feels like that is the point. I\u0027m completely disoriented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe floors are dark slate and the walls are bright white. She holds my hand tightly and drags me down the long wide hallway to a huge dark-brown door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance out the windows and wonder if I\u0027m still in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this Boston?\" I ask in a dead voice. The windows are glazed in a way that makes them blurry. I can\u0027t see anything out of them, but the bright-light can get in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignores me and pulls me though the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inside of the room is large and warm. There is a fireplace and rugs in the middle of several couches and chairs. The floor is wood and warmer than the slate. The walls are pale-blush colored. It suits the furniture. There is a bed at the back of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a massive canopy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach twists when I see the Australian man is sitting in a chair. He grins and my heart beats wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe curtsies and leaves the room, closing the door and clicking a lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes are wide. I\u0027m clutching the robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t stand. He smiles. His dark-grey pants and pale-blue dress shirt look almost exactly the same as they did the night in the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles and flashes the dimple on his one cheek. His dark hair is in the same faux hawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heartbeat picks up. The room is completely silent except for the dripping of my wet hair on the wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go sit by the fire, warm up.\" He points. His Australian accent is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he even the same guy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I hallucinating?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go.\" He demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet back up, not turning my back on him. He doesn’t move from the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sits so relaxed, it\u0027s almost cocky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to the fire.\" His tone lowers menacingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach twists more. I step back again. I walk around the couch opposite him and drop to my knees slowly. Thankfully there is a fluffy rug in front. I sit there quietly. I don’t know what to say or do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watches me. His grin is sick and twisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything you want to talk about?\" He asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow, \"He will come for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins, \"I\u0027m counting on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have business. Is it warm enough in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and look down at the rug. His cold icy stare is freaking me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you from Australia?\" I ask still looking at the thick fluffy rug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I didn’t want you getting your hopes up if you recognized me. I\u0027m good at accents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s why you asked me to dance in the bar?\" That at least made sense. I never could figure out why a sexy well-dressed man would ask me to dance. At least not whilst wearing my running watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to see if you were the mess the files said you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiles? I glance up at him, confused. I smile, it’s a sickened bitter smile. \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t move. He doesn’t talk. My back starts burning from the heat of the fire. I take a deep inhale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a second offer.\" His voice is honey sweet. I shiver, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins, \"You don’t want to hear it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and clutch the robe. I\u0027m feeling exhausted. The fire is relaxing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be willing to forgo the beating if you were nice to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gag. I shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d rather be beaten? Am I so repulsive?\" I gag again. I swallow it down. The stew was the worst meal yet and the fire is so relaxing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see his plan. Gross me out and make me feel sick but relax me into submission with the fire. Unfortunately, it\u0027s working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would still rather have a beating, than have Stuart beaten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands and puts a hand out, \"Okay then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at him. I don’t mean to turn it on, my eyes naturally do it. He shakes his head, \"Those long lashes and pretty blue eyes won\u0027t work on me. Come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow and hesitate. \"I\u0027m not coming with you. You\u0027re going to beat me either way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"I am. But it will be much easier if you just come willingly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look into his icy-blue eyes for the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push myself up and walk on shaky legs to him. I stand close to him. He jerks his hand, insisting I take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my hand into the air and drop it into his. He closes his around mine gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerror isn’t the right world. Paralyzing fright isn’t either. I don’t know that a word exists to describe it. He pulls me along to the bed. He\u0027s gentle. My heels start to dig in and his grip tightens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No. No. No. No. No.\" I chant and pull back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops and looks at me like I\u0027m a child, \"It will be much worse if I have to drag you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sob. There are no tears. He pulls me along. He stops moving when he\u0027s along side the huge bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushes me down on it. \"Remove the robe and scoot down to the bottom. Hang your feet down the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the floor. My body is convulsing in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your name?\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it matter?\" He sounds dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod once, \"Yes. I need a name to hate you properly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just call me Eli.\" His name makes me twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let the robe slip from my shoulders. I lie back and swallow hard again. The bed is soft and luxurious. The black blankets are soft and velvety against my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes feel like there is sand in them. I wish I could cry. I wiggle so my feet hang off the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare up into the canopy. It\u0027s dark like the bedding, so I pretend it\u0027s the night sky when I feel his hands touching my feet. He moves them over my feet and ankles softly, like he\u0027s letting me get used to his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a soft jerk he pulls me down the end of the mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoes slap against the floor when he walks around the room. I don’t see his hands near my face when he puts the blindfold over my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heat from his face and hands make goose bumps along my body. I grip the bedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands touch me again when he slides something down onto my legs. I can\u0027t move them. My feet are forced to flex out the bottoms. Something is hooked around my toes. I can\u0027t move the at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t want to mar that skin. Not yet. I\u0027m going to start the film now. Please feel free to be extra loud. It\u0027s better for the footage.\" My stomach is in agony. I\u0027m desperately gripping the bed. I want to cry out before he\u0027s even done anything. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-16.html","bookId":1888,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM"}
