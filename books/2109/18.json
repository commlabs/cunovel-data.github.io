When it had ended, a tiny pool of water lay at the base of the intact defensive field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWide-eyed, the frightened wizard began another spell, as did Cadderly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBogo pulled another component and began a fast-paced chant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sneeze,\" Cadderly commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBogo complied, and his spell was disrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stubborn wizard growled and began again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sneeze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you!\" Bogo cried, wiping the wetness from his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could not be farther from the truth,\" Cadderly replied calmly. \"Shall we continue to play the game?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dispel!\" Cadderly cried suddenly, his face twisting to an angry glare. The shimmering field in the doorway disappeared, and Danica and Pikel burst into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBogo realized his mistake; he should have continued to \"play\" as the young priest had called it, continued to force Cadderly into a defensive posture in the hopes that his spell repertoire would outlast the priest\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica came straight ahead, dove, came up in a leap, and jolted forward with her landing, too fast for the surprised Bogo to react. He threw his arms out defensively, and the monk promptly wrapped them, bringing her arms up through the wizard\u0027s, then down and around, locking Bogo fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did twist one wrist, though, cutting a line of blood on Danica\u0027s sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn invisible dagger!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica\u0027s foot shot up between her and the close wizard, crunching Bogo\u0027s nose. Dazed, Bogo offered no resistance as Danica released his other arm, cupped her free hand over the back of his clenched fingers and yanked his hand back toward his forearm, pulling his arm in the other direction at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard\u0027s face contorted in agony. He tried to hold his only weapon, but Danica\u0027s foot came up again; her hand continued to pull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel joined her a moment later. \"Oo,\" he said glumly, disappointed that the fun was already over. He heard the clang as the unseen dagger hit the floor, and he looked down for it, scratching his green-dyed hair curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly walked to the bed and motioned for Danica to lead her prisoner to it. \"You can let him go,\" the young priest offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica gave a quick, painful jerk as she released Bogo\u0027s arms, and she pushed the wizard, knocking him to a sitting position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vft must talk, you and I,\" Cadderly demanded quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBogo glared up at him from the bed, an impotent threat, but Danica cuffed him anyway, on the ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowled and showed Cadderly her cut arm in answer to his surprised expression, and that seemed to satisfy the young priest\u0027s nagging conscience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dorigen sent you,\" Cadderly said to the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly looked at him curiously. \"I have ways of telling when you lie,\" he warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you detect nothing,\" Bogo replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were with the Night Masks, but you are not a part of their guild,\" Cadderiy remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will die,\" Bogo promised, drawing another cuff from Danica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why have they come for me?\" Cadderiy asked. With no answer forthcoming, he added, \"I could speak with your corpse, if that would please you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, Bogo seemed afraid. The sincere calmness of Cadderly\u0027s tone gave weight to the threat, the promise, Bogo knew and, because he wanted to grow to be an old wizard, he replied. \"You got in the way,\" the young wizard stammered, \"at the library and in the forest. You forced Abal - \" Bogo stopped abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" Danica demanded, putting her face right up to Bogo\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aballister,\" Bogo admitted, \"Dorigen\u0027s mentor, my mentor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly looked to Danica, concerned. Dorigen had been a powerful adversary. How strong might her mentor be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came only to observe,\" Bogo went on, \"as I was told.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" Pikel cut him short, stepping past Danica, pushing her aside, and displaying the scorched hole in his leather tunic, the hole Bogo\u0027s lightning had made back at the Dragon\u0027s Codpiece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood drained from Bogo\u0027s face, and his growing desperation forced him to a desperate act. He shoved his hand into a pocket, grabbed a handful of pebbles, and flung them to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burst of minor explosions went off, blowing in rapid succession and shooting variously colored puffs of smoke into the air. The pops did nothing to the companions, other than distract them. With a quick chant, Bogo diminished to the size of a cat and slipped between Cadderly and Pikel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly tried to call out but could not decide fast enough whether he should shout for his Mends to stop Bogo or cry out a warning to the wizard. Danica finally pushed past him and Pikel, following the wizard\u0027s expected path to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard the door close - the smoke began to clear -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and Bogo, outside the room and man-sized again, began a new chant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica stopped, wisely not going through the portal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind the door they heard Bogo cry out in terror. The friends heard a shuffle of feet, a sickening thud, then something heavy slammed against the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly shook his head and looked away. The tip of Ivan\u0027s double-headed axe protruded through the door, dripping crimson. As if that weren\u0027t macabre enough, Bogo\u0027s fingers, grasping helplessly and twitching, reached through the circular hole Pikel\u0027s club had made in the door. Pulled by the unbalancing weight, the door slowly creaked open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel walked past Danica and opened the door the rest of the way, peeking around it and saying, \"Oo\" as he regarded the hanging wizard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I telled ye ye couldn\u0027t trust a wizard,\" Ivan, standing a dozen feet down the hall with his hands on his hips, asserted. He strode up to the door and motioned for the group to come out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young priest couldn\u0027t help but look over at the dead young wizard, a man probably not even as old as Cadderly. \"Wfe never asked his name,\" Cadderly remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan kicked the door closed, spat in his hands, and put one boot up beside Bogo for leverage. \"Wandering what to put on his stone?\" he asked gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica watched the young priest closely, looking for any signs of weakness. This time, though, Cadderly appeared to control his emotions and accept the guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just wondering,\" he answered Ivan, giving a resigned shrug as though he had pushed the incident from his mind. \"Get the body back in the room,\" Cadderly instructed the dwarves. He shook his head at the irony of one of his earlier statements, which he had made merely to scare his prisoner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could indeed speak with Bogo\u0027s corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only the lake and the empty street. Carra-doon quieted considerably as twilight neared, and the interest in the outrageous events at the Dragon\u0027s Codpiece had dissipated quickly. Only a few guests had remained at the battered inn, and with Cadderly and his companions out of the building, the place was quiet - too quiet for Kierkan Rufo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe angular man stood in front of his room\u0027s small window, the tilt of his stance making him appear almost like a diagonal crosspiece to the glass. Many minutes passed; Rufo did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had gone too far this time, he realized, had crossed the line to the dark side of his nature. He doubted he could ever step back. He stood in reflection now, trying to follow the course that had led to this horrible position. It had begun in the library, when he had met evil Barjin and, on the priest\u0027s command, had sent Cadderly tumbling down the stairs to the hidden catacombs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRufo could excuse himself of that indiscretion, and all of the other members of his order, including Cadderly, had excused him as well. In the elven forest, Rufo had betrayed his companions once more, but he had redeemed himself, had come through in the end to provide his companions with the information they needed to ultimately win out. As in the library, the efforts of Cadderly and the others had averted disaster, had helped to cover Rufo\u0027s weaknesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Avery lay dead downstairs. Rufo had put the headmaster in the path of an assassin band. Rufo had stepped over, had crossed the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to justify his actions, told himself repeatedly that he had been given no choice, that the assassins would have killed them all if he had not cooperated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe facts did not support his excuse. Cadderly, Danica, and the dwarves (where had those two come from, anyway?) had won, had chased off the band. If Rufo had gone to them soon after his initial meeting with the young wizard, their victory would have been more swift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery would be alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe angular man whimpered and turned from the window, suddenly feeling very vulnerable. \"He deserved his fate,\" Rufo muttered grimly, reminding himself of the way Avery had treated him since the trouble in Shilmista. Avery would have held him back in his ascension through the Order of Deneir; the headmaster had even threatened to have him removed from the library! That was not justice, Rufo\u0027s sensibilities argued, not when the headmaster held all the power and Rufo could only stand and let Avery\u0027s whims determine his fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Rufo had crossed the small room and collected his pack, anger had replaced his guilt. He had struck back at Avery in the only way he could, and now it was done. No one suspected him; the conspiring wizard had already fled, and Rufo had easily deflected the city guards\u0027 questions. Even more comforting, Cadderly apparently had taken the guards\u0027 conclusions for truth, for the priest hadn\u0027t asked Rufo a single question concerning the tragic events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRufo had to hide his smile as he paid Fredegar (from Avery\u0027s purse) for the time spent in the inn. He explained to the hospitable innkeeper that he had to return at once to the Edificant Library and report the tragic loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was getting dark outside when he exited the Dragon\u0027s Codpiece, dark like the path Kierkan Rufo had stumbled down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four friends left the other inn a short while later, Cadderly tossing the fearful innkeeper a bag of coins to cover the damages and the cost of disposing of Bogo\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do we go?\" Ivan asked, impatient, now that he knew where other enemies might be, to get on with the fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to the Dragon\u0027s Codpiece,\" Cadderly replied evenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do when we get there?\" Ivan said, not sounding happy about the choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wait,\" Cadderly answered, trying to calm the volatile dwarf. \"We have struck hard this day and this night. All of us need some rest.\" Cadderly believed the words; his extensive use of magic had drained him, and he wanted nothing more than to spend the next hours in peace. After what he had learned from Bogo\u0027s spirit, though, the young priest wasn\u0027t confident he would get his wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was chill outside as the night grew dark and the first stars made their appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly knew it would be a long night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel Bait\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadderly paid his friends\u0027 banter little heed. He sat by his small table, beside the Tome of Uni-versa/ Harmony, pushing the pieces of this mental puzzle closer together, seeking infor-mation from every memory he could summon. His contemplations were not purely for reasons of information gathering, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly lingered on the image, the sensation, of Avery\u0027s spirit, on the divine joy he knew the dead headmaster had found. The young priest\u0027s doubts, which had followed him through all of his spiritually bereft life, could not penetrate the holy barrier of that sensation. Cadderly\u0027s logic, founded in information he could see and test with his own senses, seemed ridiculous when compared with the perceived smile of Avery\u0027s ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe foundation of Cadderly\u0027s existence had been violently shaken, and yet, the young priest felt no remorse and no sense of loss. Quite the opposite, the mystery of it all gave Cadderly a sense of hope beyond anything he had known. Rather than deny what he had felt, the young priest would simply have to expand his foundation to include these wonderful new revelations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly\u0027s unconscious chuckle turned Danica and Ivan, who sat on the bed, toward him, and their stares, in turn, awakened the young priest from his musing. Cadderly shrugged, not knowing how to begin to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peoples,\" Ivan grumbled, but Danica nodded to the young priest, as though she understood the resolutions Cadderly was finding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Danica, Cadderly thought, and he did not doubt she knew, or that she approved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel crept along the first floor of the Dragon\u0027s Codpiece, slipping in and out of the shadows in search of the cupboards. It was late, and the dwarf was hungry, having missed three out of four meals during the course of the exhausting day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hee hee hee,\" the dwarf tittered when he found biscuits and sweet dough. He dropped the amulet Cadderly had given him into a pocket and rubbed his plump hands together briskly, his cherubic dimples revealing his glee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf sported an armload of food as he ascended the makeshift stairway to the second level, each step on the stairs that he and Ivan had put back together helping him to justify his filching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile disappeared before he got back to Cadderly\u0027s room, though, and, as a puny human approached him a moment later, half a biscuit fell out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica and Ivan struggled on the bed, the young woman proving, to Ivan\u0027s disbelief, that her concentration could prevent Ivan from taking her hand down in wrist wrestling. The mighty dwarf, his bright red face framed by his yellow beard, pushed and yanked vigorously to the side, but the woman\u0027s arm, tiny compared to Ivan\u0027s gnarly and corded muscles, did not budge an inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have met your better,\" Cadderly remarked to Ivan, which only set the dwarf into a deeper frenzy. He hopped up on his toes and pushed with all his strength, moving the bed several inches, but Danica\u0027s position remained unchanged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden and somewhat loud scrape of the bed set off silent alarms within Cadderly. The young priest had made no secret of the fact that he and his friends were back at the inn, but he didn\u0027t want to give his potential enemies too much information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet!\" he whispered harshly, and, remembering Pikel, he closed his eyes and sent his thoughts to the missing dwarf. He expected to find the same sensations - hunger mostly - waiting for him, but when Cadderly made contact, through the power of the telepathy-enhancing amulet, his eyes popped wide open. The sensations were vague, as expected, but instead of distant thoughts of muffins and ale, Cadderly visualized hunched black shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not Pikel on the other end! Images of dead Bren-nan, and of poor Nameless, filtered through Cadderly\u0027s rising sense of panic. The young priest abruptly broke contact and jumped from his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get ye yet!\" Ivan snarled at Danica, oblivious to Cadderly\u0027s alarm. Danica, though, facing Cadderly\u0027s way, did not miss his actions. Ivan tugged her arm to the bed as she came from her meditative state, the dwarf growling victoriously until he noticed that Danica was paying him no heed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica scrambled over the bed, past Ivan. The dwarf turned about to see her and Cadderly exit the room, and realized then that the trouble likely involved his absent brother. Not pausing even long enough to locate his axe, Ivan half-crawled, half-ran out the door in pursuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Pikel had never felt so weak! He stared dumb-foundedly at himself, or at his body at least, or at whatever this monster was that had stolen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding the weakling body by the throat in one hand, Ghost heard the rumble down the hall and realized that Pi-kel\u0027s friends would soon be on him. The thought brought an evil chuckle to his dwarven lips. He slapped aside Pikel\u0027s skinny arm and reached into one of his pockets, producing a small packet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooo,\" Pikel wailed, and he nearly swooned, thinking the item to be some horrible magical thing and suspecting that his life was at its end, as Ghost brought the packet up between them. But Ghost broke the packet over himself, over the dwarvish trappings, instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh?\" Pikel queried, for the imposter dwarfs face was covered in blood, blood from the packet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one arm Ghost lifted the puny form from the ground and hurled Pikel across the room, where he slammed into a wall and slumped to the floor. ,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost, too, fell back, leaning heavily on the wall perpendicular to the door, and groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnraged Ivan grabbed both Cadderly and Danica by the backs of their tunics and hurled himself past them as soon as he discerned where Cadderly was leading them. The dwarf, without his deer-antlered helmet, hit the door headfirst, bursting into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaggering, Pikel lifted a shaking finger and pointed accusingly across the room, to the slender human form crawling about the base of the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me brother!\" Ivan roared, and he charged across, hands leading to throttle the weakling killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica, too, followed the imposter dwarfs trembling finger, but Cadderly came into the room more slowly, warily, paying full attention to the apparently wounded dwarf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had brought the song of Deneir into his thoughts. He saw the shadows crouched on Pikel\u0027s - on the imposter\u0027s! - shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ivan!\" he cried, and, trusting in the song, he whipped his adamantite spindle-disks straight into the dwarfs face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf flew back against the wall; real blood mingled with the fake on the green-dyed beard. \"Oooo,\" he moaned. Across the room, Ivan let go of the weakling and came rushing back to throttle the new target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly hadn\u0027t released the dwarf from his knowing gaze. He watched the shadows break apart, then melt down into Pikel\u0027s shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan caught his brother in both hands and hoisted him off the floor, slamming him against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooo,\" Pikel moaned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold, Ivan,\" Cadderly said calmly. \"Pikel is back where he belongs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly nodded to Danica, and she turned about to face the assassin again, ready to spring at him in an instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have nowhere to run,\" Cadderly said to Ghost. He walked up to join Danica. \"I know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t have made the damn disks so fine,\" Cadderly heard Ivan say behind him, to Pikel\u0027s continuing groans. The young priest looked back briefly to see Ivan tending Pikel\u0027s bloodied face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he turned back, the shadows were gone from the puny assassin\u0027s shoulders. Cadderly\u0027s gaze darted all about the room, fearing that the man had stolen one of his friends\u0027 identities once again. His three companions appeared the same to him, though, looking to him for direction and with confusion now, apparently recognizing the young priest\u0027s sudden distress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" Cadderly muttered under his breath when he turned back to the weakling man. He let the song of Deneir sound louder in his mind, studied the aurora of this new identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a cold wind, pictured a rocky, forlorn shore backed by towering mountains. Huge ice floes dotted the bay, waves breaking against their invulnerable sides, and a giant ship sat quiet in the calmer waters near the shore, awaiting the mighty arms that could pull its monstrous oars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly looked into the weakling man\u0027s face and saw true fear and unexpected resignation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica sensed that the puny man was about to dart for the door, and she tensed for a spring to intercept him.
