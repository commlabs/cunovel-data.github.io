Holden hated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love this place,\" Amos said, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden pushed his way through a knot of drunk middle-aged gamblers, who were laughing and yelling, to a small open space near a row of pay-by-the-minute wall terminals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amos,\" he said, \"we\u0027ll be going to a less touristy level, so watch our backs. The flophouse we\u0027re looking for is in a rough neighborhood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmos nodded. \"Gotcha, Cap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Naomi, Alex, and Amos blocked him from view, Holden reached behind his back to adjust the pistol that pulled uncomfortably on his waistband. The cops on Eros were pretty uptight about people walking around with guns, but there was no way he was going to \"Lionel Polanski\" unarmed. Amos and Alex were both carrying too, though Amos kept his in the right pocket of his jacket and his hand never left it. Only Naomi flatly refused to carry a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden led the group toward the nearest escalators, with Amos, casting the occasional glance behind, in the rear. The casinos of Eros stretched for three seemingly endless levels, and even though they moved as quickly as possible, it took half an hour to get away from the noise and crowds. The first level above was a residential neighborhood and disorientingly quiet and neat after the casino\u0027s chaos and noise. Holden sat down on the edge of a planter with a nice array of ferns in it and caught his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m with you, Captain. Five minutes in that place gives me a headache,\" Naomi said, and sat down next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kidding me?\" Amos said. \"I wish we had more time. Alex and I took almost a grand off those fish at the Tycho card tables. We\u0027d probably walk out of here fucking millionaires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know it,\" Alex said, and punched the big mechanic on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if this Polanski thing turns out to be nothing, you have my permission to go make us a million dollars at the card tables. I\u0027ll wait for you on the ship,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tube system ended at the first casino level and didn\u0027t start again until the level they were on. You could choose not to spend your money at the tables, but they made sure you were punished for doing so. Once the crew had climbed into a car and started the ride to Lionel\u0027s hotel, Amos sat down next to Holden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody\u0027s following us, Cap,\" he said conversationally. \"Wasn\u0027t sure till he climbed on a couple cars down. Behind us all through the casinos too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden sighed and put his face in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, what\u0027s he look like?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belter. Fifties, or maybe forties with a lot mileage. White shirt and dark pants. Goofy hat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah. But no holster I can see,\" Amos said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Keep an eye on him, but no need to get too worried. Nothing we\u0027re doing here is illegal,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, other than arriving in our stolen Martian warship, sir?\" Naomi asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean our perfectly legitimate gas freighter that all the paperwork and registry data says is perfectly legitimate?\" Holden replied with a thin smile. \"Yeah, well, if they\u0027d seen through that, they would have stopped us at the dock, not followed us around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn advertising screen on the wall displayed a stunning view of multicolored clouds rippling with flashes of lightning, and encouraged Holden to take a trip to the amazing dome resorts on Titan. He\u0027d never been to Titan. Suddenly he wanted to go there very much. A few weeks of sleeping late, eating in fine restaurants, and lying on a hammock, watching Titan\u0027s colorful atmosphere storm above him sounded like heaven. Hell, as long as he was fantasizing, he threw in Naomi walking over to his hammock with a couple of fruity-looking drinks in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ruined it by talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is our stop,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amos, watch our friend, see if he gets off the train with us,\" Holden said as he got up and headed to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they got off and walked a dozen steps down the corridor, Amos whispered, \"Yep,\" at his back. Shit. Well, definitely a tail, but there wasn\u0027t really any reason not to go ahead and check up on Lionel. Fred hadn\u0027t asked them to do anything with whoever was pretending to be the Scopuli\u0027s owner. They couldn\u0027t very well be arrested for knocking on a door. Holden whistled a loud and jaunty tune as he walked, to let his crew and whoever was following them know he wasn\u0027t worried about a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped when he saw the flophouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dark and dingy and exactly the sort of place where people got mugged or worse. Broken lights created dark corners, and there wasn\u0027t a tourist in sight. He turned to give Alex and Amos meaningful looks, and Amos shifted his hand in his pocket. Alex reached under his coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lobby was mostly empty space, with a pair of couches at one end next to a table covered with magazines. A sleepy-looking older woman sat reading one. Elevators were recessed into the wall at the far end, next to a door marked STAIRS. In the middle was the check-in desk, where, in lieu of a human clerk, a touch screen terminal let guests pay for their rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden stopped next to the desk and turned around to look at the woman sitting on the couch. Graying hair, but good features and an athletic build. In a flophouse like this, that probably meant a prostitute reaching the end of her shelf life. She pointedly ignored his stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is our tail still with us?\" Holden asked in a quiet voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stopped outside somewhere. Probably just watching the door now,\" Amos replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden nodded and hit the inquiry button on the check-in screen. A simple menu would let him send a message to Lionel Polanski\u0027s room, but Holden exited the system. They knew Lionel was still checked in, and Fred had given them the room number. If it was someone playing games, no reason to give him a heads-up before Holden knocked on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, he\u0027s still here, so let\u0027s - \" Holden said, and then stopped when he saw the woman from the couch standing right behind Alex. He hadn\u0027t heard or seen her approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to come with me,\" she said in a hard voice. \"Walk to the stairwell slowly, stay at least three meters ahead of me the entire time. Do it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a cop?\" Holden asked, not moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the person with the gun,\" she said, a small weapon appearing like magic in her right hand. She pointed it at Alex\u0027s head. \"So do what I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer weapon was small and plastic and had some kind of battery pack. Amos pulled his heavy slug thrower out and aimed it at her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine\u0027s bigger,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amos, don\u0027t - \" was all Naomi had time to say before the stairwell door burst open and half a dozen men and women armed with compact automatic weapons came into the room, yelling at them to drop their guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden started to put his hands up when one of them opened fire, the weapon coughing out rounds so fast it sounded like someone ripping construction paper; it was impossible to hear the separate shots. Amos threw himself to the floor. A line of bullet holes stitched across the chest of the woman with the taser, and she fell backward with a soft, final sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden grabbed Naomi by one hand and dragged her behind the check-in desk. Someone in the other group was yelling, \"Cease fire! Cease fire!\" but Amos was already shooting back from his position, prone on the floor. A yelp of pain and a curse told Holden he\u0027d probably hit someone. Amos rolled sideways to the desk, just in time to avoid a hail of slugs that tore up the floor and wall and made the desk shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden reached for his gun, but the front sight caught in his waistband. He yanked it out, tearing his underwear, then crawled on his knees to the edge of the desk and looked out. Alex was lying on the floor on the other side of one of the couches, gun drawn and face white. As Holden looked, a burst of gunfire hit the couch, blowing stuffing into the air and making a line of holes in the back of the couch not more than twenty centimeters above Alex\u0027s head. The pilot reached his pistol around the corner of the couch and blindly fired off half a dozen shots, yelling at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fucking assholes!\" Amos yelled, then rolled out and fired a couple more shots and rolled back before the return fire started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they?\" Holden yelled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two are down, the rest in the stairwell!\" Amos yelled back over the sound of return fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of nowhere a burst of rounds bounced off the floor past Holden\u0027s knee. \"Shit, someone\u0027s flanking us!\" Amos cried out, then moved farther behind the desk and away from the shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden crawled to the other side of the desk and peeked out. Someone was moving low and fast toward the hotel entrance. Holden leaned out and took a couple shots at him, but three guns opened up from the stairwell doorway and forced him back behind the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, someone\u0027s moving to the entrance!\" Holden screamed at the top of his lungs, hoping the pilot might be able to get off a shot before they were all chopped to pieces by crossfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pistol barked three times by the entrance. Holden risked a look. Their tail with the goofy hat crouched by the door, a gun in his hand, the machine gun - toting flanker lying still at his feet. Instead of looking at them, the tail was pointing his gun toward the stairwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one shoot the guy with the hat!\" Holden yelled, then moved back to the edge of the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmos put his back to the desk and popped the magazine from his gun. As he fumbled around in his pocket for another, he said, \"Guy is probably a cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Extra especially do not shoot any cops,\" Holden said, then fired a few shots at the stairwell door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi, who\u0027d spent the entire gunfight so far on the floor with her arms over her head, said, \"They might all be cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden squeezed off a few more shots and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cops don\u0027t carry small, easily concealable machine guns and ambush people from stairwells. We call those death squads,\" he said, though most of his words were drowned out by a barrage of gunfire from the stairwell. Afterward came a few seconds of silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden leaned back out in time to see the door swing shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they\u0027re bugging out,\" he said, keeping his gun trained on the door anyway. \"Must have another exit somewhere. Amos, keep your eye on that door. If it opens, start shooting.\" He patted Naomi on the shoulder. \"Stay down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden rose from behind the now ruined check-in kiosk. The desk facade had splintered and the underlying stone showed through. Holden held his gun barrel-up, his hands open. The man in the hat stood, considering the corpse at his feet, then looked up as Holden came near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. My name is Jim Holden. You are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man didn\u0027t speak for a second. When he did, his voice was calm. Almost weary. \"Cops will be here soon. I need to make a call or we\u0027re all going to jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you the cops?\" Holden asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other man laughed; it was a bitter, short sound, but with some real humor behind it. Apparently Holden had said something funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Name\u0027s Miller.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-wakes-expanse-1/page-24.html","bookId":2454,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM"}
