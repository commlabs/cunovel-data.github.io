I\u0027ve been so long without human company, storing up so much conversation for lack of anyone to speak to, that now that I have—someone to speak to, I mean—I cannot seem to stop. There were two pigeons who used to land on the window of my bedchamber at Glencarin, and we three conversed, though of course, pigeons have little to say—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this, the most ominous time of her life, Jenny\u0027s shoulders began to .shake with helpless laughter, and she wrapped her arms around the startled little woman, while mirth exploded from her chest and tears of fear and exhaustion filled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor child,\" Aunt Elinor said, patting Jennifer\u0027s back. \"You are under such strain and I\u0027m but adding to it. Now then,\" she paused, thinking, \"your papa told me at supper tonight that I should not plan on accompanying you after all, but that I could stay to see you married if I wished.\" Her arms fell from Jennifer and she slumped dejectedly onto the bed, her elderly, sweet face filled with appeal. \"I would do anything not to go back to Glencarin. It\u0027s so very lonely, you see.\" Nodding, Jenny laid her hand atop her aunt\u0027s snowy hair and gently soothed the shining crown, remembering years past when her aunt had run her own huge household with bustling efficiency. It was grossly unjust that enforced solitude combined with advancing years had wrought such a change in the courageous woman. \"I will appeal to him on the morrow to change his mind,\" she said with weary determination. Her emotions were battered from the long, trying day, and exhaustion was beginning to sweep over her in heavy, crushing waves. \"Once he understands how much I want you with me,\" she said with a sigh, suddenly yearning for the comfort of her narrow cot, \"he\u0027ll surely relent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Sixteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly every foot of floor space, from the great hall to the kitchens, was covered with sleeping guests and exhausted servants, lying upon whatever they had, or could find, to cushion the hard stones. A chorus of snores rose and fell discordantly throughout the castle, clashing and ebbing like confused, tumultuous waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnaccustomed to the peculiar sounds that disrupted the dark, moonless night, Jenny stirred fitfully in her sleep, then turned her face on the pillow and opened her eyes, startled into a somnambulant wakefulness by some unknown noise or movement in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart racing in confused fright, she blinked, trying to calm her rapid pulse and peer through the inky darkness of her bedchamber. On the low pallet beside Jenny\u0027s narrow bed, her aunt turned over. Aunt Elinor, Jenny realized with relief—no doubt Aunt Elinor\u0027s movements had awakened her. The poor thing suffered quite often from a stiffness in her joints that made sleeping on a hard pallet preferable to a soft bed, and even then she tossed and turned seeking comfort. Jenny\u0027s pulse returned to normal, she rolled onto her back, shivering from a sudden cold blast of air… A scream tore from her chest at the same instant a large hand clamped over her mouth, throttling it. While Jenny stared in paralyzed terror at the dark face only inches above her own, Royce Westmoreland whispered, \"If you cry out, I\u0027ll knock you senseless.\" He paused, waiting for Jennifer to recover her wits. \"Do you understand me?\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny hesitated, swallowed, then nodded jerkily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case,\" he began, loosening his grip very slightly. The moment he did, Jennifer sank her teeth into the fleshy part of his palm and flung herself to the left, trying to gain the window and shout to the guards in the bailey below. He grabbed her before her feet left the bed and threw her onto her back, his wounded hand clamping down on her nose and mouth so tightly that she couldn\u0027t breath. \"That\u0027s the second time you\u0027ve drawn my blood,\" he bit out between his teeth, his eyes alive with fury. \"And \u0027twill be the last\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s going to suffocate me! Jenny thought wildly. She shook her head frantically, her eyes wide, her chest straining, heaving for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s better,\" he jeered, softly. \" \u0027Tis wise for you to learn to fear me. Now listen to me very carefully, Countess,\" he continued, ignoring her terrified struggles. \"One way or another, I\u0027m going to lower you out that window over there. If you give me one more instant of trouble, you\u0027ll be unconscious when I do it, which greatly reduces your chances of reaching the ground alive, since you won\u0027t be able to hang on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lightened the pressure of his hand just enough for her to drag air into her lungs, but even when she\u0027d gulped down several heaving breaths, Jenny could not stop trembling. \"The window!\" she mumbled against his muffling hand. \"Are you mad? It\u0027s more than eighty feet above the moat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring that, he fired his most deadly weapon, the threat guaranteed to demolish her resistance. \"Arik is holding your sister prisoner, not to be released until I give the signal. If you do anything to prevent me signaling him, I wouldn\u0027t like to think what he might do to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat little fight Jenny had left within her drained away. This was like reliving a nightmare, and trying to escape it was pointless. Tomorrow she\u0027d have been wed to the devil anyway, so what difference was one more night in what was bound to be years of misery and confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your hand away,\" she said wearily. \"I won\u0027t cry out. You can trust—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last sentence was a mistake; she knew it the instant the words escaped her lips and she saw his face tighten with furious contempt. \"Get up!\" he snapped, jerking her out of bed. Reaching out into the darkness, he snatched up the velvet wedding gown lying across a trunk at the foot of her bed and thrust it into her arms. Clutching the gown to her bosom, Jenny said shakily, \"Turn your back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I fetch you a dagger to use as well?\" he jeered icily, and before she could reply, he snapped, \"Get dressed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she\u0027d donned gown, slippers, and a dark blue mantle, he pulled her toward him, and before she realized what he meant to do, he was wrapping a black cloth around her mouth, gagging her. Finished, he spun her around and pushed her toward the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny stared down in terror at the long smooth wall that dropped straight into a deep dark moat. It was like looking at her own death. Wildly she shook her head, but Royce shoved her forward, snatching the stout rope he\u0027d left dangling over the window ledge and tying it tightly around her midriff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold onto the rope with your hands,\" he ordered mercilessly as he Wrapped the other end of the rope around his wrist, \"and use your feet to hold your body away from the wall.\" Without hesitation he lifted her off her feet and onto the sill. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-62.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM"}
