{"id":8592,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. PAUL PALMER AT HOME.","content":"\u0026nbsp;In a small two-story house, not far from the junction of a side street with Lake street, lived Mrs. Palmer, Paul\u0027s mother. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was rather shabby-looking externally, being sadly in want of paint, but Mrs. Palmer\u0027s rooms on the second floor were neatly, though plainly furnished, and scrupulously clean.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was an outside staircase, so that the second floor was independent of the first.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul ran up stairs, and opened the door, entering at once into the sitting-room, where his mother and sister were seated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Palmer\u0027s face brightened at the sight of Paul. He was always full of life and gayety, and his coming never failed to cheer her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So you are back again, Paul,\" she said, smiling a welcome.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, mother, and I am hungry, I can tell you. Is supper most ready?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It will be in five minutes,\" said his mother, folding[Pg 26] up her work and going into the adjoining room. \"I have got some dipped toast for you to-night.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just what I like.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But I delayed putting the toast into the dip till you came. There is some minced meat.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In other words, hash,\" said Paul, laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think you will find it good, in spite of the name.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, I am sure to like it, since it is home-made. At the restaurants I am a little afraid; I don\u0027t know but it may be made of dogs or cats.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do they make it of dogs or cats, Paul?\" asked his little sister, curiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Paul; \"I won\u0027t swear to it. All I know is that there\u0027s a lot of dogs and cats that disappear mysteriously every year in Chicago.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meanwhile Mrs. Palmer had been busily completing her arrangements for supper, and it was ready within the five minutes mentioned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Supper\u0027s ready, Paul. I haven\u0027t made you wait long,\" she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, mother; you\u0027re always on time, like an express train.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What sort of a day have you had, Paul? Did you sell much?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, more than usual. How much do you think I made?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 27]\"A dollar and a quarter?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"More than that. A dollar and seventy-five cents.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is very good indeed. It would take me a week to make as much as that by sewing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They pay mean wages for sewing, mother. I wouldn\u0027t slave at that kind of work.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shouldn\u0027t like to depend upon that kind of work altogether, but I can just as well earn something that way. I don\u0027t want you to support Grace and me in idleness.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No danger of your being idle, mother. That doesn\u0027t come natural to you. Some time or other I hope to support you as a lady.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you will be prospered, Paul; but I shall never be willing to fold my hands and do nothing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then again I don\u0027t want always to live in this poor place,\" pursued Paul.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is comfortable. I feel fortunate in having so good a home.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It would be easier to find a better one if we could afford to pay more rent. Of course this will do for the present. What have you been doing to-day, Grace?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I went to school this morning, and I have been studying arithmetic and geography at home since school was over.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will become a famous scholar in time, Grace.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 28]\"I never expect to know as much as mother,\" said Grace.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you will know a good deal more,\" said Mrs. Palmer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You know ever so much, mother.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You think so now, because I know more than you; but the time will come when you will understand better how little your mother knows.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Didn\u0027t you use to keep school, mother?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, but school-teachers don\u0027t know everything. Well, Paul, what have you seen to-day? To go to Milwaukee and back would be a great event to Grace and myself in our quiet course of life.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ve got used to it, mother. It\u0027s all in the day\u0027s work. Oh, I mustn\u0027t forget to tell you a lady had her pocket picked on our train to-day.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Tell me about it, Paul,\" said Grace, with eager interest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So Paul told the story, very much as it has already been told in the last chapter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did the pickpocket really jump off the train when it was going?\" asked Grace, her eyes wide open.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Grace.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did he get hurt?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; the conductor and I watched from the platform, and saw him turn two or three somersets, but he got up quickly and made off.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 29]\"It was taking a dangerous risk,\" said Mrs. Palmer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; it is more of a risk than I would take for forty-seven dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Was that the sum taken?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Poor young lady! What a loss it will be to her!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She happens to be a rich young lady, mother. She didn\u0027t mind it any more than I would if I should lose ten cents, and perhaps not as much.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you think the man will be caught, Paul?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know. I suppose he will keep in hiding for awhile. Anyhow, he got off with the money. I suppose he doesn\u0027t feel very friendly to me, as I was the one who detected him in the theft.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Does he know that?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Palmer looked rather alarmed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Be on your guard against him, Paul. He may do you a mischief sometime.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t doubt he would like to; but I don\u0027t believe he will ride on that railroad again very soon, and I would not recommend him to go about much in Chicago.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How do you know the lady was rich, Paul?\" asked Grace.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I know more than that. I know what her name is,\" said Paul.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 30]\"What is it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Grace Dearborn.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why, her first name is the same as mine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So it is. Don\u0027t you think she might send a present to her namesake?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She doesn\u0027t know anything about me,\" said the little girl.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t be too sure of that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How should she?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Because I told her. I can tell you something more. She sent you a present.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Really and truly?\" asked Grace, in a flutter of excitement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, really and truly. Now what do you hope it is?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m sure. I should like a nice doll. I\u0027ve got a rag baby, but that isn\u0027t as good.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She didn\u0027t send you a doll.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; I didn\u0027t expect she would; she wouldn\u0027t have any with her.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; young ladies do not generally carry dolls round with them. Still, you can buy a doll with what she did give you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul drew from his vest-pocket the small gold piece, and handed it to his little sister.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How much is it, Paul?\" asked Grace, who wasn\u0027t in the habit of seeing gold coin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 31]\"Two dollars and a half, Gracie.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why, that\u0027s ever so much money. I can get a nice doll on State street for half a dollar.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So you can, and keep the rest of the money for something useful.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Miss Dearborn was very kind,\" said Mrs. Palmer. \"I suppose she made the present before she lost her purse.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. She invited me to bring Grace to call upon her some day. She lives on Ashland avenue.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should like to go, Paul.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So you shall, Gracie.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meanwhile all the family had done justice to the supper, which, though certainly very plain, was palatable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As they rose from the supper-table, Paul took his hat from a peg, and said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll take a little walk, mother.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In what direction, Paul?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall go to Randolph street, and perhaps stroll down as far as State street. It is rather lively that way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well, Paul. I suppose you won\u0027t be out late?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, no. I always tell you beforehand when I stay out.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 32]Paul had hardly been gone twenty minutes when an unsteady step was heard on the staircase outside, and there was a loud knock on the outer door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s Stephen,\" said Mrs. Palmer, nervously. \"I wish Paul were at home!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83074.html","bookId":282,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:39:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:39:34 AM"}
