A magnificent spectacle more than worth the price of admission, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will blow you away. However, given that so much has gone into protecting the secrets of the book (including armored trucks and injunctions), don\u0027t expect any spoilers in this review. It\u0027s much more fun not knowing what\u0027s coming--and in the case of Rowling\u0027s delicious sixth book, you don\u0027t want to know. Just sit tight, despite the earth-shattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story. But take one warning to heart: do not open Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince until you have first found a secluded spot, safe from curious eyes, where you can tuck in for a good long read. Because once you start, you won\u0027t stop until you reach the very last page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-harry-potter-6.jpg","author":"J.K.
