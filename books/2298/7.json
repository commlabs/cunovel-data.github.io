Should she call Ned and Arnie? Maybe she was overreacting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLots of men had remarked on the color of her hair. But there was a killer on the loose now, a killer whose victims had all been women with red hair and green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his order came up, Vicki took Bobbie Sue aside. \"Remember that favor you owe me? Well, take this order to table four and finish my shift, will you, and we\u0027ll call it square.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, girlfriend. Something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Vicki thrust the tray into Bobbie Sue\u0027s hands. \"I\u0027ll see you tomorrow night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing into the back room, Vicki grabbed her coat, then opened the kitchen door. \"Gus, I\u0027m going home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Bobbie Sue\u0027s going to cover for me for until closing. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure everything\u0027s okay?\" he asked, his brow furrowed with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure. Night, Gus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"G\u0027night, kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlipping into her coat, Vicki ducked out the back door into the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to get into her car when a tingling down her spine warned her that she was no longer alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should park out front,\" a deep voice remarked. \"Under a light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whirled around, her mind racing. Her keys. She could use them for a weapon if she had to. Or she could just scream. Someone in the diner would surely hear her. She wished that she had remembered to take Arnie\u0027s advice and asked Gus to walk her out to her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need to cause a scene,\" the man said. \"I just want to ask you a couple of questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the man from the diner. She clutched her keys tightly in one hand. \"Questions about what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Tom Duncan. I\u0027m looking for someone. A man about five foot ten. Looks to be in his late thirties. Blond hair. Yellow eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yellow eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. And believe me, I\u0027d remember someone with yellow eyes. Are you a cop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you looking for this guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s personal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I haven\u0027t seen him. Good night, Mr. Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, ma\u0027am. You\u0027d best be more careful in the future. Try to park under a light, and keep your doors… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know. Keep my doors locked and don\u0027t invite any strangers into the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s gaze grew sharp. \"Who told you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Practically everybody. You, the police… an acquaintance of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have any strangers approached you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just you. Like I said, it\u0027s not likely I\u0027d forget someone with yellow eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the name of this acquaintance? Is it someone you\u0027ve just met?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a man who claimed he wasn\u0027t a cop, he sure sounded like one. \"Yes, his name is…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" She paused, suddenly reluctant to give out Antonio Battista\u0027s name. She didn\u0027t know this man. Of course, she didn\u0027t really know Antonio, either. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mr. Duncan, I don\u0027t think I should give out that information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might be very important, Vicki.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know my name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured at her uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, she thought, feeling foolish, it was on her name tag. \"Who are you, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a bounty hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bounty hunter!\" she repeated skeptically. \"Didn\u0027t they die out along with the cowboy and the buffalo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am. We\u0027re still doing our job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you\u0027re looking for Yellow Eyes to collect a bounty? What did he do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s wanted for murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Murder! Is he the one who killed Sharlene and the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very likely. Are you sure you haven\u0027t seen him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, overcome by a wave of relief. Antonio wasn\u0027t the killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for your help, Vicki. If you see him, run like hell.\" He scribbled something on the back of a card and handed it to her. \"That\u0027s my cell phone. Call me if you need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tucked the card into her skirt pocket. She could feel him watching her as she slid behind the wheel. She locked her door, switched on the engine, turned on the lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced out the rearview mirror as she drove out of the parking lot. He was still standing there, watching her, his hands jammed into his pants pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. First Antonio, then the murders, and now this bounty hunter looking for some guy with yellow eyes. If she didn\u0027t know better, she\u0027d think she was in the middle of a nightmare that refused to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drove home faster than she should have and felt an overwhelming sense of relief when she pulled into the driveway. She stopped in front of the garage and stared at the door. Call her a coward, but there was no way she was driving into that dark garage tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShutting off the engine, she took the key from the ignition. She was about to open the car door when she happened to glance up at the front porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd saw a pair of glowing yellow eyes staring back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrozen in terror, Vicki stared at the unblinking yellow eyes. He was here. The murderer was here, waiting for her on the front porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a stab at putting the key back into the ignition so she could restart the car and get the hell out of there before it was too late, but her hand was shaking so badly she couldn\u0027t manage it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still trying to put the key in the ignition when the yellow eyes blinked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughter bordering on hysteria rose in Vicki\u0027s throat as her neighbor\u0027s black cat jumped off the railing and disappeared into the hedge that separated her property from his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki sat in the car for a minute, taking deep breaths while she waited for her heart to stop pounding. When her breathing had returned to normal, she opened the car door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling foolish and relieved, she grabbed her handbag and got out of the car. Shaking her head, she climbed the stairs and reached for the doorknob. She frowned when the door didn\u0027t open and then blew out a breath of exasperation when she remembered she had locked it. She fumbled in the dark as she tried to insert the key into the lock. If she was going to start locking the front door, she was going to have to remember to leave the porch light on so she could see what she was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had just turned the key in the lock when she sensed she was no longer alone. Still a little on edge from seeing those yellow eyes staring at her, she whirled around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me,\" Battista said. \"I did not mean to startle you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she breathed, one hand covering her pounding heart. \"It\u0027s you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were expecting someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s just that… Oh, never mind.\" She felt foolish enough. She didn\u0027t need to have him laughing at her for her inane behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed the door open and stepped inside, then glanced at Antonio over her shoulder. \"Would you like to come in?\" It was rather late to be entertaining company, but at the moment she didn\u0027t feel like being alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, he followed her into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki closed and locked the door. She dropped her handbag on a chair in the living room, shrugged out of her coat, and tossed it over her bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You left in a hurry again tonight,\" she remarked. She waited for him to answer, but he didn\u0027t seem inclined to offer any explanation. Okay, so it was none of her business. \"Do you want something to drink? Iced tea? Coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I need some.\" She went into the kitchen and put on a fresh pot of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she turned around, Antonio was standing in the doorway regarding her through fathomless blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here so late?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to be sure you made it safely home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you\u0027ve just been waiting around outside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I followed you here from the diner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. \"How did you do that? There wasn\u0027t anyone behind me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint smile tugged at his lips. \"Are you certain of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am unless you were driving with your headlights off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile widened. \"There are other forms of transportation, my sweet one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what? A bicycle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed softly. She had never heard him laugh before. It was a surprisingly sensual sound. It did odd things in the pit of her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood frozen in place as he moved toward her, felt her heart skip a beat as he stroked her hair, then cupped her cheek in his palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are beautiful, my sweet. Your hair is like a silken flame, your skin as soft as that of a newborn babe. And your eyes… Ah, they are as green as the meadows I played in as a child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up him, lost in the heat of his eyes, the husky resonance of his voice. He was beautiful, too, she thought, from his finely chiseled lips and patrician nose to his fine straight brows and sculpted jaw. She tried to visualize him as a child and couldn\u0027t. It was impossible to imagine that he had ever been young or vulnerable, or that he had once played childish games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Victoria … \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunger in his voice aroused an answering hunger deep within her. Without conscious thought, she swayed toward him, went up on her tiptoes as he lowered his head. She closed her eyes as his lips found hers, their touch burning away every other thought, every other need, but the need to be in his arms, to feel the hardness of his body pressed intimately against her own. It was a most remarkable kiss, infusing her with warmth and a heretofore unknown sense of belonging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer arms slid around his waist and she clung to him, certain she would expire if he took his mouth from hers, if he deprived her of the touch of his hand, the nearness of his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moaned softly when he lifted his head. \"Don\u0027t stop.\" She looked up at him, then stared in disbelief at what she saw. Yet even as she told herself she could not be seeing what she was seeing, the faint red glow faded from his eyes and they were again a deep dark blue. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-7.html","bookId":2298,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM"}
