But, no matter how much it condensed, it still wouldn’t surpass 99 miles.

As for Mo Eversnow, her delicate eyebrows were pressed together. She too had no idea what would happen after a perfect 33 Layered Heavens Life Destruction.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFive-colored lightning sparked in the skies. Then, a melodic sound like a grand morning bell burst out into the sky, echoing without end.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sort of sound was vast and ghostly, like a massive bronze bell ringing to the ends of the earth. As the disciples of Carefree Island heard this sound, they felt all of the blood within their bodies swell up. Their heartbeats drummed in rhythm to this divine sound, and a trace of enlightenment even occurred between every heartbeat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?

There are far too many Heavenly Dao Laws gathered in the origin energy clouds, thus they naturally formed the sound of the Great Dao. What we’ve heard is just a tiny bit and yet we can feel a portion of that enlightenment. As for Lin Ming himself, he directly withstood the baptism of the Heavenly Dao Laws. The advantages he obtained from this could be imagined.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeveral Elders marveled out loud, their hearts filled with envy. Then, at this time, the sound of the Great Dao suddenly changed. It was like a god was sitting atop a cloud, playing a zither. Waves after waves of mysterious sounds surged outwards. Sometimes it was pitched and daring, like soldiers in the battlefield, trudging through war and mud. Sometimes it was light and sprightly, like rivers and mountains, beads dripping down from a jade plate. At times it was soft and mild, like the thick autumn rain, flowers falling and fading…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNobody was able to understand the meaning behind this mysterious sound.

The origin energy cloud he summoned was extremely gray and solemn, like chaos itself. Moreover, the origin energy cloud he formed was far heavier than one formed by a normal martial artist. This origin energy cloud seemed as if it were condensed from elementary grandmist energy, and it itself contained an eminent killing intent. And now, this killing intent became so thick that it was substantializing, making everyone under it feel a great pressure.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Lin Ming crossed Ninefall, not only did his origin energy clouds not scatter, but the energy within them only grew stronger!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That is…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Elders of Carefree Island widened their eyes.

At this time, he was working together with her to conceal the energy fluctuations from the world Laws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The origin energy cloud has evolved into a tribulation cloud! 33 Layered Heavens, 99 mile origin energy cloud, nine through nine returns to one, Lin Ming’s Ninefall has reached the peak of perfection.

Lin Ming’s body burst out with heated and dazzling sparks, and underneath him, a fissure thousands of feet long was cut into the earth, forming an unfathomable abyss!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the Elders and direct disciples of Carefree Island saw the terrifying abyss that this gold sword had formed in the earth, and then saw Lin Ming still floating in the skies, completely fine, all of them gulped, their throats twitching.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn resisting the metal tribulation, a thousand foot fissure had appeared in the earth, but Lin Ming himself was alright!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWas he even human?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven a block of divine metal wasn’t so hard!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter the first golden sword cut down from the skies, more and more blazing gold blades fell down from the tribulation cloud, completely enveloping Lin Ming in a rain of gold.

Whether it was thunder tribulation or five element tribulation, all of it was the power of heavenly tribulation. In this world, when something was born that surpassed the highest truths of the Heavenly Dao, that existence would draw heavenly tribulation upon itself. For instance, when a monster reached a point in its martial path where it would obtain enlightenment, or when a top divine weapon spirit artifact was forged, or when a transcendent divine pill was born, or even when a transcendent divine might was created, all of that could summon the wrath of heavenly tribulation to the world!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd now, Lin Ming had studied two transcendent divine mights!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn addition to that, he dual cultivated body and energy, a process that already violated the current Heavenly Dao Laws of the universe!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd there was the Magic Cube, an existence that defied the will of the heavens!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMoreover, Lin Ming’s Ninefall had crossed a 33 Layered Heavens and produced a 99 mile origin energy cloud.

This would be fine if it were ordinary thunder tribulation, but five element tribulation represented the five source energies that formed all life in the universe. How could heavenly tribulation using this sort of power possibly be crossed easily?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“If Lin Ming can pass this, it will also be another great lucky chance for him. Lin Ming is too monstrous a genius. There are four or five aspects of him that are able to spur heavenly tribulation. All of that added up means that Lin Ming’s heavenly tribulation will be beyond terrifying!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNo one could help someone resist heavenly tribulation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat person could only withstand the wrath of the Heavenly Dao themselves.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe powerful had the ability to resist a strong heavenly tribulation.

Even so, the gold tribulation of this heavenly tribulation was far too strong and there was far too much. The blades chopped through Lin Ming’s flesh, causing blood to spill out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSoon after, Lin Ming was completely swallowed up by that golden light!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLooking at just that terrifying power and momentum, one could imagine that massive calamity Lin Ming had to resist.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe five element heavenly tribulation represented the will of the Heavenly Dao.

At this time, Lin Ming’s prestige in the hearts of Carefree Island’s Elders had completely turned around.
