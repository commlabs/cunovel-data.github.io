In one hand they held their spears, and in the other a pick of some sort – its business end a splay of talon-like hooks that they swung down into dead and dying flesh alike, pulling themselves yet higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn moments the first line of Saphii had reached the top, and over and out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screams from the first trench intensified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Follow!’ bellowed Feveren. ‘Follow!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd up they went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, they’d lifted him to his feet. But his mind remained lost in a deafening roar. Brother Diligence raised his head, struggled to find his balance. Officers surrounded him, healers crowded close, and, from a great distance, the sounds of battle took hold of the air above the valley, shaking it without pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sought to make sense of the cacophony in his head. He heard screams, horrified screams, rising in waves of panic and dread, but even that seemed far away. Far away, yes. That voice – so far away . Abruptly he shoved his helpers from his side, and then staggered as at last he could make out the words, the sources of those desperate screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Reverence!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer answer came in a savage torrent. ‘ Brother Diligence! Your battle is feint! We are attacked! K’Chain Che’Malle! T’lan Imass! We cannot hold – gods, the slaughter! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe silenced her hard as a slap. You must hold, Sister! We are coming!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking around, he saw the panic in the eyes of the Watered – they had felt her, had heard her frantic cries. ‘Attend!’ he bellowed. ‘Maintain the defences of the two lowest tiers – the rest are to withdraw to the high road – they must march east to the Spire with all haste! Weapons and armour and one skin of water and nothing more! You have one bell to get twenty-five thousand soldiers on the road!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Blessed Pure, the Perish have betrayed us!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved a dismissive hand. ‘Leave them. I shall awaken Akhrast Korvalain – I shall obliterate the enemies before us! Wait! I want the forces on our left to counter-attack – lock on to the enemy flank – I want those Bolkando and Barghast driven from the field! Now, clear me a path down to the second tier!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world seemed to be trembling beneath his feet. As he made his way down, choosing the right flank, he quickly scanned the battle before him. The damned Letherii fought as if blind to defeat – and they would be defeated, of that there was no doubt. Even without his voice, they could not hope to overrun his defences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I want them on their knees, empty-handed, heads bowed. And my soldiers shall rise from the trenches and walk among them, their weapons swinging. Not one Letherii shall leave this place – not one!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when I have driven them down, I shall turn to the other flank – it is stronger, I can see that, the White Faces remain in reserve – but none there can hope to stop me. They will be held in place by the counter-attack. I will have them all!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost directly below, he saw a tight mass of Letherii, a standard waving above them, and there, to his amazement, two K’Chain Che’Malle. Ve’Gath soldiers, one being ridden by a scale-armoured figure, the other revealing an empty saddle. They were flanking a lone Letherii on a horse, a man struggling to form the tip of a wedge pushing its way up the first berm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe K’Chain Che’Malle we shall have to cut down the hard way – and Sister Reverence faces an army of these creatures! We were complacent. We were fools to think them without cunning – are they not humans, after all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see you, Commander. I will take you first .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first to kneel. The first to submit to execution .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued his rapid descent of the earthworks, feeling his warren awakening within him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow, Letherii sorcery crackled in a grey wave, swept up and over an onager redoubt. Bodies erupted in crimson mists. Furious, Diligence reached out, found a handful of squad mages. With a single word he crushed their skulls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching a ramp, he made his way across, and took position atop the second tier. Across a distance less than a bowshot, the Letherii commander had attained the top of the berm, his Ve’Gath clearing a path with vicious, sweeping strokes of their halberds that sent bodies spinning through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ I see you! ’ roared Diligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys Beddict felt his horse crumpling under him, and as he flung his feet clear of the stirrups and twisted to evade the falling beast he saw an enormous quarrel driven deep into its chest. Landing in a crouch, he readied his blood-smeared sword. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-380.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
