Hector advancing, Menelaus retires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This, Glaucus objects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had won from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till Ajax rallies them: Aeneas sustains the Trojans. Aeneas and Hector Attempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The horses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his body with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion. Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus\u0027 death: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the utmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body to the ships.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day.

sight:\n\u003cbr\u003e Loud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.\n\u003cbr\u003e Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,\n\u003cbr\u003e With rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,\n\u003cbr\u003e Voracious hounds, that many a length before\n\u003cbr\u003e Their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;\n\u003cbr\u003e But if the savage turns his glaring eye,\n\u003cbr\u003e They howl aloof, and round the forest fly.\n\u003cbr\u003e Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,\n\u003cbr\u003e Wave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:\n\u003cbr\u003e But Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,\n\u003cbr\u003e All pale they tremble and forsake the field.\n\u003cbr\u003e While thus aloft the hero\u0027s corse they bear,\n\u003cbr\u003e Behind them rages all the storm of war:\n\u003cbr\u003e Confusion, tumult, horror, o\u0027er the throng\n\u003cbr\u003e Of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:\n\u003cbr\u003e Less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire\n\u003cbr\u003e To whelm some city under waves of fire;\n\u003cbr\u003e Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,\n\u003cbr\u003e Now crack the blazing temples of the gods;\n\u003cbr\u003e The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,\n\u003cbr\u003e And sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.\n\u003cbr\u003e The heroes sweat beneath their honour\u0027d load:\n\u003cbr\u003e As when two mules, along the rugged road,\n\u003cbr\u003e From the steep mountain with exerted strength\n\u003cbr\u003e [pg 330]\n\u003cbr\u003e Drag some vast beam, or mast\u0027s unwieldy length;\n\u003cbr\u003e Inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,\n\u003cbr\u003e The enormous timber lumbering down the hill:\n\u003cbr\u003e So these—Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands,\n\u003cbr\u003e And breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.\n\u003cbr\u003e Thus when a river swell\u0027d with sudden rains\n\u003cbr\u003e Spreads his broad waters o\u0027er the level plains,\n\u003cbr\u003e Some interposing hill the stream divides.\n\u003cbr\u003e And breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.\n\u003cbr\u003e Still close they follow, close the rear engage;\n\u003cbr\u003e Aeneas storms, and Hector foams with rage:\n\u003cbr\u003e While Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,\n\u003cbr\u003e Wedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,\n\u003cbr\u003e That shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung\n\u003cbr\u003e High on poised pinions, threats their callow young.\n\u003cbr\u003e So from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly,\n\u003cbr\u003e Such the wild terror, and the mingled cry:\n\u003cbr\u003e Within, without the trench, and all the way,\n\u003cbr\u003e Strow\u0027d in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;\n\u003cbr\u003e Such horror Jove impress\u0027d! yet still proceeds\n\u003cbr\u003e The work of death, and still the battle bleeds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Illustration: VULCAN FROM AN ANTIQUE GEM.\n\u003cbr\u003e VULCAN FROM AN ANTIQUE GEM.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e
