She spent her days in sewing and spinning, and in minding her father\u0027s sheep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At that time there was a sad war in France, and the English had won many battles. Joan was grieved to hear of the trouble of her country. She thought of it night and day, and one night she dreamt that an angel came, and told her to go and help the French prince.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Joan told her friends of this dream, they laughed at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How can a poor girl help the prince?\" asked they.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I do not know,\" replied Joan; \"but I must go, for God has sent me.\" So she went to the prince, and said: \"Sir, my name is Joan. God has sent me to help you to win the crown of France.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They gave Joan a suit of white armour, and a white horse, and set her at the head of the army. She led the soldiers to fight, and the rough men thought she was an angel, and fought so bravely that they won many battles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the prince was crowned King of France.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When this was done, Joan felt that her work was over. \"I would that I might go and keep sheep once more with my sisters and my brothers; they would be so glad to see me,\" pleaded she. But the king would not let her go. So Joan stayed; but her time of victory was past. Soon, she was taken prisoner by the English, and cruelly burned to death. She died as bravely as she had lived, and her name will never be forgotten.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2154/60904.html","bookId":596,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:35:23 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:35:23 AM"}
