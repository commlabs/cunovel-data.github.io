Although that gap wasn’t huge, to cultivators of this level, it was the type of thing that could mean the difference between victory and defeat, between life and death!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what Meng Hao wanted was not just victory or defeat, but rather... to kill his opponent and come out alive!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had nothing to do with enmity or hatred. The only way to end the war was to kill Lord White. With him dead, Grandpa Meng would be safe. Furthermore, the explosive ripples that would be unleashed prior to his death were exactly what was needed to bring his grandfather\u0027s soul back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore he chose to use this spear. In fact, Meng Hao’s personality was such that he didn’t even hesitate to waste the precious spear that had been unsealed by Greed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe destruction of that spear had been the feint needed to unleash Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, which now shot directly toward Lord White’s forehead, bursting with power. Lord White had no time to react or even do anything before... the spear stabbed directly into his flesh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ripping sound could be heard as his flesh was torn apart, and then cracking sounds echoed out as his skull was shattered. Demon Weapon Lonelytomb stabbed directly into Lord White’s forehead!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as that happened, no look of relief appeared on Meng Hao’s face. Instead, his expression flickered, and his pupils constricted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was because, even as Lord White’s forehead was pierced, and his eyes dimmed, he suddenly spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Green Emperor’s Eternal Incantation.” In the same moment that the words left his mouth, an aura erupted out of him that Meng Hao found very familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnexpectedly, it resembled... the aura of the Eternal stratum!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs that aura erupted out, the flesh on Lord White’s forehead began to wriggle. Simultaneously, that aura spread out into Demon Weapon Lonelytomb and then toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Lord White, the aura was a restorative power, but to Meng Hao, it was like a surging wild beast. At the same time, his own Eternal stratum roared madly. Apparently, these two different auras were as incompatible as water and fire!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, Meng Hao’s Eternal stratum had been acquired by walking the road of Perfection to the very end. Then, through a series of chance occurrences, he had managed to merge it with the Eyeless Larva. However, in the most fundamental of ways, it actually had some connections to the Mountain and Sea Scripture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Meng Hao was about to put his spear away, Lord White grabbed it, then stared into Meng Hao’s eyes. A vicious gleam could be seen in his own eyes, and the Eternal aura around him grew stronger. Shockingly, an illusory ancient scripture suddenly appeared behind him, upon which were written three characters!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMountain and Sea Scripture!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the ancient scripture opened, Lord White’s aura began to grow stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost in the same moment that the protection of the ancient scripture appeared, Meng Hao’s Eternal stratum began to surge with even more madness. Suddenly, a piercing cry like that of a silkworm began to echo out from inside of him, and behind him, a shocking illusory image appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was... the Eyeless Larva!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first time since the Eyeless Larva had become a part of his Eternal stratum that it ever appeared in this way. As soon as it became visible, it turned to Lord White and howled. [1. The Eyeless Larva was last mentioned in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-5-chapter-693/\"\u003echapter 693\u003c/a\u003e when Meng Hao used to it to acquire the Eternal stratum]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord White’s face flickered with shock as he suddenly realized that Meng Hao had also... cultivated some of the Mountain and Sea Scripture!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An incomplete Mountain and Sea Scripture, huh?” Lord White said with a cold snort. However, he was still shocked. He could sense the explosive violence within his Green Emperor’s Eternal Incantation, and how it wished to attack the Eyeless Larva behind Meng Hao, and fight with it to the death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes went wide as he realized that his opponent intended to take away his Demon Weapon. He was not the type of person to let something like that happen lightly, so instead, he let go of it and uttered a single word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Detonate!” As soon as the word left his mouth, Demon Weapon Lonelytomb exploded with a huge bang. Once again, Lord White was injured, and yet, with his Eternal aura at work, he quickly began to recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord White looked deeply at Meng Hao. Without saying another word, he fell back to give himself time to heal and buy some more time. Earlier, he had not underestimated Meng Hao, but now... he wanted to kill him more than ever. It had been a very, very long time since he had experienced the sensation of imminent death that he had moments ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere it not for the profundity of his divine ability, then with the way he had been stabbed in the forehead just now, while it wouldn’t have killed him, it would have resulted in a grievous injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Demon Weapon exploded, it transformed into streams of black mist that swirled back to collect together near Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Mountain and Sea Scripture....” Meng Hao said, an unsightly expression on his face. From what he understood, the Mountain and Sea Scripture was a combination of the three classic scriptures of the Mountain and Sea Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, Lord White had actually cultivated the Mountain and Sea Scripture, but to a far higher level than Meng Hao. After all, Meng Hao had used fragments of the actual scripture, and then relied on his own deductive powers to make alterations as he had seen fit. [2. As a brief reminder, Meng Hao got the Sublime Spirit Scripture way back in the Reliance Sect. It set him on the path of Perfection, which eventually led to the Eternal. The Sublime Spirit Scripture was described as one of the three great classic scriptures, along with the Dao Divinity Scripture and the Heaven Severing Scripture. P.S. This line in the original Chinese actually contains a mistake which I fixed. If any of you are reading along in Chinese as well, you will probably notice this]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Meng Hao had the feeling that if his Eternal stratum could merge with the Green Emperor’s Eternal Incantation of his opponent, then... his own Eternal stratum would increase by a whole level!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder if there is something beyond the Eternal...?” Meng Hao thought, his eyes shining brightly. All of a sudden, he had yet another reason to kill Lord White!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wound on Lord White’s forehead was rapidly healing up, and it seemed as if it would only be moments before it was completely restored. Meng Hao’s eyes flickered, and he took two steps forward, which were his sixth and seventh steps respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant that his seventh step landed, Meng Hao’s energy spiked. Something like a roar echoed out to the ends of the starry sky as a terrifying foot suddenly appeared. It was like a planet descending from above, causing massive rumbling sounds to echo out as it crushed down toward Lord White!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was none other than the ability he had learned from Su Yan, who was still in his bag of holding... the Seven God Steps!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as that huge foot appeared up in the starry sky, Lord White’s face fell yet again, filling with disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Seven God Steps? That’s impossible!!” Shockingly, he recognized this particular Daoist magic of Meng Hao’s. Instantly, Lord White bit the tip of his tongue and spit out a mouthful of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat blood rapidly expanded, instantly transforming into a sea of blood, which seethed out across the starry sky to slam into the incoming foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the resulting massive explosion, Meng Hao’s energy surged, and the killing intent in his eyes intensified. Next, his left hand flashed in an incantation gesture, and the meat jelly appeared. Muttering disconsolately, it transformed into a set of armor which covered Meng Hao. Then, Meng Hao extended his right hand, and the copper mirror transformed into a beam of multicolored light as it, along with the grumbling parrot, transformed into... a pitch black Battle Weapon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant the Battle Weapon appeared, Meng Hao’s desire to fight exploded out. The starry sky went dark, and the void trembled. Meng Hao’s murderous aura rose to shocking heights as he slashed his blade out toward the fleeing Lord White.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DIE!!” he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensation of deadly crisis that exploded up within Lord White was impossible to describe. In fact, the sensation far, far exceeded the feeling he had experienced when Meng Hao had gone all-out to attack him with Demon Weapon Lonelytomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, there was something different about it: Demon Weapon Lonelytomb had appeared completely unexpectedly, giving him no time to react. In this moment, although the sensation of deadly crisis was more intense, at least he had a moment to prepare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately... Lord White was still in the middle of utilizing his Green Emperor’s Eternal Incantation to restore himself. He couldn’t unleash his peak level of power, causing a vicious, intense gleam to appear in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaring at Meng Hao, he roared, “Extermination!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, Essence fluctuations appeared, which were none other than the ripples of the Essence of extermination!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Power Essence!” He wasn’t finished yet, though! As soon as the Essence of extermination appeared, a second shocking Essence aura roiled up inside of him. The void around him distorted, and boundless ripples spread out through the starry sky from his second Essence... the Essence of power!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was not the power of the fleshly body, but rather... power incited from within the starry sky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Curse!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Land!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time!!” Lord White knew that this was a moment of extreme crisis, and as of this moment, fully realized how difficult it was to deal with Meng Hao. Furthermore, he also knew that he had lost out on an opportunity to seize the initiative. He had ceded that to Meng Hao, who was clearly extremely domineering. Once he got going, he kept going without stop!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord White had never encountered someone who fought like this in the past, but he could tell that once Meng Hao built up enough momentum, it would be difficult to stop him, and he would only continue to grow stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five Essence Dao!” Lord White cried, spreading his hands out wide in Meng Hao’s direction and then pushing forward. His clothes and hair whipped about, and his cultivation base exploded out, merging with the starry sky, connecting with the Heavens, drawing upon the boundless energy of Heaven and Earth, sucking it into his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like he became a huge black hole which consumed the energy of Heaven and Earth. It poured into his body, which became like a transfer point for that energy, which he then sent out... to become five different Essences!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a way of using Essence that was completely new to Meng Hao. Instead of drawing upon the powers of the world and wielding them, it took Heaven and Earth and transformed it within oneself. The latter was definitely more domineering than the former!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Either die, or screw the hell off!!!” roared Lord White. His five Essences became five natural laws, filling the entire world, sweeping through the Heavens, instantly enveloping Meng Hao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA will of extermination that could erase emotions and obliterate the soul!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA magic embodying the Essence of power that could crush the body and smash the mind!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Dao of cursing that could defile the blood and eradicate blood vessels!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Essence of land which could bury corpses and sever qi passageways!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quintessence of Time, the ultimate of the five Essences, which could reach through Time to slaughter the enemy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe starry sky trembled, and within that world of Essence and natural law, blood oozed out of Meng Hao’s eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. However his eyes were shining brightly, and his desire to fight was no less than before. Hefting the Battle Weapon, he... slashed it out in attack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an extraordinary showdown!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-haired old man and the others had long since retreated from their position 3,000 meters away. They were now 30,000 meters away, where they sent their divine sense out to observe the fierce fighting going on between Meng Hao and Lord White. All four of their faces were completely pale, and their hearts were battered with waves of shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1296\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1298\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1297","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
