When he was clean and smelled like every scented thing in my bathroom, and he was modestly draped with a big towel, I went all over him with Neosporin. I used up a whole tube on the bites. They seemed to be healing clean already, but I could not stop myself from trying to think of things to do for him. He\u0027d had hot chocolate, and he\u0027d eaten some hot oatmeal (which I thought was an odd choice, but he said all Felton had brought him to eat had been barely cooked meat), and he\u0027d put on the sleeping pants I\u0027d bought for Eric (too big, but the drawstring waist helped), and he\u0027d put on a baggy old T-shirt I\u0027d gotten when I\u0027d done the Walk for Life two years before. He kept touching the material as if he was delighted to be dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to want to be warm and to sleep, more than anything. I put him in my old room. With a sad glance at the closet, which Eric had left all askew, I told my brother good night. He asked me to turn the hall light on and leave the door cracked a little. It cost Jason to ask that, so I didn\u0027t say a word. I just did as he\u0027d requested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam was sitting in the kitchen, drinking a cup of hot tea. He looked up from watching the steam of it and smiled at me. \"How is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank down into my usual spot. \"He\u0027s better than I thought he would be,\" I said. \"Considering he spent the whole time in the shed with no heat and being bitten every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder how long Felton would have kept him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until the full moon, I guess. Then Felton would\u0027ve found out if he\u0027d succeeded or not.\" I felt a little sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I checked your calendar. He\u0027s got a couple of weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Give Jason time to get his strength back before he has something else to face.\" I rested my head in my hands for a minute. \"I have to call the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To let them know to stop searching?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you made up your mind what to say? Did Jason mention any ideas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that the male relatives of some girl had kidnapped him?\" Actually, that was sort of true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cops would want to know where he\u0027d been held. If he\u0027d gotten away on his own, they\u0027d want to know how, and they\u0027d be sure he\u0027d have more information for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if I had enough brainpower left to think. I stared blankly at the table: the familiar napkin holder that my grandmother had bought at a craft fair, and the sugar bowl, and the salt- and pepper-shakers shaped like a rooster and a hen. I noticed something had been tucked under the saltshaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a check for $50,000, signed by Eric Northman. Eric had not only paid me, he had given me the biggest tip of my career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I said, very gently. \"Oh, boy.\" I looked at it for a minute more, to make sure I was reading it correctly. I passed it across the table to Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. Payment for keeping Eric?\" Sam looked up at me, and I nodded. \"What will you do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put it through the bank, first thing tomorrow morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"I guess I was thinking longer term than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just relax. It\u0027ll just relax me to have it. To know that...\" To my embarrassment, here came tears. Again. Damn. \"So I won\u0027t have to worry all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things have been tight recently, I take it.\" I nodded, and Sam\u0027s mouth compressed. \"You...\" he began, and then couldn\u0027t finish his sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, but I can\u0027t do that to people,\" I said firmly. \"Gran always said that was the surest way to end a friendship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could sell this land, buy a house in town, have neighbors,\" Sam suggested, as if he\u0027d been dying to say that for months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move out of this house?\" Some member of my family had lived in this house continuously for over a hundred and fifty years. Of course, that didn\u0027t make it sacred or anything, and the house had been added to and modernized many times. I thought of living in a small modern house with level floors and up-to-date bathrooms and a convenient kitchen with lots of plugs. No exposed water heater. Lots of blown-in insulation in the attic. A carport!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDazzled at the vision, I swallowed. \"I\u0027ll consider it,\" I said, feeling greatly daring to even entertain the idea. \"But I can\u0027t think of anything much right now. Just getting through tomorrow will be hard enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of the police man-hours that had been put into searching for Jason. Suddenly I was so tired, I just couldn\u0027t make an attempt to fashion a story for the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to go to bed,\" Sam said astutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could only nod. \"Thank you, Sam. Thank you so much.\" We stood and I gave him a hug. It turned into a longer hug than I\u0027d planned, because hugging him was unexpectedly restful and comfortable. \"Good night,\" I said. \"Please drive careful going back.\" I thought briefly of offering him one of the beds upstairs, but I kept that floor shut off and it would be awfully cold up there; and I\u0027d have to go up and make the bed. He\u0027d be more comfortable making the short drive home, even in the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" he said, and released me. \"Call me in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough thank-yous,\" he said. Eric had put a couple of nails in the front door to hold it shut, until I could get a dead bolt put on. I locked the back door behind Sam, and I barely managed to brush my teeth and change into a nightgown before I crawled in my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing I did the next morning was check on my brother. Jason was still deeply asleep, and in the light of day, I could clearly see the effects of his imprisonment. His face had a coating of stubble. Even in his sleep, he looked older. There were bruises here and there, and that was just on his face and arms. His eyes opened as I sat by the bed, looking at him. Without moving, he rolled his eyes around, taking in the room. They stopped when they came to my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t dream it,\" he said. His voice was hoarse. \"You and Sam came and got me. They let me go. The panther let me go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s been happening while I was gone?\" he asked next. \"Wait, can I go to the bathroom and get a cup of coffee before you tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked his asking instead of telling (a Jason trait, telling), and I was glad to tell him yes and even volunteer to get the coffee. Jason seemed happy enough to crawl back in bed with the mug of coffee and sugar, and prop himself up on the pillows while we talked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him about Catfish\u0027s phone call, our to-and-fro with the police, the search of the yard and my conscription of his Benelli shotgun, which he immediately demanded to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fired it!\" he said indignantly, after checking it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flinched first. \"I guess it worked like a shotgun is \u0027spose to,\" he said slowly. \"Since you\u0027re sitting here looking pretty much okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, and don\u0027t ask me again,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now we have to think of a story for the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we can\u0027t just tell them the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Jason, let\u0027s tell them that the village of Hotshot is full of were-panthers, and that since you slept with one, her boyfriend wanted to make you a were-panther, too, so she wouldn\u0027t prefer you over him. That\u0027s why he changed into a panther and bit you every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can just see Andy Bellefleur\u0027s face,\" Jason said in a subdued kind of way. \"He still can\u0027t get over me being innocent of murdering those girls last year. He\u0027d love to get me committed as being delusional. Catfish would have to fire me, and I don\u0027t think I\u0027d like it at the mental hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, your dating opportunities would sure be limited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crystal - God, that girl! You warned me. But I was so bowled over by her. And she turns out to be a... you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for goodness sake, Jason, she\u0027s a shape-shifter. Don\u0027t go on like she\u0027s the creature from the Black Lagoon, or Freddy Krueger, or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sook, you know a lot of stuff we don\u0027t know, don\u0027t you? I\u0027m getting that picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s lots else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believed what you said, but I just didn\u0027t get it. Some people I know - I mean besides Crystal - they\u0027re not always people, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like how many?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI counted up the two-natured I\u0027d seen in the bar: Sam, Alcide, that little were-fox who\u0027d been standing Jason and Hoyt drinks a couple of weeks ago... \"At least three,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" he said, after a long moment. \"I don\u0027t want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now, you,\" I said gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, and we won\u0027t be sure for a couple of weeks,\" I said. \"But Calvin\u0027ll help you if you need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t take help from them!\" Jason\u0027s eyes were blazing, and he looked positively feverish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have a choice,\" I said, trying not to snap. \"And Calvin didn\u0027t know you were there. He\u0027s an okay guy. But it\u0027s not even time to talk about it yet. We have to figure out what to tell the police right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor at least an hour we went over and over our stories, trying to find threads of truth to help us stitch together a fabrication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I called the police station. The day-shift dispatcher was tired of hearing my voice, but she was still trying to be nice. \"Sookie, like I told you yesterday, hon, we\u0027ll call you when we find out something about Jason,\" she said, trying to suppress the note of exasperation beneath her soothing tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got him,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You - WHAT?\" The shriek came over loud and clear. Even Jason winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll send someone right over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" I said, though I didn\u0027t mean it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the foresight to get the nails out of the front door before the police got there. I didn\u0027t want them asking what had happened to it. Jason had looked at me oddly when I got out the hammer, but he didn\u0027t say a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your car?\" Andy Bellefleur asked first thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s at Merlotte\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I just tell you and Alcee, together, one time?\" Alcee Beck was coming up the front steps. He and Andy came in the house together, and at the sight of Jason lying wrapped up on my couch, they both stopped dead in their tracks. I knew then that they\u0027d never expected to see Jason alive again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to see you safe and sound, man,\" Andy said, and shook Jason\u0027s hand. Alcee Beck followed on his heels. They sat down, Andy in Gran\u0027s recliner and Alcee in the armchair I usually took, and I perched on the couch beside Jason\u0027s feet. \"We\u0027re glad you\u0027re in the land of the living, Jason, but we need to know where you\u0027ve been and what happened to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea,\" Jason said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he stuck to it for hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been no believable story Jason could tell that could account for everything: his absence, his poor physical condition, the bite marks, his sudden reappearance. The only possible line he could take was to say the last thing he remembered, he\u0027d heard a funny noise outside while he was entertaining Crystal, and when he\u0027d gone to investigate, he\u0027d been hit on the head. He didn\u0027t remember anything until somehow he\u0027d felt himself pushed from a vehicle to land in my yard the night before. I\u0027d found him there when Sam brought me home from work. I\u0027d ridden home with Sam because I was scared to drive in the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, we\u0027d cleared this with Sam ahead of time, and he\u0027d agreed, reluctantly, that it was the best we could come up with. I knew Sam didn\u0027t like to lie, and I didn\u0027t either, but we had to keep that particular can of worms closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beauty of this story was its simplicity. As long as Jason could resist the temptation to embroider, he\u0027d be safe. I\u0027d known that would be hard for Jason; he loved to talk, and he loved to talk big. But as long as I was sitting there, reminding him of the consequences, my brother managed to restrain himself. I had to get up to get him another cup of coffee - the lawmen didn\u0027t want any more - and as I was coming back in the living room, Jason was saying he thought he remembered a cold dark room. I gave him a very plain look, and he said, \"But you know, my head is so confused, that may just be something I dreamed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy looked from Jason to me, clearly getting angrier and angrier. \"I just can\u0027t understand you two,\" he said. His voice was almost a growl. \"Sookie, I know you worried about him. I\u0027m not making that up, am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I am so glad to have him back.\" I patted my brother\u0027s foot under the blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, you didn\u0027t want to be wherever you were, right? You missed work, you cost the parish thousands of dollars from our budget to search for you, and you disrupted the lives of hundreds of people. And you\u0027re sitting here lying to us!\" Andy\u0027s voice was almost a shout as he finished. \"Now, the same night you show up, this missing vampire on all the posters called the police in Shreveport to say he\u0027s recovering from memory loss, too! And there\u0027s a strange fire in Shreveport with all kinds of bodies recovered! And you\u0027re trying to tell me there\u0027s no connection!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason and I gaped at each other. Actually, there was no connection between Jason and Eric. It just hadn\u0027t occurred to me how strange that would look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What vampire?\" Jason asked. It was so good, I almost believed him myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s leave, Alcee,\" Andy said. He slapped his notebook shut. He put his pen back in his shirt pocket with such an emphatic thrust that I was surprised he had a pocket left. \"This bastard won\u0027t even tell us the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think I\u0027d tell you if I could?\" Jason said. \"Don\u0027t you think I\u0027d like to lay hands on whoever did this to me?\" He sounded absolutely, one hundred percent sincere, because he was. The two detectives were shaken in their disbelief, especially Alcee Beck. But they still left unhappy with the two of us. I felt sorry for it, but there was nothing I could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that day, Arlene picked me up so I could fetch my car from Merlotte\u0027s. She was happy to see Jason, and she gave him a big hug. \"You had your sister some kind of worried, you rascal,\" she said, with mock ferocity. \"Don\u0027t you ever scare Sookie like that again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do my best,\" Jason said, with a good approximation of his old roguish smile. \"She\u0027s been a good sister to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, that\u0027s God\u0027s truth,\" I said, a little sourly. \"When I bring my car back, I think I might just run you home, big brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason looked scared for a minute. Being alone had never been his favorite thing, and after hours by himself in the cold of the shed, it might be even harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet girls all over Bon Temps are making food to bring to your place now that they heard you\u0027re back,\" Arlene said, and Jason brightened perceptibly. \"\u0027Specially since I\u0027ve been telling everyone what an invalid you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Arlene,\" Jason said, looking much more like himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI echoed that on the way into town. \"I really appreciate you cheering him up. I don\u0027t know what all he went through, but he\u0027s going to have a rough time getting over it, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, you don\u0027t need to worry about Jason. He\u0027s the original survivor. I don\u0027t know why he didn\u0027t try out for the show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe laughed all the way into town at the idea of staging a Survivor episode in Bon Temps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What with the razorbacks in the woods, and that panther print, they might have an exciting time of it if we had Survivor: Bon Temps,\" Arlene said. \"Tack and me would just sit back and laugh at them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gave me a nice opening to tease her about Tack, which she enjoyed, and altogether she cheered up me just as much as Jason. Arlene was good about stuff like that. I had a brief conversation with Sam in the storeroom of Merlotte\u0027s, and he told me Andy and Alcee had already been by to see if his story meshed with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hushed me before I could thank him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took Jason home, though he hinted broadly he\u0027d like to stay with me one more night. I took the Benelli with us, and I told him to clean it that evening. He promised he would, and when he looked at me, I could tell he wanted to ask me again why I\u0027d had to use it. But he didn\u0027t. Jason had learned some things in the past few days, himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was working the late shift again, so I would have a little time on my hands when I got home before I had to go in to work. The prospect felt good. I didn\u0027t see any running men on my way back to my house, and no one phoned or popped in with a crisis for a whole two hours. I was able to change the sheets on both beds, wash them, and sweep the kitchen and straighten up the closet concealing the hidey-hole, before the knock came at the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew who it would be. It was full dark outside, and sure enough, Eric stood on my front porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at me with no very happy face. \"I find myself troubled,\" he said without preamble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ve got to drop everything so I can help you out,\" I said, going instantly on the offensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked an eyebrow. \"I\u0027ll be polite and ask if I can come in.\" I hadn\u0027t rescinded his invitation, but he didn\u0027t want to just stroll into my house. Tactful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you can.\" I stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hallow is dead, having been forced to counter the curse on me, obviously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pam did a good job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"It was Hallow or me,\" he said. \"I like me better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027d she pick Shreveport?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her parents were jailed in Shreveport. They were witches, too, but they also ran confidence games of some kind, using their craft to make their victims more convinced of their sincerity. In Shreveport, their luck ran out. The supernatural community refused to make any effort to get the older Stonebrooks out of jail. The woman ran afoul of a voodoo priestess while she was incarcerated, and the man ran afoul of a knife in some bathroom brawl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty good reason to have it in for the supernaturals of Shreveport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They say I was here for several nights.\" Eric had decided to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. I tried to look agreeably interested in what he had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in that time, we never... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t pretend to misunderstand him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric, does that seem likely?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t sat down, and he moved closer to me, as if looking at me hard would reveal the truth. It would have been easy to take a step, be even closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"And it\u0027s making me a little aggravated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"Are you enjoying being back at work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But Pam ran everything well during my absence. I\u0027m sending lots of flowers to the hospital. Belinda, and a wolf named Maria-Comet or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maria-Star Cooper. You didn\u0027t send any to me,\" I pointed out tartly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I left you something more meaningful under the saltshaker,\" he said, with much the same edge. \"You\u0027ll have to pay taxes on it. If I know you, you\u0027ll give your brother some of it. I hear you got him back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did,\" I said briefly. I knew I was getting closer to bursting out with something, and I knew he should leave soon. I\u0027d given Jason such good advice about being quiet, but it was hard to follow it myself. \"And your point is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t last for long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think Eric realized how much money fifty thousand dollars was, by my standards. \"What\u0027s your point? I can tell you have one, but I don\u0027t have an idea what it might be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was there a reason I found brain tissue on my coat sleeve?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt all the blood drain from my face, the way it does when you\u0027re on the edge of passing out. The next thing I knew, I was on the couch and Eric was beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think there are some things you\u0027re not telling me, Sookie, my dear,\" he said. His voice was gentler, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe temptation was almost overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I thought of the power Eric would have over me, even more power than he had now; he would know I had slept with him, and he would know that I had killed a woman and he was the only one who\u0027d witnessed it. He would know that not only did he owe me his life (most likely), I certainly owed him mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I liked you a lot better when you didn\u0027t remember who you were,\" I said, and with that truth forefront in my mind, I knew I had to keep quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harsh words,\" he said, and I almost believed he was really hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily for me, someone else came to my door. The knock was loud and peremptory, and I felt a jolt of alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe caller was Amanda, the insulting redheaded female Were from Shreveport. \"I\u0027m on official business today,\" she said, \"so I\u0027ll be polite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be a nice change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded to Eric and said, \"Glad to have you back in your right mind, vampire,\" in a completely unconcerned tone. I could see that the Weres and vampires of Shreveport had reverted to their old relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And good to see you, too, Amanda.\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" she said, but hardly as if she cared. \"Miss Stackhouse, we\u0027re making inquiries for the shifters of Jackson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no. \"Really? Won\u0027t you please sit down? Eric was just leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027d love to stay and hear Amanda\u0027s questions,\" Eric said, beaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda looked at me, eyebrows raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t a hell of a lot I could do about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, by all means, stay,\" I said. \"Please sit down, both of you. I\u0027m sorry, but I don\u0027t have a lot of time before I\u0027m due at work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll get right to the point,\" Amanda said. \"Two nights ago, the woman that Alcide abjured - the shifter from Jackson, the one with the weird haircut?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, to show I was on the same page. Eric looked pleasantly blank. He wouldn\u0027t in a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Debbie,\" the Were recalled. \"Debbie Pelt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric\u0027s eyes widened. Now, that name he did know. He began to smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alcide abjured her?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were sitting right there,\" snapped Amanda. \"Oh, wait, I forgot. That was while you were under a curse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe enjoyed the hell out of saying that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, Debbie didn\u0027t make it back to Jackson. Her family is worried about her, especially since they heard that Alcide abjured her, and they\u0027re afraid something might have happened to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think she would have said anything to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda made a face. \"Well, actually, I think she would rather have eaten glass than talked to you again. But we\u0027re obliged to check with everyone who was there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this was just routine. I wasn\u0027t being singled out. I could feel myself relax. Unfortunately, so could Eric. I\u0027d had his blood; he could tell things about me. He got up and wandered back to the kitchen. I wondered what he was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen her since that night,\" I said, which was true, since I didn\u0027t specify what time. \"I have no idea where she is now.\" That was even truer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda told me, \"No one admits to having seen Debbie after she left the area of the battle. She drove off in her own car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric strolled back into the living room. I glanced at him, worried about what he was up to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has her car been seen?\" Eric asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know he\u0027d been the one who\u0027d hidden it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, neither hide nor hair,\" Amanda said, which was a strange image to use for a car. \"I\u0027m sure she just ran off somewhere to get over her rage and humiliation. Being abjured; that\u0027s pretty awful. It\u0027s been years since I\u0027ve heard the words said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her family doesn\u0027t think that\u0027s the case? That\u0027s she\u0027s gone somewhere to, ah, think things over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re afraid she\u0027s done something to herself.\" Amanda snorted. We exchanged glances, showing we agreed perfectly about the likelihood of Debbie committing suicide. \"She wouldn\u0027t do anything that convenient,\" Amanda said, since she had the nerve to say it out loud and I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Alcide taking this?\" I asked anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can hardly join in the search,\" she pointed out, \"since he\u0027s the one who abjured her. He acts like he doesn\u0027t care, but I notice the colonel calls him to let him know what\u0027s happening. Which, so far, is nothing.\" Amanda heaved herself to her feet, and I got up to walk her to the door. \"This sure has been a bad season for people going missing,\" she said. \"But I hear through the grapevine that you got your brother back, and Eric\u0027s returned to his normal self, looks like.\" She cast him a glance to make sure he knew how little she liked that normal self. \"Now Debbie has gone missing, but maybe she\u0027ll turn up, too. Sorry I had to bother you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right. Good luck,\" I said, which was meaningless under the circumstances. The door closed behind her, and I wished desperately that I could just walk out and get in my car and drive to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made myself turn around. Eric was standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going?\" I said, unable to keep from sounding startled and relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you said you had to get to work,\" he said blandly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suggest you wear that jacket, the one that\u0027s too light for the weather,\" he said. \"Since your coat is still in bad shape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d run it through the washer on cold water wash, but I guess I hadn\u0027t checked it well enough to be sure everything had come off. That\u0027s where he\u0027d been, searching for my coat. He\u0027d found it on its hanger on the back porch, and examined it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact,\" Eric said, as he went to the front door, \"I\u0027d throw it away entirely. Maybe burn it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left, closing the door behind him very quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew, as sure as I knew my name, that tomorrow he would send me another coat, in a big fancy box, with a big bow on it. It would be the right size, it would be a top brand, and it would be warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was cranberry red, with a removable liner, a detachable hood, and tortoiseshell buttons. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4/page-16.html","bookId":2194,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:56:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:56:17 PM"}
