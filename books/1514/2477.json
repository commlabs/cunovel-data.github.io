He is indeed the Devouring Master.” First elder Zhu Li looked at the huge crack before he involuntarily exclaimed. He was also a top-tier expert who had touched Reincarnation.

Meanwhile, his dark black eyes were staring intently at the black crack, before he involuntarily clenched both his hands.

Beside him, Little Marten and Little Flame were slightly startled upon seeing this. After all, they understood Lin Dong very well and knew that the latter was extremely cautious.

With a wave of their hands, their men also rushed forward.

However, he did not put up a resistance against them. Instead, he allowed the spatial ripples to diffuse around him. Soon after, he felt his vision turn blurry. The next time he opened his eyes, the scene in front of him had changed drastically.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter stabilizing his body, Lin Dong immediately surveyed his surroundings. Promptly, his body froze. In front of him, was an endless desolate land. However, that land was filled with gullies that were hundreds of thousands of feet in size. These gullies did not appear to be naturally formed. Instead, it seems like they were formed due to extremely terrifying fights.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis land looked like an ancient battlefield that was riddled with scars. In fact, even after tens of thousands of years, the fearsome ancient aura permeating this place remained as intense as before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLooked into the horizon, Lin Dong saw some dense white bones that were hundreds of thousands of feet in size. Those bones were broken and one could no longer identify their shape. However, there was still a fluorescence glow being emitted from those bones even after such a long period of time, while desolate-like ripples spread from them. Therefore, one can easily imagine just how frightening the owners of these bones must have been, tens of thousands of years ago.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Huh?

Immediately, he frowned. Soon after, he came to a sudden comprehension. It turns out that the spatial crack was unstable because of the wild and violent energy seeping out from this place. As a result, those who entered the crack were dispersed randomly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Big brother!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA whistle sounded from nearby while Lin Dong frowned. After which, he saw three figures rapidly rushing over. Upon closer inspection, he realized that they were Little Flame, Little Marten and the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander. From the looks of it, the three of them were sent to the same area and they were able to quickly locate each other.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Just the three of you?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong looked at the three of them and asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Aye. The rest of them should have been separated. But it doesn’t matter. We are all headed towards the deepest part and we should be able to meet them soon.” Little Marten nodded. After which, his eyes swept across this place before he said, “This place seems to be an ancient battlefield left behind from the ancient times.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Little Marten saw this miserable ancient battlefield, he sighed involuntarily.

When he saw the huge bones scattered all across the ground, his heart sunk. Those darned Yimo were truly powerful. In fact, even with the Symbol Ancestor in command, they only managed to scrap a narrow victory. Moreover, they also left behind many hidden dangers. One example was the mysterious “Devil Prison”, who had secretly extended their influence to various places...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Many top experts from the ancient era should have died here.

The Demonic Beast World was far more prosperous during the ancient era and there were more overlord tribes than the current four. However, those other overlord tribes were exterminated during that calamity.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Let’s go, we’ll head directly to the Devouring Divine Palace.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong mused for a moment before he cast his attention towards the deepest part of the ancient battlefield. This ancient battlefield was far too vast and it was filled with a fearsome aura, that could interfere with one’s Mental Energy probing. Fortunately, Lin Dong possessed the Devouring Ancestral Symbol. Therefore, he was still able to determine the right direction thanks to the faint connection that he felt.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Alright.” The Little Marten trio did not object. Their best course of action now was to locate the Devouring Divine Palace.

After travelling for nearly twenty minutes at their full speed, Lin Dong’s group were still unable to spot the end of this ancient battlefield. Meanwhile, the number of huge bones on the ground increased and this scene caused their expressions to become even more solemn. Although this was only a corner of the great world war, it was still possible to deduce how terrible and frightening the great world war must have been through this scene.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlong the way, Lin Dong’s group encountered many powerful individuals as well. However, all of them were guarded and showed no intentions of interacting. Nonetheless, Lin Dong was also pleased by this fact. In fact, he even quietly rejoiced when he saw that some of them were headed in his opposite direction. After all, even though Lin Dong did not think that they could pose much of a threat to him, it was always good to have one less competitor.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFour rays of light flashed across the sky, while Lin Dong’s sharp eyes scanned the ground beneath.

He turned his head to look at Little Flame, only to discover that the latter was a little absent-minded. Meanwhile, the latter’s tiger eyes were staring intently at the scar-filled ancient battleground below.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Big brother… it seems like there is something at that spot beckoning me.” Little Flame hesitated before replying.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong was startled when he heard this. He exchanged glances with Little Marten before the both of them stilled. After musing for a moment, the four of them slowly landed onto the ground. The spot where they landed, was the intersection of many hundred thousand feet large cracks. Meanwhile, darkness filled that deep gully.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“The beckoning is coming from this place?” Lin Dong pointed at the seemingly bottomless gully and asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Aye.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLittle Flame mused for a moment before he nodded solemnly.

However, I do not know which tribe that ancestor belongs to.” Little Marten voiced his thoughts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Won’t we find out once we take a look?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong smiled. His mind moved before a silver-white Mental Energy ball of light rose from his palm.

That was because they could see a huge creature at the bottom of that deep gully.

Meanwhile, its body was purely black and white in colour. At a glance, it appeared like Yin Yang was in suspension. Meanwhile, there was also one white and one black wing on its back. It laid on the ground and it had no signs of life. However, the overwhelming and peerless ferocity spreading from it, was sufficient to cause Lin Dong’s expression to become solemn.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What Tiger tribe is it from? It looks so bizzare.” The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander involuntarily asked. Amongst the current Tiger tribes, the three great tribes were the Heavenly Devil Tiger tribe, Dark Abyss Tiger tribe and Ground Shaking Lightning Tiger tribe. However, it was obvious that members of these three tribes, were not as awe-inspiring as the large black and white tiger in front of them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong slowly shook his head. Then, he turned to look at Little Marten. The latter released a deep sigh. His expression was grave as he spoke each word deliberately, “One of the ancient overlord tribes, the Darkness Saint Tiger.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1163\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1165\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1164","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM"}
