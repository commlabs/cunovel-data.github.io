Carrying her voice. ‘ In Icarias, memory remains. In Icarias waits the tomb of all that is forgotten. Where memory remains. Where he would have found his truth. Do you choose to save him now, Ogre? Do you choose to bring him to his city? When he opens his own tomb, what will he find?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do any of us find?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill you dare map your life, Ogre, by each dead child left in your wake?

I suppose I could carve out my own eyes, and then bless my newfound blindness—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you now mock my wound?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, forgive me. I was thinking of the poet who one day decided he’d seen too much.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, Kilmandaros asked, ‘And did his self-mutilation change the world?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Irrevocably, Mother.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How so?’ she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Eyes can be hard as armour. They can be hardened to see yet feel nothing, if the will is strong enough. You’ve seen such eyes, Mother – you as well, Errastas. They lie flat in the sockets, like stone walls. They are capable of witnessing any and every atrocity. Nothing gets in, nothing gets out. Now, that poet, he removed those stones. Tore away the veil, permanently. So what was inside, well, it all poured out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But, being blinded, nothing that was outside could find a way in.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed, Mother, but by then it was too late. It had to be, if you think about it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So it poured out,’ grumbled Errastas. ‘Then what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’d hazard it changed the world.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not for the better,’ Kilmandaros muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have no burning need, Errastas,’ said Sechul Lath, ‘to cure the ills of the world. This one or any other.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yet you observe critically—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If all honest observation ends up sounding critical, is it the honesty you then reject, or the act of observation?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why not both?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed, why not both?

I could weep for a reason, or weep for no reason. In the latter we find madness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And is the former any different?’ Kilmandaros asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. A part of me chooses to believe that if I weep long enough, I’ll weep myself out. And then, in the ashes – in the aftermath – will be born something else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Like what?’ Errastas demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSechul Lath shrugged. ‘Hope.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘See this hole in my face, Knuckles?
