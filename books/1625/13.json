This was an event in its own right; like most Ramtoppers Granny lived her life via the back door. There were only three times in your life when it was proper to come through the front door, and you were carried every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt opened with considerable difficulty, in a series of painful jerks and thumps. A few flakes of paint fell on to the snowdrift in front of the door, which sagged inward. Finally, when it was about halfway open, the door wedged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny sidled awkwardly through the gap and out on to the hitherto undisturbed snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had put her pointed hat on, and the long black cloak which she wore when she wanted anyone who saw her to be absolutely clear that she was a witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an elderly kitchen chair half buried in snow. In summer it was a handy place to sit and do whatever hand chores were necessary, while keeping one eye on the track. Granny hauled it out, brushed the snow off the seat, and sat down firmly with her knees apart and her arms folded defiantly. She stuck out her chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was well up but the light on this Hogswatchday was still pink and slanting. It glowed on the great cloud of steam that hung over the assembled creatures. They hadn\u0027t moved, although every now and again one of them would stamp a hoof or scratch itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny looked up at a flicker of movement. She hadn\u0027t noticed before, but every tree around her garden was so heavy with birds that it looked as though a strange brown and black spring had come early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccupying the patch where the herbs grew in summer were the wolves, sitting or lolling with their tongues hanging out. A contingent of bears was crouched behind them, with a platoon of deer beside them. Occupying the metterforical stalls was a rabble of rabbits, weasels, vermine, badgers, foxes and miscellaneous creatures who, despite the fact that they live their entire lives in a bloody atmosphere of hunter and hunted, killing or being killed by claw, talon and tooth, are generally referred to as woodland folk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rested together on the snow, their normal culinary relationships entirely forgotten, trying to outstare her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo things were immediately apparent to Granny. One was that this seemed to represent a pretty accurate cross-section of the forest life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other she couldn\u0027t help saying aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t know what this spell is,\u0027 she said. \u0027But I\u0027ll tell you this for nothing – when it wears off, some of you little buggers had better get moving.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them stirred. There was no sound except for an elderly badger relieving itself with an embarrassed expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Look,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027What can I do about it? It\u0027s no good you coming to me. He\u0027s the new lord. This is his kingdom. I can\u0027t go meddling. It\u0027s not right to go meddling, on account of I can\u0027t interfere with people ruling. It has to sort itself out, good or bad. Fundamental rule of magic, is that. You can\u0027t go round ruling people with spells, because you\u0027d have to use more and more spells all the time.\u0027 She sat back, grateful that long-standing tradition didn\u0027t allow the Crafty and the Wise to rule. She remembered what it had felt like to wear the crown, even for a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, things like crowns had a troublesome effect on clever folk; it was best to leave all the reigning to the kind of people whose eyebrows met in the middle when they tried to think. In a funny sort of way, they were much better at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe added, \u0027People have to sort it out for themselves. Well-known fact.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt that one of the larger stags was giving her a particularly doubting look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, well, so he killed the old king,\u0027 she conceded. That\u0027s nature\u0027s way, ain\u0027t it? Your lot know all about this. Survival of the wossname. You wouldn\u0027t know what an heir was, unless you thought it was a sort of rabbit.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drummed her fingers on her knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anyway, the old king wasn\u0027t much of a friend to you, was he? All that hunting, and such.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hundred pairs of dark eyes bored in at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s no good you all looking at me,\u0027 she tried. \u0027I can\u0027t go around mucking about with kings just because you don\u0027t like them. Where would it all end? It\u0027s not as if he\u0027s done me any harm.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to avoid the gaze of a particularly cross-eyed stoat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All right, so it\u0027s selfish,\u0027 she said. \u0027That\u0027s what bein\u0027 a witch is all about. Good day to you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stamped inside, and tried to slam the door. It stuck once or twice, which rather spoiled the effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside she drew the curtains and sat down in the rocking chair and rocked fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s the whole point,\u0027 she said. \u0027I can\u0027t go around meddling. That\u0027s the whole point.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lattys lurched slowly over the rutted roads, towards yet another little city whose name the company couldn\u0027t quite remember and would instantly forget. The winter sun hung low over the damp, misty cabbage fields of the Sto Plains, and the foggy silence magnified the creaking of the wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHwel sat with his stubby legs dangling over the backboard of the last latty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d done his best. Vitoller had left the education of Tomjon in his hands; \u0027You\u0027re better at all that business,\u0027 he\u0027d said, adding with his usual tact, \u0027Besides, you\u0027re more his height.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Apple,\u0027 he repeated, waving the fruit in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomjon grinned at him. He was nearly three years old, and hadn\u0027t said a word anyone could understand. Hwel was harbouring dark suspicions about the witches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But he seems bright enough,\u0027 said Mrs Vitoller, who was travelling inside the latty and darning the chain mail. \u0027He knows what things are. He does what he\u0027s told. I just wish you\u0027d speak,\u0027 she said softly, patting the boy on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHwel gave the apple to Tomjon, who accepted it gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I reckon them witches did you a bad turn, missus,\u0027 said the dwarf. \u0027You know. Changelings and whatnot. There used to be a lot of that sort of thing. My great-great-grandmother said it was done to us, once. The fairies swapped a human and a dwarf. We never realised until he started banging his head on things, they say—\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They say this fruit be like unto the world\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo sweet. Or like, say I, the heart of man\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo red without and yet within, unclue\u0027d,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe find the worm, the rot, the flaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever glows his bloom the bite\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProves many a man be rotten at the core.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them swivelled around to stare at Tomjon, who nodded to them and proceeded to eat the apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That was the Worm speech from The Tyrant,\u0027 whispered Hwel. His normal grasp of the language temporarily deserted him. \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But he sounded just like—\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m going to get Vitoller,\u0027 said Hwel, and dropped off the tailboard and ran through the frozen puddles to the front of die convoy, where the actor-manager was whistling tunelessly and, yes, strolling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What ho, b\u0027zugda-hiara[8],\u0027 he said cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027ve got to come at once! He\u0027s talking!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalking?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHwel jumped up and down. \u0027He\u0027s quoting!\u0027 he shouted. \u0027You\u0027ve got to come! He sounds just like—\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Me?\u0027 said Vitoller, a few minutes later, after they had pulled the lattys into a grove of leafless trees by the roadside. \u0027Do I sound like that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes,\u0027 chorused the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung Willikins, who specialised in female roles, prodded Tomjon gently as he stood on an upturned barrel in the middle of the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Here, boy, do you know my speech from Please Yourself!\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomjon nodded. \u0027 “He is not dead, I say, who lies beneath the stone. For if Death could but hear—” \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey listened in awed silence as the endless mists rolled across the dripping fields and the red ball of the sun floated down the sky. When the boy had finished hot tears were streaming down Hwel\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027By all the gods,\u0027 he said, when Tomjon had finished, \u0027I must have been on damn good form when I wrote that.\u0027 He blew his nose noisily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do I sound like that?\u0027 said Willikins, his face pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVitoller patted him gently on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If you sounded like that, my bonny,\u0027 he said, \u0027you wouldn\u0027t be standing arse-deep in slush in the middle of these forsaken fields, with nothing but liberated cabbage for thy tea.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clapped his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No more, no more,\u0027 he said, his breath making puffs of steam in the freezing air. \u0027Backs to it, everybody. We must be outside the walls of Sto Lat by sunset.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the grumbling actors awoke from the spell and wandered back to the shafts of the lattys Vitoller beckoned to the dwarf and put his arm around his shoulders, or rather around the top of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well?\u0027 he said. \u0027You people know all about magic, or so it is said. What do you make of it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He spends all his time around the stage, master. It\u0027s only natural that he should pick things up,\u0027 said Hwel vaguely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVitoller leaned down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you believe that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I believe I heard a voice that took my doggerel and shaped it and fired it back through my ears and straight into my heart,\u0027 said Hwel simply. \u0027I believe I heard a voice that got behind the crude shape of the words and said the things I had meant them to say, but had not the skill to achieve. Who knows where such things come from?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared impassively into Vitoller\u0027s red face. \u0027He may have inherited it from his father,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And who knows what witches may achieve?\u0027 said the dwarf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVitoller felt his wife\u0027s hand pushed into his. As he stood up, bewildered and angry, she kissed him on the back of the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t torture yourself,\u0027 she said. \u0027Isn\u0027t it all for the best? Your son has declaimed his first word.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpring came, and ex-King Verence still wasn\u0027t taking being dead lying down. He prowled the castle relentlessly, seeking for a way in which its ancient stones would release their grip on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was also trying to keep out of the way of the other ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChampot was all right, if a bit tiresome. But Verence had backed away at the first sight of the Twins, toddling hand in hand along the midnight corridors, their tiny ghosts a memorial to a deed darker even than the usual run of regicidal unpleasantness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was the Troglodyte Wanderer, a rather faded monkeyman in a furry loincloth who apparently happened to haunt the castle merely because it had been built on his burial mound. For no obvious reason a chariot with a screaming woman in it occasionally rumbled through the laundry room. As for the kitchen . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day he\u0027d given in, despite everything old Champot had said, and had followed the smells of cooking into the big, hot, high domed cavern that served the castle as kitchen and abattoir. Funny thing, that. He\u0027d never been down there since his childhood. Somehow kings and kitchens didn\u0027t go well together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was full of ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they weren\u0027t human. They weren\u0027t even proto-human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were stags. They were bullocks. They were rabbits, and pheasants, and partridges, and sheep, and pigs. There were even some round blobby things that looked unpleasantly like the ghosts of oysters. They were packed so tightly that in fact they merged and mingled, turning the kitchen into a silent, jostling nightmare of teeth and fur and horns, half-seen and misty. Several noticed him, and there was a weird blarting of noises that sounded far-off, tinny and unpleasantly out of register. Through them all the cook and his assistants wandered quite unconcernedly, making vegetarian sausages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerence had stared for half a minute and then fled, wishing that he still had a real stomach so that he could stick his fingers down his throat for forty years and bring up everything he\u0027d eaten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d sought solace in the stables, where his beloved hunting dogs had whined and scratched at the door and had generally been very ill-at-ease at his sensed but unseen presence. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-13.html","bookId":1625,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:49 PM"}
