I roll over in bed, and squint through the darkness: It’s 5:43 in the morning. My alarm doesn’t go off until 6:37.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd only then do I realize: That sound is not my alarm clock. It is a car horn, honking, sounding some kind of terrible siren song through the streets of Evanston, a howling warning of doom. Horns don’t honk this early, not with such insistence. It must be an emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI race out of bed, pull on a pair of jeans, and bolt toward the front door. I’m relieved to see both Mom and Dad alive, racing to the entryway. I say, “Jesus, what’s going on?” and my mom just shrugs and my dad says, “Is it a car horn?” I make it to the door first and peer out the glass sidelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny Cooper is parked outside my house, honking methodically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run outside and only when he sees me does he stop honking. The passenger window rolls down. “Christ, Tiny. You’re going to wake the whole neighborhood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see a can of Red Bull dancing in his huge, shaky hand. The other hand remains perched on the horn, ready to honk at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We gotta go,” he says, his voice rushed. “Gotta go go go go go go go go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gotta go to school. I’ll explain later. Get in the car.” He sounds so frantically serious, and I am so tired, that I don’t think to question him. I just race back into the house, pull on some socks and shoes, brush my teeth, tell my parents I’m going to school early, and hurry into Tiny’s car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five things, Grayson,” he says as he puts the car into drive and speeds off, without ever relinquishing his shaky hold on the can of Red Bull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Tiny, what’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing’s wrong. Everything’s right. Things couldn’t be righter. Things could be less tired. They could be less busy. They could be less caffeinated. But they couldn’t be righter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude, are you on meth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m on Red Bull.” He hands me the Red Bull, and I sniff at it, trying to figure out whether it’s laced with something. “Also coffee,” he adds. “So but listen, Grayson. Five things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe you woke up my entire neighborhood at five forty-three for no reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually,” he says, his voice louder than seems entirely necessary at such a tender hour, “I woke you up for five reasons, which is what I’ve been trying to tell you, except that you keep interrupting me, which is just a very, like, Tiny Cooper thing of you to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve known Tiny Cooper since he was a very large and very gay fifth grader. I’ve seen him drunk and sober, hungry and sated, loud and louder, in love and in longing. I have seen him in good times and bad, in sickness and in health. And in lo those many years, he has never before made a self-deprecating joke. And I can’t help but think: maybe Tiny Cooper should fry his brain with caffeine more often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, what are the five things?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One, I finished casting the show last night around eleven while I was skyping with Will Grayson. He helped me. I imitated all the potential auditioners, and then he helped me decide who was least horrible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The other Will Grayson,” I correct him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two,” he says, as if he hasn’t heard me. “Shortly thereafter, Will went to bed. And I was thinking to myself, you know, it’s been eight days since I met him, and I haven’t technically liked someone who liked me back for eight days in my entire life, unless you count my relationship with Bethany Keene in third grade, which obviously you can’t, since she’s a girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three, and then I was thinking about that and lying in the bed staring up at the ceiling, and I could see the stars that we stuck up there in like sixth grade or whatever. Do you remember that? The glow-in-the-dark stars and the comet and everything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, but he doesn’t look over, even though we’re stopped at a light. “Well,” he goes on, “I was looking at those stars and they were fading away because it had been a few minutes since I’d turned out the light, and then I had a blinding light spiritual awakening. What is Tiny Dancer about? I mean, what is its subject, Grayson? You’ve read it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI assume that, as usual, he is asking this question rhetorically, so I say nothing so he’ll go on ranting, because as painful as it is for me to admit, there is something kind of wonderful about Tiny’s ranting, particularly on a quiet street when I am still half asleep. There is something about the mere act of him speaking that is vaguely pleasurable even though I wish it weren’t. It is something about his voice, not his pitch or his rapid-fire, caffeinated diction, but the voice itself—the familiarity of it, I guess, but also its inexhaustibility. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/will-grayson-will-grayson/page-18.html","bookId":2712,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:26 AM"}
