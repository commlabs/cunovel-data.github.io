The plane sat idle on the tarmac while the flight attendants strolled��so casually��up and down the aisle, patting the bags in the overhead compartments to make sure everything fit. The pilots leaned out of the cockpit, chatting with them as they passed. Alice\u0027s hand was hard on my shoulder, holding me in my seat while I bounced anxiously up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s faster than running,\" she reminded me in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just nodded in time with my bouncing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last the plane rolled lazily from the gate, building speed with a gradual steadiness that tortured me further. I expected some kind of relief when we achieved liftoff, but my frenzied impatience didn\u0027t lessen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice lifted the phone on the back of the seat in front of her before we\u0027d stopped climbing, turning her back on the stewardess who eyed her with disapproval. Something about my expression stopped the stewardess from coming over to protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to tune out what Alice was murmuring to Jasper; I didn\u0027t want to hear the words again, but some slipped through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t be sure, I keep seeing him do different things, he keeps changing his mind�� A killing spree through the city, attacking the guard, lifting a car over his head in the main square�� mostly things that would expose them��he knows that\u0027s the fastest way to force a reaction��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you can\u0027t.\" Alice\u0027s voice dropped till it was nearly inaudible, though I was sitting inches from her. Contrarily, I listened harder. \"Tell Emmett no�� Well, go after Emmett and Rosalie and bring them back�� Think about it, Jasper. If he sees any of us, what do you think he will do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Exactly. I think Bella is the only chance��if there is a chance�� I\u0027ll do everything that can be done, but prepare Carlisle; the odds aren\u0027t good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed then, and there was a catch in her voice. \"I\u0027ve thought of that�� Yes, I promise.\" Her voice became pleading. \"Don\u0027t follow me. I promise, Jasper. One way or another, I\u0027ll get out�� And I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hung up, and leaned back in her seat with her eyes closed. \"I hate lying to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me everything, Alice,\" I begged. \"I don\u0027t understand. Why did you tell Jasper to stop Emmett, why can\u0027t they come help us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two reasons,\" she whispered, her eyes still closed. \"The first I told him. We could try to stop Edward ourselves��if Emmett could get his hands on him, we might be able to stop him long enough to convince him you\u0027re alive. But we can\u0027t sneak up on Edward. And if he sees us coming for him, he\u0027ll just act that much faster. He\u0027ll throw a Buiclc through a wall or something, and the Volturi will take him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the second reason of course, the reason I couldn\u0027t say to Jasper. Because if they\u0027re there and the Volturi kill Edward, they\u0027ll fight them. Bella.\" She opened her eyes and stared at me, beseeching. \"If there were any chance we could win�� if there were a way that the four of us could save my brother by fighting for him, maybe it would be different. But we can\u0027t, and, Bella, I can\u0027t lose Jasper like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized why her eyes begged for my understanding. She was protecting Jasper, at our expense, and maybe at Edward\u0027s, too. I understood, and I did not think badly of her. I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t Edward hear you, though.\u0027\" I asked. \"Wouldn\u0027t he know, as soon as he heard your thoughts,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat I was alive, that there was no point to this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that there was any justification, either way. I still couldn\u0027t believe that he was capable of reacting like this. It made no sense! I remembered with painful clarity his words that day on the sofa, while we watched Romeo and Juliet kill themselves, one after the other. I wasn\u0027t going to live without you, he\u0027d said, as if it should be such an obvious conclusion. But the words he had spoken in the forest as he\u0027d left me had canceled all that out��forcefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he were listening,\" she explained. \"But believe it or not, it\u0027s possible to lie with your thoughts. If you had died, I would still try to stop him. And I would be thinking \u0027she\u0027s alive, she\u0027s alive\u0027 as hard as I could. He knows that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ground my teeth in mute frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there were any way to do this without you, Bella, I wouldn\u0027t be endangering you like this. It\u0027s very wrong of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be stupid. I\u0027m the last thing you should be worrying about.\" I shook my head impatiently. \"Tell me what you meant, about hating to lie to Jasper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled a grim smile. \"I promised him I would get out before they killed me, too. It\u0027s not something I can guarantee��not by a long shot.\" She raised her eyebrows, as if willing me to take the danger more seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are these Volturi?\" I demanded in a whisper. \"What makes them so much more dangerous than Emmett, Jasper, Rosalie, and you?\" It was hard to imagine something scarier than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath, and then abruptly leveled a dark glance over my shoulder. I turned in time to see the man in the aisle seat looking away as if he wasn\u0027t listening to us. He appeared to be a businessman, in a dark suit with a power tie and a laptop on his knees. While I stared at him with irritation, he opened the computer and very conspicuously put headphones on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned closer to Alice. Her lips were at my ears as she breathed the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was surprised that you recognized the name,\" she said. \"That you understood so immediately what it meant��when I said he was going to Italy. I thought I would have to explain. How much did Edward tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just said they were an old, powerful family��like royalty. That you didn\u0027t antagonize them unless you wanted to�� die,\" I whispered. The last word was hard to choke out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to understand,\" she said, her voice slower, more measured now. \"We Cullens are unique in more ways than you know. It\u0027s�� abnormal for so many of us to live together in peace. It\u0027s the same for Tanya\u0027s family in the north, and Carlisle speculates that abstaining makes it easier for us to be civilized, to form bonds based on love rather than survival or convenience. Even James\u0027s little coven of three was unusually large��and you saw how easily Laurent left them. Our kind travel alone, or in pairs, as a general rule. Carlisle\u0027s family is the biggest in existence, as far as I know, with the one exception. The Volturi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were three of them originally, Aro, Caius, and Marcus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen them,\" I mumbled. \"In the picture in Carlisle\u0027s study.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice nodded. \"Two females joined them over time, and the five of them make up the family. I\u0027m not sure,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut I suspect that their age is what gives them the ability to live peacefully together. They are well over three thousand years old. Or maybe it\u0027s their gifts that give them extra tolerance. Like Edward and I, Aro and Marcus are�� talented.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued before I could ask. \"Or maybe it\u0027s just their love of power that binds them together. Royalty is an apt description.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if there are only five��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five that make up the family,\" she corrected. \"That doesn\u0027t include their guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. \"That sounds�� serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it is,\" she assured me. \"There were nine members of the guard that were permanent, the last time we heard. Others are more�� transitory. It changes. And many of them are gifted as well��with formidable gifts, gifts that make what I can do look like a parlor trick. The Volturi chose them for their abilities, physical or otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth, and then closed it. I didn\u0027t think I wanted to know how bad the odds were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded again, as if she understood exactly what I was thinking. \"They don\u0027t get into too many confrontations. No one is stupid enough to mess with them. They stay in their city, leaving only as duty calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duty?\" I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t Edward tell you what they do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, feeling the blank expression on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice looked over my head again, toward the businessman, and put her wintry lips back to my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a reason he called them royalty�� the ruling class. Over the millennia, they have assumed the position of enforcing our rules��which actually translates to punishing transgressors. They fulfill that duty decisively.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes popped wide with shock. \"There are rules?\" I asked in a voice that was too loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t somebody have mentioned this to me earlier?\" I whispered angrily. \"I mean, I wanted to be a�� to be one of you! Shouldn\u0027t somebody have explained the rules to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice chuckled once at my reaction. \"It\u0027s not that complicated, Bella. There\u0027s only one core restriction��and if you think about it, you can probably figure it out for yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. \"Nope, I have no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, disappointed. \"Maybe it\u0027s too obvious. We just have to keep our existence a secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I mumbled. It was obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes sense, and most of us don\u0027t need policing,\" she continued. \"But, after a few centuries, sometimes one of us gets bored. Or crazy. I dor\u0027t know. And then the Volturi step in before it can\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecompromise them, or the rest of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Edward��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is planning to flout that in their own city��the city they\u0027ve secretly held for three thousand years, since the time of the Etruscans. They are so protective of their city that they don\u0027t allow hunting within its walls. Volterra is probably the safest city in the world��from vampire attack at the very least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said they didn\u0027t leave. How do they eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t leave. They bring in their food from the outside, from quite far away sometimes. It gives their guard something to do when they\u0027re not out annihilating mavericks. Or protecting Volterra from exposure��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From situations like this one, like Edward,\" I finished her sentence. It was amazingly easy to say his name now. I wasn\u0027t sure what the difference was. Maybe because I wasn\u0027t really planning on living much longer without seeing him. Or at all, if we were too late. It was comforting to know that I would have an easy out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt they\u0027ve ever had a situation quite like this,\" she muttered, disgusted. \"You don\u0027t get a lot of suicidal vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound that escaped out of my mouth was very quiet, but Alice seemed to understand that it was a cry of pain. She wrapped her thin, strong arm around my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll do what we can, Bella. It\u0027s not over yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\" I let her comfort me, though I knew she thought our chances were poor. \"And the Volturi will get us if we mess up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice stiffened. \"You say that like it\u0027s a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knock it off, Bella, or we\u0027re turning around in New York and going back to Forks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what. If we\u0027re too late for Edward, I\u0027m going to do my damnedest to get you back to Charlie, and I don\u0027t want any trouble from you. Do you understand that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Alice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled back slightly so that she could glare at me. \"No trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scout\u0027s honor,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me concentrate, now. I\u0027m trying to see what he\u0027s planning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left her arm around me, but let her head fall back against the seat and closed her eyes. She pressed her free hand to the side of her face, rubbing her fingertips against her temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched her in fascination for a long time. Eventually, she became utterly motionless, hei face like a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estone sculpture. The minutes passed, and if I didn\u0027t know better, I would have thought she\u0027d fallen asleep. I didn\u0027t dare interrupt her to ask what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished there was something safe for me to think about. I couldn\u0027t allow myself to consider the horrors we were headed toward, or, more horrific yet, the chance that we might fail��not if I wanted to keep from screaming aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t anticipate anything, either. Maybe, if I were very, very, very lucky, I would somehow be able to save Edward. But I wasn\u0027t so stupid as to think that saving him would mean that I could stay with him. I was no different, no more special than I\u0027d been before. There would be no new reason for him to want me now. Seeing him and losing him again��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fought back against the pain. This was the price I had to pay to save his life. I would pay it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey showed a movie, and my neighbor got headphones. Sometimes I watched the figures moving across the little screen, but I couldn\u0027t even tell if the movie was supposed to be a romance or a horror film.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter an eternity, the plane began to descend toward New York City. Alice remained in her trance. I dithered, reaching out to touch her, only to pull my hand back again. This happened a dozen times before the plane touched town with a jarring impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice,\" I finally said. \"Alice, we have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touched her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes came open very slowly. She shook her head from side to side for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything new?\" I asked in a low voice, conscious of the man listening on the other side of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly,\" she breathed in a voice I could barely catch. \"He\u0027s getting closer. He\u0027s deciding how he\u0027s going to ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had to run for our connection, but that was good��better than having to wait. As soon as the plane was in the air, Alice closed her eyes and slid back into the same stupor as before. I waited as patiently as I could. When it was dark again, I opened the window to stare out into the flat black that was no better than the window shade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was grateful that I\u0027d had so many months\u0027 practice with controlling my thoughts. Instead of dwelling on the terrifying possibilities that, no matter what Alice said, I did not intend to survive, I concentrated on lesser problems. Like, what I was going to say to Charlie if I got back:\u0027 That was a thorny enough problem to occupy several hours. And Jacob? He\u0027d promised to wait for me, but did that promise still apply? Would I end up home alone in Forks, with no one at all? Maybe I didn\u0027t want to survive, no matter what happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like seconds later when Alice shook my shoulder��I hadn\u0027t realized I\u0027d fallen asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,\" she hissed, her voice a little too loud in the darkened cabin full of sleeping humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t disoriented��I hadn\u0027t been out long enough for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice\u0027s eyes gleamed in the dim light of a reading lamp in the row behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not wrong.\" She smiled fiercely. \"It\u0027s right. They\u0027re deliberating, but they\u0027ve decided to tell him no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Volturi?\" I muttered, groggy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Bella, keep up. I can see what they\u0027re going to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tellme.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn attendant tiptoed down the aisle to us. \"Can I get you ladies a pillow?\" His hushed whisper was a rebuke to our comparatively loud conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you.\" Alice beamed at up at him, her smile shockingly lovely. The attendant\u0027s expression was dazed as he turned and stumbled his way back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me,\" I breathed almost silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispered into my ear. \"They\u0027re interested in him��they think his talent could be uselul. They\u0027re going to offer him a place with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see that yet, but I\u0027ll bet it\u0027s colorful.\" She grinned again. \"This is the first good news��the first break. They\u0027re intrigued; they truly don\u0027t want to destroy him��\u0027wasteful,\u0027 that\u0027s the word Aro will use��and that may be enough to force him to get creative. The longer he spends on his plans, the better for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t enough to make me hopeful, to make me feel the relief she obviously felt. There were still so many ways that we could be too late. And if I didn\u0027t get through the walls into the Volturi city, I wouldn\u0027t be able to stop Alice from dragging me back home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m confused. How are you seeing this so clearly? And then other times, you see things far away��things that don\u0027t happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes tightened. I wondered if she guessed what I was thinking of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s clear because it\u0027s immediate and close, and I\u0027m really concentrating. The faraway things that come on their own��those are just glimpses, faint maybes. Plus, I see my kind more easily than yours. Edward is even easier because I\u0027m so attuned to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see me sometimes,\" I reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Not as clearly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"I really wish you could have been right about me. In the beginning, when you first saw things about me, before we even met��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw me become one of you.\" I barely mouthed the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"It was a possibility at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the time,\" I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, Bella��\" She hesitated, and then seemed to make a choice. \"Honestly, I think it\u0027s all gotten beyond ridiculous. I\u0027m debating whether to just change you myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her, frozen with shock. Instantly, my mind resisted her words. I couldn\u0027t afford that kind of hope if she changed her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I scare you?\" she wondered. \"I thought that\u0027s what you wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do!\" I gasped. \"Oh, Alice, do it now! I could help you so much��and I wouldn\u0027t slow you down. Bite me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh,\" she cautioned. The attendant was looking in our direction again. \"Try to be reasonable,\" she whispered. \"We don\u0027t have enough time. We have to get into Volterra tomorrow. You\u0027d be writhing in pain for days.\" She made a face. \"And I don\u0027t think the other passengers would react well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip. \"If you don\u0027t do it now, you\u0027ll change your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She frowned, her expression unhappy. \"I don\u0027t think I will. He\u0027ll be furious, but what will he be able to do about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart beat faster. \"Nothing at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed quietly, and then sighed. \"You have too much faith in me, Bella. I\u0027m not sure that I can. I\u0027ll probably just end up killing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take my chances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so bizarre, even for a human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh well, this is purely hypothetical at this point, anyway. First we have to live through tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good point.\" But at least I had something to hope for if we did. If Alice made good on her promise��and if she didn\u0027t kill me��then Edward could run after his distractions all he wanted, and I could follow. I wouldn\u0027t let him be distracted. Maybe, when I was beautiful and strong, he wouldn\u0027t want distractions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go back to sleep,\" she encouraged me. \"I\u0027ll wake you up when there\u0027s something new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" I grumbled, certain that sleep was a lost cause now. Alice pulled her legs up on the seat, wrapping her arms around them and leaning her forehead against her knees. She rocked back and forth as she concentrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested my head against the seat, watching her, and the next thing I knew, she was snapping the shade closed against the faint brightening in the eastern sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening?\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve told him no,\" she said quietly. I noticed at once that her enthusiasm was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice choked in my throat with panic. \"What\u0027s he going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was chaotic at first. I was only getting flickers, he was changing plans so quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kinds of plans?\" I pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a bad hour,\" she whispered. \"He\u0027d decided to go hunting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me, seeing the comprehension in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the city,\" she explained. \"It got very close. He changed his mind at the last minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wouldn\u0027t want to disappoint Carlisle,\" I mumbled. Not at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will there be enough time?\" As I spoke, there was a shift in the cabin pressure. I could feel the plane angling downward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hoping so��if he sticks to his latest decision, maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to keep it simple. He\u0027s just going to walk out into the sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust walk out into the sun. That was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be enough. The image of Edward in the meadow��glowing, shimmering like his skin was made of a million diamond facets��was burned into my memory. No human who saw that would ever forget. The Volturi couldn\u0027t possibly allow it. Not if they wanted to keep their city inconspicuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the slight gray glow that shone through the opened windows. \"We\u0027ll be too late,\" I whispered, my throat closing in panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Right now, he\u0027s leaning toward the melodramatic. He wants the biggest audience possible, so he\u0027ll choose the main plaza, under the clock tower. The walls are high there. He\u0027ll wait till the sun is exactly overhead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we have till noon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we\u0027re lucky. If he sticks with this decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot came on over the intercom, announcing, first in French and then in English, our imminent landing. The seat belt lights dinged and flashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How far is it from Florence to Volterra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That depends on how fast you drive�� Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyed me speculatively. \"How strongly are you opposed to grand theft auto?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bright yellow Porsche screamed to a stop a few feet in front of where I paced, the word TURBO scrawled in silver cursive across its back. Everyone beside me on the crowded airport sidewalk stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry, Bella!\" Alice shouted impatiently through the open passenger window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran to the door and threw myself in, feeling as though I might as well be wearing a black stocking over my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheesh, Alice,\" I complained. \"Could you pick a more conspicuous car to steal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interior was black leather, and the windows were tinted dark. It felt safer inside, like nighttime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice was already weaving, too fast, through the thick airport traffic��sliding through tiny spaces between the cars as I cringed and fumbled for my seat belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The important question,\" she corrected, \"is whether I could have stolen a faster car, and I don\u0027t think so. I got lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure that will be very comforting at the roadblock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe trilled a laugh. \"Trust me, Bella. If anyone sets up a roadblock, it will be behind us.\" She hit the gas then, as if to prove her point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI probably should have watched out the window as first the city of Florence and then the Tuscan landscape flashed past with blurring speed. This was my first trip anywhere, and maybe my last, too. But Alice\u0027s driving frightened me, despite the fact that I knew I could trust her behind the wheel. And I was too tortured with anxiety to really see the hills or the walled towns that looked like castles in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you see anything more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something going on,\" Alice muttered. \"Some kind of festival. The streets are full of people and red flags. What\u0027s the date today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t entirely sure. \"The nineteenth, maybe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s ironic. It\u0027s Saint Marcus Day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckled darkly. \"The city holds a celebration every year. As the legend goes, a Christian missionary, a Father Marcus��Marcus of the Voltun, in fact��drove all the vampires from Volterra fifteen hundred years ago. The story claims he was martyred in Romania, still trying to drive away the vampire scourge. Of course that\u0027s nonsense��he\u0027s never left the city. But that\u0027s where some of the superstitions about things like crosses and garlic come from. Father Marcus used them so successfully. And vampires don\u0027t trouble Volterra, so they must work.\" Her smile was sardonic. \"It\u0027s become more of a celebration of the city, and recognition for the police force��after all, Volterra is an amazingly safe city. The police get the credit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was realizing what she meant when she\u0027d said ironic. \"They\u0027re not going to be very happy if Edward messes things up for them on St. Marcus Day, are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, her expression grim. \"No. They\u0027ll act very quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked away, fighting against my teeth as they tried to break through the skin of my lower lip. Bleeding was not the best idea right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was terrifyingly high in the pale blue sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s still planning on noon?\" I checked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He\u0027s decided to wait. And they\u0027re waiting for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what I have to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her eyes on the winding road��the needle on the speedometer was touching the far right on the dial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to do anything. He just has to see you before he moves into the light. And he has to see you before he sees me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are we going to work that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small red car seemed to be racing backward as Alice zoomed around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get you as close as possible, and then you\u0027re going to run in the direction I point you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try not to trip,\" she added. \"We don\u0027t have time for a concussion today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned. That would be just like me��ruin everything, destroy the world, in a moment of klutziness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun continued to climb in the sky while Alice raced against it. It was too brigh:, and that had me panicking. Maybe he wouldn\u0027t feel the need to wait for noon after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" Alice said abruptly, pointing to the castle city atop the closest hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at it, feeling the very first hint of a new kind of fear. Every minute since yesterday morning��it seemed like a week ago��when Alice had spoken his name at the foot of the stairs, there had been only one fear. And yet, now, as I stared at the ancient sienna walls and towers crowning the peak of the steep hill, I felt another, more selfish kind of dread thrill through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI supposed the city was very beautiful. It absolutely terrified me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Volterra,\" Alice announced in a flat, icy voice. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-2-new-moon-twilight-2/page-20.html","bookId":2024,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM"}
