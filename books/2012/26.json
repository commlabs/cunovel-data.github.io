Words like that just dig big holes and invite us to jump.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced away. ‘I’m sorry.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Go, catch up to them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe collected his reins, swung his mount round and tapped its flanks with his heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you gamble on this, too, Olar Ethil? How smug will you sound in your greeting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell now, enjoy your time, because it won’t last for ever. Not if I have any say in the matter. Do not worry, Toc, I’ve not forgotten. For you, I will do this, or die in the effort .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rode at a canter across the empty land, until he drew within sight of the Bonecaster and her three charges. When the twins turned and cried out in relief, it very nearly broke him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetoc had watched the young Awl warrior ride after Olar Ethil, saw when he reached them. An exchange of words, and then they set out once more, walking until the deceptive folds of the landscape swallowed them all. Then she turned, studied Cartographer. ‘The boy was crying in grief. Over his dead dog. You told him to stop. Why? Why should that have so bothered you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How is it,’ the undead man said, rising from the barrow and shuffling closer, ‘that the weakest among us is the only one so willing to give up his life protecting those children? I do not mean to wound you with my words, Setoc. I but struggle to understand this.’ The withered face tilted to one side, pitted eye sockets seeming to study her. ‘Is it, perhaps, because he has the least to lose?’ He continued on in his awkward steps, to stand over the carcass of the ay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course he has,’ she snapped. ‘As you said, just his life.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCartographer looked down at the corpse of Baaljagg. ‘And this one had even less.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Go back to your dead world, will you? It’s so much simpler there, I’m sure. You can stop wondering about the things us pathetic mortals get up to.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am a knower of maps, Setoc. Listen to my words. You cannot cross the Glass Desert. When you reach it, turn southward, on to the South Elan. It is not much better, but there should be enough, at least to give you a chance.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough what? Food? Water? Hope? ‘You are remaining here. Why?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In this place,’ Cartographer gestured, ‘the world of the dead has arrived. Here, you are the unwelcome stranger.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly shaken, inexplicably distraught, Setoc shook her head. ‘Gruntle said you were with them almost from the very beginning. Now you’re just stopping. Here?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Must we all have a purpose?’ Cartographer asked. ‘I did, once, but that is done with.’ His head turned, faced northward. ‘Your company was … admirable. But I’d forgotten.’ He hesitated, and she was about to ask what he’d forgotten when he said, ‘Things break.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes,’ she whispered, not loud enough for him to hear. She reached down and collected the bundle of her gear. Straightening, she set out. Then paused and glanced back at him. ‘Cartographer, what did Gruntle say to you, at the barrow?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘“The past is a demon that not even death can shake.”’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What did he mean by that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, still studying Baaljagg’s carcass. ‘I told him this: I have found the living in my dreams, and they are not well.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away, began walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDust devils spun and raced along, tracking her on either side. Masan Gilani knew all about this. She’d heard all the old stories of the Seven Cities campaign, how the Logros T’lan Imass had a way of just vanishing, whispering on the winds or twisting along on the currents of some river. Easy for them. Rising from the ground at the end of it all not even out of breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted. Breath, that was a good one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer horse was reluctant this morning. Not enough water, not enough forage, hadn’t crapped or pissed in a day and a night. Wouldn’t last much longer, she suspected, unless her companions could conjure up a spring and a heap of hay or a bag or two of oats. Could they do things like that? She had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Be serious, woman. They looked as if a sleeping dragon had rolled over them. If they could magic stuff out of nowhere, well, they’d have done something by now.’ She was hungry and thirsty too, and if it came to it she’d slit her horse’s neck and feast until her belly exploded. ‘Put that back together, will you? Thanks.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot far now. By her reckoning, she’d be on the Bonehunters’ trail before noon, and by dusk she’d have caught up with them – no army that size could move very quickly. They were carrying enough supplies to feed a decent-sized town for half a year. She glanced northward, something she found she was doing rather often of late. No surprise in that impulse, however. It wasn’t every day that a mountain grew up out of nowhere in the course of a single day and night, and what a storm accompanied its birth! She thought to hitch to one side for a spit or two, to punctuate the sardonic wonder she’d just chewed on. But spit was worth keeping. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-26.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
