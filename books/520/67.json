{"id":44733,"no":67,"title":"24th July","content":"Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Isn\u0027t it fun to work--or don\u0027t you ever do it? It\u0027s especially\n\u003cbr\u003e fun when your kind of work is the thing you\u0027d rather do more than\n\u003cbr\u003e anything else in the world. I\u0027ve been writing as fast as my pen\n\u003cbr\u003e would go every day this summer, and my only quarrel with life\n\u003cbr\u003e is that the days aren\u0027t long enough to write all the beautiful\n\u003cbr\u003e and valuable and entertaining thoughts I\u0027m thinking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve finished the second draft of my book and am going to begin\n\u003cbr\u003e the third tomorrow morning at half-past seven. It\u0027s the sweetest\n\u003cbr\u003e book you ever saw--it is, truly. I think of nothing else. \n\u003cbr\u003e I can barely wait in the morning to dress and eat before beginning;\n\u003cbr\u003e then I write and write and write till suddenly I\u0027m so tired that I\u0027m\n\u003cbr\u003e limp all over. Then I go out with Colin (the new sheep dog) and romp\n\u003cbr\u003e through the fields and get a fresh supply of ideas for the next day. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s the most beautiful book you ever saw--Oh, pardon--I said\n\u003cbr\u003e that before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You don\u0027t think me conceited, do you, Daddy dear?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m not, really, only just now I\u0027m in the enthusiastic stage. \n\u003cbr\u003e Maybe later on I\u0027ll get cold and critical and sniffy. No, I\u0027m sure\n\u003cbr\u003e I won\u0027t! This time I\u0027ve written a real book. Just wait till you\n\u003cbr\u003e see it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ll try for a minute to talk about something else. I never told you,\n\u003cbr\u003e did I, that Amasai and Carrie got married last May? They are still\n\u003cbr\u003e working here, but so far as I can see it has spoiled them both. \n\u003cbr\u003e She used to laugh when he tramped in mud or dropped ashes on the floor,\n\u003cbr\u003e but now--you should hear her scold! And she doesn\u0027t curl her hair\n\u003cbr\u003e any longer. Amasai, who used to be so obliging about beating\n\u003cbr\u003e rugs and carrying wood, grumbles if you suggest such a thing. \n\u003cbr\u003e Also his neckties are quite dingy--black and brown, where they\n\u003cbr\u003e used to be scarlet and purple. I\u0027ve determined never to marry. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s a deteriorating process, evidently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There isn\u0027t much of any farm news. The animals are all in the best\n\u003cbr\u003e of health. The pigs are unusually fat, the cows seem contented\n\u003cbr\u003e and the hens are laying well. Are you interested in poultry? \n\u003cbr\u003e If so, let me recommend that invaluable little work, 200 Eggs per\n\u003cbr\u003e Hen per Year. I am thinking of starting an incubator next spring\n\u003cbr\u003e and raising broilers. You see I\u0027m settled at Lock Willow permanently. \n\u003cbr\u003e I have decided to stay until I\u0027ve written 114 novels like Anthony\n\u003cbr\u003e Trollope\u0027s mother. Then I shall have completed my life work and can\n\u003cbr\u003e retire and travel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. James McBride spent last Sunday with us. Fried chicken and ice-cream\n\u003cbr\u003e for dinner, both of which he appeared to appreciate. I was awfully\n\u003cbr\u003e glad to see him; he brought a momentary reminder that the world at\n\u003cbr\u003e large exists. Poor Jimmie is having a hard time peddling his bonds. \n\u003cbr\u003e The `Farmers\u0027 National\u0027 at the Corners wouldn\u0027t have anything\n\u003cbr\u003e to do with them in spite of the fact that they pay six per cent. \n\u003cbr\u003e interest and sometimes seven. I think he\u0027ll end up by going home\n\u003cbr\u003e to Worcester and taking a job in his father\u0027s factory. He\u0027s too open\n\u003cbr\u003e and confiding and kind-hearted ever to make a successful financier. \n\u003cbr\u003e But to be the manager of a flourishing overall factory is a very\n\u003cbr\u003e desirable position, don\u0027t you think? Just now he turns up his nose\n\u003cbr\u003e at overalls, but he\u0027ll come to them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I hope you appreciate the fact that this is a long letter from\n\u003cbr\u003e a person with writer\u0027s cramp. But I still love you, Daddy dear,\n\u003cbr\u003e and I\u0027m very happy. With beautiful scenery all about, and lots\n\u003cbr\u003e to eat and a comfortable four-post bed and a ream of blank paper\n\u003cbr\u003e and a pint of ink--what more does one want in the world?\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours as always,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. The postman arrives with some more news. We are to expect\n\u003cbr\u003e Master Jervie on Friday next to spend a week. That\u0027s a very\n\u003cbr\u003e pleasant prospect--only I am afraid my poor book will suffer. \n\u003cbr\u003e Master Jervie is very demanding.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59789.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
