She was nervous, but not about the verdict. She knew she would be found innocent. Frank Hammond had told her so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just do exactly what I tell you, Grace, and leave the rest to me. The jury will acquit you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Frank spoke, it was like listening to the voice of the prophet. Grace had followed his instructions to the letter, even down to her courtroom attire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not your job to look contrite. You\u0027re innocent. I want you to walk into that courtroom proudly, with your head held high. Remember, you\u0027re representing Lenny as well as yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenny. Darling, Lenny. Are you watching, sweetheart? Are you proud of me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Grace\u0027s nerves were not about the verdict. They were about what would happen once the case was over. How am I going to find out who framed Lenny? So far the FBI had conspicuously failed to track down more than a few million of the missing Quorum money. If they can\u0027t find that money, what hope do I have? But she had to do it. She had to clear Lenny\u0027s name. He\u0027d been gone six months now. It was already December, almost Christmas. My first Christmas as a widow. Despite being Jewish, Lenny had always loved Christmas, the present giving, the parties. He had such a generous spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe judge\u0027s voice sounded distant, unreal. He addressed the foreman of the jury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you reached your verdict?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose I\u0027ll spend Christmas with the Merrivales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristmas was a time for family, but both Grace\u0027s sisters had let her down badly. Neither of them had called or visited since she\u0027d been arrested. Grace had half hoped, half expected to see them in the public gallery when the trial started, but Connie and Honor were both conspicuous by their absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I\u0027m found innocent, I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll come back to me. When they do, I\u0027ll forgive them. I\u0027m going to need their support if I\u0027m going to put things right. If I\u0027m going to find out who really stole that money. Who framed my darling Lenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe foreman looked at Grace and smiled. Grace smiled back. He seemed like a nice man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you find the defendant, on the charge of securities fraud?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistrict Attorney Angelo Michele punched the air. So there wasn\u0027t a strategy! Big Frank Hammond just screwed this thing up. He\u0027s not so invincible after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace started to feel the first stirrings of panic. She looked at Frank Hammond, but his eyes were fixed on the judge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And on the charge of money laundering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! I\u0027m not guilty. This is a mistake! I did everything Frank told me to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the charge of perjury...wire fraud...mail fraud...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words tore into Grace like razor blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guilty...guilty...guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is wrong! Please, Your Honor. This is all a mistake. I\u0027m innocent and so is my husband! We were framed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boos and catcalls from the public gallery were so deafening, Grace could barely hear her own words. It took a full minute for the judge to restore order. When he did, he turned to Grace with chilling anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grace Brookstein. Between you, you and your husband robbed your investors of an almost unimaginable sum of money. The human suffering brought about by your actions has been profound. Yet at no point have you shown the slightest remorse. You seem to have taken a view that because of your privileged position in society, the laws of this great nation do not apply to you. They do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gallery roared their approval. Grace could hear the muffled cheers from the crowds gathered outside, watching the proceedings on specially erected screens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your decision to plead not guilty in this courtroom, knowing the overwhelming evidence against you, compounds an already despicable crime. It is this utter disregard for the law, as well as for the pain your victims have suffered, that has informed my decision with regard to your sentence. I do not doubt that your denial of any knowledge of your husband\u0027s business practices is a lie, a lie you have shamelessly repeated both to this court and to the authorities struggling to repay your husband\u0027s victims. For this, I intend to see to it that you spend the remainder of natural life deprived of your freedom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe judge was still speaking, passing sentence, but Grace no longer heard him. What the hell happened? What went wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Hammond sat beside her slumped over the table, his head in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she felt the bailiff\u0027s grip tighten on her arm, Grace looked up at John Merrivale. He mouthed the words \"Don\u0027t worry,\" but his stricken face said it all. Even Caroline, who\u0027d been cold and unsupportive in the run-up to the trial, looked shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace felt sick, not for herself but for Lenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve failed him. I\u0027ve let him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow am I ever going to prove his innocence now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eON THE STEPS OF THE COURTHOUSE, Angelo Michele was being mobbed. Throngs of people pressed forward to shake his hand and pat him on the back. He had avenged them, avenged New York, avenged the poor, the dispossessed, the homeless, avenged all the victims of the Brooksteins\u0027 avarice and greed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA reporter pulled Harry Bain aside. \"Look at Michele. They love him. It\u0027s like he\u0027s Joe DiMaggio back from the dead or something. The guy\u0027s a rock star.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s more than that,\" Harry Bain said. \"He\u0027s a hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Angelo Michele, the show was over. But for Harry Bain and Gavin Williams, it had barely begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey still had to find that money. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-10.html","bookId":2373,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:31 AM"}
