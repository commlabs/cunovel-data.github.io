Her fiery red hair swayed with the wind, while her exquisite and alluring face was filled with murderous intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWild and violent Yuan Power circled and rose around Tang Xinlian’s body like a rising tornado. In fact, even the surrounding air was pressured until it crackled and exploded. It was quite a startling sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany pairs of eyes outside the Immeasurable Mirror were staring at this fiery red figure, who had voluntarily stepped forward. Their eyes were filled with shock. Tang Xinlian’s reputation was clearly comparable to her beauty within this Chaotic Demon Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha, you are indeed worthy of the title Flame Fairy. Your charisma and charm are not inferior to that of a man.” Hua Chen looked at Tang Xinlian, who was holding the long spear and staring back at him. His eyes became focused as he said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Xinlian stared at Hua Chen. Her originally bright enchanting eyes were now icy-cold and filled with the desire to kill. Pointing the Fire Phoenix Spear in her hand towards the distant Hua Chen, she spoke faintly: “I will be your opponent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHua Chen narrowed his eyes. He was well aware of Tang Xinlian’s strength. In a real fight, it would be possible for her to tie him down for a while. However, right now, he had to obtain the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black robed man, leaning on a stone wall on one of the peaks, slowly took off his hat, revealing his strange, bandage covered face. A pair of diamond shaped eyes stared at Tang Xinlian from under the bandage. After which, he slowly took a step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany cracks emerged on the rocks under his feet, as he stepped forward. A frightening ripple was emitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a soft laughter sounded just as Xu Xiu stepped forward. A blue light flashed and directly appeared in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, but you should not intervene in their fight.” Zhou Ze looked at Xu Xiu with a smile as he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are no match for me.” Xu Xiu’s diamond shaped eyes looked at Zhou Ze, who was standing in front of him, before he remarked in a hoarse voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you don’t try, how would you know?” Zhou Ze laughed. A faint white light was emitted from within his body, while an earthshaking scream seemed to be vaguely emitted. It caused the entire place to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems like in order to obtain the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol, a fight is inevitable.” Hua Chen grinned when he saw this scene. A dark chill quickly surged from deep within his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In that case… I will have to kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid that you don’t have the ability to do so!” Tang Xinlian’s pretty eyes contained a darkness as she laughed coldly. She quickly turned towards where Lin Dong was, “Lin Dong, do not allow anyone to touch the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong nodded gently. It seems like a huge fight was inevitable...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brat, are you just going to be a useless bystander again? This is truly disappointing.” Hua Chen glanced at Lin Dong and laughed softly. His laughter was filled with ridicule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong lowered his eyelids and acted as if he had not heard Hua Chen’s provocations. Instead, he directly sat down. Yuan Power quietly circulated within his body. He wanted to adjust his own condition to reach his peak!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tsk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Hua Chen saw that Lin Dong ignored his own provocation, he curled the corner of his mouth. Just as he was about to speak again, Tang Xinlian’s eyes turned completely icy. Her body moved before she shot forward. The Fire Phoenix Spear in her hands danced and formed many shadows, which were accompanied by a sharp aura, as they rained down on Hua Chen from all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should stop uttering nonsense. Your opponent is me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha, since the Flame Fairy is so valiant, won’t I appear as weak and cowardly as Lin Dong if I back down?” Hua Chen laughed out loud when he saw Tang Xinlian charging over with great killing intent. Clenching his fist, dense black Qi rose from his finger as a punch was thrown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black light fist whistled forward and easily shattered the many spear shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, the Flame Fairy should be a little more serious if you wish to fight with me. A trick like that is useless against me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold glint gathered in Tang Xinlian’s eyes as she tightened the grip on her spear. Majestic Yuan Power gushed out while bright red light swept out from the spear like a monstrous flame. A clear phoenix cry resounded across the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heaven Phoenix Red Moon!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBright red light gathered and directly transformed into a thousand feet large moon, which sat at the tip of Tang Xinlian’s spear. Flames rose beside the moon, while a terrifying destructive force radiated forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone could tell that Tang Xinlian was using her signature moves. Any probing strikes against a powerful individual like Hua Chen was completely useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Red Moon Cut!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Xinlian waved her hand. A delicate cry sounded and the red moon turned into a ray of red light as it tore through the air and whizzed towards Hua Chen in the distance, with lightning like speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha, this is getting a little interesting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHua Chen laughed towards the sky. Promptly, he took a step forward while black Qi crazily surged from within his body. His eyes also become unusually dark at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Devil Demon Force, shatter!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHua Chen’s body seemed to have turned into a sinister devil as he was covered by a dense black fog. He did not dodge in the face of Tang Xinlian’s attack. Instead, black Qi spread as he pressed a finger forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwoosh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ray of black light penetrated the air with indescribable speed and ruthlessly collided with the bright red moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shocking energy ripple swept across the sky. The terrifying violent energy caused the faces of some initial Profound Death stage experts to change drastically. Even they did not dare to casually intervene in a fight of this level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Tang Xinlian and Hua Chen were engaging in a huge fight, murderous intent also suddenly surged from Zhou Ze and Xu Xiu, as they faced off in another battleground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResplendent white and black light surged towards the sky, with each of them occupying half the sky. An elephant’s low and deep cry resounded across the sky while being accompanied by a frightening strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang bang bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two battlefields became the focus of attention in the Immeasurable Mirror at this moment. Their frightening fights caused the eyes of many to reveal some shock. Their fights could be considered as a fight between the best amongst the younger generation members...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose other experts on the peaks were also intimidated by the strength those four had unleashed in their respective fights. In fact, there was actually no one who dared try to get their hands on the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong sat quietly on a peak while wild and violent Yuan Power spread like thunderbolts in the sky. His dark blacks eyes were extremely calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA delicate little figure rushed over from some distance away and landed beside Lin Dong. She pouted her mouth and said, “Big brother Lin Dong, that fellow is so hateful. Why don’t you beat him up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could naturally tell that Lin Dong’s withdrawal in the face of of Hua Chen’s taunting, had caused some bystanders to quietly curl their mouths in disdain. Those people were not aware of the agreement between Lin Dong and Tang Xinlian. Hence, their hearts involuntarily felt some disdain when they saw no response from Lin Dong, who had instead allowed Tang Xinlian to intervene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong laughed softly as he heard Mu Lingshan complain. Lifting his head, his jet black eyes reflected the eye-catching battleground, that was now the focus of attention of countless individuals. Then, he said, “I need some time to prepare.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMu Lingshan came to a sudden comprehension after she heard this. Lin Dong should be in a pretty good state now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even I do not have much confidence in the subsequent battle.” Lin Dong rubbed Mu Lingshan’s small head. He inhaled a deep breath and said, “They are no match for Hua Chen and Xu Xiu…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMu Lingshan’s small face had a change in expression. She looked at the two battlegrounds and muttered, “Sister Xinlian and Zhou Ze are not at much of a disadvantage…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused after saying this. After which, she looked at Lin Dong in a worried manner, If they fail…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is brother Lin Dong going to fight alone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong nodded slightly. He muttered, “Although those two are the strongest younger generation members that I have ever encountered…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However… I have promised elder Mo Luo, and I ought to keep it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1012\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1014\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1013","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM"}
