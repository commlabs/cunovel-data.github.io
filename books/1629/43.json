It\u0027s unreliable levers that are the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the depths of the Temple\u0027s hidden plumbing, Urn grasped a bronze pipe firmly with his spanner and gave the nut a cautious turn. It resisted. He changed position, and grunted as he used more pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sad little metal sound, the pipe twisted-and broke . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater gushed out, hitting him in the face. He dropped the tool and tried to block the flow with his fingers, but it spurted around his hands and gurgled down the channel towards one of the weights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop it! Stop it!” he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” said Fergmen, several feet below him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop the water!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The pipe\u0027s broken!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought that\u0027s what we wanted to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop shouting, mister! There\u0027s guards around!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn let the water gush for a moment as he struggled out of his robe, and then he rammed the sodden material into the pipe. It shot out again with some force and slapped wetly against the lead funnel, sliding down until it blocked the tube that led to the weights. The water piled up behind it and then spilled over on to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn glanced at the weight. It hadn\u0027t begun to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe relaxed slightly. Now, provided there was still enough water to make the weight drop . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Both of you-stand still.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around, his mind going numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a heavy-set man in a black robe standing in the stricken doorway. Behind him, a guard held a sword in a meaningful manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you? Why are you here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn hesitated for only a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured with his spanner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it\u0027s the seating, innit,” he said. “You\u0027ve got shocking seepage around the seating. Amazing it holds together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stepped into the room. He glared uncer?tainly at Urn for a moment and then turned his atten?tion to the gushing pipe. And then back to Urn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re not- he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun around as Fergmen hit the guard hard with a length of broken pipe. When he turned back, Urn\u0027s spanner caught him full in the stomach. Urn wasn\u0027t strong, but it was a long spanner, and the well?known principles of leverage did the rest. He doubled up and then sagged backwards against one of the weights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened next happened in frozen time. Dea?con Cusp grabbed at the weight for support. It sank down, ponderously, his extra poundage adding to the weight of the water. He clawed higher. It sank further, dropping below the lip of the pit. He sought for bal?ance again, but this time it was against fresh air, and he tumbled on top of the falling weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn saw his face staring up at him as the weight fell into the gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a lever, he could change the world. It had certainly changed it for Deacon Cusp. It had made it stop existing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFergmen was standing over the guard, his pipe raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know this one,” he said. \"I\u0027m going to give him a-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind about that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove them linkage clanked into action. There was a distant creaking of bronze against bronze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let\u0027s get out of here,” said Urn. “Only the gods know what\u0027s happening up there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd blows rained on the unmoving Moving Turtle\u0027s carapace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn! Damn! Damn!” shouted Simony, thump?ing it again. “Move! I command you to move! Can you understand plain Ephebian! Move!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unmoving machine leaked steam and sat there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Om pulled himself up the slope of a small hill. So it came to this, then. There was only one way to get to the Citadel now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a million-to-one chance, with any luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Brutha stood in front of the huge doors, oblivious to the crowd and the muttering guards. The Quisition could arrest anyone, but the guards weren\u0027t certain what happened to you if you apprehended an arch?bishop, especially one so recently favored by the Prophet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a sign, Brutha thought, in the loneliness of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors trembled, and swung slowly outwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha stepped forward. He wasn\u0027t fully conscious now, not in any coherent way as understood by normal people. Just one part of him was still capable of looking at the state of his own mind and thinking: perhaps the Great Prophets felt like this all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thousands inside the temple were looking around in confusion. The choirs of lesser Iams paused in their chant. Brutha walked on up the aisle, the only one with a purpose in the suddenly bewildered throng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis was standing in the center of the temple, under the vault of the dome. Guards hurried toward Brutha, but Vorbis raised a hand in a gentle but very positive movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Brutha could take in the scene. There was the staff of Ossory, and Abbys\u0027s cloak, and the sandals of Cena. And, supporting the dome, the massive statues of the first four prophets. He\u0027d never seen them. He\u0027d heard about them every day of his childhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what did they mean now? They didn\u0027t mean anything. Nothing meant anything, if Vorbis was Prophet. Nothing meant anything, if the Cenobiarch was a man who\u0027d heard nothing in the inner spaces of his own head but his own thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was aware that Vorbis\u0027s gesture had not only halted the guards, although they surrounded him like a hedge. It had also filled the temple with silence. Into which Vorbis spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. My Brutha. We had looked for you in vain. And now even you are here . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha stopped a few feet away. The moment of . . . whatever it had been . . . that had propelled him through the doors had drained away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow all there was, was Vorbis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe part of him still capable of thought was think?ing: there is nothing you can say. No one will listen. No one will care. It doesn\u0027t matter what you tell peo?ple about Ephebe, and Brother Murduck, and the des?ert. It won\u0027t be fundamentally true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFundamentally true. That\u0027s what the world is, with Vorbis in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis said, “There is something wrong? Some?thing you wish to say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-on-black eyes filled the world, like two pits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha\u0027s mind gave up, and Brutha\u0027s body took over. It brought his hand back and raised it, oblivious to the sudden rush forward of the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw Vorbis turn his cheek, and smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha stopped, and lowered his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “No. I won\u0027t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, for the first and only time, he saw Vorbis really enraged. There had been times before when the deacon had been angry, but it had been something driven by the brain, switched on and off as the need arose. This was something else, something out of con?trol. And it flashed across his face only for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the hands of the guards closed on him, Vorbis stepped forward and patted him on the shoulder. He looked Brutha in the eye for a moment and then said softly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thrash him within an inch of his life and burn him the rest of the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Iam began to speak, but stopped when he saw Vorbis\u0027s expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do it now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA world of silence. No sound up here, except the rush of wind through the feathers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp here the world is round, bordered by a band of sea. The viewpoint is from horizon to horizon, the sun is closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, looking down, looking for shapes . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . down in the farmland on the edge of the wil?derness . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . on a small hill . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . a tiny moving dome, ridiculously exposed . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sound but the rush of wind through feathers as the eagle pulls in its wings and drops like an arrow, the world spinning around the little moving shape that is the focus of all the eagle\u0027s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloser and . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . talons down . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . grip . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . and rise . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis back was merely agonizing. He\u0027d long ago got used to switching off pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was spread-eagled on a surface, his arms and legs chained to something he couldn\u0027t see. Sky above. The towering frontage of the temple to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy turning his head a little he could see the silent crowd. And the brown metal of the iron turtle. He could smell smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was just tightening the shackles on his hand. Brutha looked over at the inquisitor. Now, what was it he had to say? Oh, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Turtle Moves?” he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not this one, friend,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world spun under Om as the eagle sought for shell?cracking height, and his mind was besieged by the tortoise\u0027s existential dread of being off the ground. And Brutha\u0027s thoughts, bright and clear this close to death . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m on my back and getting hotter and I\u0027m going to die . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCareful, careful. Concentrate, concentrate. It\u0027ll let go any second . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm stuck out his long scrawny neck, stared at the body just above him, picked what he hoped was about the right spot, plunged his beak through the brown feathers between the talons, and gripped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eagle blinked. No tortoise had ever done that to an eagle, anywhere else in history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm\u0027s thoughts arrived in the little silvery world of its mind:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don\u0027t want to hurt one another, now do we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eagle blinked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEagles have never evolved much imagination or forethought, beyond that necessary to know that a turtle smashes when you drop it on the rocks. But it was forming a mental picture of what happened when you let go of a heavy tortoise that was still intimately gripping an essential bit of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts eyes watered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thought crept into its mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now. You play, uh, ball with me, I\u0027ll play . . . ball with you. Understand? This is important. This is what I want you to do . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eagle soared on a thermal off the hot rocks, and sped towards the distant gleam of the Citadel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo tortoise had ever done this before. No tortoise in the whole universe. But no tortoise had ever been a god, and knew the unwritten motto of the Quisition: Cuius testiculos habes, habeas cardia et cerebellum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you have their full attention in your grip, their hearts and minds will follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn pushed his way through the crowds, with Fergmen trailing behind. That was the best and the worst of civil war, at least at the start-everyone wore the same uniform. It was much easier when you picked enemies who were a different color or at least spoke with a funny accent. You could call them “gooks” or something. It made things easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, Urn thought. This is nearly philosophy. Pity I probably won\u0027t live to tell anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big doors were ajar. The crowd was silent, and very attentive. He craned forward to see, and then looked up at the soldier beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Simony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It didn\u0027t work,” said Simony, bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you-?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We did everything! Something broke!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It must be the steel they make here,” said Urn. \"The link pins on-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That doesn\u0027t matter now,” said Simony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flat tones of his voice made Urn follow the eyes of the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another iron turtle there-a proper model of a turtle, mounted on a sort of open gridwork of metal bars in which a couple of inquisitors were even now lighting a fire. And chained to the back of the turtle-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who\u0027s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brutha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know what happened. He hit Vorbis, or didn\u0027t hit him. Or something. Enraged him anyway. Vorbis stopped the ceremony, right there and then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn glanced at the deacon. Not Cenobiarch yet, so uncrowned. Among the Iams and bishops standing uncertainly in the open doorway, his bald head gleamed in the morning light. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-gods-discworld-13/page-43.html","bookId":1629,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM"}
