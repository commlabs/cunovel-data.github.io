On a hillside in the distance, through a break in the trees, they saw huge branches whipping back and forth and hundreds of scarlet leaves spinning into the air. Then the white veil of rain descended over the view, and though it was yet a half-mile away they braced for the blast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew had given the reins to Greathouse about an hour ago and taken over the task of watching the prisoner. Both Matthew and Greathouse wore their cloaks tight about them, and now as the sound of the wind came nearer Greathouse shouted, \"Keep the gun dry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew put it inside his cloak and kept his hand on the grip. The horses nickered and lifted their heads nervously to protest their course, but Greathouse\u0027s firm control of the reins kept them from going off the road and into the thicket. Matthew saw the prisoner watching him almost incuriously, as one might watch to see what a dog would do when doused with a bucketful of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here it comes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first swirl of the wind, deceptively meek, came just a few seconds after Greathouse\u0027s voice. and then there was a keen high shrill of air that built to almost a feminine scream and the next blast of wind hit Matthew in the back and almost lifted him off the seat. He had the quick sensation of thinking that the wind was going to get into the flapping folds of his cloak and send him flying. Leaves of a hundred hues of red, purple and yellow struck him, as if the very forest had turned assaulter. He felt the tricorn flip off his head, and that was when Slaughter made his move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the tumult of whirling leaves Matthew saw Slaughter come up from his position of repose like a snake striking from beneath a rock. The noise of the wind masked the rattle of chains, and when Matthew opened his mouth to cry out he knew his voice would be tattered to pieces before it reached Greathouse, who was trying to keep the horses from turning against the onslaught. Slaughter reached out toward Matthew with a claw-like hand, the knives of his nails flashing at Matthew\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand even as Matthew struggled to get the pistol out of his cloak and failed to dislodge it, he brought up his other arm, fist clenched, to ward off the coming blow and he saw Slaughter grasp his tricorn, which had blown off his head and which the prisoner had caught before it could go flying off the wagon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are, Matthew,\" said Slaughter, bent with the weight of his irons and speaking close to the younger man\u0027s ear. \"You wouldn\u0027t want to lose such a fine hat.\" He pushed it into Matthew\u0027s fist until the fist opened to accept it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is iti\" Greathouse had looked over his shoulder, his eyes widening as he took in the scene. The horses were still unnerved and tossing their heads against the bit. \"Sit down, Slaughter! Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe order could not be obeyed before the rain struck. It came rushing in on the heels of the wind, hit with a cold impact that made breath hitch in the lungs, and within seconds had drenched the three travelers to their skins. Slaughter sank down amid the leaves that littered the wagon, and curled himself up as best he could. Greathouse hollered out a great curse as rain streamed through his brown woolen cap and down his face. Matthew dumped the water out of his tricorn and put it back on, and when he sat there shivering he wasn\u0027t sure if it was due to the chill rain or the fact that Slaughter\u0027s fingernails could have torn out his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind ceased, but the rain kept pouring down. Waterfalls sprang from the treetops. The air itself turned grayish-green, visibility was cut to the edges of what might have been roiling seafoam, and it seemed they were no longer travelling through forest but across an undersea kingdom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horses, back to their old stolid selves, pulled the wagon onward with no further dissent. Presently their hooves began to sink in mud. Thoroughly wet and miserable, Matthew thought that now must surely be the time to admit his discovery of the money, and end this travail. They\u0027d already come, by the reckoning of his tailbone, at least six miles due west from the pike and the road was yet to turn to the southwest as Slaughter had said. Before the storm had hit, Matthew had expected Greathouse to point this fact out to the prisoner, but then again they might not have quite made six miles yet; it was hard to tell, with just these unbroken woods all around. They\u0027d had several glimpses of the river, off to the right, but not a single view of any dwelling built by the hand of man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew wondered what his fate was going to be when he told. More than a scolding, for sure. a knock on the head, if he was lucky. More than one, depending on Greathouse\u0027s mood, and in this damned rain his mood was certainly going to be deepest black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is thisi\" Greathouse suddenly said, and Matthew dared to look over his shoulder at what the other man had already seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn their left the woods had been cleared away, and emerging from the rain-thrashed gloom were the simple wooden markers of a small cemetery. Matthew counted thirty-eight graves. The surprising thing about it was that the cemetery was so orderly and well-kept, free of weeds, vines and underbrush that normally would have quickly overgrown such a sylvan setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"a cabin ahead,\" Greathouse said, and in another sticky quarter-revolution of the wheels Matthew also saw it, a dark shape sitting on the right. Then, a second dark structure came out of the rain on the left, this one with a collapsed roof. a third cabin stood just beyond that one, also seemingly abandoned, and as more of them emerged on both sides of the mudtrack Matthew realized it was a village. Or, at least, what had once been a village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slaughter!\" Greathouse called, and the prisoner stirred. \"Is this the placei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" came the reply, as he sat up and gazed around with rain running from his beard. \"This is New Unity. Rather it used to be, before I went into the loon house. I wonder what happened to the people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure you didn\u0027t kill themi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was an active village when I last passed this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn another moment Matthew caught a whiff of woodsmoke, and he spied a light glinting behind the shutters of a cabin just ahead on the right. \"There!\" he said, but Greathouse only nodded because he\u0027d already spotted the sign of life. That and the smoke fighting its way up into the sodden air from a fieldstone chimney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s best we get out of this for awhile, if they\u0027ll accept any visitors.\" Greathouse started to turn the team toward what appeared to be New Unity\u0027s single occupied dwelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you doingi\" Slaughter was up on his knees. \"You can\u0027t stop here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say one miserable wreckage of a village is as good as another in a downpour, especially if there\u0027s a roof and a fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t!\" Slaughter insisted, a note of desperation in his voice. \"We\u0027re so close to the fort!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The forti What\u0027re you talking abouti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the safebox is buried. The Dutch settlement at Fort Laurens. We have to keep going, we can get there by-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nightfalli\" Greathouse interrupted. \"In this raini Only if we\u0027re kept out of that cabin at gunpoint.\" He urged the horses through the muck and off the road. Both he and Matthew had already seen what appeared to be a small barn just beside the cabin, and none of Slaughter\u0027s pleadings about keeping on to Fort Laurens made a whit of difference to either of them; they were drenched, cold and uneasy about this journey, both for their own reasons, and the lamplight behind a shutter was for the remainder of this day at least as good a shine as gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they would be accepted by the occupant here, and that was the question. \"Matthew!\" Greathouse said. \"Go knock at the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mei Why mei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re dressed as a gentleman. a soaking wet one, but a gent all the same. Go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew got down off the wagon and went up three stone steps to the cabin\u0027s door, which was set on a porch supported by large flat rocks. The place was made of timbers chinked together with mud, the same as the rest of New Unity\u0027s constructions. Everything was weather-beaten, dark-stained and dismal. The windows were shuttered tight, but through their cracks Matthew saw what appeared to be the light of several candles. He glanced back at the figure of Greathouse, sitting with as much dignity as could be maintained in a cold drenching downpour, and then he balled up his fist and knocked against the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, not without trepidation, and heard footsteps approaching across the planks within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s there, pleasei\" came a voice from the other side. a feeble, quiet voice, but carrying perhaps also an expectant note. The voice of an elderly man, Matthew thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Travelers,\" Matthew replied. \"The storm caught us. May we rest here for awhilei Or at least, in your barni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. Then: \"How many are youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going to wherei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fort Laurens,\" Matthew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain, a pause. Matthew thought the speaker must\u0027ve gone away. Then, quite abruptly, the door was opened. The old man who peered out held a candle in a wooden holder. The flickering light painted him with orange and yellow. He was lean, rawboned, and of medium height, yet had been much taller in his youth for now his back was stooped with the ravages of age. His face was a mass of lines and wrinkles, like a map that itself had been left out in the rain and crumpled by a careless fist. His remaining tufts of hair were wintry white and as fine as the first frost, but his white eyebrows had grown as thick as summer\u0027s cornfields. He angled his head to the left and then to the right, and Matthew realized the man\u0027s sunken eyes might only be seeing him as a man-shaped shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"all of you, please come in,\" said the old man. He opened the door wider, and Matthew motioned to Greathouse that their request had been granted. \"Come in, come in. Warm yourself,\" the old man urged. Matthew waited to make sure Greathouse could handle the prisoner on his own, getting him out of the back of the wagon, and then he entered the cabin and went directly to the cheerful crackling fireplace, where he set the pistol atop the mantel, took off his tricorn and basked in the gratifying heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am John Burton.\" The old man had left the door open for his other two guests and had come up beside Matthew. With an age-spotted but steady hand, he lifted the candle nearer Matthew\u0027s face. \"Your name, siri\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matthew Corbett.\" He heard the rattle of chains coming. \"Mr. Burton, I need to tell you that-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was interrupted by the noise of the thunderball, which Slaughter had been carrying in his manacled hands, slamming to the boards just outside the door. Matthew winced, thinking that visitors to a stranger\u0027s cabin ought not to destroy the porch floor within the first minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, forgive me,\" Slaughter said in the doorway, his back bent with the irons. \"I carry a heavy burden, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down,\" Greathouse told him. He shrugged off his wet cloak and threw it upon the prisoner. \"Wipe the mud off your feet before you enter a man\u0027s home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I had shoes, my feet wouldn\u0027t be so muddy, now would theyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the credit of his nerves, John Burton had jumped only a bit when the ball had fallen, and had not lost hold of the candle. Matthew saw in the stronger light that Burton\u0027s eyes were nearly opaque, and by the flame glowed with a murky yellow that Matthew thought must be the color of London\u0027s fog. Possibly the man wasn\u0027t completely blind, but most of his sight was surely gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a man in chains,\" Burton said, again tilting his head this way and that. \"a prisoner. Taking him to Fort Laurens, theni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" Greathouse answered. \"My name is Hudson Greathouse. Matthew and I are from New York. We appreciate your letting us warm ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your prisoner. He has a namei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tyranthus Slaughter, at your service,\" he said from his seat on the porch, where he was fouling Greathouse\u0027s cloak with his filthy feet. \"and you arei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John Burton. I should say, Reverend John Burton. I was the minister here.\" He hesitated, silent for a few seconds, and then seemed to make a decision. \"I am the minister here,\" he said firmly. \"Pick up your chains, and come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You drop that ball again,\" Greathouse warned as Slaughter struggled to his feet, \"and I\u0027ll take two balls for one with my boot. Understandi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlaughter looked up at him from his crooked posture and grinned wryly. \"Put your threats back in your pocket, sir. I promise as a gentleman to be on my best behavior. all righti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreathouse motioned the prisoner in. Then he picked up his cloak, surveyed the damage and with a noise of disgust threw it off the porch onto a mound of wet leaves. He closed the door, walked past Slaughter and stood next to Matthew warming himself at the fire. \"ahhh!\" he said, holding his palms out. \"Much better!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon our condition,\" Matthew told the minister, realizing they were dripping puddles on the floor. He\u0027d taken stock of the room and seen that, however nearly-blind Burton might be, the place was nevertheless clean and neat. It was by no means up to the standards of the houses in New York, but it was also far from being the hovel that it had appeared from without. On the floor was a mat of woven river reeds. Two chairs, one with a footstool, were arranged before the fieldstone fireplace. a small round table was set between them. Wood had been brought in, and stacked next to the hearth in a leather carry-all. a larger table stood on the other side of the room, also with two chairs, and near it was an old trunk with its lid up displaying iron pots, pans and other cookware within. a ladder led up to what appeared to be a sleeping-loft. Matthew noted a bookcase with ten volumes in it, though how Reverend Burton could read was a mystery. a plain pinewood cupboard stood at the rear of the room. Next to one wall was a minister\u0027s lectern, simple but sturdy, and open atop it was a thick black-bound book that could only have been the Holy Bible. In the corner beside the lectern was something that made Matthew\u0027s brows go up: a little pile of straw that seemed to be the nesting place for an unknown entity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your conditioni\" Burton put the candle down upon the small round table. Two other candles, both nearly stubs, were burning in holders, one atop the mantel amid a collection of smooth stones probably taken from the river, and the second on the larger table. \"Oh, you mean that you\u0027re weti\" He managed a smile that took a few years off his face, and Matthew had the impression of a once-handsome man with a strong square chin and sparkling eyes. \"I should thank God for the storm, then. We don\u0027t have much company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wei\" Greathouse asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My friend Tom has gone to check the snares.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" was Greathouse\u0027s response, but Matthew looked uneasily at the nest of straw and wondered if Tom slept there. Surely the reverend wasn\u0027t insane, for he seemed clean enough and was dressed well, in dark brown breeches, gray stockings, a white shirt and a pair of old but serviceable brown boots. No, there most certainly had to be a human Tom, for who had put an axe to the wood and lugged it in from the foresti\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mind if I sit down, here on the floori\" Slaughter inquired. \"Where I won\u0027t be in anyone\u0027s way.\" He was already sitting, and putting the ball gently down, by the time he\u0027d asked the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New York, you saidi\" Burton eased himself into the chair with the footstool, and winced a bit as his bones settled. \"I haven\u0027t been to New York in oh eight years, I think it must be. Probably nearer ten, really. all that noise and the goings-on, it was never my cup of choice. But tell me, who do you gentlemen work for, that you\u0027re taking a prisoner to-\" He stopped, and his head tilted. \"ah! Here\u0027s Tom now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere came the sound of boots on the porch. The door opened. a small wet dog, its short bristly hair black as midnight and its snout the brown hue of damp sand, scampered in. \"Tom! We have company!\" The wet dog was not Tom, for following right after the dog was a tall, slimly-built boy who Matthew guessed was thirteen or fourteen years old. Tom wore a black wool cap and a long black coat turned up at the collar. He was carrying two large gray rabbits hanging from a pole. and that was all the luxury of impression that Matthew could afford at the moment, for the dog stopped just short of Slaughter and, its legs splayed wide, began to rend the air with barks like pistol shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"James!\" scolded Burton. \"Don\u0027t be inconsiderate!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog kept barking, but it ceased when the boy commanded sharply, \"James! Hush!\" after which, the dog made a couple of circles while keeping its eyes on Slaughter, and then it backed up against the boy\u0027s leg and made grumbling noises of disapproval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strange,\" Slaughter said, with a shrug that rattled his chains. \"animals usually adore me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom looked from Slaughter to Greathouse and then to Matthew, his expression impassive. By the candleglow, his keen eyes were a light gray, and as they stared at him for a few seconds Matthew had the distinct feeling of being taken apart from head to toe as a curious youth might cut to pieces a grasshopper for closer inspection. Then the boy\u0027s gaze left him, and Tom said, \"Shhhh!\" to quiet James\u0027 opinion of the new arrivals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These two gentlemen are from New York,\" Burton explained. \"The individual on the floor who smells in dire need of soap scrubbing is their prisoner. They\u0027re on their way to Fort Laurens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom frowned and started to speak, but the reverend continued. \"I think we should take them at their word, and as Christians offer them shelter and food. Do we have enoughi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was a moment in answering. Finally he said, \"The rabbits are bonny enough. I\u0027ll make a stew,\" in what was definitely the cadence and rolling \"r\" of a thick Scottish accent. \"First off, you\u0027ll be needin\u0027 to get that team in the barn \u0027less you want drowned horses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreathouse nodded. He told the boy, \"I could use some help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom glanced quickly at Matthew and then at the prisoner, as if marking whether the former was up to dealing with the latter. When he took notice of the pistol on the mantel, he put aside the freshly-killed rabbits and went out the door again without a word, the dog shadowing him right at his heels. Greathouse said, \"Watch him,\" to Matthew, who needed no urging on that particular subject. Then the door was closed just as a distant sound of thunder boomed to indicate the storm was in no hurry to reach the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, here we are.\" Slaughter leaned back against the wall. \"at least it\u0027s better than where I was, but not by much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your friend,\" Matthew said to the reverend. \"Just a boy. Is he not related to youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Tom came to me \" Burton hesitated, his eyes closed. \"For-give me, time plays tricks on me now. He came to me in November, I think it was. Late November, just after my eyes began to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He came to youi Howi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just as I say. One day he and James just walked into the village. From the direction of Belvedere, I think he said. The trading post there. It\u0027s a good thing he came. a God-sent gift, he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reallyi\" Something about the reverend\u0027s tone of voice had pricked Matthew\u0027s curiosity, which always lay near his surface. \"and how might that bei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurton\u0027s eyes opened and he stared into the fire as it popped and hissed. What he might be seeing was up to debate. \"God sent him to me, to help keep my promise.\" He breathed softly, as again in the distance thunder rumbled. \"I\u0027m going to die soon,\" he continued. \"I feel it coming. I was asleep in my chair when you knocked and others here, before they died, told me they had dreams of death knocking at their doors, and it was all right, it was not to be feared. So I thought I wasn\u0027t sure I was dreaming, or awake when I answered your knock. But God sent Tom to me to help do what I promised for the others, the ones who died. To take care of their graves, until I also pass from this life. and Tom has promised me also. He would stay with me until I die, and I will be the last grave in the cemetery. and that will be what happened to the village of New Unity, gentlemen. In the space of hardly more than six months, from april to October, one year ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happenedi\" Slaughter asked. \"Ehi What\u0027re you talking abouti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fever,\" came the hushed reply. \"It killed men, women and children. Whole families. My wife as well. and I am left, with the help of God and Tom, to watch over their place of final rest. They worked so hard at building a town. all of them. So very hard. They deserve now to be remembered. Don\u0027t you agreei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your opinion,\" said Slaughter, in a hollow sort of voice that Matthew had not heard from him before. \"God doesn\u0027t give a shit about us. Why should anyone elsei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew saw the reverend flinch at this brutal statement. For a moment Burton did not respond, and then he said, not without pity, \"Sir, you have a very cold and callous attitude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve earned it,\" Slaughter answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remark hung in the air, as the fire\u0027s red center spat sparks and another torrent of rain beat against the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you were asking about Tom.\" The reverend put his feet up on the footstool before him with the slow regality of his age. \"He\u0027s told me that the dog took up with him somewhere on the road, and he named it after his father. For companionship, you know. I believe he was very close to his father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What became of his familyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His mother died when he was a small boy. a younger brother and sister, also dead. I would think fever in that case, as well. His father was a farmer. Kicked in the chest by a horse and passed away soon after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hm,\" Matthew said thoughtfully. Indeed, he was thinking of his own origins. His mother dead of poisoned blood when he was but three, his father a hardworking Massachusetts colony plowman who was struck down by a horse\u0027s kick to the head when Matthew was six, and then Matthew was thrown into the embrace of the world, which was not often kindly. But, looking upon Reverend Burton in this flickering firelight, Matthew was reminded of his mentor at the orphanage in New York. Headmaster Staunton, who had treated Matthew well, who had lifted him up into the higher realm of books and education with a strict but respectful hand, and who in essence was responsible for his evolution from a dirty street urchin to a young man whose mind never rested in the pursuit of a problem. Headmaster Staunton had left the orphanage in his sixty-sixth year to travel west into the frontier land, with intent to teach the Indian tribes the salvation of God, and then the detested Eben ausley had arrived to take charge. But that was past history. What intrigued Matthew at the moment was the fact that he and Tom had both lost their fathers to the whim of capricious fate in the form of a horse\u0027s kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From what I gather, Tom has no more family in the colonies,\" Burton went on. \"I think he sold the horse and set off on his own, and that was a year or so before he came here, if I have it right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parson, speaking of right,\" said Slaughter. \"It looks to me as if we\u0027d wear near the same size of boots. You wouldn\u0027t have another pair, would youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Matthew saw Slaughter give a faint half-smile, and the flameglow lay red in his eyes. \"That\u0027s a pity, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew didn\u0027t care for the way that was spoken. He measured how long it would take him to fetch the pistol up and train it on Slaughter, if he had to. But how fast could Slaughter move with all that iron on himi He wished Greathouse would hurry up. He felt Greathouse could handle him, even without a gun, and he wondered as well if Slaughter could smell fear on a man, like a horse an instant before it kicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire popped, shooting sparks, and when Matthew jumped just the smallest bit he heard Slaughter give a soft laugh as if at the most secret joke. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mister-slaughter-matthew-corbett-3/page-10.html","bookId":2252,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:17 PM"}
