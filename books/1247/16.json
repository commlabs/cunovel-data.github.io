I have been constantly in touch by means of wireless with the British and Japanese warships engaged in searching for the missing ships. H.B.M.S. Adventurer has now received orders to return to Hong Kong, and H.I.J.M.S. Kanazawa has been recalled to Nagasaki. In no case have these vessels reported any signs of the above-mentioned missing ships.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"VII. At midnight on the night of the 14th—15th March, visibility being fair, wind Force 1 and sea smooth, a breaking sea was heard ahead. Knowing that I was in the vicinity of an island marked position uncertain on U.S. and British charts (Lat. 31° 10\u0027 12\" N., Long. 171° 30\u0027 10\" W.) the speed of the ship was reduced to five knots. At 12.15 a.m: course was altered eight points to port. Frequent casts gave a depth of from 49 to 30 fathoms. At 12.30 a.m. I ordered a searchlight to bear upon the island, continuing the inspection at intervals until 2.15 a.m. Deeming it prudent not to close the island during the hours of darkness I steered north by west until dawn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"VIII. When sufficiently light I again approached the island, which is about three miles long on each of its four sides and forms a plateau fronted by cliffs averaging 200 feet in height. There is a considerable indentation on the western side, but no harbour. The closest examination by means of glasses failed to reveal any means of gaining the summit of the island, which is recognizable by a conical hill towards the center and a conspicuous group of palms on the south-eastern extremity. The island is surrounded by a continuous reef, over which the surf was breaking heavily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"IX. In the circumstances I deemed it prudent not to send a boat ashore, as landing would be extremely hazardous if not impracticable. At intervals sound signals were made in the hope of attracting the attention of possible castaways, but there was no sign of life upon the island.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"X. At noon I caused independent observation to be made, determining the position of the island as follows: Lat N. 31° 10\u0027 5\"; Long. W. 171° 30\u0027 15\".\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"XI. While regretting that the search has proved to be unsuccessful I wish to call your attention to the indefatigable zeal of the officers and men under my command, with a request that the Navy Board be informed of my recommendations set forth in paragraph V.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have the honor to be,\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sir,\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Your obedient Servant,\n\u003cbr\u003e \"CYRUS P.
