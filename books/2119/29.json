His body could no longer support them perhaps. Soon they stopped. He lifted his helmet from Allie\u0027s golden lap and sat up. Several meters away, the warriors and guard were gathered into small groups, sitting and talking. And, obviously, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Felix. \"How long was I out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" Allie said gently. \"You feel better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I can\u0027t believe I could sleep. I just got up.\" He indicated the others. \"Haven\u0027t they said anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the drop...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" He stopped, seeing it. He faced his friend. \"It was all a fake. The drop... all for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie nodded slowly. \"Mostly,\" he admitted. \"This is Banshee, however. And we are carrying probes. Of course they don\u0027t work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They never have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I understand. Lovely war, this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you do it? You said no one else knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they don\u0027t. No one here, except Suki, knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how, Allie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie shrugged. \"The master of the Terra was most cooperative. He gave me a drop of my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He went along, without even knowing why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the Masao.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix smiled. For some reason, he had always found his friend\u0027s astonishing arrogance endearing. He gestured toward the others. \"And the CO?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, much easier. Command Voice and all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix winced. \"He\u0027s not a pet, Allie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh really? Then what\u0027s he doing here\"\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, started to say something else. But it came again, without warning, doubling him over, grinding up and out. He wept and wept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been sitting and staring at nothing, thinking of nothing. He was numb, exhausted, wrenched flat. And, he realized with amazement, relieved. He didn\u0027t know exactly what it meant. He didn\u0027t want to know. Or at least he didn\u0027t feel like examining it. Beside him, sitting patiently and waiting, with his back to all, sat the Masao. Felix smiled-he had his legs crossed Bhudda-fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll his life he had known this man. He was closer to him than any other human. Despite the fact that they were from two different planets and two different cultures, they had managed to stay in touch since infancy. Most of the major events in their lives had been joint ventures. Allie had been Best Man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what really, he thought, did they have in common? Only that their recent ancestors had been rich enough and tough enough and egocentric enough to establish favorite monarchies on the two richest planets in known space. Even in that respect the two were different. Felix had been but one of twelve candidates for Guardian. The Masao had been the Masao from conception. He had always known it and always loved it that way. Whereas, Felix...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he loved him. In his short life, there had been only the two who had touched him. Now one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the time. Damn! Two hours here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allie, we\u0027ve got to get out of here. Call the ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suddenly you\u0027re in a hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not. The ants are. They must\u0027ve sensed us by now. They\u0027ll be coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fleet reports say no ants here. It\u0027s why I picked it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix stared at him. \"Fleet reports? I thought you\u0027d been keeping track of this war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm. I see what you mean. Fleet isn\u0027t here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix laid a glove on his shoulder. \"Let me tell you something, old friend. Fleet is never here. Call the ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. Well, I could, of course. But we need to go somewhere else to get picked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, Felix. This is supposedly a probe placement. They pick us up at the end of the line when we\u0027ve finished planting them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About ten kilometers, I believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Masao eyed him with distaste. \"I think I liked you better in my lap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When, Allie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About five hours. Plenty of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix stood up. \"Let\u0027s get started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You trying to scare the Masao?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allie, don\u0027t you understand? This is Banshee!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! You mean this is Banshee...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix tried to get angry. He failed. \"Come on,\" he urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, my friend. We\u0027ll have you in the Hall of Gold in less than...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie paused. He stood up. \"You mean you won\u0027t go back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s talk about it later. We\u0027ve got to get these people moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" Allie agreed reluctantly. \"For now. Suki!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were up and moving in seconds, a steady procession of two concentric circles. A good team. Felix only had one suggestion. He thought the probes ought to be left behind now that their purpose had been served. The CO treated the advise like an order. \"Yessir,\" he replied respectfully and ordered the probes abandoned on the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix stared at him. Now that he noticed it, all the others were treating him with equal deference. He caught them glancing his way occasionally, always taking care not to get caught gawking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe accused the Masao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie laughed. \"I swear to you. I told no one. And Suki wouldn\u0027t dare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I guess seeing that we knew each other...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie laughed again. \"Could be that. Could be your Command Voice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buzz off, Allie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t still blame them,\" Allie insisted. \"Besides, it wasn\u0027t their fault the freighter buckled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix sighed. \"It was their fault she was on the freighter in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been walking for over an hour. Allie had been on him the whole way. He turned his gaze to the others, marching steadily around them. No one had approached, no one had spoken. Their privacy was respected. Pure Masao, he thought wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized Allie had been talking. \"What?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis friend sounded exasperated. \"I said you can\u0027t go on blaming a whole people for a mistake made by a few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allie, those few didn\u0027t just err, they defaulted. You know how long it took me to run away? Three months. I planned for three months and my bodyguards still almost caught up with me. Angel lost hers, without planning, in three minutes. That\u0027s a breakdown in commitment. The guards simply didn\u0027t care enough about her to do their duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Allie conceded. \"Perhaps you\u0027re right...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\u0027perhaps\u0027 about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay. You made your point. But you\u0027re still blaming the planet for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allie, the guards were just indicative. They never accepted Angel-no one ever did. They never gave her a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie shrugged. \"She was an Earthwoman. Your people resented it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddammit! My mother was from Earth! So was yours. They never had any trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a long time ago. Partner. They were there from the start. They were very old and revered. Mine still is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, looked sideways at his friend. \"Still beautiful, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie laughed. \"By Imperial decree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always loved your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She loved you. She\u0027s missed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were quiet for several steps. \"Angel left me a note before she left. Did I tell you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said she was afraid she was holding me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t know. Even then, she still didn\u0027t know how much I... I...\" His voice cracked. He fought the churning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to stop?\" Allie asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can. We\u0027ve got plenty of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said firmly. \"I\u0027ll be all right.\" He looked at Allie through his tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I will, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later they had covered over half the distance. The landscape had gradually changed. They were on a long broken plain apparently unaffected by the storm. Crusted dunes were everywhere around them. In the distance, foot-hill-size drifts could be made out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie tried patriotism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The people need you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix sighed. \"They have a Guardian now. They have Tasp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know about that? Well, you have bothered to keep up then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But who else could it have been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it wasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would be better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with Tasp? Don\u0027t the people like him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course they do. He\u0027s a good Guardian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he isn\u0027t you.\" Allie stopped suddenly, looked at him carefully. \"They wanted you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix matched his gaze. \"I wanted Angel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother hour. The team sat or lay sprawled around them in the sand. They were making very good time. Allie voiced concern about arriving early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we have to wait two hours there, won\u0027t it be just as bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aha,\" laughed Felix. \"I have scared the Masao.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be impertinent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix laughed again. \"Yes, Great One.\" And he went on to explain that it was location, not timing, that counted. He was explaining about the three-hour safety margin surrounding Retrieval when it hit him. He stopped and stared at his friend, seeing him, really seeing him for the first time. And, more importantly, really believing he was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat forward and threw his arms around his chest and held him close. They were silent for several seconds. Then they broke away. Allie peered closely into his faceplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re back,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix smiled. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is really you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix laughed. \"It always was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of you,\" Allie corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"\u0027Some of me\u0027 still, Allie. It\u0027s been... very bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. I think it\u0027s incredible. In four hours-after two years of being... whoever it was you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix shrugged. \"I was already on my way. He was dying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Engine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that is... what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. A what. As opposed to a who.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie shook his head. \"I don\u0027t get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. It\u0027s just something that... well, it kept me alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s what you call living. The life you had is...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allie, once and for all-I\u0027m not going back. Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Masao sighed loudly. He lay back in the sand. \"All right.\" He tapped the toe of a boot against Felix\u0027s armor. \"I hope your next suit is more fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix shook his head violently. \"No. No more armor for me. I don\u0027t...\" He stared at something in the distance, not seeing it, and wondered how he had possibly done it at all. He shook the thoughts away. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do if I had to fight again. No more armor for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie shrugged. \"I wasn\u0027t talking about fighting especially. But it\u0027s still armor, whether you admit it or not. It\u0027s still something you hide in.\" He sat up. \"Felix, you came here to hide in there. But everything you were hiding from was in there with you. That\u0027s the trouble with armor. It won\u0027t protect you from what you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you\u0027ll do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When it counts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuki approached and bowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speak,\" said the Masao, standing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, the officer in charge reports the scout...\" He looked at Felix, embarrassed. \"That is, one of the warriors. He was sent ahead, over the next hill. He reported Retrieval Proximity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot damn!\" said Allie happily, slapping his golden palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn near,\" Felix agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord? Then I can tell them we can begin at once?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. Yes, Suki, by all means. At once. Let\u0027s get the hell out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Lord!\" Suki agreed happily, bowing and backing away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix stood up too. Soon the procession was again on the move. They marched in silence over the hill. Soon each had the Retrieval Beacon flickering below his holos. Only a few hundred yards to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie matched steps with him, throwing an arm over his shoulders. \"So tell me: what are you gonna do? How are you going to live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix grinned. \"The Masao will be pleased to provide the necessary luxuries.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/armor/page-29.html","bookId":2119,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:55 PM"}
