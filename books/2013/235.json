She was a woman and any exchange of words with a woman was fraught with her torturer’s array of deadly implements, each one hovering at the very edge of a man’s comprehension. Swords were simpler. Even the harried disaster of all-out war was simpler than the briefest, lightest touch of a woman’s attention. What infuriated him was how much he missed that touch. True, there were whores aplenty for the champions awaiting the Emperor. But there was nothing subtle-nothing real-in that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must be a middle ground, Karsa told himself. Where the exchange exulted in all the sparks and feints that made things interesting, without putting his dignity at risk. Yet he was realistic enough to hold little hope of ever finding it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world was filled with weapons and combat was a way of life. Perhaps the only way of life. He’d bled to whips and words, to punches and glances. He’d been bludgeoned by invisible shields, blindsided by unseen clubs, and had laboured under the chains of his own vows. And as Samar Dev would say, one survives by withstanding this onslaught, this history of the then and the now. To fail was to fall, but falling was not always synonymous with a quick, merciful death. Rather, one could fall into the slow dissolution, losses heaped high, that dragged a mortal to his or her knees. That made them slow slayers of themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had come to understand his own traps, and, in that sense, he was probably not yet ready to encounter someone else’s, to step awry and discover the shock of pain. Still, the hunger never went away. And this tumult in his soul was wearisome and so a most sordid invitation to a disgruntled mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasily solved by mayhem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacking love, the warrior seeks violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa Orlong sneered as he slung the stone sword over his left shoulder and strode out into the corridor. ‘I hear you, Bairoth Gild. You would be my conscience?’ He grunted a laugh. ‘You, who stole my woman.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps you have found another, Karsa Orlong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I would break her in two.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat has not stopped you before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no, this was a game. Bairoth Gild’s soul was bound within a sword. These sly words filling Karsa’s skull were his own. Lacking someone else’s attention, he was now digging his own pitfalls. ‘I think I need to kill someone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the corridor to a broader hallway, then on to the colonnaded transept, into a side passage and on to the compound’s north postern gate. Meeting no-one on the way, further befouling Karsa’s mood. The gate was inset with a small guardhouse to its left where the heavy latch release could be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Letherii seated within had time to glance up before the Toblakai’s fist connected solidly with his face. Blood sprayed from a shattered nose and the hapless man sank down into his chair, then slid like a sack of onions to the floor. Stepping over him, Karsa lifted the latch and slid the bronze bar to his left, until its right-hand end cleared the gate itself. The bar dropped down into a wheeled recess with a clunk. Emerging outside once more, Karsa pushed the gate open and, ducking to clear the lintel, stepped out into the street beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a flash as some sort of magical ward ignited the moment he crossed the threshold. Fires burgeoned, a whisper of vague pain, then the flames dwindled and vanished. Shaking his head to clear the spell’s metallic reverberation from his mind, he continued on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few citizens here and there; only one noted his appearance and that one-eyes widening-quickened his pace and moments later turned a corner and was lost from sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa drew a deep breath, then set off for the canal he had seen from the roof of the barracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVast as a river barge, the enormous black-haired woman in mauve silks filled the entrance to the courtyard restaurant, fixed her eyes on Tehol Beddict, then surged forward with the singular intent of a hungry leviathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him, Bugg seemed to cringe back in his chair. ‘By the Abyss, Master-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now now,’ Tehol murmured as the woman drew closer. ‘Pragmatism, dear Bugg, must now be uppermost among your, uh, considerations. Find Huldo and get his lads to drag over that oversized couch from the back of the kitchen. Quick now, Bugg!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manservant’s departure was an uncharacteristic bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman-sudden centre of attention with most conversations falling away-seemed for all her impressive girth to glide as she moved between the blessedly widely spaced tables, and in her dark violet eyes there gleamed a sultry confidence so at odds with her ungainly proportions that Tehol felt an alarming stir in his groin and sweat prickled in enough manly places to make him shift uneasily in his chair, all thoughts of the meal on the plate before him torn away like so many clothes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-235.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
