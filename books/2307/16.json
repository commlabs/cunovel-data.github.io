It would be so wonderful to awaken in Gabriel\u0027s arms, to make love to him first thing in the morning, when the world was new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe tonight she would ask him to stay. Maybe this time he would agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, she slid out of bed. Tonight, she thought. She would see him again tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you tired of the ballet?\" she asked later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were sitting in their favorite cafe, at the table Sara had come to think of as theirs. As usual, she ordered a light meal; as usual, he had only a glass of dry red wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel lifted one black brow. \"Are you tired of dancing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel smiled at her then. \"And I never tire of watching you dance. You have such passion, such life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words brought a flush of pleasure to her cheeks. Her dancing didhave more passion, she mused, and she owed it all to Gabriel. He had transformed her from a girl into a woman, and it had changed the world. Now, when she danced, the music seemed to have more meaning, more depth; her body seemed better able to express deep emotion, whether it was Aurora\u0027s love for the prince in Sleeping Beauty, or sorrow for lost love in Giselle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA last bite, and she pushed her plate away. She wiped her mouth with her napkin, hiding behind the cloth while she summoned her nerve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, cara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you move in with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? We spend every night together anyway. It would be ever so much easier if you lived with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you before, cara, I have my own way of life. I don\u0027t wish to change it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Sara, either we go on as before, or we end it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not fair!\" She stared at him for a moment, and then frowned as a horrible thought occurred to her. \"You\u0027re not married, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why? Please, Gabriel, it would be so wonderful to wake up in your arms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No questions, Sara Jayne, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No questions, no questions!\" She threw her napkin down on the table. \"I\u0027m sick of those two words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel sighed heavily, knowing he was being unfair. But he could not explain his reasons to her. To do so would be to lose her forever, and he wasn\u0027t ready to let her go, not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his glass, drained the last few drops of wine, and rose to his feet. \"Shall we go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a curt nod, she stood up and walked swiftly toward the door, acutely aware that he was close behind her even though his footsteps made hardly a sound. Sometimes she had the feeling that he walked on air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Gabriel took her arm, but instead of turning south, toward her apartment, he turned north, toward a small park. He could feel Sara\u0027s anger in her rigid posture, in the tension of her arm beneath his grasp. In all honesty, he couldn\u0027t blame her for being angry, and yet, even if he wanted to explain why they couldn\u0027t live together, what could he say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry, cara, I\u0027m a vampire. In the three hundred and fifty years of my dark existence, I\u0027ve trusted no one to know where I take my rest during the day. And you would not want to see me then, my body hard and unmoving, with the stillness of a sleep that is like death. You don\u0027t want to see me when I rise, when the hunger is upon me, when my eyes look like death and no mortal is safe in my presence...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turned down a narrow path. Few people frequented this place after the sun went down, but Gabriel had no fear of the dark, or of mortal man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe park was beautiful in the moonlight. A faint breeze whispered through the leaves, singing songs to the night. Drifting shadows played hide-and-seek with the light of the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sensed the man\u0027s presence as they drew near the small pond located at the far reaches of the park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your purse, monsieur,\" the man said. Moonlight glinted off the blade of the knife in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid my purse is empty,\" Gabriel said coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s gaze moved over Gabriel in a long, assessing glance, noting the high quality of his clothing, his expensive leather boots, the fine wool of his cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think not,\" the brigand said with a sneer. He made a threatening gesture with his knife. \"Give it over, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thief lunged forward, but before he could strike, Gabriel\u0027s hand closed over the man\u0027s forearm in a viselike grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara gasped at the look of horror that flickered in the man\u0027s eyes as Gabriel\u0027s hand inexorably tightened around his wrist and the knife fell from nerveless fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a rush of nausea at the sound of the bones being slowly, deliberately crushed. The blood drained from the man\u0027s face; a shrill scream of agony bubbled in his throat as tears welled in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mercy, my lord,\" the man begged. \"Please...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel, let him go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel\u0027s back was toward her, and she saw him stiffen at the sound of her voice, as if he had suddenly remembered she was there, watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a step forward, Sara placed her hand on his shoulder. \"Please, Gabriel, please let him go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, Gabriel released his hold on the brigand\u0027s arm and the man fell to his knees, his ruined arm cradled against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t come here again,\" Gabriel said, and taking Sara by the hand, he led her back toward the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to stop,\" she said weakly, \"Please, I\u0027m...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara, what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to be sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel wrapped his arm around her waist, supporting her as she retched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the spasm passed, he wiped her mouth with his handkerchief, then swept her into his arms and carried her home. And all the while he was berating himself for behaving so savagely in her presence. Why hadn\u0027t he simply given the man his purse? Certainly he could afford the loss of a few francs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached Sara\u0027s apartment, Gabriel put her to bed, fetched a glass of water to rinse her mouth, and then fixed her a cup of hot tea heavily laced with brandy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better?\" he asked when she set the empty cup aside a few moments later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara nodded, then glanced away. She could still hear the awful sound of the man\u0027s bones breaking as Gabriel crushed his wrist. The memory of it sickened her even as she marveled at Gabriel\u0027s superhuman strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuperhuman. She remembered Maurice\u0027s words: There\u0027s something not right with that man, he had said. Can\u0027t you sense the evil that surrounds him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara looked up into Gabriel\u0027s face, gazing deep into his eyes, but it wasn\u0027t evil she saw reflected in the smoky gray depths, only love and concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, cara?\" he asked. \"What troubles you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That man... you broke his wrist as if it were made of kindling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara shook his head. \"It was more than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you trying to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I... it was awful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry you had to see it.\" Bending, he brushed her cheek with his knuckles. \"Go to sleep, Sara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No questions, tonight, cara. You need to rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze caught and held hers. \"You\u0027re tired, Sara Jayne,\" he said, his voice low and hypnotic. \"Go to sleep. We\u0027ll talk tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow,\" she repeated drowsily, and then her eyelids fluttered down and she was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat beside her as long as he dared, and then he left the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice waited in the shadows across from Sara\u0027s house, listening as a distant clock chimed the hour. Five A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShivering in the chill air, he shifted his weight in the saddle, wishing he had thought to wear gloves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had just decided to call off his vigil when the door to Sara\u0027s apartment opened and a dark shape descended the stairs and blended into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t get away from me this time,\" Maurice vowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd filled with a sense of purpose and determination, he touched his heels to the horse\u0027s flanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLost in thought, his steps uncharacteristically slow and heavy, Gabriel made his way toward the abandoned cottage. Sara wanted him to move in with her, and she wouldn\u0027t accept his excuses forever. For the first time, he considered telling her the truth. Perhaps, if she loved him enough, she would be able to accept him for who and what he was. Perhaps she\u0027d keep his secret, be content to share her life with a man who was not a man at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a low sound of disgust deep in his throat. And perhaps she\u0027d offer to ease his thirst, as well, or even join him in his hellish existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd perhaps dogs would sing and pigs would fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRevulsion for what he was rose up within him, as hot and bitter as bile. Even if she wished it, he would never condemn her to the kind of existence he led. She was a creature of light and beauty. To condemn her to a world of endless darkness would be cruelty of the worst kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should leave her, he thought bleakly. Walk out of her life and never return. But, selfish bastard that he was, he knew that was something he could not do. He had lived in solitude for most of the last two hundred years, rarely mingling with humanity, but with Sara he had dared to take a small step into the mortal world. He had sat beside her while she dined in her favorite cafe. He had ventured into the Paris Opera and watched her dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had dared to make love to her - and for those brief moments, the darkness that enveloped him had been swallowed up in her light. Miraculously, his desire for her flesh had tempered his lust for blood. Holding her in his arms, loving her, had given him a reprieve from the ugliness of his existence. For that alone, she had earned his love and his everlasting gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer goodness permeated him. He had the oddest feeling that if he could find the courage to tell her what he was, to confess his innumerable sins against humanity, her love would shrive the guilt from his soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not leave her, he thought as he entered the cottage and closed and locked the door. If it meant his life, he could not leave her. Not so long as she would have him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis feet made no sound as he descended the narrow stone stairway that led down to the cellar. There were stout locks on both sides of the thick oak door. By night, the lock on the outside of the cellar door kept his resting place secure; by day, the lock on the inside ensured that no one would come upon him while he slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntering the cellar, he closed the door behind him and turned the key in the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilently, he crossed the dirt-packed floor, removed his cloak, and climbed into the long, sturdy pine box that served as his resting place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing his eyes, he let his imagination take flight. Sara, clothed as the Princess Aurora, pirouetted within the corridors of his mind, and he was the prince. But in his ballet, it wasn\u0027t the prince who awakened the princess from sleep with a kiss, but the princess who willingly gave the prince a single drop of her precious blood and saved him from a life of eternal darkness...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving the horse tethered out of sight in a copse of trees, Maurice moved stealthily toward the cottage, his footsteps muffled by the damp earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, he thought with satisfaction, this was where the devil lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart was pounding like a wild thing when he reached the south side of the cottage. Hardly daring to breathe, he peered into the window. The room was empty. Frowning, he made his way around the cottage, pausing to peer into each window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs near as he could tell in the darkness, all the rooms were empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePuzzled, he made his way toward a clump of brush and hunkered down on his heels. A short time later, dawn brightened the sky and he crept toward the cottage again. The faint light afforded by the rising sun confirmed his earlier suspicions: the rooms were all empty. So, where was Gabriel? Had he gone back to town? Or was there perhaps a room below?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried the windows and door. All were securely locked. Strange, he thought, that a house long abandoned would be locked from the inside. Stranger still that Gabriel, who possessed a great deal of wealth, chose to live in an abandoned cottage on the outskirts of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling his courage expand with the dawn, Maurice found a good-sized rock and then, taking a deep breath, he broke one of the windows with it. He listened for a long moment, waiting to see if the noise had been overheard, and when nothing happened, he climbed over the low sill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused inside the room, his heart pounding so loudly it would have been impossible to hear anything else, and then, summoning his nerve, he walked from room to room. A heavy layer of dust covered the floor; lacy cobwebs adorned the corners of the ceilings. A rat had made a nest in the kitchen hearth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of unease overtook him as he came to a flight of steps that led down, to the wine cellar, he supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fine sheen of perspiration coated his brow and dampened his hands as he took the steps one by one until he reached the door at the foot of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiped his palm on his trouser leg, placed his hand on the latch. Instantly, he was overcome with a deep, primeval fear that went beyond terrorasan image of blood-red eyes shining within a cavernous skull rose within his mind. And with that death\u0027s-head image came an overwhelming sense of doom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was more than he could endure. With a hoarse cry, he bolted up the steps. The cold sweat of fear momentarily blinded him, and then he was running through the small cottage, diving through the broken window, impervious to the blood that oozed from his hand when he gashed it on a shard of broken glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if pursued by all the hounds of hell, he vaulted into the saddle and raced away from the cottage and the terrifying evil that dwelled within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent of blood, hot and fresh and rank with fear, drifted down the stairs that led to the cellar, rousing Gabriel from the lethargy that imprisoned him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up, his senses suddenly alert. Lifting his head, he sniffed the air, much as a wolf might sniff the wind, and he caught it again, the tantalizing odor of freshly spilled blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had been inside the cottage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHead cocked to one side, he closed his eyes and listened. And waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the danger was past. Whoever had invaded his sanctuary had fled, leaving nothing behind but a few drops of blood and the lingering smell of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have to find a new resting place, he mused as he slowly surrendered once more to the darkness of his deathlike sleep. Either that, or destroy the mortal who had dared violate his lair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint smile twisted his lips. For Sara\u0027s sake, he would spare Maurice\u0027s life. For now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/embrace-the-night/page-16.html","bookId":2307,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM"}
