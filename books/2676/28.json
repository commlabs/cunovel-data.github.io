A monotonous succession of watches amidst the cold pipes, dials, wheels, levers, blinking lights, and telltale buzzers. The same faces and the same danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven peril can grow boring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA distant sound of propellers in an area where all such sounds mean hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait and listen. Creep ahead a few knots. Wait and listen. Creep ahead a few knots. Wait and listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distant sound is gone. The Ram picks up speed while red-rimmed eyes watch the ranging and sonar gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia was up and about on the fourth day -- a man grown strangely morose and sullen when Ramsey was present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill the subtug moved steadily nearer to safety, towing the turgid slug: a prize wrested from death itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a special tension -- a new pressure -- crept into the actions of the Ram\u0027s crew. It was a tension that said: \"We\u0027re going to make it . . . We\u0027re going to make it . . . We\u0027re going to make it . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey, asleep in his bunk, wrestled with a silent nightmare in which Sparrow, Garcia, and Bonnett suddenly turned to face him -- all with the features of mad Heppner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, the nightmare lifted and left him peaceful in the womblike stillness of the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStillness!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey sat bolt upright in his bunk, wide awake, every sense crying out against the strange new element:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equiet. He reached behind him and snapped on his bunk light. It was dim -- showing that they were on emergency batteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Johnny!\" It was Sparrow\u0027s voice over the wall speaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, Skipper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get up to your shack on the double. We\u0027re having pile trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on my way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis feet hit the deck, fumbled into shoes. He snapped off his bunk light, ran out the door, up the ladder two steps at a time, down the companionway and into his shack station, talk switch open. \"On station, Skipper. Is it serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett\u0027s voice came back. \"Full-scale flare-up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the skipper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forward with Joe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joe shouldn\u0027t be anywhere near that! He\u0027s still on the hot list!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Joe\u0027s watch. You know how --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Johnny!\" Sparrow\u0027s voice over the intercom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Secure the shack for minimum power drain and come forward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" Ramsey found that his hands knew automatically which switches to hit. He blessed the long hours of patience with the mock-up board. This was what Reed had meant: \"There is no such thing as a minor emergency aboard a submarine.\" He made the conventional glance-around double check; stand-by light glowing amber, jacks out, main switch up, relay circuit to control room plugged in and green. He thumbed his chest mike: \"Les, she\u0027s all yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On your way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran out the door, turned right up the companionway, through the control room without glancing at Bonnett, and out onto the central catwalk. The laboring hum of one engine turning slowly on battery power to give them headway permeated the engine room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia stood beside the tunnel hatch down forward to the left, his hands fumbling with the zipper of an ABG suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey\u0027s first thought was: What\u0027s wrong with Sparrow? He can\u0027t let Joe go in there! Then he understood the significance of the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nozzle of a detergent hose was racked beside Garcia. Sparrow stood about twenty feet away on the lower catwalk. The space between them showed raw splashes of detergent spray. As Sparrow took a step forward, Garcia stopped working with the zipper, put a hand on the nozzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay where you are, Skipper!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia\u0027s voice was metallic and seemed to echo in the engine room and Ramsey realized the man was talking into the open mike of his ABG suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia lifted the hose nozzle, pointed it at Sparrow. \"One step more and I\u0027ll let you have another taste of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey went to the left hand-ladder, dropped down to Sparrow\u0027s level. He saw that the front of Sparrow\u0027s uniform was dripping with detergent, and winced at the thought of what that high-pressure jet spray could do to a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we rush him, Skipper?\" he asked. \"I could drop down to --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if it isn\u0027t the head thumper,\" said Garcia. The zipper on his suit suddenly unjammed and he pulled it closed, reached back and folded the hood forward over his head, sealed it. The quartz-plate front gleamed at them like a malignant Cyclops eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow glanced at Ramsey, turned back to Garcia. \"We couldn\u0027t move an inch against that hose. We have to reason with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let the head thumper reason with me,\" said Garcia, his voice booming from the bulkhead speaker above them. \"That\u0027s his department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s only four days from a radiation overdose,\" said Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my show,\" said Garcia. \"This is my big scene. I\u0027m going to crawl that tunnel and there\u0027s nothing you can do to stop me. Besides, I know this end of the ship better than any of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey looked down at the open door to the tunnel, realized abruptly that it was the same tunnel in which they had found the dead Security officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia half turned toward the door. \"Joe, stop!\" barked Sparrow. \"That\u0027s an order!\" He made a sudden dash forward, was bowled over backward by a hard stream of detergent spray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, Ramsey caught part of the spray, slipped to his knees. By the time they had scrambled to their feet, Garcia had disappeared into the tunnel, closing the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow said, \"He took a wrecking bar with him. He\u0027s going to jam the hatch dogs inside so we can\u0027t follow him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard metal banging on metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia\u0027s voice came over the bulkhead speaker. \"That\u0027s right, Skipper. Can\u0027t have you fellows trying to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esteal my scene. You have front-row seats; enjoy the show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he gone off his rocker?\" asked Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow slipped down to the tunnel door, tested the dogs. \"Jammed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he gone psychotic?\" asked Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not!\" barked Sparrow. \"There\u0027s a full-scale flare-up in that pile room. He\u0027s gone in to do what he can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey looked at the snooper above the tunnel door, saw that its needle was jammed in the red. \"Skipper! It\u0027s hot here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow slapped the snooper with one hand and the needle swung back into the seven-hour-limit zone. \"Jammed when he opened the door.\" He turned to the tool rack beside the door. \"Joe! Do you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Skipper. No need to shout. I\u0027m almost at the tunnel curve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joe, defiance of orders is a serious offense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia\u0027s laughter roared from the speaker. \"So sue me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened in the pile room?\" asked Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow began pulling tools from the rack. \"Our repairs didn\u0027t hold. Tie bolts sheared. The whole reactor slipped to the left, jammed the remote-control bank.\" He glanced at his wrist watch. \"The batteries will give us steerage control for about another thirty minutes. When we lose steerage, the planes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewon\u0027t be able to hold us level and over we go. Over goes the pile. If we\u0027re lucky it\u0027ll reach critical mass. If we\u0027re unlucky, the whole boat will be contaminated and us with it. That\u0027ll be the slow way out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if Joe lives through this, you\u0027ll have his hide,\" said Ramsey. \"Even though he\u0027s risking --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You blasted idiot!\" shouted Sparrow. \"What do you mean if he lives? Don\u0027t you know there\u0027s only one way to get that pile back onto its base?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Ramsey could think was: I did it! I cracked through that iron control! Now his emotions can take a normal -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skipper!\" It was Bonnett\u0027s voice over the intercom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow spoke into his chest mike. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m tuned to the portside pile-room eye over the tunnel plates. They\u0027re moving toward --Good God! Joe! Get out of there! Skipper! He\u0027s in the pile room!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I meant,\" murmured Sparrow. \"Our Father, protect him.\" He stared at the tunnel door. \"\u0027The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name\u0027s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no --\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now hear this!\" It was Garcia\u0027s voice from the bulkhead speaker. \"I can last maybe fifteen minutes. When I get the remote-control bank cleared, be ready to take over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Joe.\" whispered Sparrow. He swung open a panel on the forward bulkhead, revealing the direct controls to the left-side bank. The telltale lights glowed red when he threw in the switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a dead man already,\" said Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet!\" barked Sparrow. \"Tune that bulkhead screen above us to that pile-room eye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey jumped to obey. The screen came to life. It showed Garcia\u0027s figure bulky in an ABG suit. He was bent over, rigging jacks to force the reactor onto its foundation. As they watched, Garcia began to turn the screws. Slowly, the deadly block inched toward its proper position. They could feel Bonnett adjusting the planes to accommodate for the shifting weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow bent over the tools he had removed from the bulkhead rack, hefted a big Stillson wrench. \"Let\u0027s try one of those dogs,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only way he could\u0027ve jammed it is from the bottom,\" said Ramsey. \"If we force it down, break it off and --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow fitted the wrench to the upper dog, said, \"They drilled you well for your little job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, what\u0027s he mean by that? thought Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, give me a hand,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey took hold of the wrench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, they bore down on the handle. Abruptly, the dog twisted, snapped off. Ramsey took a punch and hammer from the stack of tools, knocked the fitting through the door into the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow had the wrench fitted to the other dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey glanced up at the screen. The reactor was back on its foundation, and Garcia was securing it with new lag bolts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey snapped off the other dog, heard a clatter of metal in the tunnel as Garcia\u0027s wrecking bar fell away. Sparrow pried the door open, swung it wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snooper\u0027s needle jammed in the red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suits,\" said Sparrow. He motioned toward the locker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skipper.\" It was Garcia\u0027s voice from the speaker. \"Tell my wife she doesn\u0027t have to be afraid any more. She\u0027ll understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Joe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her to go someplace and change her name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey passed him an ABG suit, began scrambling into his own. \"Johnny\u0027ll understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow slipped into the suit, looked at Ramsey. \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey shook his head, unable to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow spoke into his mike as he sealed the hood in place. \"Joe, we\u0027ve forced the door. I\u0027m bringing in the detergent hose and a cool suit. Come out of there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m too hot,\" said Garcia. \"Leave me here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come out or I\u0027ll come in after you,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey handed Sparrow a fresh ABG suit, glanced up at the bulkhead screen. It showed Garcia\u0027s squat-suited figure, standing beside the tunnel plates. Above him, one of the giant remote-control manuals swung outward. At the same time, Bonnett\u0027s voice came over the intercom. \"The control bank\u0027s free, Skipper. I can take it from here. Get that damned fool out of there. He may still have a chance.\" Bonnett was almost sobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming in after you,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand,\" shouted Garcia. \"Stay out of here, Skipper!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming,\" repeated Sparrow. He freed the detergent hose from its reel clip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia\u0027s voice rose almost to a scream. \"Skipper! I\u0027m your spy! Don\u0027t be a fool!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re my engineering officer,\" said Sparrow. He bent for the tunnel, slid into it, dragging hose and ABG suit behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia\u0027s voice came to them: \"You can\u0027t --\" He fell silent, choked, coughed, collapsed onto the reactor-room floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround Ramsey in the engine room, lights brightened, the four motors resumed their normal humming. He could feel the Ram\u0027s response through his feet as though it were a report from someone outside himself. He was unable to tear his gaze from the screen. The giant manual arm swung out over Garcia\u0027s prone figure, clasped him gently, lifted him into the tunnel, replaced the cover plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got him,\" said Sparrow. A gush of detergent washed out the mouth of the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was afraid to look back at the snooper above the tunnel door. Jammed in the red. We\u0027ve had it, but good, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett was still at the helm as Ramsey entered the control room. \"Wouldn\u0027t let me help,\" he said. He motioned toward the door aft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey continued after the line of wet footprints. Naked of soul, naked of body, he thought. Now we\u0027re down to the simplest essentials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey jumped to the bulkhead console, started a pump removing the hot fluid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Johnny!\" Sparrow\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke into his suit mike. \"Here, Skipper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow\u0027s voice lowered. \"You don\u0027t have to help in this, Johnny. Get away from the tunnel mouth if you value your virility. Joe\u0027s hot. Very hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already got two kids,\" said Ramsey. \"Bring him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here he is.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-in-the-sea/page-28.html","bookId":2676,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:59 AM"}
