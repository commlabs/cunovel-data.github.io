Curiosity got the better of her intention to ignore him, however, and since they now rode well ahead of both Graham and Patrick, and wouldn\u0027t be overheard, she decided to find out what she could about her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is Laird Maclean like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the amusement in his voice. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you so interested?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good to know as much as possible about one\u0027s enemies,\" she explained. \"Why will your father be pleased to see Graham?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has something to settle with him,\" Douglas answered. \"The hate goes back long years. Aye, my father will be happy to see Graham again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t speak again until they had reached Maclean land. Judith was given a few minutes privacy. She returned from the shelter of the trees, ignored Douglas\u0027s outstretched hand, and gained her own horse before he could stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick kept trying to get close enough to talk to her. The Dunbars weren\u0027t letting him. Those warriors took their leave when additional Maclean soldiers surrounded them, obviously intent on returning to their own holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith knew Patrick wanted her to keep silent. He didn\u0027t want the Macleans to know they\u0027d captured the laird\u0027s wife to use as bait to draw Iain out. Douglas had only been fishing for the truth when he\u0027d suggested she was Iain\u0027s woman. He couldn\u0027t be sure until someone who knew the truth verified it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of it mattered. Iain would come anyway. Surely Patrick realized that. The two brothers had always looked after each other, and Iain would come to Patrick\u0027s aid now, Judith told herself, even if she weren\u0027t involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere could be a bloodbath. Judith didn\u0027t have any doubt about that. Iain wouldn\u0027t be reasonable when he retaliated, and just thinking about what would happen made her stomach ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want anyone to die. She didn\u0027t know what she could do to prevent the war, but she was determined to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could try to get her father alone and tell him who she was. Then she would have to beg his mercy. If he proved to be compassionate, he might let Graham and Patrick leave before Iain came after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith had never begged for anything, and in her heart she doubted it would work anyway. She didn\u0027t think her father would welcome her. He hadn\u0027t bothered to come after her or her mother… why would he change his attitudes now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if she told him who she was, she would certainly lose everything. Iain would never forgive her. She couldn\u0027t blame him. She should have told him the truth, should have insisted he listen to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about all those warm, dark nights when they had held each other close and whispered their thoughts to each other… oh, yes, she could have told him then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been too afraid, of course, and all because deep inside she knew he wouldn\u0027t love her anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith\u0027s mind was so consumed by her fears, she didn\u0027t notice they\u0027d ridden into the courtyard of the Maclean keep. She looked up, caught sight of the massive stone structure and immediately straightened her shoulders\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…and her resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave the Maclean holding a name. Purgatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouglas tried to help her in mid-mount. She kicked his hand away. He tried to grab hold of her arm after she\u0027d reached the ground. She shoved him away, then turned and walked up the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer bearing was every bit as regal as a queen\u0027s. Graham followed her. He was so proud of her behavior, he smiled. So did Patrick. The Maclean warriors were left guessing as to why the Maitlands were in such cheerful moods. They shook their heads and hurried inside to see their laird\u0027s reaction to his son\u0027s \"gifts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaird Maclean made everyone wait on him for over three long hours. Judith was kept at one end of the gigantic hall, and the other captives were kept at the opposite end. Patrick and Graham had their hands tied together behind their backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith couldn\u0027t sit still. She paced back and forth in front of the long table. The longer they were kept waiting, the more anxious she became. She was worried about Frances Catherine most of all. Would her friend begin her laboring when she was given the news that Patrick had been taken captive? Dear God, she wouldn\u0027t be there to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart went out to Patrick. He was certainly thinking the same worrisome thoughts right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer pace must have been driving the Maclean warriors daft. One reached out to grab her. She was too surprised by the bold action to fight him until he pulled her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick let out a roar of fury and came charging across the hall. Douglas came running from the entrance. Judith gathered her wits before either man could get to her. She rammed her knee into the eager soldier\u0027s groin. He let out a howl of outrage—and pain, she was pleased to note—before doubling over and crashing to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was thoroughly satisfied. Douglas caught her attention then. He grabbed her to pull her away from the soldier writhing on the floor. Patrick wasn\u0027t hindered by the fact that his hands were bound behind his back. He used his shoulder to knock Douglas away from Judith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouglas went flying into the stone wall. Judith went with him. She would have hit the back of her head against the stone, but Douglas\u0027s hand got there first, protecting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick tried to slam into Douglas again. Judith was still in his way, however. Douglas shoved her out of his way and then lunged for her brother-in-law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare strike him,\" Judith cried out. \"His hands are bound, damn it. If you want to hit someone, hit me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay out of this, Judith,\" Patrick roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bellow came from the entrance. Everyone turned to see who had issued the command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaird Maclean stood in the center of the entrance. Judith stiffened at the sight of the big man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laird\u0027s hands were settled on his h*ps and he had a mean scowl on his face. \"Get that soldier out of here,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouglas nodded. He helped the soldier Judith had felled to the floor back to his feet and gave him a push toward the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laird nodded with satisfaction, then walked into the hall. He passed Judith without giving her a glance and continued on until he reached the other side of the table. He took his seat in a high-backed chair in the center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman came hurrying inside. She appeared to be about ten years older than Judith. She was dark-haired, heavyset, and wore a smug expression on her face. She paused to stare at Judith before hurrying on toward the table. Judith decided to hate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer attention returned to her father. She didn\u0027t want him to be handsome. He was, though. He looked a little like Douglas… and like her, she supposed with a sinking heart. His skin was far more leathered-looking than his son\u0027s, of course, and he had deep creases around the corners of his eyes and mouth. His brown hair was streaked through with gray, giving him a distinguished appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was apparent he didn\u0027t know who she was, but when his gaze settled on Graham, he smiled a mean-hearted, ugly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouglas walked forward. She tried to trip him when he passed her. He grabbed hold of her arm and jerked her into his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve a wedding present for you, Father,\" Douglas called out. \"I can\u0027t be certain, but I\u0027ve got a strong feeling this shrew belongs to Iain Maitland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicked him because he\u0027d called her an insulting name. Then the fullness of what he had just said penetrated her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wedding present for her father… no, it couldn\u0027t be. She couldn\u0027t have understood. \"Your father isn\u0027t getting married, is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded as though she was strangling on something. Douglas turned to look at her. \"Aye, he is getting married, and Lord, you really do ask the strangest questions for a captive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer knees went weak. Douglas had to hold her up. God\u0027s truth, she didn\u0027t think she could take any more surprises. First she found out she had a brother, and now she was learning her father was about to become a bigamist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thinks he\u0027s going to marry that woman?\" she asked with a wave of her hand toward the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouglas nodded. The laird\u0027s companion took offense. \"Get her out of here,\" she called out. \"She offends me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith took a step toward the woman. Douglas squeezed her arm. She thought he might have broken the bone. She let out an involuntary cry of pain and pulled away from him. The sleeve of her gown ripped wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouglas had an appalled look on his face. In a low whisper only she could hear, he said, \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you. Please stand still. It won\u0027t do you any good to fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaird Maclean let out a loud sigh. \"You will leave,\" he ordered his companion. \"I don\u0027t need your interference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took her time obeying. She glared at Judith again when she walked past her. Judith ignored her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Maitland laird\u0027s coming up the path,\" a soldier shouted from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith\u0027s heart felt as though it had just stopped beating. Iain was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many ride with him?\" Laird Maclean shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s all alone,\" the soldier reported. \"Riding up the hill as sweet as you please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Maclean laird laughed. \"The boy\u0027s got courage, I\u0027ll give him that,\" he remarked. \"He isn\u0027t carrying any weapons, either, I\u0027ll wager.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, he isn\u0027t,\" the soldier replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith desperately wanted to run outside to her husband. She tried to do just that, but Douglas caught her. He tightened his hold on her already bruised arm and pulled her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will not mistreat a woman, Douglas, no matter how much she provokes you. I\u0027m wanting Iain, not his woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the love of God, I beg you to listen to reason, Laird Maclean. Stop this now before there\u0027s a bloodbath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Laggan shouted his plea from the entrance. Judith turned just as the priest came running into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came to a quick stop when he reached Judith\u0027s side. \"Are you all right, lass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Father, did you come to listen to Laird Maclean give his marriage vows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, Judith,\" the priest wearily answered. \"And to hopefully talk some sense into these men before it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith shook her head. In a whisper, she said, \"I can promise you there won\u0027t be any wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unhand her, Douglas,\" the priest ordered. \"Look what you\u0027ve done to her arm. The skin\u0027s already turning purple with the swelling. You\u0027re hurting her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouglas quickly obeyed the priest\u0027s command. Judith took full advantage of her freedom. She ran toward the doorway. Douglas caught her around the waist and dragged her back just as Iain walked inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t even pause to take in the situation, or the numbers against him. He just kept right on coming. Judith took one look at his expression and closed her eyes. Iain was about to kill someone. She thought Douglas might very well be his target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go of me,\" she whispered. \"He\u0027ll kill you if you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother was intelligent enough to do as she suggested. She immediately ran to Iain and threw herself into his arms. She buried her face against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" he asked. \"They didn\u0027t hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel him shaking. She looked up at him. The expression on his face told her it wasn\u0027t fear causing that reaction. Nay, it was rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one hurt me,\" she told him. \"I\u0027ve been treated well, truly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. He gave her a quick squeeze, then gently forced her behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked forward to confront his enemy. Judith followed him. Graham and Patrick were given freedom to move forward. They positioned themselves on either side of Judith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two lairds stared at each other a long while, each taking the other\u0027s measure. Maclean was the first to break the silence. \"It seems you\u0027ve got yourself a problem, Iain Maitland. I\u0027ve captured your woman and I\u0027m not at all certain what I\u0027m wanting to do with her. You dared to try to form an alliance with the Dunbars while sending an emissary to me for the same purpose. Were you believing you could play one against the other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a fool, old man,\" Iain replied in a voice shaking with anger. \"It was the Dunbars playing that game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaclean slammed his fist down on the table. \"I\u0027ve formed an alliance with the Dunbars. Do you call me fool now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain didn\u0027t hesitate. \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaird Maclean took a deep breath in a bid to control his rising fury. He cocked his head to one side while he stared at Iain. Then he shook his head. \"You\u0027re deliberately provoking me,\" he remarked. \"I\u0027m wondering why. Everyone knows the store I put in family dealings. Aye, my alliance with the Dunbars made sound sense. You must know the Dunbar laird\u0027s second cousin, Eunice, is married to my brother. Aye, it was a union of family, Iain Maitland, and family comes before all other considerations. Yet you call me fool because I\u0027m loyal? You\u0027re far too clever to deliberately goad me into killing you. You\u0027ve got too much to lose. What is your game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain didn\u0027t answer soon enough to please the laird. \"Is this woman your wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her relationship to me is none of your affair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaclean grinned. \"I might keep her and give her to one of my men,\" he boasted, in an attempt to get the Maitland laird riled enough to lose his composure. \"Douglas? Are you wanting her in your bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am,\" Douglas called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outrage had gone far enough. The two lairds were like bulls, ramming heads together. Judith moved to her husband\u0027s side. \"You won\u0027t keep me,\" she called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Your boldness displeases me,\" he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain almost smiled then and there. He could feel Judith trembling. Maclean didn\u0027t have any idea how frightened she really was, however, and that fact pleased Iain considerably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got the voice of an Englishwoman,\" Maclean remarked. \"And you appear to be as ignorant as your husband. Don\u0027t either of you realize your jeopardy?\" He centered his gaze on Judith. \"Or does the possibility of your husband\u0027s death appeal to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Judith nor Iain answered the laird. Maclean\u0027s patience ended. He started shouting at Iain. Iain didn\u0027t show any outward reaction to the threats his enemy was making. His expression was so controlled, it was as though it had been carved out of stone. In truth, he looked downright bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laird was red-faced and out of breath by the time he\u0027d finished spewing his litany of reprisals. \"Aye, you\u0027ve got a problem,\" he muttered. \"For no one calls me a fool. No one.\" He leaned back in his chair, his mind made up. \"I am going to kill you, Iain, for that insult alone.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-39.html","bookId":1844,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM"}
