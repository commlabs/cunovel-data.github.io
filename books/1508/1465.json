Within Lin Ming, even the true essence, blood vitality, and Law fragments were attracted by this strength, wanting to burst out from his body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn just ten years without seeing each other, Xiao Moxian’s Heaven Absorbing Demon Art had reached a completely different level than the one she displayed during the First Martial Meeting.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Heaven Absorbing Demon Art could permanently absorb true essence and world power from a martial artist, and it could also temporarily absorb it. Currently, Xiao Moxian was using the latter version. The first version was far too cruel and evil; she naturally wouldn’t casually harm another person’s cultivation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut in terms of attracting power, the latter version was several times more powerful than the previous!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBeneath Precipice Cliff, everyone saw a massive vortex of energy appear 36 miles high.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eUnderneath the terrifying force field of Precipice Cliff, it was hard to imagine just what sort of technique could still display such a horrifying might!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“They are attacking each other at this time!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“They are already having trouble resisting the pressure so how could they still have the power to fight!

Xiao Moxian hadn’t concealed her smile either, proving that the relationship between these two wasn’t too bad. But at the 36 mile height of Precipice Cliff they actually began to brutally strike out at each other.

Even if these people desperately tried as hard as they could, they still couldn’t rush up the Emperor Stone, but these two still wanted to compete over it. To them, it was like leaving a mark on the Emperor Stone didn’t have any challenge at all. Rather, the only challenge came from competing with someone else. Only by competing with someone else to leave a mark would there be a challenge.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian’s Heaven Absorbing Demon Art created a giant vortex that covered nearly the entirety of the Emperor Stone.

After the vortex of the Heaven Absorbing Demon Art covered his body he could feel the energy within him being rapidly pulled away. The pressure surrounding him immediately increased.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was the transcendent divine might created by Empyrean Demondawn.

As Lin Ming saw the Heretical God Tree’s power of heavenly tribulation having difficulties resisting the Heaven Absorbing Demon Art, he took a deep breath and then sunk his energy deep into his inner world. The black hole seed came howling out!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA black hole was the heaviest celestial body in the entire universe and its gravitational pull was also the strongest. Within the black hole horizon, not even light was able to escape.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that instant, within the massive black vortex that Xiao Moxian created, an even larger and more terrifying vortex appeared!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis vortex was absolute darkness and spun in the opposite direction. Like a cruel circular saw, it tore apart the vortex of Xiao Moxian’s Heaven Absorbing Demon Art!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe moment that the Heaven Absorbing Demon Art shattered, Xiao Moxian suffered a backlash of energy.

However, Lin Ming’s Divine Seal Art had surpassed the category of transcendent divine mights. This was a cultivation method created by a True Divinity!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot just that, but the Heaven Absorbing Demon Art and Divine Seal Art were completely analogous cultivation methods, both of them able to form giant attracting vortexes. When they bumped into each other, they naturally had to contest to see which was superior!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEveryone below paled as they saw this scene. Xiao Moxian’s advantage had been completely suppressed by Lin Ming. Not just that, but there was also the heaven-shaking black vortex. As for Monster Prince Duyu, he was completely frozen solid. In his eyes, all that was left over was that pitch black vortex. He mumbled to himself, completely unable to accept what was happening.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBeneath the traction force of the black hole seed, the energy that Xiao Moxian had gathered with the Heaven Absorbing Demon Art began to be rapidly pulled out. This caused the pressure on her to rapidly increase in response!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe grit her teeth and her giant phoenix wings stirred up a tornado that forcefully stabilized her body beneath the massive storm of energy and the tremendous pressure of Precipice Cliff.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This cultivation method is…” Xiao Moxian’s thoughts raced. The instant that her move was defeated by Lin Ming she wasn’t sad at all. Rather, a look of excitement crossed her face as she clearly recognized the true nature of this technique.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It is that fellow’s abilities after all. Although the appearance is a bit different, the aura cannot be wrong. During the First Martial Meeting, he used this technique to break through Big Sister Frost Dream’s Dreamsoul Immortal Melody and fight to a tie with her! This Lin Lanjian is really that abnormal fellow after all! Hah! To think he would use an appearance changing technique to try and deceive this miss!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePresently, Xiao Moxian had basically confirmed Lin Ming’s true identity. The power of thunder and fire, Grandmist Laws, as well as this final black hole cultivation method, all of this together was more than convincing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere were countless martial artists in this world, and it couldn’t be calculated just how many practiced similar Laws and cultivation methods.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut, the Laws that Lin Ming cultivated were extremely rare; one could even say that he was the only one to practice them. Those that practiced similar Laws as he did could be called nearly zero. In addition, the talent and potential that this Lin Lanjian displayed could not be wrong.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“A freak is really a freak.
