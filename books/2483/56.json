The jumble of old, young, men, women, and children poured up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie tossed chairs and tables into the corridor leading to the Left Corridor. The zombies tended to not pay attention to anything but their victims and were easily tripped. Thomas joined her as more and more people lined up to ascend the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katie, let’s go,” Travis said firmly, pulling her toward the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But Jenni,” Katie protested. “We need to find her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis turned to his wife and she could see the anguish in his eyes. “Katie, I love you and you know I care about Jenni, but we need to get out of here now! Think of the baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie nodded and, tears streaming down her face, she let him guide her into line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Target the fast zombies first,” Kevin ordered as the five soldiers took up position, looking down the corridor. It was strewn with chairs, tables, and potted plants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where the fuck did the fast ones come from?” Thomas yelled angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They all slowed down. Why are they fast again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re the fresh ones,” Kevin answered grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, shit,” Thomas said in an agonized tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKevin didn’t even want to think of how many fresh zombies there might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people fleeing the Right Corridor were down to a trickle. Some had been overcome by the smoke or badly burned by the explosion. Finally the last survivors stumbled out of the smoke. It was Jenni with the children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf-carrying and half pulling the children, she saw the line of people ascending the metal staircase crawling up the wall and hurried toward it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of the running zombies appeared from the Left Corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning at full speed, they howled with hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fire!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers opened fire, their bullets slicing through the air to impact with the heads of the runners. The zombies were eliminated one by one, several of them managing to make it close enough to trip over the tables and chairs. But they, too, were cut down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Running low on ammo,” Valerie said to Kevin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKevin looked up to see that the majority of the people were now on the stairs. He caught sight of Jenni with three small children stumbling into the last part of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We keep them covered until they are up the stairs,” Kevin instructed in a somber tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers all grimly nodded and looked back down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stumbling, slow dead were moving in one great wave toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch for the fast ones,” Kevin instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie grimaced, reloading her weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie was nearly halfway up the stairs when she looked down to see Jenni pushing the children onto the first steps of the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Travis, she made it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank God,” Travis exclaimed, continuing to climb while holding his wife’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni pushed Margie up onto the stairs. She heard the gunfire and turned. The zombies had reached the food court and were lunging toward the soldiers. The soldiers backed slowly toward the staircase, attempting to defend those on the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy she looked up, she would never know. But Jenni did and saw a single black bird flying over the skylight. She flashed on Juan being shot and all that followed. And she understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep going,” she told Margie, setting the two younger children on the stairs. “Get your brother and sister out of here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni then turned and ran down the stairs. Running up behind Thomas, she grabbed his revolver from his holster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran past him toward the zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shambling corpses could not follow the people on the stairs. Amy had given her life for her children. They would live. Katie and Travis were going to have a baby and be a family. They would live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was her time. Her choice. Her decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, fuckers!” Jenni waved her arms. “You stupid gawddamn muthafuckin’ zombies, c’mere!” Then she screamed at them and waved her arms desperately. “Look at me, you fuckers! C’mon, you fuckin’ cannibals. Prime rib Jenni right here! Come get me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the fuck is she doing?” Kevin exclaimed as the woman danced terrifyingly close to the slowly advancing zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie looked up at the people on the stairs and the little kids trying to climb and understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The right thing,” she answered, running after Jenni. “Hey stinkbags, follow us!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, shit. Dammit! I don’t want to die,” Thomas growled, but ran after the women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKevin was about to follow when he felt a tug on his hand. Looking down he saw a little girl Jenni had shoved up the stairs looking up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mister, we need to go get my Mom,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit!” He snatched up the girl and ran to the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last soldier, William, hesitated, then he too followed Jenni. “Awwww, hell…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of them teased, taunted and lured the zombies after them and away from the staircase. Low on ammunition, they held their fire, moving ahead of the mob, keeping them away from the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni screamed at the things, screaming her hate, screaming her joy, screaming her fucking lungs off. In that moment, she knew she was doing exactly the right thing. Glancing briefly up at the stairs, she could see Katie and Travis near the top and Kevin pulling the children up in the rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, you stupid shits, come get me, you stupid muthafuckas,” Jenni shouted with glee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir grisly faces and clawed hands reached for her, grasping at empty air as she danced away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C’mon fuckers!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was moving back toward the waterfall. In her head was a half-formed plan to circle the waterfall and head up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then the zombies from the Right Corridor made their appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough delayed, the sprinklers had come on, quenching most of the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies now filed into the food court behind Jenni and the soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were now completely surrounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” William shouted, beginning to fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni whirled around as the dead began to fill the space around her. “Oh, hell,” she said sadly, but calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam went down first, screaming, firing into the crowd of zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas began to laugh hysterically and kept firing into the oncoming onslaught until he too submitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni looked to her left and saw the waterfall rising above her. To her surprise, she saw a narrow staircase cutting up through the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation, she began to ascend the fake stone facade away from the zombies below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie started to follow, but was cut off so suddenly by a runner zombie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe staggered backwards and was instantly grabbed from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a second thought, she lifted her revolver to her temple and fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni climbed, moving quickly. Behind her, the zombies moaned and wailed. They struggled to push their way up behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing toward the staircase she could see Katie looking toward her, screaming her name. Kevin was almost to the top with the children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking over her shoulder, Jenni saw the zombies climbing after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting the revolver, she fired off a few shots, watching with satisfaction as their disgustingly rotted heads exploded. Reaching the top of the waterfall, she stood on the edge next to the rushing water. Her gaze swept over the food court and was horrified to see all the dead looking up at her, their hands reaching toward her figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven above the roar of the water, Jenni could hear Katie’s voice screaming her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve done the right thing, she thought as she saw Kevin push the children through the doorway to the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies had yet to go even near the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was eerily calm. Looking down, she wondered how deep the water was. Maybe she could dive into it and swim to the other side. Maybe she would have enough time to climb the staircase and escape onto the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA growl behind Jenni startled her. Turning, she saw Amy step onto the platform. Raising her gun, Jenni fired at her zombified friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gun clicked empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy lunged forward and her teeth snapped shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorrified, Jenni rapidly drew her hand back, but she felt her skin tear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, shit,” she said as pain erupted in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy chewed Jenni’s flesh, then lunged forward again for another taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni brought the gun down hard on Amy’s head, so hard she felt the skull crack. A surge of anger hit her and she brought it down again. Screaming in rage, she slammed the gun into the zombie’s head until Amy’s skull splintered and shattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith rage, fierce and hot, Jenni reached into Amy’s head and ripped chunks of her brain out and threw it out over the zombie horde below her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy’s corpse slid to the ground in silence, truly dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExhaling, Jenni stood over the dead body, tears on her face. As quickly as the rage had hit, it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made the right choice, she thought again. Bending down, she washed her hands off in the rushing water, watching it turn red with her blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking toward Katie and Kevin, she could see them waving at her to jump into the pool of water below. They didn’t understand, she realized. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/siege-as-the-world-dies-3/page-56.html","bookId":2483,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:34 PM"}
