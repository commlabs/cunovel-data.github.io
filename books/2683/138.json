Paparazzi hunt for celebs. It\u0027s freezing in the VIP room and everyone\u0027s breath steams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI order a Tasmanian beer from the bug-eyed bartender wearing a velour tuxedo who unashamedly tries to sell me a joint laced with Special K as he lights my cigarette, wild fluorescent patterns spiraling across the mirrored wall behind him while Shirley Bassey sings the \"Goldfinger\" theme and an endless reel of Gap ads flashes on various video monitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the mirrored wall I immediately spot the Christian Bale-looking guy who followed me into Masako yesterday standing next to me and I whirl around and start talking to him and he\u0027s annoyed and pulling away but the director takes me aside and hisses, \"Sam Ho\u0027s an Asian, you nitwit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey man, I know, I know,\" I say, holding my hands up. \"It\u0027s cool. It\u0027s cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then who is that?\" the director asks, nodding over at the Christian Bale guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he was in the movie,\" I say. \"I thought you guys casted him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen him before in my life,\" the director snaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a buddy of, um, mine,\" I say, waving over at him. The Christian Bale guy looks at me like I\u0027m insane and turns back to his beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over there,\" the director says. \"Sam He\u0027s over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fairly beautiful Asian kid about my age, slight with blond hair and black roots, wearing sunglasses, sweaty and humming to himself, leans against the bar waiting for the bartender, repeatedly wiping his nose with the hand that\u0027s waving cash. He\u0027s wearing a tie-dyed T-shirt, inside-out Levi\u0027s 50 1 s, a Puffer jacket and Caterpillar boots. Sighing to myself, thinking, Oh dear, I make my way over to where Sam He\u0027s standing and the first time I glance at him he notices and smiles to himself but then the bartender glides by, ignoring him, causing Sam to start dancing up and down in a frustrated jig. Sam lowers the sunglasses and glares at me as if it\u0027s my fault. I look away but not before noticing the word SLAVE tattooed on the back of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, stop being so elusive,\" he groans theatrically, in a heavy accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, are you Sam Ho?\" I ask. \"Like, the model?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re cute but I think also brain-fried,\" he says without looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Far out,\" I say, undeterred. \"Isn\u0027t this place great?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could quite happily live here,\" Sam says, bored. \"And it\u0027s not even rave night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s changing the definition of what a hip night out means, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop holding out on me, baby,\" Sam shouts at the bartender as he races by again, juggling three bottles of Absolut Citron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s the story?\" I\u0027m asking. \"When\u0027s Fetish Evening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every evening is Fetish Evening in clubland, darling,\" Sam groans, and then, glancing sideways at me, asks, \"Am I being sought after?\" He checks out my wrist. \"Nice arm veins.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-138.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
