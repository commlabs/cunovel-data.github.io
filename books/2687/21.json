I saw Colt and Hudson a little while ago. Colt grilled me on what was going on with us.” She swiped his mug and took a drink. “The rumor mill has been churning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it has. My mother called today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you tell her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothin’. I didn’t answer her call. I just…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t want to tell her it’s just sex between us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam sighed. “I want to keep you to myself for a little bit longer before they start meddling. Does that sound stupid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Before she choked up at another glimpse of the sweet side of this gruff man, she changed the subject. “So, did you arrest anyone today, Deputy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I ticketed two kids for drag racin’ out by the old cemetery. Then I finished paperwork. I got tired of listening to Shortbull and Reeves arguing about baseball so I took a break and came here. What time do you get done?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten thirty. I’m cooking tonight, which I’ll admit I am not looking forward to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Funny, I always look forward to your cooking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. So is that why you’ve been coming in at least once a day for the last two years? Because of my culinary skills?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a bachelor. Half the time I eat Cap’n Crunch for supper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomini leaned across the table. “That is not an answer, Cam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. But I don’t guess you’d like to hear how seeing your pretty face never fails to make my day, no matter what else happens to me during the course of that day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re wrong. Sometimes I want to hear mushy stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam touched her face. “Anything you want, Domini. Name it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell pinged. Cam dropped his hand and threaded their fingers together. Before Domini tore her gaze away from Cam’s compelling blue eyes, a blond ball of energy stopped short of tackling her in the booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guess what? Mom said next week I can spend the night and you can take me to school—” Anton caught sight of Cam. His teeth clamped together so fast Domini feared he might have chipped a molar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Anton. Do you know Deputy McKay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam stuck out his right hand. “Pleased to meet you Anton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook Cam’s hand, albeit reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bell pinged again and Nadia hustled in. The second Nadia saw Cam, she froze too. She gathered herself and stood behind Anton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nadia, you remember Deputy McKay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam returned Nadia’s quick nod of acknowledgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What brings you guys by?” Domini asked to fill the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were out and about and thought we’d see if you had time to eat with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shoot. I’m working in the kitchen tonight—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No big deal, it was a spur of the moment idea anyway. Another time.” Nadia squeezed Anton’s shoulders. “Let’s go home.” She aimed a cool gaze at Cam. “Deputy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Nadia and Anton were gone. Weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf a dozen people came in. She sighed. “Time to get to work.” Domini tried to tug her hand free. Her breath caught when Cam brought their joined hands to his mouth, licking and nibbling her knuckles like he was kissing her sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed her a cocky grin. “See you at ten thirty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam’s cell phone rang right after he’d climbed into his patrol car. “McKay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this Cam McKay? The war hero?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “Brock Tennyson, you bastard. Were your ears burning? Because I was just talking about you last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah? I hope you were talking me up to that hot sister of yours, because, man-oh-man that cowgirl she has got it going on, whoo-ee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t make me hurt you after you saved my life. I will rip your arms outta the sockets and beat you with them if you lay so much as a single finger on Keely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrock laughed. “You’re so easy to rile, McKay. So what’s up with you? Been busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a fuckin’ riot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Admit it. You miss my humor. How goes the deputy job?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great, most days. Better than chasing cattle, that’s for damn sure. What about you? It’s a little early to be calling about setting up our bi-annual hunting trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I apologize for giving you such late notice. I’m on my way to Seattle and I’ve got an extra day to burn, so I thought I’d stop off in Sundance, see if you’re gonna be around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Day after tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be here. I’m scheduled off that day so if you wanna hit Colt’s fishin’ hole—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To be honest, I’d rather chill. Drink a couple of beers. Shoot the shit. Relax.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word relax wasn’t in Brock’s vocabulary. Cam’s alarm bells started ringing. “Is everything okay, B?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. No. Hell, some stuff I need to figure out, which is why I’m driving across country instead of flying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re welcome to crash at my place for as long as you need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. I appreciate it. Look forward to catching up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too. Drive safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will do.” Brock hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam stared at the screen on his phone listing missed calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides Brock, his mother had called. Twice. That was it. Sad really, that his brothers and cousins weren’t ringing him up just to chat. Even Keely had given up calling him for the most part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you blame them? You don’t exactly encourage that type of behavior with anyone in your family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig fucking deal. Didn’t matter anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut the phone off and returned to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Ten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCleaning the grill was her least favorite part of shutting the restaurant down. Thank God she was done. Domini scoured the grease from her hands and fantasized about a hot sudsy shower. Right. Like that’d happen. She’d sent Cam upstairs to wait for her an hour ago. He’d had that look in his eye then and she expected cooling his boots had only increased his ardor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremor of desire rolled down her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Domini scaled the stairs to her apartment, she wondered if she should’ve doused herself with perfume. Did she reek like a fryer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened. Cam wore the look of an impatient man. He circled her wrist and tugged her inside, immediately scorching her lips with a blistering kiss. He released the band holding her hair, and used his fingers to loosen the strands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. Maybe fryer grease was an aphrodisiac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam herded her until her back met the wall. Being on the receiving end of such passion was still so new and exciting, she welcomed the rush of moisture in her panties whenever this man touched her. Domini generated a hungry noise as she worked his buttons, want want want echoed in her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam ripped his mouth free. “Shirts off.” Within seconds they were pressed naked chest to naked chest. His lips flirted with hers, sending an electric buzz from her mouth to her core. “I want to hoist you against this wall and fuck you right here, right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds good to me.” Domini toed off her shoes. She unsnapped the clasp and her pants fell to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned. “I don’t think I can. It’ll put too much pressure on my leg.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shimmied out of her underwear and watched Cam watching her. “Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Couch. Now.” He set her on the edge. It wasn’t wide, but the height was ideal. Keeping their eyes locked, Cam unbuckled his belt, shucked his pants and his briefs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis callused finger drew a line from the dent in her chin to the opening of her sex. He swirled two fingers into the stickiness and swallowed her gasp of surprise when those fingers slid in and began fucking her. He feathered his thumb across her clit. Slowly at first, and then quicker, shorter, more precise movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery drop of blood in her body seemed to gather in the bundle of nerves. Just when she bumped her hips up, clenching her pussy muscles in anticipation of a killer orgasm, he stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomini whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll come on my timeframe not yours. Watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced down as he thumbed his erection and pushed the head of his cock into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So hot. So wet.” He fed her an inch at a time, both of them looking until they were completely, intimately joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Domini raised her chin, wanting to see Cam’s eyes, Cam’s fingers squeezed her upper thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh-uh. Watch.” He withdrew until just the tip rested in her opening. “Do you know what a fucking turn on it is to see your sweet cream coating my cock?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the swirls of white smeared against the dark skin of his shaft was highly erotic. She couldn’t remember caring what the mechanics of sex looked like; she’d only cared what it felt like. Yes, it felt amazing, but leave it to him to bring her every sensual nuance she’d missed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if I told you to get on your knees right now? What if I wanted to see you licking the taste of yourself off my dick?” He alternately sucked and blew in her ear, sending tremors straight to her sex. “Would you do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d do anything you wanted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right answer, princess.” Cam kicked up the pace. He nuzzled the sensitive skin beneath her jaw, allowing his teeth to graze her neck. His hand slid up to the juncture of her thighs, while the other hand pushed against the small of her back, subtly changing the angle of her pelvis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomini dug her fingernails into his biceps when he started stroking her clit. “Oh God. I like that.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shoulda-been-a-cowboy-rough-riders-7/page-21.html","bookId":2687,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:55 AM"}
