After Della had told me about her dream last night and shared her memories, I hadn\u0027t been able to sleep. I\u0027d wanted to hold her and watch her sleep. The idea of her having another dream like that and my not being awake to stop it scared the shit out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was fucked up. What she\u0027d lived through was more fucked up than I could even imagine. She worried that she wasn\u0027t strong enough, but, damn, anyone who had lived through what she had and still functioned normally day to day was strong. Della did more than function. She laughed, she made friends, she enjoyed life, she made me smile, and she completed my world. She was the strongest person I had ever met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry I\u0027m late. The girls woke up early and I was trying to get them something to eat so they could watch television and let their mother sleep late,\" Nile said, interrupting my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his dark hair and blue eyes, he looked so much like Della that it was hard for me not to stare at him. There was no arguing that this man was her father. \"No worries. I haven\u0027t been here long,\" I assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want a caddy?\" I asked. I never used one but most members did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNile glanced over at the golf cart I had already pulled around with my clubs and a set from the clubhouse. He had mentioned last night that he hadn\u0027t brought his clubs with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I think I\u0027d like it to be just us,\" he said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to talk about Della. I figured as much. Which was why I hadn\u0027t already had a caddy on standby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then we\u0027re ready to go. I have water in the cooler but if you want something more, a cart will be around by the time we get to the third hole. We can order something from it if you prefer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Water\u0027s great. Too early for anything else,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove us to the first hole. \"Della is looking forward to meeting the girls and your wife down at the beach today.\" They had planned a beach day. Nile was going to join them after our game. I was going to go work and give Della time alone with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The girls can\u0027t wait to see Della again. They really took to her. Jillian adores her, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI parked the cart. \"Della\u0027s hard not to adore,\" I said before getting out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, she is. She\u0027s much like her mother . . . uh, Glenda, that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t met Glenda but I wanted to. Della looked like her birth father but she didn\u0027t have his personality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNile pulled his driver from the bag. \"Della seems happy here,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t move to set up his shot. He studied me instead. \"You haven\u0027t proposed to her. And I couldn\u0027t help but notice she didn\u0027t make it sound like marriage was in her near future last night when the girls were questioning her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a conversation I had expected to have with him today. I pulled my driver from the bag and tried not to get pissed by this line of questioning. \"We haven\u0027t talked about marriage yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNile nodded. \"I see,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell did \"I see\" mean? I was going to marry Della.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to shoot straight with you, Woods. You\u0027re a good man. You have a bright future. When the woman you want to marry walks into your life, you will know it and you will want to be married to her. So, seeing as how you aren\u0027t thinking of marriage to Della just yet, I know, as a man, that you aren\u0027t sure she\u0027s the one for you. I was going to wait but I have decided to ask Della to move to Phoenix and live with us. Jillian is on board with this idea. We stayed up most of last night talking about it. We have an extra bedroom and Della can finish school. She\u0027s only twenty. She needs a family around her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear what he was saying but I felt like I had just stepped outside of myself and was watching this conversation happening. This wasn\u0027t real. It couldn\u0027t be real. This man was not suggesting taking Della away from me. I shook my head before he finished talking and he stopped midsentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" was all I managed to say. He had blindsided me. I hadn\u0027t expected this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\" he repeated as if he didn\u0027t understand that word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I repeated. \"You\u0027re not taking Della away from me. I\u0027ll follow her. Anywhere she goes I will follow her. She\u0027s it for me. She isn\u0027t going to Phoenix. She\u0027s staying here with me. I\u0027m going to marry her. No, I haven\u0027t proposed yet, but I intend to. She just came back to me. She\u0027s finally facing the horrors of her past and letting me help her heal. She\u0027s mine, Nile. She is mine. She\u0027s not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNile studied me a moment, then he nodded. A smile touched his lips. \"That\u0027s what I wanted to hear,\" he said, then turned and walked to the tee as if the conversation were over. It wasn\u0027t fucking over until he told me he wasn\u0027t asking Della to move to Phoenix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNile glanced back at me over his shoulder. \"You showed passion and determination to keep her. You want her forever. I wanted to make sure. Now I just need to make sure she wants the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you lied to me to get me to admit I was going to marry her?\" I asked. I wasn\u0027t sure I liked this man anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m very serious. If Della wants to move to Phoenix with us, then I\u0027m taking her. I will spend every damn dime I have making up for the fact that I was a kid when she was born and didn\u0027t know any better. I will give her a family and I\u0027ll make sure she feels loved and a part of my family. But I needed to know that if I leave her here, then she\u0027ll have someone who loves her with the passion that forever requires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait . . . he was still asking her to move to Phoenix? \"Della isn\u0027t just mine. I belong to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNile nodded. \"Good. If she feels the same way she will tell me no when I ask her to move to Phoenix. If she does, I will know that she has a happy future ahead of her. I will also expect an invitation to the wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She won\u0027t leave me,\" I said with more force than necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we will see. Won\u0027t we?\" he said before giving his complete attention to his swing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-39.html","bookId":1992,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
