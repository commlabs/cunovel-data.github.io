Mary is mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God, Adam,\" she says. \"Have you lost your mind? Do you have any idea who that guy even is?.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I say. The truth is, Mary\u0027s pretty cute when she\u0027s mad. I can\u0027t believe I never noticed before. Well, I guess I\u0027ve never seen her get mad. There\u0027s not a lot to get all heated up about in Mrs. Gregory\u0027s class. \"Lila\u0027s new man. That guy\u0027s such a loser. Did you get a look at his pants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary just shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" she asks me in a slightly stunned voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same thing as you, apparently,\" I say, eyeing the crossbow. \"Only you\u0027ve got way more firepower. Where\u0027d you get that? Are those even legal in Manhattan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re one to talk,\" she says, meaning the Beretta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold up both hands in an I-surrender sort of way. \"Hey, it was just ketchup. But that\u0027s definitely not a suction cup I see on the end of that thing. You could do some major damage-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the idea,\" Mary says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there\u0027s so much animosity-Mom keeps encouraging Veronica and me to instead use descriptive language to express ourselves-in her voice, that I know. I just know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrake\u0027s her ex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to admit, I feel sort of weird when I realize this. I mean, I like Mary. You can tell she\u0027s pretty smart-she\u0027s always done the reading when Mrs. Gregory calls on her-and the truth is, the fact that she hangs around Lila, dim as she is, proves at least she\u0027s not a snob, since most of the girls at Saint Eligius won\u0027t give Lila the time of day... ever since that cell-phone photo went all around school of exactly what she and Ted were doing in the bathroom at that loft party downtown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that there\u0027s anything wrong with what they were doing, if you ask me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill. I\u0027m kind of disappointed. I\u0027d have thought a girl like Mary would have better taste than to go out with a guy like Sebastian Drake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich I guess goes to prove that what Veronica\u0027s always saying about me is right: What I don\u0027t know about girls could fill the East River.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe this. I mean, that I\u0027m standing in the alley next to Swig, talking to Adam Blum, who sits behind me in Mrs. Gregory\u0027s fourth-period U.S. History. Not to mention Teddy Hancock, Adam\u0027s best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Lila\u0027s ex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhom Lila is currently steadfastly ignoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve taken the ash-tipped arrow from the stock and slipped it back into my case. There will be, I know now, no extermination tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I suppose I should be grateful that I wasn\u0027t the one who got snuffed out. If it hadn\u0027t been for Adam... well, I wouldn\u0027t be standing here right now, trying to explain to him something that\u0027s... well, frankly inexplicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously, Mary.\" Adam is regarding me with somber brown eyes. Funny that I\u0027d never noticed how good-looking he is before now. Oh, he\u0027s no Sebastian Drake. Adam\u0027s hair is as dark as mine and his irises are dark as syrup, not blue as the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he does fairly well for himself with his broad-shouldered swimmer\u0027s physique-he\u0027s led Saint Eligius Prep to the regional finals in the butterfly two years in a row-and a six-foot frame (so tall that I practically have to crane my neck to see up into his face, my own height being a sadly disappointing-to me, anyway-five feet). He\u0027s a more than middling student and popular, too, if you count all the freshman girls who swoon every time he passes them in the hallway (not that he seems to notice).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s nothing inattentive about the way he\u0027s staring at me now, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the deal?\" he wants to know, one of his thick dark eyebrows lifted with suspicion as he eyes me. \"I know why Ted hates Drake. He stole his girl. But what\u0027s your beef with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s personal,\" I say to him. God, this is so unprofessional. Mom will kill me when she finds out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she ever finds out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand... well, Adam probably did just save my life. Even if he doesn\u0027t know it. Drake would have eviscerated me-right there in front of everyone-without thinking twice about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless he decided to play with me first. Which, knowing his father, is exactly what he would have done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI owe Adam. Big-time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027m not about to let him know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you get in there?\" Adam wants to know. \"Don\u0027t even tell me you made it through the metal detector with that thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I didn\u0027t,\" I say. Seriously, boys are so silly sometimes. \"I got in through the skylight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the roof?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is generally where they keep skylights,\" I point out to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so immature,\" Lila is saying to Ted. Her voice is soft and breathy, even if what she\u0027s saying isn\u0027t. She can\u0027t help it, though. She\u0027s just caught in Drake\u0027s spell. \"What on earth were you hoping to accomplish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve barely known this guy a day, Lila.\" Ted\u0027s got his hands shoved deep in his pockets. He looks ashamed of himself... but defiant at the same time. \"I mean, I could\u0027ve gotten you into Swig if that\u0027s where you\u0027d wanted to go. Why didn\u0027t you tell me? You know about my uncle Vinnie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not about what clubs Sebastian can get me into, Ted,\" Lila is saying. \"It\u0027s about... well, just him. He\u0027s... perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to swallow hard to keep down the vomit that\u0027s risen into my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s perfect, Li,\" Ted says, before I have a chance to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sebastian is,\" Lila enthuses, her dark eyes glittering in the light from the single bulb illuminating the club\u0027s emergency side door. \"He\u0027s so beautiful... and intelligent... and worldly... and gentle-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it. I\u0027ve heard more than I can take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lila,\" I snap. \"Shut up. Ted\u0027s right. You don\u0027t even know the guy. Because if you did, you\u0027d never call him gentle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he is,\" Lila insists, the glitter in her eyes fading to a warm glow. \"You don\u0027t even know-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second later-I\u0027m not even sure how it happened-I have her by the shoulders, and I\u0027m shaking her. She\u0027s six inches taller than me and outweighs me by a good forty pounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that doesn\u0027t matter. In that moment, all I want to do is knock some intelligence into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told you, didn\u0027t he?\" I hear myself yell at her, hoarsely. \"He told you what he is. Oh, Lila. You idiot. You stupid, stupid girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa.\" Adam is trying to pry my hands off Lila\u0027s bare shoulders. \"Hey, now. Let\u0027s all calm down-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Lila wrenches herself out of my grasp and whirls on us with a triumphant expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she cries with that exultant throb in her voice I recognize only too well. \"He told me. And he warned me about people like you, Mary. People who don\u0027t understand-can\u0027t understand-that he comes from a line as ancient and as noble as any king\u0027s-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God.\" I\u0027m itching to slap her. The only reason I don\u0027t is because Adam reaches out and grabs me by the arm-almost as if he\u0027d read my mind. \"Lila. You knew? And you went out with him anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I did,\" Lila says with a sniff. \"Unlike you, Mary, I have an open mind. I\u0027m not prejudiced against his kind, the way you are-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His kind? His kind?\" If it wasn\u0027t for Adam holding me back-and murmuring, Hey, take it easy-I\u0027d have thrown myself at her and attempted to beat some common sense into her vapid blond head. \"And did he happen to mention how his kind survives? What they eat-or should I say drink-to live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila looks contemptuous. \"Yes,\" she says. \"He did. And I think you\u0027re making way too big a deal out of it. He only drinks blood he buys from a plasma center. He doesn\u0027t kill-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lila!\" I can\u0027t believe what I\u0027m hearing. Well, I mean, I can, considering that it\u0027s Lila. Still, I would have thought that even she wouldn\u0027t be naive enough to fall for that one. \"That\u0027s what they all say. They\u0027ve been feeding that line to girls for centuries. I don\u0027t kill humans. It\u0027s total b.s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on.\" Adam\u0027s grip on my arm has gotten quite a bit looser. Unfortunately, now that I\u0027m at liberty to do so, I don\u0027t feel like smacking Lila anymore. I\u0027m too disgusted. \"What\u0027s going on here?\" Adam wants to know. \"Who drinks blood? Are you talking about-Drake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Drake,\" I say tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam stares down at me in disbelief, while beside him, his friend Ted whistles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man,\" Ted says. \"I knew there was something I didn\u0027t like about that guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it!\" Lila cries. \"All of you! Listen to yourselves! Do you have any idea how bigoted you sound? Yes, Sebastian is a vampire-but that doesn\u0027t mean he hasn\u0027t got the right to exist!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh,\" I say. \"Considering that he\u0027s a walking abomination to humankind and has been feeding on innocent girls like you for centuries, actually, he doesn\u0027t have the right to exist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute.\" Adam is still looking incredulous. \"A vampire? Come on. That\u0027s impossible. There\u0027s no such thing as vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh!\" Lila whirls toward him and stamps a foot. \"You\u0027re even worse than they are!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lila,\" I say, ignoring Adam. \"You can\u0027t see him again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t do anything wrong,\" Lila. insists. \"He hasn\u0027t even bitten me-even though I\u0027ve asked him to. He says it\u0027s because he loves me too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God,\" I say in disgust. \"That\u0027s just another line he\u0027s feeding you, Lila. Don\u0027t you see? They all say that. And he doesn\u0027t love you. Or at least, he doesn\u0027t love you any more than a tick loves the dog it\u0027s feeding off of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" Ted says, his voice cracking on the word I. \"And you dumped me for a vampire?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-3.html","bookId":2030,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM"}
