Then he smirks. “Anything you want me to be sorry for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, but my words are sincere. “No. I’m sorry. You were right—I was just being a bitch. You didn’t do anything wrong. I’m definitely pre-menstrual.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe kisses my forehead. “It’s not your fault. I totally blame Eve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss his lips softly. And then his neck. I trail a path across his chest, moving around his pecs, suddenly awake with the urge to please him. I look up at him. “You want me to make it up to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis fingers trace what I’m sure are dark circles under my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re exhausted. how about you make it up to me in the morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull myself closer and rest my cheek against his skin. I close my eyes, ready to go back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil Drew’s voice breaks the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unless . . . you know . . . you really want to make it up to me now. Because if you do, far be it from me to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh out loud, cutting off his words as I duck my head under the covers, slowly traveling downward to make it up to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his most favorite way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later, we’re having breakfast at the kitchen table. Drew likes to exercise in the evening after work, to decompress and release the stress of the day. I, however, am one of those highly annoying people who love to go for a five a.m. run. Breakfast is where we meet in the middle. After which, Drew goes to the office and I shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what I love about Cookie Crisp cereal?” he’s staring at his spoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never seen one person ingest so much cereal. I swear, if I didn’t cook, it’s all he would eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow a mouthful of yogurt—Dannon Light \u0026amp; Fit. The commercials don’t lie; it’s really delicious. Strawberry banana is the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s shaped like cookies. So, not only is it awesome, but I feel like I’m getting revenge on my parents for making me eat frigging oatmeal the first half of my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA poet and a philosopher, Drew is truly a Renaissance man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my mouth to tease him, but I snap it shut as a wave of nausea strikes like a lightning bolt. I clear my throat and bring the back of my hand to my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kate? You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I try to answer, my stomach does a somersault that would make Nadia Com?neci jealous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to throw up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate throwing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes me feel claustrophobic. Suffocated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo this day, when I have a stomach virus, I sit on the phone with my mommy while she talks me through the heaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not going to make it to the bathroom, so I lunge for the kitchen sink. As I splatter my breakfast into it, Drew holds back the strands of hair that have escaped my ponytail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to tell him to go away, but another round of retching commences. Some women have no problem going to the bathroom, passing gas, or throwing up in front of their boyfriends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it’s stupid, but if I were to die suddenly, I don’t want the last image Drew has of me to be one where I’m sitting on the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr in this case, barfing in the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis voice is kind. Soothing. “Okay . . . easy. You’re okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it seems like the worst is over, Drew hands me a wet paper towel. Then he glances toward the drain. “Well, that’s colorful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI croak, “Ugh—I knew I was getting the flu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seems like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “I don’t have time be sick. I have the Robinson meeting today.” Anne Robinson is a client I’ve been courting for months. Old money—and I stress the word old. She’s like, ninety-five. If I don’t sign her today, it might literally be too late to sign her at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sick, baby. And I don’t think Mrs. Robinson will be impressed if you yak all over her antique brooch. Lucky for you, you have a genius boyfriend who performs exceedingly well in clutch situations. Give me the folder—I’ll run the meeting. Annie’s as good as yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe scoops me up in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drew, no—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe cuts me off. “Nope. No bitching. Don’t want to hear it. I’m putting you to bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew tucks me in and leaves a glass of ginger ale on the nightstand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think he kisses my forehead, but I can’t be sure. Because I’m already drifting off to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hours later, I walk out of the elevator onto the 40th floor of our office building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach’s empty, but after a good nap, I woke up feeling better. Refreshed. Ready to take on the world and Anne Robinson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the small conference room and peer in through the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you see Drew? Sitting next to the little gray-haired lady in the wheelchair? While he’s speaking to the legal representation seated around the table, Mrs. Robinson’s hands disappear under it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a second later Drew flinches, like he’s been given an electric shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld women have a thing for Drew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s completely hilarious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe gives Mrs. Robinson a harsh look. She just wiggles her eyebrows. Then he rolls his eyes before looking away, spotting me in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew excuses himself and comes out into the hall, relief shining on his face like a beacon. “For the love of all that is holy—thank God you’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips slide into a smirk. “I don’t know; Mrs. Robinson seems to be enjoying your company.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah—if she tries enjoying it any more, I’m going to staple her hands to the conference table.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he looks me over, concerned. “Don’t think I’m not overfucking-joyed to see you, ’cause I am. But what are you doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re supposed to be in bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. “Must’ve been a three-hour bug. I feel fine now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew cups my cheek and palms my forehead, feeling for a fever. “You sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. Right as rain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe nods, but his eyes are suspicious, not totally convinced. “All right. Oh—we’re supposed to have dinner at my parents’ tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink you’ll be up for it, or do you want me to cancel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinner at the Evans’ is always an interesting affair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should be good to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe hands me the Robinson folder. “Okay. Your investment strategies got them all quivery. They’re wet and spread-eagled, just waiting for you to nail them.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-tangled-2/page-9.html","bookId":1814,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM"}
