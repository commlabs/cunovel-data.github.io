{"id":22745,"no":8,"title":"VII. THE BLUE CATERPILLAR.","content":"Would you like to know what happened to Alice, after she had got away from the Puppy? It was far too large an animal, you know, for her to play with. (I don’t suppose you would much enjoy playing with a young Hippopotamus, would you? You would always be expecting to be crushed as flat as a pancake under its great heavy feet!) So Alice was very glad to run away, while it wasn’t looking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, she wandered up and down, and didn’t know what in the world to do, to make herself grow up to her right size again. Of course she knew that she had to eat or drink something: that was the regular rule, you know: but she couldn’t guess what thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alice looking at the blue caterpillar sitting on a mushroom\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e However, she soon came to a great mushroom, that was so tall that she couldn’t see over the top of it without standing on tip-toe. And what do you think she saw? Something that I’m sure you never talked to, in all your life!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a large Blue Caterpillar.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I’ll tell you, soon, what Alice and the Caterpillar talked about: but first let us have a good look at the picture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That curious thing, standing in front of the Caterpillar, is called a “hookah”: and it’s used for smoking. The smoke comes through that long tube, that winds round and round like a serpent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And do you see its long nose and chin? At least, they look exactly like a nose and chin, don’t they? But they really are two of its legs. You know a Caterpillar has got quantities of legs: you can see some more of them, further down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What a bother it must be to a Caterpillar, counting over such a lot of legs, every night, to make sure it hasn’t lost any of them!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And another great bother must be, having to settle which leg it had better move first. I think, if you had forty or fifty legs, and if you wanted to go a walk, you’d be such a time in settling which leg to begin with, that you’d never go a walk at all!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And what did Alice and the Caterpillar talk about, I wonder?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, Alice told it how very confusing it was, being first one size and then another.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the Caterpillar asked her if she liked the size she was, just then.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Alice said she would like to be just a little bit larger——three inches was such a wretched height to be! (Just mark off three inches on the wall, about the length of your middle finger, and you’ll see what size she was.)\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the Caterpillar told her one side of the mushroom would make her grow taller, and the other side would make her grow shorter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So Alice took two little bits of it with her to nibble, and managed to make herself quite a nice comfortable height, before she went on to visit the Duchess.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Duchess holding a baby while Alice looks on and the cook is cooking\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1831/53094.html","bookId":630,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:06:03 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:06:03 PM"}
