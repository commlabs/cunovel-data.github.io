{"id":31958,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"Humphrey came downstairs and out into the street again walking like one in a dream. His interview with Ferrol had lasted barely five minutes, and in those few minutes the whole course of his future life had been determined. His mind was whirling with the suddenness of it all; whirling and whirling round one thought, the thought of three pounds a week. Round this pivot, as a catharine-wheel spins round its pin, the thing of the greatest import revolved brilliantly, shedding its luminous light far into the dark recesses of the future ... he was on The Day. Fleet Street was at his feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In that moment a new Humphrey Quain was born, different from the youth who had walked a little timorously into Ferrol\u0027s room; he was no longer a lost cipher in the world, he was a unit in the army that marched forwards, with Progress and To-morrow for their watchwords. He felt, suddenly, a great manâ€”Humphrey Quain of The Day, cocksure, self-confident, with ambitions that appalled him when he thought of them in after years.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What would Beaver say? What would old Worthing say...? And there was his aunt, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That man in the silk hat, with the shabby overcoat, was still sitting on the doorstep. As Humphrey passed him, his lips twisted in a haunting ironical smile. Perhaps he knew of Humphrey\u0027s thoughts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He went back to Easterham. After all, Worthing took it very well, and his aunt agreed that three pounds a[54] week certainly showed that he was Getting On, and Beaver, to whom he wrote the glad news, recommended him rooms in Guilford Street, in the house where he was living.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And there followed days of tremendous dreams.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1879/54331.html","bookId":801,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:48:49 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:48:49 AM"}
