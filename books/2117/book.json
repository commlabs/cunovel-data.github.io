Roaming in his spare time, Harry discovers that Thibor had infected a pregnant woman with a small part of his flesh, which results in a lesser breed of vampire, albeit a still formidable one. This youth, Yulian Bodescu, retains many vampire abilities: hypnotism, increased lust, bodily transformation, regeneration, and creating thralls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/necroscope-ii-wamphyri-necroscope-2.jpg","author":"Brian Lumley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-ii-wamphyri-necroscope-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:49 PM"}
