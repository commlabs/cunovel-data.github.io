I loved a good fire drill\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it disrupted class for the time being, gave us a chance for some fresh air, and allowed Ivy, Abby, and me the freedom to gossip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only problem was when the high school performed the drills in a season with plummeting temperatures. It was always on a day when I chose not to drag my coat with me all day and kept it in my locker. The guys didn\u0027t seem bothered by not wearing their coats, but I was freezing. Our class lined up outside where the asphalt met the grass. Nash, Dylan, and Jake used the opportunity to throw snowballs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, you\u0027re shivering.\" Brandon was holding out his coat to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was taken aback at his kind gesture. Nash hadn\u0027t even offered to stand next to me. I think I was too cold to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted so badly to be wrapped in Brandon\u0027s coat, but I knew if I took it, my friends would freak out\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;especially Nash. But what my friends and Nash didn\u0027t know was that I wanted to use Brandon\u0027s coat\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not because I was cold, but because it was his coat. It was close to his skin and cloaked him all day long. I knew it would smell good, too\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;like fabric softener or irresistible cologne or smoke from a fireplace. I wanted to wear it now, wear it all day, wear it forever. It would be the closest I\u0027d be able to get to him again, since our time together in the woods when he saved my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy shot me a dirty look. She was protective of me and must have thought Brandon was hitting on me. I could only hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby yanked my sleeve toward her and the three of us girls huddled together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take it,\" Hayley Phillips, a skater from Riverside, said. She was wearing fingerless gloves, a knit hat, and a long-sleeved thermal henley. She put on Brandon\u0027s coat. It swallowed her up like an oversized blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI envied her. At that moment I would have given anything to have been in her skateboarding shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchool was closed for the next few days for the Thanksgiving holiday. Since I couldn\u0027t see Brandon at school, I was looking forward to Nash\u0027s party in the hope that he might show up. Nash lived in the same subdivision as Ivy and Abby. The homes were estates and had as many bathrooms as bedrooms. I spent hours trying to find the perfect outfit. I realized I was dressing up as much for a possible Brandon sighting as I was for Nash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a strong chance Brandon wouldn\u0027t show. Not only might it be that he\u0027d gone out of town for the holiday, but if he\u0027d remained in Legend\u0027s Run, what did he have to gain by attending? He didn\u0027t socialize with any of us or anyone who was coming to the party. He might have thought it was a trick or a potential hazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy and I arrived at the party to find Abby already there with Dylan. Jake was talking to several jocks, and Nash was nowhere to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we headed into the kitchen, I found Nash by the refrigerator. Instead of greeting me with a passionate kiss\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;which I would have been uncomfortable with anyway\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he seemed almost put off by my presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to pour your drinks?\" He sighed. \"I\u0027m not used to being someone\u0027s servant, you know. I thought I did my job when I apologized to that guy. Anyway, I haven\u0027t seen him, and I\u0027m crossing my fingers he doesn\u0027t show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I think pouring me a soda would be a nice gesture,\" I said, not because I wanted him to be a servant, but because it was the gentlemanly thing to do. \"But I can pour my own drink,\" I finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it - \" Nash said. \"I\u0027m not being a good host. What would you ladies like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew there was a good guy inside of Nash, but sometimes it took a lot of prodding to find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoped Brandon would arrive at any moment. There was a chance we could all get to know one another and make him feel more comfortable at our school. I knew that our being one big happy clique was near to impossible, but it was my nature to dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour passed and Brandon still hadn\u0027t shown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem distracted,\" Ivy said. \"This party was your idea. You should be having the most fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got the best part of the dare,\" Nash said, chuckling. \"Shame that Westsider didn\u0027t show. I\u0027m sure we would have been great friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash headed for the stairs. I didn\u0027t even follow him. Instead I sat on the couch and vacantly watched whatever was playing on the TV. The clock ticked on and Nash didn\u0027t return. I\u0027d finished my soda hours ago, so I decided to get a bottle of water. I was headed back to the kitchen when I spotted Brandon in the corner of the parlor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked magnetic\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;more stunning than any other guy there. It wasn\u0027t hard for him to look gorgeous\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;for Brandon it came naturally. It was clear he could have any girl at the party, if one so much as saw beyond his Westsider status. But it didn\u0027t seem likely that any of these girls would look past their turned-up noses, and for this, I was almost grateful. He would have been fawned all over by every cheerleader and become just like any other guy on the football or basketball team, possibly just like the one who had invited me\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;who was supposed to be my boyfriend and wasn\u0027t paying me any attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon was sitting with Hayley Phillips and a few other skaters whom he must have brought with him. Hayley was talking to her friends, but Brandon wasn\u0027t listening to their conversation. I didn\u0027t think they were dating\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I hoped they weren\u0027t. Brandon wasn\u0027t really talking to them but rather he appeared like he was observing the crowd, as if he was looking for someone. He didn\u0027t notice me watching him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should talk to them,\" I said when Ivy reached my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Ivy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they were invited to the party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it\u0027s your nature to be nice to everyone. But really, we don\u0027t know them. They seem to be really happy hanging out together. And besides, it\u0027s Nash\u0027s party, not ours. He\u0027s the one who should talk to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it hit me\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what if Brandon did mention our time in the woods? My friends would be very curious why I hadn\u0027t mentioned that he was the one who saved me. Maybe I didn\u0027t want my friends talking to them\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I wasn\u0027t sure they would understand why I hadn\u0027t told them myself, and I didn\u0027t want there to be trouble between Brandon and Nash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, Nash needed to welcome his new guests, just as Ivy said. I scoured the house for him. I went upstairs to find his bedroom door closed. Afraid of what\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or who\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I might find with him on the other side, I knocked. When no one answered, I opened it. The room was empty. I was relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally found Nash downstairs in the media room. He was hanging out on the couch, yucking it up for some of his teammates. Heidi Rosen\u0027s legs were draped over his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon wasn\u0027t the only one Nash wasn\u0027t paying attention to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash saw me standing at the bottom of the stairs. \"Hey, Celeste - \" he called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around and left. When I reached the top of the stairs, I bumped into Brandon. I didn\u0027t know what to say. I wanted to leave. My so-called boyfriend had disappointed me. I didn\u0027t want anyone, much less Brandon, to witness it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just wanted to go. I found Ivy and told her what I\u0027d seen. \"The thing is, Ivy. I\u0027m not sure that I care,\" I finally admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you should stay,\" she encouraged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean about Nash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash found me as I headed to the front door with my purse and keys in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to stop me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste - \" Nash said, \"where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out for some fresh air,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You misinterpreted what you saw,\" he said. \"She was hanging on me, not the other way around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. I don\u0027t care. And besides, that\u0027s not the issue, Nash. You missed the whole point of this party,\" I said to him. \"It was about our friends. It was about meeting other people. It definitely wasn\u0027t supposed to be about Heidi Rosen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately the partygoers were focused on their own conversations\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;except for one person. Brandon was hanging by the foyer and overheard everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste, don\u0027t go,\" Ivy said, running up to us at the door. I pushed past Nash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was briskly marching to my car when I sensed someone behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not staying, Nash,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t Nash trailing me. It was Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood by my car, the moonlight shining on his face. He was so alluring, my heart raced and I was breathless. It was one thing to see Brandon from across the classroom or hallway, before he saved my life. But since I\u0027d spent so many hours obsessing about him and imagining him kissing me, I was suddenly embarrassed being in his company\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;as if he knew the romantic thoughts I\u0027d been thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leaving so soon?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... yes. I just...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I felt torn. I was the one who put Nash up to inviting Brandon. Nash was ignoring him and now I was leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny. You were the reason I came,\" he said as if the words had slipped from his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to say. I felt so flattered, awkward, and nervous. I knew I should say something witty back, but all my words escaped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Nash looming by the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I better go,\" I said. As I got into my car, Nash went back inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon watched me as I put the gear into reverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure what to do. I was pulled in two directions. I might have been leaving Nash, but I didn\u0027t want to leave Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned off the ignition and got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you forget something?\" Brandon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never properly thanked you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon twinkled above and the stars shined brightly. If I were the star of a Hollywood movie, I would have thrown myself into his arms and we would have shared a steamy kiss. But my life was far from a movie. I didn\u0027t move, and neither did Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste!\" Ivy called. She and Abby were running toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon retreated into the darkened shadows of the front yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you already left,\" Ivy said. \"I\u0027m so glad you changed your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just forgot something,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you forget?\" Abby wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To thank someone who saved my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure what you mean,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay.\" I sighed. \"It\u0027s hard to explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t leave,\" Ivy begged. \"Nash was just being foolish. He\u0027s in there sulking. You left him in front of everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. Normally I didn\u0027t seek revenge, but Nash deserved a time-out. He wasn\u0027t doting like Jake and Dylan, or chivalrous like Brandon. I didn\u0027t want to be anywhere near him and remind myself of his behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time I have servants for a day,\" I said to Ivy, \"I won\u0027t waste it on him.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-11.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
