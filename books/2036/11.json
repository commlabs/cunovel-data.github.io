{"id":108893,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\u003cp\u003eArizona was as hot and barren a state as Elena had imagined. She and Damon drove directly to the Juniper Resort, and Elena was depressed, if not surprised, to see that Matt was not checked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can\u0027t have taken him longer than us to get here,\" she said, as soon as they\u0027d been shown up to their rooms. \"Unless - oh, God, Damon! Unless Shinichi caught him somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon sat down on a bed and regarded Elena grimly. \"I guess I hoped I wouldn\u0027t have to tell you this - that the jerk would at least have the courtesy to tell you himself. But I\u0027ve been tracking his aura ever since he left us. It\u0027s been getting steadily farther away - in the direction of Fell\u0027s Church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, really bad news takes a while to sink in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean,\" Elena said, \"that he\u0027s not going to show up here at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean that, as the crow flies, it wasn\u0027t all that far from where we got the cars to Fell\u0027s Church. He went in that direction. And he didn\u0027t come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" Elena demanded, as if logic could somehow conquer fact. \"Why would he go off and leave me? Especially, why would he go to Fell\u0027s Church, where they\u0027re looking for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for why he\u0027d leave: I think he got the wrong idea about you and me - or maybe the right idea a little early\" - Damon raised his eyebrows at Elena and she threw a pillow at him - \"and decided to let us have some privacy. As for why Fell\u0027s Church...\" Damon shrugged. \"Look, you\u0027ve known the guy longer than I have. But even I can tell he\u0027s the Galahad type. The parfait gentil knight, sans peur et sans reproche. If I had to say I\u0027d say he went to meet Caroline\u0027s charges.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no,\" Elena said, going to the door as a knock sounded. \"Not after I told him and told him - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" Damon said, assuming a slight crouching position. \"Even with your sage advice ringing in his ears - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened. It was Bonnie. Bonnie, with her petite frame, her curly strawberry hair, her wide, soulful brown eyes. Elena, in a state to disbelieve the evidence of her own eyes, and still not through with the argument with Damon, shut the door on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt\u0027s going to get lynched,\" Elena almost screamed, vaguely annoyed that some knocking was going on somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon uncrouched. He passed Elena on the way to the door, said, \"I think you\u0027d better sit down,\" and then sat her down by putting her in a chair and holding her there until she stopped trying to get up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time it was Meredith knocking. Tall and willowy, with her hair falling in dark clouds around her shoulders, Meredith radiated the intention to go on knocking until the door stayed open. Something happened inside Elena, and she found that she could get her mind around more than one subject at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Meredith. And Bonnie. In Sedona, Arizona!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena leaped up from the chair where Damon had put her and flung her arms around Meredith, saying incoherently, \"You came! You came! You knew I couldn\u0027t call you, so you came!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie edged around the embrace and said to Damon in an undertone, \"Is she back to kissing everyone she meets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately,\" Damon said, \"no. But be prepared to be squeezed to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena turned on him. \"I heard that! Oh, Bonnie! I just can\u0027t believe you two are really here. I wanted to talk to you so much!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, she was hugging Bonnie, and Bonnie was hugging her, and Meredith was hugging both of them. Subtle velociraptor sisterhood signals were being passed from one to another at the same time - an arched eyebrow here, a slight nod there, a frown and shrug ending with a sigh. Damon didn\u0027t know it, but he had just been accused, tried, acquitted, and restored to duty - with the conclusion that extra surveillance was necessary in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena snapped out of it first. \"You must have met with Matt - he had to tell you about this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did, and then he sold the Prius and we sort of packed on the run and got plane tickets here and we\u0027ve been waiting - we didn\u0027t want to miss you!\" Bonnie said breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose that would have been just about two days ago that you bought your tickets here,\" Damon asked the ceiling wearily as he lounged with an elbow on Elena\u0027s chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see - \" Bonnie began, but Meredith said flatly, \"Yes it was. What? It made something happen to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were trying to keep things slightly ambiguous for the enemy,\" Damon said. \"But as it turns out, it probably didn\u0027t matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Elena thought, because Shinichi can reach inside your brain whenever he wants and try to take away your memories and all you can do is try to fight him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it does mean that Elena and I should start off right away.\" Damon continued. \"I have to do an errand first. Elena should pack. Take as little as you can, just the absolute essentials - but include food for two or three days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said...starting now?\" Bonnie breathed, and then she sat down abruptly on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes sense, if we\u0027ve already lost the element of surprise,\" Damon replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you two came to say good-bye to me while Matt watches over the town,\" Elena said. \"That is so sweet!\" She smiled radiantly before adding, in her own mind, And so dumb!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I still have an errand,\" Damon said, waving without turning around. \"Let\u0027s say we\u0027ll leave here in half an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stingy,\" Bonnie complained, when the door was safely shut behind him. \"That might have only given us a few minutes to talk before we start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can pack in less than five minutes,\" Elena said sadly, and then got tangled up in Bonnie\u0027s previous sentence. \"\u0027Before we start\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t pack just essentials at all,\" Meredith was fretting quietly. \"I couldn\u0027t store everything on my mobile, and I have no idea when I\u0027ll be able to recharge the batteries. I\u0027ve got a suitcase of stuff on paper!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena was looking back and forth at them nervously. \"Um, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m the one who\u0027s supposed to be packing,\" she said. \"Because I\u0027m the only one going...right?\" Another look back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if we would let you set off into some other universe without us!\" Bonnie said. \"You need us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not another universe; only another dimension,\" Meredith said. \"But the same principle applies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - I can\u0027t let you come with me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you can\u0027t. I\u0027m older than you,\" Meredith said. \"You don\u0027t \u0027let\u0027 me do anything. But the truth is that we have a mission. We want to find Shinichi\u0027s or Misao\u0027s star ball if we can. If we could do that we think we could stop most of the stuff going on in Fell\u0027s Church immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Star ball?\" Elena said blankly, while somewhere in the depths of her mind, an uneasy image stirred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll explain later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena was shaking her head. \"But - you left Matt to deal with whatever supernatural stuff is going on? When he\u0027s a fugitive and has to hide from the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena, even the police are scared of Fell\u0027s Church now - and frankly, if they put him in custody in Ridgemont it might be the safest place for him. But they\u0027re not going to do that. He\u0027s working with Mrs. Flowers and they\u0027re good together; they\u0027re a solid team.\" Meredith stopped to take a breath, and seemed to be considering how to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie said it for her in a very small voice. \"And I was no good, Elena. I\u0027d started - well, I started to get hysterical and see and hear things that weren\u0027t there - or at least to imagine them and maybe even make them come true. I was scaring myself out of my mind, and I think I actually was putting people in danger. Matt\u0027s too practical to do that.\" She dabbed at her eyes. \"I know the Dark Dimension is pretty bad, but at least I won\u0027t be able to put houses full of innocent people in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith nodded. \"It was all...going bad with Bonnie there. Even if we hadn\u0027t wanted to come with you I would have had to get her out. I don\u0027t want to be overly dramatic, but I believe that the demons there were after her. And that since Stefan\u0027s gone, Damon may be the only one who can keep them away. Or maybe you can help her, Elena?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith...overly dramatic? But Elena could see the fine tremors running under Meredith\u0027s skin, and the light sheen of perspiration on Bonnie\u0027s forehead that was dampening her curls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith touched Elena\u0027s wrist. \"We haven\u0027t just gone AWOL or anything. Fell\u0027s Church is a war zone now; it\u0027s true, but we didn\u0027t leave Matt without allies. Like Dr. Alpert - she\u0027s logical - she\u0027s the best country doctor there is - and she might even convince somebody that Shinichi and the malach are real. But besides all that, the parents have taken over. Parents and psychiatrists and newshounds. And they make it almost impossible to work openly anyway. Matt\u0027s not at any disadvantage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - in just a week - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a look at this week\u0027s Sunday paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena took the Ridgemont Times from Meredith. It was the biggest paper in the area of Fell\u0027s Church. A banner headline read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePOSSESSION IN THE 21ST CENTURY?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the headline were many lines of gray print, but what really caught the eye was a photo of a three-way fight between girls, all of whom seemed to be undergoing seizures or contortions impossible to the human body. The expressions of two of the girls were simply those of pain and terror, but it was the third girl who froze the blood in Elena\u0027s veins. Her body was humped so that her face was upside down, and she was looking directly at the camera with her lips skinned back from her teeth. Her eyes - there was just no other way to put it - were demonic. They weren\u0027t rolled back in her head or malformed or anything. They weren\u0027t glowing eerily red. It was all in the expression. Elena had never seen eyes that made her sick to her stomach before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie said quietly, \"Do you ever sort of slip and get that feeling like, \u0027Oh, whoops, there goes the whole universe\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Constantly, since meeting Stefan,\" Meredith said. \"No offense meant, Elena. But the point is that all this has happened in just a couple of days; from the minute the adults who knew that there was something really going on got together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith sighed and ran fingers with perfectly manicured nails through her hair before continuing. \"Those girls are what Bonnie calls possessed in the modern sense. Or maybe they\u0027re possessed by Misao - female kitsune are supposed to do that. But if we could just find these things called star balls - or even one - we could force them to clean all this up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena put the newspaper down so she wouldn\u0027t have to see those upside-down eyes staring into hers. \"And while all this is happening, what is your boyfriend doing during the crisis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, Meredith looked genuinely relieved. \"He may be on his way as we speak. I\u0027ve written to him about everything that\u0027s happening, and he was actually the one who said to get Bonnie out.\" She flashed a glance of apology at Bonnie, who simply lifted her hands and face to the heavens. \"And as soon as he\u0027s finished with his work on some island called Shinmei no Uma, he\u0027s coming to Fell\u0027s Church. This kind of thing is Alaric\u0027s specialty, and he doesn\u0027t get spooked easily. So even if we\u0027re gone for weeks, Matt will have a backup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena threw her own hands up in a gesture similar to Bonnie\u0027s. \"There\u0027s just one thing you\u0027d better know before we start. I can\u0027t help Bonnie. If you\u0027re counting on me to do any of the things I did when we fought Shinichi and Misao last time - well, I can\u0027t. I\u0027ve tried over and over, as hard as I could, to do all my wings attacks. But nothing has ever come of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith said slowly, \"Well, then, maybe Damon knows something - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he does, but, Meredith, don\u0027t push him right now. Not right this minute. What he knows for certain is that Shinichi can reach in and take his memories - and who knows, maybe even possess him again - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That lying kitsune!\" Bonnie spat out, sounding almost proprietory. As if, Elena thought, Damon was her boyfriend. \"Shinichi swore he wouldn\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he swore he\u0027d leave Fell\u0027s Church alone, too. The only reason I have any faith at all in the clues that Misao gave me about the fox key, is that she was taunting me. She never thought we\u0027d do a deal, and so she wasn\u0027t trying to lie or be too clever - I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s why we\u0027re here with you, to get Stefan out,\" Bonnie said. \"And if we\u0027re lucky, to find the star balls that will let us control Shinichi. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right!\" Elena said fervently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Meredith said solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie nodded. \"Velociraptor sisterhood forever!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey laid their right hands over one another\u0027s quickly, forming a three-spoked wheel. It reminded Elena of the days when there were four spokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about Caroline?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie and Meredith consulted each other with their eyes. Then Meredith shook her head. \"You don\u0027t want to know. Really,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can take it. Really,\" Elena said in almost a whisper. \"Meredith, I\u0027ve been dead, remember? Twice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith was still shaking her head. \"If you can\u0027t look at that picture, you shouldn\u0027t hear about Caroline. We went to see her twice - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You went to see her twice,\" Bonnie interrupted. \"The second time I fainted and you left me by the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I realized I could have lost you for good, and I\u0027ve apologized - \" Meredith broke off when Bonnie put a hand on her arm and gave her a little push.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, it wasn\u0027t exactly a visit,\" Meredith said. \"I went running into Caroline\u0027s room ahead of her mom and found her inside her nest - never mind what that is - eating something. When she saw me, she just giggled and went on eating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" Elena said, when the tension got to be too much for her. \"What was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" Meredith said bleakly, \"that it was worms and slugs. She would stretch them up and up and they\u0027d squirm before she bit them. But that wasn\u0027t the worst. Look, you had to have been here to appreciate it, but she just smirked at me, and said in this thick voice, \u0027Have a bite?\u0027 and suddenly my mouth was filled with this wriggling mass - and it was going down my throat. So I was sick, right there on her carpet. Caroline just started laughing, and I ran down again and picked Bonnie up and ran out and we never went back. But...halfway down the path to the house, I realized Bonnie was suffocating. She had the - the worms and things - in her mouth and her nose. I know CPR; I managed to get most of them out before she woke up vomiting. But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was an experience I would really rather not have again.\" The very lack of expression in Bonnie\u0027s voice said more than any tone of horror could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith said, \"I\u0027ve heard that Caroline\u0027s parents have moved out of that house, and I can\u0027t say I blame them. Caroline\u0027s over eighteen. All I can add is that everybody\u0027s sort of praying that somehow the werewolf blood will win out in her, because that seems at least to be less horrible than the malach or the - the demonic. But if it doesn\u0027t win out...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena rested her chin on her knees. \"And Mrs. Flowers can deal with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better than Bonnie can. Mrs. Flowers is glad to have Matt around; like I said, they\u0027re a solid team. And now that she has finally spoken to the human race of the twenty-first century, I think she likes it. And she\u0027s been practicing the craft constantly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The craft? Oh - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s what she calls witchcraft. I have no idea whether she\u0027s any good at it or not, because I don\u0027t have anything to compare her to - or with - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her poultices work like magic!\" Bonnie said firmly just as Elena said, \"Her bath salts certainly work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith smiled faintly. \"Too bad she isn\u0027t here instead of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena shook her head. Now that she had reconnected with Bonnie and Meredith she knew she could never go into the Darkness without them. They were more than her hands; they were so much more to her...and here they were, each prepared to risk their life for Stefan and for Fell\u0027s Church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, the door to the room opened. Damon walked in, carrying a couple of brown paper bags in one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So everybody\u0027s said bye-bye nicely?\" he asked. He seemed to have trouble looking at either of the two visitors, so he stared particularly hard at Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well - not really. Not as such,\" Elena said. She wondered if Damon was capable of throwing Meredith out a fifth-story window. Best to break it easily to him, by degrees....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we\u0027re going with you,\" Meredith said, and Bonnie said, \"We forgot to pack, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena slid quickly so that she was between Damon and the others. But Damon just stared at the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a bad idea,\" he said very softly. \"A very, very, very bad idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damon, don\u0027t Influence them! Please!\" Elena waved both hands at him in a gesture of urgency, and Damon raised one of his hands in a gesture of negation - and somehow their hands brushed each other\u0027s - and tangled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElectric shock. But a nice one, Elena thought - although she didn\u0027t really have time to think it. She and Damon were both trying desperately to get their hands back to themselves, but didn\u0027t seem to be able to. Little shockwaves were running from Elena\u0027s palm all through her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the disentanglement worked and then they both turned, in guilty unison, to look at Bonnie and Meredith, who were staring at them with enormous eyes. Suspicious eyes. Eyes that belonged in faces saying \"Aha! What have we here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long moment when no one moved or spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Damon said seriously, \"This isn\u0027t some kind of pleasure trip. We\u0027re going because there\u0027s no other choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not alone, you\u0027re not,\" Meredith said in a neutral tone. \"If Elena goes, we all go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know it\u0027s a bad place,\" Bonnie said, \"but we are definitely going with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, we have our own agenda,\" Meredith added. \"A way to cleanse Fell\u0027s Church of the harm Shinichi has done - and is still doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon shook his head. \"You don\u0027t understand. You won\u0027t like it,\" he said tightly. He nodded at her mobile. \"No electric power in there. Even owning one of those is a crime. And the punishment for just about any crime is torture and death.\" He took a step toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith refused to back away, her dark gaze fixed on his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, you don\u0027t even realize what you have to do just to get in,\" Damon said bleakly. \"First, you need a vampire - and you\u0027re lucky to have one. Then you\u0027ll have to do all sorts of things you won\u0027t like - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Elena can do it, we can do it,\" Meredith interrupted quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want either of you to get hurt. I\u0027m going in because it\u0027s for Stefan,\" Elena said hastily, speaking partly to her friends and partly to the innermost core of her being, which the shockwaves and pulses of electricity had reached at last. Such a strange, melting, throbbing sweetness for something that had started out as a shock. Such a fierce shock for simply touching another person\u0027s hand....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena manged to tear her eyes away from Damon\u0027s face and tune back into the argument that was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going in for Stefan, yes,\" Meredith was saying to her, \"and we\u0027re going in with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you, you won\u0027t like it. You\u0027ll live to regret it - if you live, that is,\" Damon was saying flatly, his expression dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie simply gazed up at Damon with her brown eyes wide and pleading in her small heart-shaped face. Her hands were clasped together at the base of her throat. She looked like a picture on a Hallmark card, Elena thought. And those eyes were worth a thousand logical arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Damon looked back at Elena. \"You\u0027re probably taking them to their deaths, you know. You, I could probably protect. But you and Stefan, and your two little teenage girlfriends... I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing it put that way was a shock. Elena hadn\u0027t quite thought of it like that. But she could see the determined set of Meredith\u0027s jaw and the way Bonnie had gone up a little on her toes to try to look bigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s already been decided,\" she said quietly, aware that her voice shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long moment as she stared into Damon\u0027s dark eyes, and then suddenly he flashed his 250-kilowatt smile at all of them, shut it off almost before it had begun, and said, \"I see. Well, in that case, I have another errand. I may not be back for quite a while, so feel free to use the room - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena should come to our room,\" Meredith said. \"I have a lot of material to show her. And if we can\u0027t take much with us, we\u0027ll have to go over it all tonight - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s say we meet back here at dawn,\" Damon said. \"We\u0027ll set off for the Demon Gate from here. And remember - don\u0027t bring money; it isn\u0027t any good there. And this is not a vacation - but you\u0027ll get that idea soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a graceful, ironic gesture, he handed Elena her bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Demon Gate?\" Bonnie said as they went to the elevator. Her voice shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush,\" said Meredith. \"It\u0027s only a name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena wished she didn\u0027t know so well when Meredith was lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-shadow-souls-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-11.html","bookId":2036,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:30:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:30:13 PM"}
