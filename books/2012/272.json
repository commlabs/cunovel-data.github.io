Then this master’s power cannot challenge us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He and his army represent a military threat nonetheless. I now advise we dispatch another three legions, commanded by another Pure.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ready the legions, Brother, but do not send them to Estobanse. Not yet. The challenge posed by the Master of the Deck of Dragons … intrigues me. I will think some more on how to deal with him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As you wish, Sister.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors swung open then and Diligence turned to observe the approach of the retinue. Flanked by two Pures, the heavily armoured warriors marched towards the throne, a full dozen of the highest-ranking officers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Diligence murmured, ‘Most formidable, are they not, Sister Reverence?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed, Brother.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen paces from the dais the contingent halted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Diligence studied them briefly, and then said to one of the escorting Pures, ‘Brother Serenity. They have anchored their ships in the harbour?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They have, Brother. They are now servants of the Restitution.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Reverence then spoke. ‘Welcome, Grey Helms of the Perish. Your gesture has left no doubt in our minds as to the veracity of your claims.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the commanders tipped his head and said, ‘We have discussed your arguments at length, Sister Reverence, and we are agreed. Our Mortal Sword committed blasphemy in swearing fealty to the Malazans. Furthermore, we are certain that our Shield Anvil has concluded much the same, and that he is now at odds with the Mortal Sword.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And who will win this wrestling for control of your land-based army?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There is no ambiguity, Sister Reverence. The Mortal Sword shall be made to accept her crime, and do penance. If she refuses, she will be divested of her title and the privileges it affords. The time has come. The vengeance of the Wolves of Winter must now begin.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All very delightful,’ Sister Reverence purred, and then she leaned forward. ‘Unfortunately, the Forkrul Assail demand something more than an alliance of forces that just happen to share – for the moment at least – a common cause.’ She raised her voice. ‘Now, you shall kneel. You shall avow your service to the will of the Forkrul Assail.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Brother Diligence felt buffeted by the power of Sister Reverence’s sorcery. Against this, no mere human, no matter how pious or disciplined, could stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chamber echoed with the creak and clatter of armour as the Perish warriors knelt on the bloodstained tiles of the throne room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiligence turned to Reverence. ‘Sister, I look forward to using these subjects. And it pleases me to know that yet more are on their way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, leaning back. ‘What are wolves but dogs not yet beaten into submission?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiligence frowned. ‘Their cause is just, Sister Reverence.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is indeed, Brother. But wildness is without discipline. Even savagery must be controlled, given direction and focus. We shall be the guiding hand.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As you say, Sister.’ He regarded the still-kneeling Perish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You look thoughtful, Brother.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I was contemplating setting these warriors against the Master of the Deck of Dragons.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverence arched her brows, and then said, ‘Brother Serenity, what think you of that notion?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I only ask that I be granted the privilege of commanding them, Sister. It is my understanding that the offending army is composed of Malazans, and I have a history with Malazans.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Send them, Brother Diligence. Break their defences, Serenity, and if you can, drive them out into the open. I dare say even mastery of the warrens would not save them then. At that moment, we shall discover what other resources the man possesses, if any.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you want him delivered in chains before you, Sister?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe considered, and then said, ‘No. His head will suffice.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swarm of Shards twisted as it lifted high into the air, blotting out a third of the sky. The shadow it cast spread across the ravaged, lifeless desert, flowing like black water. The scent of suffering was in the air, and the hunger of the locusts was, as ever, desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow found the prey, but even the sudden cooling of air was not enough to awaken it to the threat fast closing, and the locusts rushed towards it. As the vast cloud hovered a moment it seemed to tremble, and then out from its heart burst a winged creature. It plummeted down upon the unconscious form lying sprawled on the parched ground, and in its wake descended the Shards, their wings voicing a roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaloned hands reached down, grasped hold of the body, lifted it effortlessly. Wings thundering, the creature rose back into the sky. Behind it, the locusts spun in confusion. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-272.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
