I’m always hungry, and my feet hurt.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1 hate children with secrets-especially ones with secrets they’re not even aware of. Find the right questions; there’s no other way of doing this. ‘What else bothers you about being among the living again, Kettle?’ And… how? Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Feeling small.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren’s right arm was plucked by a slave, an old man who reached out for the keys with pathetic hope in his eyes. She handed them to him. ‘Free the others,’ she said. He nodded vigorously, scrabbling at his shackles. ‘Now,’ Seren said to Kettle, ‘that’s a feeling we all must accept. Too much of the world defies our efforts to conform to what would please us. To live is to know dissatisfaction and frustration.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I still want to tear out throats, Seren. Is that bad? I think it must be.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Kettle’s words, the old man shrank away, redoubling his clumsy attempts at releasing himself. Behind him a woman cursed with impatience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas had climbed onto the bed of the lead wagon and was busy looting it for whatever they might.need. Kettle scrambled to join him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We need to move out of this mist,’ Seren muttered. ‘I’m soaked through.’ She walked towards the wagon. ‘Hurry up with that, you two. If more company finds us here, we could be in trouble.’ Especially now that Silchas Ruin is gone. The Tiste Andii had been the singular reason for their survival thus far. When hiding and evading the searchers failed, his two swords found voice, the eerie song of obliteration. The White Crow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a week since they last caught sight of Edur and Letherii who were clearly hunters. Seeking the traitor, Fear Sengar. Seeking the betrayer, Udinaas. Yet Seren Pedac was bemused-there should have been entire armies chasing them. While the pursuit was persistent, it was dogged rather than ferocious in its execution. Silchas had mentioned, once, in passing, that the Emperor’s K’risnan were working ritual sorceries, the kind that sought to lure and trap. And that snares awaited them to the east, and round Letheras itself. She could understand those to the east, for it was the wild lands beyond the empire that had been their destination all along, where Fear-for some reason he did not care to explain-believed he would find what he sought; a belief that Silchas Ruin did not refute. But to surround the capital city itself baffled Seren. As if Rhulad is frightened of his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas leapt down from the lead wagon and made his way to the second one. ‘I found coin,’ he said. ‘Lots. We should take these horses, too-we can sell them once we’re down the other side of the pass.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There is a fort at the pass,’ Seren said. ‘It may be un-garrisoned, but there’s no guarantee of that, Udinaas. If we arrive with horses-and they recognize them…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We go round that fort,’ he replied. ‘At night. Unseen.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned, wiped water from her eyes. ‘Easier done without horses. Besides, these beasts are old, too broken-they won’t earn us much, especially in Bluerose. And when Wyval returns they’ll probably die of terror.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wyval’s not coming back,’ Udinaas said, turning away, his voice grating. ‘Wyval’s gone, and that’s that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she should not doubt him. The dragon-spawn’s spirit had dwelt within him, after all. Yet there was no obvious explanation for the winged beast’s sudden disappearance, at least none that Udinaas would share. Wyval had been gone for over a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas swore from where he crouched atop the bed of the wagon. ‘Nothing here but weapons.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Weapons?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Swords, shields and armour.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Letherii?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. Middling quality.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What were these slavers doing with a wagon load of weapons?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging, he climbed back down, hurried past her and began unhitching the horses. ‘These beasts would’ve had a hard time on the ascent.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Silchas Ruin is coming back,’ Kettle said, pointing down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That was fast.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas laughed harshly, then said, ‘The fools should have scattered, made him hunt each one down separately. Instead, they probably regrouped, like the stupid good soldiers they were.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom near the front wagon, Fear Sengar spoke. Your Mood is very thin, Udinaas, isn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Like water,’ the ex-slave replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Errant’s sake, Fear, he did not choose to abandon your brother. You know that. Nor is he responsible for Rhulad’s madness. So how much of your hatred for Udinaas comes from guilt! Who truly is to blame for Rhuladl For the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-15.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
