You also murdered Lori Star and attempted to murder Sam Latham.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Jared cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis horror and his fierce frown of denial certainly seemed real, Joe thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jared, I just came from Virginia, where you rented a Poe costume.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Jared asked, sounding truly confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look,” Joe told him. “I can get the cops in here now, and they’ll take your confession and help you work out a deal with the D.A. to avoid the death penalty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The death—what are you talking about?” Jared said. “What does renting a Poe costume in Virginia have to do with murder?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once, he didn’t look like a cocky rich kid, Joe thought. He looked genuinely frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn act?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jared, we have proof,” Joe said, knowing he was stretching the truth pretty much to the breaking point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Proof?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Proof that you used your father’s card to rent a Poe costume, then drove out to William Morton’s house and killed him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared shook his head, staring wildly. “My father liked William Morton. He thought he was brilliant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that why you killed him? Because you were jealous that your father thought more of Morton than he did of you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was stunned when Jared suddenly burst into tears. “Look, I was…a jerk. I didn’t think I had to pay my tickets. But I didn’t kill anyone. I sure as hell didn’t kill my father, I swear it. I wasn’t even there when he died. I was working, and then I went down and bought a hot dog from the vendor outside the office. You can talk to him if you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t you tell anyone about the hot-dog vendor before?” Joe asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I didn’t think of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the Sunday Lori Star was murdered?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was at home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure you were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s true.” He reddened. “There were drugs involved. I admit it. But I was home.” He brightened. “I saw someone then, too!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The window washer. I know he’ll remember me. I had just poured myself a drink when I saw him out there, and I was joking around, pretending I was going to pour him a drink, too.” “Why the hell didn’t you tell the police about this before?” Joe demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared shook his head. “Because…because I’m Jared Bigelow. I shouldn’t have to make excuses. I shouldn’t need an alibi. I’m Jared Bigelow,” he repeated in a small, defeated voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgusted, Joe turned away. Dammit. He believed the bastard. His story would be easy enough to prove. His building would have a contract with a window-washing service, and it would be easy enough to find whoever had been working there on a Sunday, of all days. No doubt the hot-dog vendor could be found and questioned, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if it hadn’t been Jared…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to have been someone with Jared. With Thorne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat left two people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Vincenzo. But did Mary have the strength to do what had been done to William Morton and Lori Star?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr there had been two killers. A woman and a man, working together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne with the strength to strangle someone. And one who could slip into a hospital room in a nurse’s uniform, and not be noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly remembered something. Something that had struck him as interesting a few days ago and then been forgotten in the welter of events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had spoken his name, and it wasn’t Jared Bigelow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he recognized the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt, or a semblance of Matt, was there. Matt, his cousin and best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dead cousin. His dead best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe, she needs you. For the love of God, hurry!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear and urgency set in. If Jared wasn’t the killer, then the killer was still out there. And if Matt was urging him on…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needs you, Matt repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe ran past the officer on duty outside the door without bothering to explain why he was in such a hurry. His cell phone was in his hand as he sprinted for the street. Genevieve didn’t pick up at her apartment, and she didn’t answer her cell. He tried Eileen’s number as he wondered why the hell you could never find a cab in New York when you really needed one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Joe!” Eileen said, pleased. “Are you joining us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart leaped. “Genevieve is with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but she may show up later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEileen told him, and when she didn’t mention one name in particular, he knew he had just figured everything out at last, knew what had niggled at him since the funeral until he’d remembered it just a few minutes ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t want to panic Eileen, so he just said, “Ask Gen to call me if she shows up, all right? And don’t leave O’Malley’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up. Where? Where the hell would the killer have taken her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere else, but…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was within walking distance, but he didn’t walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve woke up slowly. Her head was pounding as if a thousand trucks were running through it. Worse than that, though, her arms hurt, as if there was a dead weight pulling on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWherever she was, it was stuffy and it smelled funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized that there really was a dead weight on her arms. When she tried to move them, she heard what sounded like chains rattling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, and her eyes adjusted to the semidarkness. But she was chained, and the weird smell was…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was bricking her up behind a wall!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought back panic, reminded herself that she had been locked up underground by a maniac for weeks, and she had survived that. She had used her wits, and she had survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the trowel moving in the concrete mixture, heard the telltale sounds as another brick was shoved into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould she scream? Would there be any hope for her if she did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the last brick went in, how much time would she have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s awake, I know it,” said a female voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot Mary Vincenzo’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was familiar, but it sounded different, more confident than she had ever heard it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, she’s awake. Join us, won’t you, Genevieve?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man’s voice, and it was familiar, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought the panic setting in, trying to figure out the best way to play for time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime for what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor help to arrive? What help? Joe was at the police station, convinced that all clues led to Jared Bigelow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bennet, what a surprise,” Gen said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bennet? Come, come. You know my given name. Why not use it…Miss Genevieve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her head. The bricks that would eventually cover her face hadn’t been laid yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, Albee,” she said. “I don’t get it. Or maybe I do. I suppose you’re furious because Jared gets the Bigelow money, even after you put up with Thorny for all those years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeminine laughter rang out, and Barbara Hirshorn popped her head up behind Albee’s. “Don’t be silly.” Barbara had lost the Poe mustache she had been wearing, and though she still had on a man’s nineteenth-century suit and a black wig, her sharp features were now easily recognizable. “It’s not that at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” Gen said, frowning. “Then explain things to me. How did you do it? And why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really don’t understand anything, do you?” Barbara demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She should. After that trip to Richmond and Baltimore,” Bennet said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow the hell had he known where she’d been? Gen didn’t ask the question, but Barbara answered it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggled again, as if she were the most clever creature in the world. “Your mother told me where you were, of course. I mean, who would worry about what they said to poor, meek little nobody Barbara?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbee Bennet had stopped laying bricks for the moment, too busy grinning at her. Beaming with pride and pleasure. “We really are very clever, Barbara and I,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” Gen said. “But I still don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t? You really don’t?” Bennet asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, setting his arm around Barbara’s shoulders. “Actually, taking care of Thorne the way we did was Barbara’s idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poison in the wine,” Barbara said proudly. “My idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother had been the one to say it first, but they’d all agreed that, statistically speaking, poisoning was a woman’s method of murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So clever,” Bennet said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was nothing,” Barbara said, blushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He needed to die. It was justice, really. Just like those other two blowhards,” Bennet explained. “Best of all, there’s no way for anyone to prove that I had anything to do with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure there is a way. They just haven’t figured it out yet,” Genevieve said as confidently as she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbara just rolled her eyes. “Bennet is the genius, don’t you see? He knew Poe. He loved Poe. He can be Poe—far more effectively than I can. Once Thorne understood just how much Bennet knew about Poe, how he empathized with Poe, comprehended his work and everything about him, he would make Bennet come down for discussions. And everything Bennet said found its way into Thorne’s work. He used him! My brilliant Bennet. Thorne was horrible. He deserved to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Lori Star?” Genevieve demanded. “What about Sam Latham? He’s just a nice guy with a wife and two little kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, yes, Sam.” Bennet sighed. “It couldn’t look as if we were only trying to kill Thorne, could it? I just happened to be on the road when I saw him pass me. I suddenly realized how easy it would be to engineer his death, so I drove like a bat out of hell to catch up. Unfortunately, he survived.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-death-dealer-harrison-investigation-6/page-47.html","bookId":2272,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:04 PM"}
