Smith,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e SIR: You never answer any questions; you never show the slightest\n\u003cbr\u003e interest in anything I do. You are probably the horridest one of\n\u003cbr\u003e all those horrid Trustees, and the reason you are educating me is,\n\u003cbr\u003e not because you care a bit about me, but from a sense of Duty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t know a single thing about you. I don\u0027t even know your name. \n\u003cbr\u003e It is very uninspiring writing to a Thing. I haven\u0027t a doubt but that\n\u003cbr\u003e you throw my letters into the waste-basket without reading them. \n\u003cbr\u003e Hereafter I shall write only about work.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My re-examinations in Latin and geometry came last week. I passed\n\u003cbr\u003e them both and am now free from conditions.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours truly,\n\u003cbr\u003e Jerusha Abbott\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59737.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
