But as he thought about it further, it wasn’t strange at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith the great calamity ready to erupt at any moment, Xiao Moxian would also want to rapidly increase her strength, but in the Divine Realm alone, it would be hard for her to find sufficient space to grow. She needed rivals and opponents, she needed a new world to broaden her horizons, and she needed pressure that would force her to transform into someone greater than she was before. The Asura Road was indeed a very good place to go.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThen, after arriving here, Xiao Moxian had at some time obtained a mission to go to the Great Desolate. And, her appearing here was also reasonable, because the Desolate Springs was the safest entry route into the Great Desolate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming thought of this he sped up. He could clearly see the phantom of a Dark Phoenix in the distant skies. Lin Ming had fought with Xiao Moxian before so he clearly understood that this was her bloodline strength – the Phoenix Trueform. Unless she encountered some formidable opponent, Xiao Moxian wouldn’t easily reveal this ability in the Asura Road. It was similar to an elephant revealing its ivory tusks or a rhinoceros revealing its horn; it would arouse the greed of others.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s guess was correct. Xiao Moxian was indeed placed in a great crisis.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe cause was simple. After Xiao Moxian entered the Asura Road, the first place she stopped was Wave City. After entering Wave City, she went to the mission issuing area, similar to the City of Discord’s Black God Fort, and then she also participated in the trial game there. With Xiao Moxian’s talent, obtaining the 50 badge blue soul level reward was far too simple, and even obtaining the zenith black level reward wasn’t difficult at all. After Xiao Moxian had two drawings, although she didn’t draw the Destiny reward that Lin Ming had drawn, she had still pulled out the second zenith black reward possibility, and the best one at that. If she drew that, the value of the god rune would only be slightly worse than the Destiny reward. This would be enough to cause all the martial artists in Wave City to go crazy with greed. In addition, her blue soul level reward was likely the most precious third possibility type too.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen these factors were added together, the result could be imagined.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian was now besieged from all sides!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Fires Scorching the Starry Skies!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHu – hu – hu !\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBlack flames swept up a storm. Xiao Moxian wielded her swift long whip, the speed reaching unimaginable degrees as if she would tear apart space itself. Flames burnt along the whip’s length. Every time the whip lashed out, martial artists would be torn apart, leaving behind nothing but bloody fog.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCorpses were already piled up all around her. These corpses were either torn apart by long whip strokes or charred into cinders. As for Xiao Moxian, her long hair was scattered about and blood stained her face.

The rocks all around were dyed black and red, and all the surrounding plant life had withered away. There were many wounds crisscrossing her body and even her expansive Dark Phoenix wings were wet with blood. This blood was hers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe battlefield was already thick with the scent of blood and death.

He clearly had a considerable amount of experience. In the midst of this intense battle he had been able to see through Xiao Moxian’s bloodline!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“A phoenix body!

Just a single drop of her blood essence is incomparably precious. If we can capture this woman and dual cultivate with her, we can suck up her yin essence and even swallow her primal origin energy. We can even use her blood to make medicine to obtain unimaginable benefits! Hahaha!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Use her for medicine? That ruins the fun too much. This is truly a top quality woman, the most outstanding kind of all, so how can we use her as medicine? We should enjoy her as thoroughly as we can. When we capture her we can plant a slave seal within her and make her serve us faithfully! Hehe, little girl, don’t resist us. We have enough people that you will be captured sooner or later. No matter what you try, we will place a slave seal rune within you and enjoy your body, hahaha!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe leading martial artists increased their violent barrage of attacks. These people all had a Holy Lord level cultivations for a total of four Holy Lords!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough they weren’t strong Holy Lords, several of them added together formed a terrifying strength! It would be almost impossible for Xiao Moxian to escape the siege of these people, and even someone like Lin Ming would find it difficult.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian formed more seals as she wrapped her body in black flames. Mystical runes began to shine over her face, neck, and arms. These runes were the Law runes of a Dark Phoenix that were inscribed into her body. They were the miracle of Laws that she inherited from her mother, the symbol of a God Beast!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese runes shimmered with a brilliant black light.

One of them even casually grasped a minion beside them to use as a shield. That unlucky martial artist was directly burned down to nothing, but the Holy Lord powerhouse behind him was completely fine.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The ones sieging you are all our slaves controlled by god runes. Don’t you know that there are god runes that can specifically act as slave seals for others? If you burn them, that isn’t any loss to us at all.

He was short, with pointy ears and nearly black skin. At this time he was fiendishly smiling as his eyes greedily swept over Xiao Moxian’s body. In truth, they also knew that Xiao Moxian was extremely strong. If they were to truly attack in a head-on fight then no single one of them alone was Xiao Moxian’s match. Even if they joined forces Xiao Moxian could still counterattack and kill off one or two of them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThus, they used the many slaves under their control to wear down her strength.

He felt the space around him tighten as a terrifying strength swept at his direction! Xiao Moxian had ignored all others to attack him; her only goal was to wipe out the Holy Lord who had shouted just now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Old Fourth, be careful!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot too far away, two of the other Four Wave Saints also moved to help him. As for the last one, he attacked Xiao Moxian. He was too far away so he didn’t have enough time to help his comrade, thus he thought of attacking Xiao Moxian to force her to retreat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian realized that there was an attack coming at her from behind and she also realized the consequences of being struck.

But in the next moment, a massive amount of broken stone was swept away by her black phoenix wings. Xiao Moxian stood up, but as she did, she revealed that only one of her phoenix wings was upright; the other wing was hanging at a strange angle. That saber strike just then had cut through her wing bones.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn addition, there was also a three foot long wound; it was unknown just how deep it was, but it had already injured her organs.

These people all came from the demon race or the saint race, and their different strengths converged together to form an array diagram. Within this array diagram, the phantom of a giant sea monster began to emerge.

As their sabers came slashing down, Xiao Moxian glared at them, her eyes cold and implacable. At this time it was no longer possible for her to burn her ancient phoenix blood any further.

They saw Xiao Moxian disappear from their sight, replaced by a thick ancient stone gate that fell down from the clouds, separating them from her!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What is this?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Cut it down!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe three Holy Lords were extremely fast. Their attacks didn’t slow down in the least as they slashed out at the stone gate. In fact, it was impossible for them to slow down, just like someone that was racing suddenly coming to a complete stop. If they did so then the energy and momentum in their attack would create a backlash against them and injure them instead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe array diagram upon their sabers shined even brighter. The octopus-like sea monster roared out and slammed its tentacles at the stone gate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRumble rumble rumble!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEnergy exploded. All of the attacks fell down on the stone gate. Wild shockwaves spread outwards, causing all the nearby stones to disintegrate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe sea monster phantom that bore the brunt of this impact was torn apart!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for that heavy stone gate, it merely shook a little without showing any signs of damage. After that, the array diagram atop the three Holy Lords’ sabers also cracked apart. Because they were too fast, all of them crashed into the stone gate. For a time, they were completely knocked senseless!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePuff!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe boss of the Four Wave Saints spat out a mouthful of blood. Although he hadn’t been attacked just now, he had taken a rebound injury. This was like a person punching at a stone wall with all their strength. Although the wall would be fine, their hand would be injured.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What happened!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sudden change in events left the Holy Lords all perplexed and startled. The Holy Lord boss suddenly looked up in the sky to see a youth wrapped in a black cape.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis youth held a long spear. His build was ordinary, as was his appearance. His face was a bit yellow, making him seem like someone that would never be noticed in a crowd.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithout a doubt, the stone gate that came down just now had come from this person.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1447\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1449\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1448","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:20 AM"}
