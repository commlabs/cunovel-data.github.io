Four players sat around a circular table, equidistant to each other and all on the diagonal of the room, so that no one would be closer to the raised dais and the symbolic throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the doors banged closed, the last of the escorts departing, King Bruenor spent a moment scrutinizing his peers - or at least, the two he considered to be his peers, and the third, seated directly across from him, whom he realized he had to tolerate. To his left sat the other dwarf, King Emerus Warcrown, his face scrunched in a scowl, his beard neatly trimmed and groomed, but showing a bit more gray, by all accounts. How could Bruenor blame him for that, since Emerus had lost nearly as many dwarves as had Clan Battlehammer, and in an even more sudden and devastating manner?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Bruenor\u0027s right sat another ally, and one he respected greatly. Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon had been a friend to Bruenor and to Mithral Hall for many years. When the dark elves invaded the dwarves\u0027 homeland Alustriel had stood strong beside Bruenor and his kin, and at great loss to the people of her city. Many of Alustriel\u0027s warriors had died fighting the drow in Keeper\u0027s Dale. Alustriel seemed as regal and beautiful as ever. She was dressed in a long gown of rich, deep green, and a silver circlet accentuated her sculpted features and her silvery hair. By all measures, the woman was beautiful, but there was something more about her, a strength and gravity. How many foolish men had underestimated Alustriel, Bruenor wondered, thinking her pretty face the extent of her powers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross from the dwarf sat Galen Firth of Nesme. Dirty and disheveled, carrying several recent scars and scabs, the man had just come from a battlefield, obviously, and had repeatedly expressed his desire to get right back to the fighting. Bruenor could respect that, certainly, but still the dwarf had a hard time in offering too much respect to that man. Bruenor still hadn\u0027t forgotten the treatment he and his friends had found in Nesme, nor the negative reaction of Nesme to Settlestone, a community of Wulfgar\u0027s folk that Bruenor had sponsored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was Galen, though, sitting in Mithral Hall as a representative of the town, and brought in by Alustriel as, so she said, a peer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be it known and agreed that I speak not only for Silverymoon, but for Everlund and Sundabar, as well?\" Alustriel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" the other three all answered without debate, for Alustriel had informed them from the beginning that she had been asked to serve as proxy for the other two important cities, and none would doubt the honorable lady\u0027s word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we are all represented,\" Galen Firth remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all,\" said Emerus Warcrown, his voice as deep as a boulder\u0027s rumble within a mountain cave. \"Harbromm\u0027s got no voice here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two other dwarves sit at the table,\" Galen Firth argued. \"Two humans for four human kingdoms, but two dwarves do not suffice for only three dwarven mines?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor snorted. \"Alustriel\u0027s getting three votes, and rightly so, since them other two asked her to do their voting here. Why yerself\u0027s even getting a voice is something I\u0027m still wondering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen narrowed his eyes, and Bruenor snorted again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not I nor King Bruenor would deign to speak for King Harbromm of Citadel Adbar,\" Emerus Warcrown added. \"King Harbromm has been advised of the situation, and will make his decisions known in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now is the time to speak!\" Galen Firth replied. \"Nesme remains under assault. We have driven the trolls and bog blokes from the town and pushed most back into the Trollmoors, but their leader, a great brute named Proffit, has eluded us. While he lives, Nesme will not be safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll be sending ye all me warriors then, and right off,\" Bruenor answered. \"I\u0027ll just tell Obould to hold back his tens of thousands until we\u0027re properly ready for greeting him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sarcasm made Galen Firth narrow his eyes all the more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will settle nothing about our enemies if we cannot come to civil agreement among ourselves,\" the ever-diplomatic Alustriel put in. \"Bury old grievances, King Bruenor and Galen Firth, I beg of you both. Our enemies press us - press your two peoples most of all - and that must be our paramount concern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerus Warcrown leaned back in his thick wooden chair and crossed his burly arms over his barrel-like chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor regarded his counterpart, and offered an appreciate wink. Emerus was dwarf first, Bruenor understood clearly. The hierarchy of his loyalty placed Bruenor and Harbromm, and their respective clans, at the top of Emerus\u0027s concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right then, them grievances are buried,\" Bruenor answered Alustriel. \"And know that I lost more than a few good Battlehammers in helping Galen Firth there and his troubled town. And not a thing have we asked in kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen started to say something, again in that petulant and negative tone of his, but Alustriel interrupted with a sudden and harsh, \"Enough!\" aimed directly at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We understand the plight of Nesme,\" Alustriel went on. \"Are not the Knights in Silver doing battle there even now, securing the region so that the tradesmen can rebuild the houses and strengthen the wall? Are not my wizards patrolling those walls, the words of the fireball ready at their lips?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Tis true, my good lady,\" Galen admitted, and he settled back in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The trolls are on the run, and will be put back in the Trollmoors,\" Alustriel promised all three of them. \"Silverymoon and Everlund will help Nesme see to this need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good enough, and what\u0027s yer timetable?\" asked Bruenor. \"Will ye have them back afore winter settles in too deep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question seemed all the more urgent since the first snows had begun to accumulate that very day outside of Mithral Hall\u0027s eastern door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is our hope, so that the people of Nesme can return to their homes before the trails grow deep with snow,\" Alustriel answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so that yer armies will be ready to fight beside me own when the winter lets go of the land?\" Bruenor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlustriel\u0027s face grew very tight. \"If King Obould presses his attack on Mithral Hall, he will find Clan Battlehammer bolstered by the forces of Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor let a long and uncomfortable moment of silence pass before pressing the point: \"And if King Obould decides that his advance is done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have spoken of this before,\" Alustriel reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speak of it again,\" Bruenor demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the time winter passes, Obould\u0027s army will be powerfully entrenched,\" said Alustriel. \"That army was formidable enough when it was marching against defended positions. Your own people know that better than any.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah, but ye\u0027re giving up!\" King Emerus interrupted. \"Ye\u0027re all thinking to leave the orc to his gains!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cost in dislodging him will be terrible,\" Alustriel explained, not disagreeing. \"Perhaps too great a price.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah!\" Emerus growled. He slammed a fist onto the heavy wooden table - and it was fortunate that the table was built so sturdily, else Emerus\u0027s smash would have splintered it to kindling. \"Ye\u0027re going to fight for Nesme, but Mithral Hall\u0027s not worthy of yer sacrifice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know me better than to say that, King Emerus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlustriel\u0027s statement did calm the dwarf, who was far more on his edge than normal after the catastrophe at the river. Earlier that same day, King Emerus had presided over the consecration of the River Surbrin, saying farewell to nearly a thousand good dwarves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fell back in his seat, crossed his burly arms again, and gave a great, \"Harrumph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"King Bruenor . .. Bruenor, my friend, you must understand our thinking in this,\" Alustriel said. \"Our desire from Silverymoon to Everlund to Sundabar to rid the land of Obould and his thousands is no less than your own. But I have flown over the occupied lands. I have seen the swarms and their preparations. To go against them would invite disaster on a scale heretofore unknown in the Silver Marches. Mithral Hall is open once more - your path across the Surbrin will be assured. You are now the lone outpost, the last bastion for the goodly folk in all the lands between the Trollmoors and the Spine of the World, the Surbrin and Fell Pass. You are not without friends or support. If Obould comes against you again, he will find the Knights in Silver standing shoulder to shoulder with Clan Battlehammer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waist to shoulder, perhaps,\" Galen Firth quipped, but the scowls of the two dwarves showed him clearly that his feeble attempt at humor was not appreciated, and Alustriel went on without interruption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This piece of ground between your eastern door and the Surbrin will not fall, if all of it is to be covered in layers of the dead from the three cities I represent at this meeting,\" she said. \"We are all agreed on this. Winter\u0027s Edge will be expanded as a military encampment, and supplies and soldiers will flow through Silverymoon to that town unabated. We will relieve King Emerus\u0027s dwarves here, so that they can return to their work in securing the Underdark route between Felbarr and Mithral Hall. We will offer great wagons and drivers to King Harbromm, so that Citadel Adbar can easily enter the conflicted region as they see fit. We will spare no expense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you will spare yer warriors,\" Bruenor remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will not throw thousands against defended mountains for the sake of nearly barren ground,\" Alustriel bluntly answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor, wearing the same expression and seated in the same posture as his dwarf counterpart, offered a grim nod in response. He wasn\u0027t thrilled with Alustriel\u0027s decision; he wanted nothing more than to sweep ugly Obould back to his mountain hole. But Bruenor\u0027s people had done battle with the orc king and his legions, and so Bruenor surely understood the reasoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strengthen Winter\u0027s Edge, then,\" he said. \"Work your soldiers in concert. Drill them and practice them. I wish that the Moonwood had chosen to attend this meeting. Hralien, who speaks for them, has promised his support, but from afar. Surely they fear that Obould is as likely to turn against their forest as against Mithral Hall, since they chose to enter the fray. I expect the same loyalty to them, from all o\u0027 ye, as ye\u0027re offering to Mithral Hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" said Alustriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They saved me a thousand dwarves,\" Emerus agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen Firth sat quietly, but not still, Bruenor noted, the man obviously growing agitated that the discussion had so shifted from the fate of his beloved Nesme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye go get yer town put back together,\" Bruenor said to him. \"Ye make it stronger than ever before - I\u0027ll be sending caravans full o\u0027 the best weapons me smithies can forge. Ye keep them damned trolls in their smelly moor and off o\u0027 me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man visibly relaxed, even uncrossing his arms and coming forward as he replied, \"Nesme will not forget the aid that Mithral Hall offered, though Mithral Hall was terribly pressed at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor responded with a nod, and noted out of the corner of his eye that Alustriel was smiling with approval for his generous offering and words. The King of Mithral Hall wasn\u0027t thrilled with the decisions made that day, but he well understood that they all had to stand together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor if they chose to stand alone, they would fall, one by one, to the swarms of Obould.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know that,\" Catti-brie said, trying to be comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delly is gone, Colson is gone, and Khazid\u0027hea is gone,\" Wulfgar replied, and he seemed as if he could hardly stand up while uttering those dreaded words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Catti-brie had sent the news throughout Mithral Hall that Khazid\u0027hea was missing, and had made it quite clear that the sword was not to be handled casually, that it was a weapon of great and dangerous power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was obvious that someone had taken it, and few dwarves would be put under the spell of any sentient weapon. That left Delly, or one of the other human refugees who had set out across the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be Delly, Catti-brie silently agreed. She had come to Catti-brie\u0027s room before, the woman knew. Half-asleep, she had once or twice seen Delly staring at her from the doorway, though out of concern or jealousy, she did not know. Was it possible that Delly had come in to speak with her and had been intercepted by the machinations of a bored and hungry Khazid\u0027hea?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor where had Delly gone? How dare she leave Mithral Hall with Colson, and without ever speaking to Wulfgar?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mystery had Wulfgar on the very edge of outrage. The man, battered as he had been, should have been resting, but he hadn\u0027t gone to his bed in more than a day, ever since the troubling report of Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder chasing after a lone figure running off to the north. The dwarves were betting it to be Cottie Cooperson, who was quite out of her mind with grief, but both Catti-brie and Wulfgar held a nagging feeling that someone else might be out of her mind, or at least that someone might have inadvertently let a malignant spirit into her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or is it that we have been infiltrated by stealthy allies of Obould?\" Wulfgar asked. \"Have spies come into Mithral Hall? Have they stolen your sword, and my wife and child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will sort through all of this,\" Catti-brie assured him. \"We will find Delly\u0027s trail soon enough. The storms have lessened and the ferry will soon be running again. Or Alustriel and King Emerus will aid us in our search. When they come out from their meeting with Bruenor, bid them to find the refugees who went across the river. There we will find answers, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar\u0027s expression showed that perhaps he was afraid of finding those answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was nothing else to be done. Dozens of dwarves were searching the halls, for the sword, the woman, and the toddler. Cordio and some of his fellow priests were even using divining spells to try to help the search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, there were only questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar slumped against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obould will be dead in three days,\" Stormsinger the giant growled. \"That was your promise, Princess Gerti, yet Obould is alive and more powerful than ever, and our prizes - pegasus, dark elf, and that magical panther he carries - have flown from our grasp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are better off having Drizzt Do\u0027Urden working toward the same goal as we,\" Gerti argued, and she had to raise her voice to lift it above the tumult of protest that was rising all around her. Once again the weight of events pressed down on the giantess. It had all seemed so simple just a few tendays past: She would lend a few giants here and a few giants there to throw boulders from afar at settlements the orcs had surrounded, softening up the defenses so that Obould could overrun the towns. She would gain spoils of war for the cost of a few rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she had thought. The explosion at the ridge, where twenty of her giants had been immolated, had irrevocably changed all of that. The assault into Mithral Hall, where several more had fallen to tricks and traps, had irrevocably changed all of that. The ceremony of Gruumsh, where Obould had seemingly taken on godlike proportions, had irrevocably changed all of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerti was left just trying to bail out of it all, to let Obould and the dwarves battle it out to the last and leave herself and her kin playing on both sides of the equation so that, whoever proved victorious, the battle would not come to Shining White.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grumbling around her showed her clearly that her kin weren\u0027t holding much faith in her or her curious choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only Drizzt Do\u0027Urden had slaughtered the wretched Obould!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drizzt is a formidable opponent,\" Gerti said, following that notion. \"He will find a way to strike hard at Obould.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And at Shining White?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerti narrowed her eyes and scowled at the petulant Stormsinger. Clearly the large warrior was positioning himself as an alternative to her when the great Jarl Orel finally let go of life. And just as clearly, many of the other giants were beginning to look favorably on that positioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drizzt will not, by his word, and he will dissuade others from coming against us, should Bruenor defeat Obould.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is all a waste,\" Stormsinger groused. \"We have lost friends, all of us, and for what gain? Have we more slaves to serve our needs? Have we more wealth than we knew before we followed King Obould of the orcs? Have we more territory, rich mines or wondrous cities? Have we even a single winged horse, one handed over to us and now handed away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have ...\" Gerti started to say, but a chorus of complaining rose up in the room. \"We have ...\" she said more loudly, and repeated it over and over until at last the din lessened. \"We have gained position,\" she explained. \"We could not have avoided this war. If we had not joined with Obould initially, then we would likely find him as an enemy soon enough, if not already. Now that will not happen, for he is indebted to us. And now King Bruenor and all of his allies are indebted to us, despite our waging war on them, because of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. We have gained position, and in a time as conflicted and confusing as this, that is no small thing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke her words with conviction and with the weight of her royal position behind her, and the room did quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they would stir again, Gerti feared, and Stormsinger, though he did not respond at that time, would not let the matter drop there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar from it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-28.html","bookId":2142,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:47 PM"}
