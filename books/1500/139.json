However, we have to discuss a price, right? Alright, speak, how much money did you prepare for us? The soldiers under me have to be brought along as well. As for the compensation towards Roxland, you have to settle it.

He released a sound of approval before saying, “Your fixed reward is 100 yuan per month for now, which will increase slowly in the future.

There is that registration fee or whatever for subordinates, and you can’t pay that, right?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Correct.” This matter wasn’t something Su was going to hide. “The registration fee for each subordinate is ten thousand, so right now, I have only prepared enough for you and Li Gaolei.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Wait, Li is Li, and I am myself. Me and her aren’t connected, and the price between us has to be discussed separately!” Li Gaolei hurriedly spoke.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt this time, Su’s tactical tablet suddenly lit up. He pressed down on the edge of the tactical tablet, and the screen brightened. There was a message saying that the Black Dragonriders attached great importance to Blue Scorpion. For the sake of information regarding their invasion, the corpses of nine Blue Scorpion soldiers, as well as any captured equipment, they valued it to be 110 thousand, and they transferred 80 thousand to Su’s account in advance. If the corpses and equipment can provide even more valuable information, the reward can be increased. When Su transferred these items back to headquarters, he can receive the remainder of the reward.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBased on the customs of the wilderness, Su seemed to have won this battlefield alone, so most of the spoils should be distributed to him. This time, Su didn’t act too politely, and Li Gaolei as well as Li were rather straightforward. Roxland only needed the corpse of one soldier and one of each type of equipment for research purposes. As for everything else, it was all given to Su. Due to ammunition for these advanced weapons being limited, taking too much wouldn’t be useful to them anyway.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu never thought that this unexpected mission would provide such great rewards. It seemed like for the Black Dragonriders, Blue Scorpion was a newly discovered enemy, and that was the most valuable portion. As for the soldiers’ corpses and equipment, their reference value was much greater than their inherent value. The headquarter specialist could detect the level of evolution through their flesh, and from their equipment, the Blue Scorpion’s level of technology and combat philosophy can be deduced. From then on, they can work out the relevant tactics and produce even newer models of equipment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFrom where Li was sitting, she was just able to sneak a look at the screen’s contents. She immediately released a snort and said with a sneer, “What is that? It seems like you just received eighty thousand yuan, yet you are only willing to pay me 100 yuan a month?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu returned a confirmation message and patiently explained, “All of a subordinate’s equipment and promotional costs are all under the dragonrider’s responsibility. This means that not only you, the equipment of the soldiers under you has to be prepared by me. You might think that eighty thousand is a lot. It is, it really is a lot, because the Black Dragonriders’ currency is much more valuable than the coins of the wilderness. However, I need to prepare a complete set of combat equipment for you all, and I also need to include your well-being and medical supplies. In addition, in order to deal with the next Blue Scorpion attack, we need something that can deal with their tanks. The price of this thing will be unexpectedly expensive. This is why the money this time will be all used for additional equipment.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi released a few cold laughs and was about to say something when Li Gaolei who was earnestly reading the subordinates manual suddenly roared with laughter. He interrupted the negotiations between Li and Su that was turning more and more sour and said, “Alright, alright, subordinates are pretty much the same as slaves that had sold themselves! That’s why if we become subordinates, we don’t have the qualifications to criticize how our masters distribute funds at all. Of course, I believe Su will take care of everything quite well.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Come, Su, let’s have a good discussion now. You know that a person like me doesn’t have many requirements. Money, authority, pretty girls, and safety. As long as all of these are satisfied, I am yours!” While speaking he walked over and lead Su over to a distant place before quietly discussing a few things.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi strained her ears, but she was just slightly off from hearing their conversation, making her so angry she furiously clawed at her hair, in the end causing her to groan in pain from her own movements.

Right when he was about to give up, he never thought that things would change so quickly.

Su placed all of the spoils of war onto the heavy transport truck before bidding Li and Li Gaolei farewell. Before leaving, he left the Glock pistol with forty or so rounds left with Li Gaolei and taught him how to use it. This Glock pistol Su had was remodeled, and the bullets it carried used special gunpowder, making it 30% more powerful than an ordinary Glock pistol. The price of great power was that after Li Gaolei fired three times continuously, with only two levels of strengthened ability, his wrist would most likely fracture.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter a simple goodbye, Su hurriedly wanted to leave.

Kane had already completed all of the subordinate registration procedures on his own, and he had handed over the corresponding costs. This left the young woman who was in charge of subordinate registration quite shocked. During the entire process of registration, she continuously tried to inquire about Kane’s background. It was because in all of her time here, she had never seen a subordinate personally come to complete the registration procedure and pay the fees.
