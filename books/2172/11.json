And Flattery, of all people, should know better. We clones were the slaves of our age. First-generation clones had it real tough. They were grown as organ farms for the donors. They needed us, but they needed us to do what we were told. Now he\u0027s enslaved the kelp, stunted its reason, because he needs it to do what it\u0027s told. He can\u0027t keep cutting it back, because he can\u0027t afford the regrowth time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027ll happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A showdown,\" MacIntosh said. \"And if Flattery\u0027s still groundside when it comes he\u0027d better hope that the kelp needs him for something or I wouldn\u0027t give you two bits for his chances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two bits of what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacIntosh laughed again, a big bark of a laugh to match his size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t want to guess how old that expression is,\" he said. \"When I was at Moonbase, two bits was a quarter, which was a quarter of a dollar, which was the currency we used.

If we push any harder we\u0027ll fry our board, and that kelp, and anybody inside it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder what it is that the kelp wants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if we gave it its head?\" MacIntosh mused. \"That would be one way to find out.

How you going to convince the Director?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glance at the display showed the entire stand of kelp to be twisting itself into a vortex, like the whirlpool in a drain. As near as MacIntosh could tell, Current Control was at its maximum limit of restraint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpud pointed at the display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a focus of electrical override here. Whatever\u0027s bugging the kelp is right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Electrical or mechanical?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could be either, or both - it\u0027s a heavy traffic area,\" Spud said. \"Something down there is definitely irritating the kelp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" MacIntosh agreed, \"that\u0027s my thought. The electrical override is coming from the kelp itself. It must be responding to something. That stand\u0027s not mature enough to think for itself.

Spud\u0027s pointing finger trembled with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a spiral, headed into the middle of sector eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That means the one kelp bed is delivering something to its neighbor - isn\u0027t that what it looks like to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or the neighbor is snatching it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spud, I\u0027ll bet you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacIntosh stepped up to the console and tapped out a sequence with his two huge index fingers. The red lights on the messenger panel went black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just had a relay malfunction,\" MacIntosh said, and winked at Spud. \"Next time Flattery calls, tell him it was a hardwire failure and you worked it out personally. Maybe you\u0027ll get a promotion. If I\u0027ve guessed wrong, my job will be up for grabs. Now, we might as well let go the reins on this kelp and see where the hell it runs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacIntosh heard Spud swallow behind him and he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the big deal, Spud? It\u0027s a plant, it\u0027s not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wel... well, it\u0027s just that Flattery doesn\u0027t trust anybody - it\u0027d be like him to have some kind of booby-tra...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did,\" MacIntosh said, \"and this stand got itself blown apart a few years back. But he hasn\u0027t reset charges here yet - the kelp\u0027s not supposed to get this frisky this soon.\" He waited for the burst line to charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There!\" he said, and pressed the send signal. \"Now let\u0027s sit back and see what cooks. Something bizarre is inside there, and I\u0027d like to be the first to know what it is. If we can\u0027t do anything with this stand, maybe we can at least learn from it. Besides,\" he winked again, \"Flattery\u0027s down there, we\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beeping signal from his console interrupted him. He opened the intercom to Launch Command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We sling our bird your way in five minutes,\" the voice said. \"Any contraindications?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Negative,\" MacIntosh replied. \"Currents at your site are stable, weather will arrive your location in approximately one hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger that, Current Control. Launch is a go fo... four minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCanon in D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Pachelbel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Immensity recoiled with a snap from the shock of freedom, then let its tendrils and fronds drift in their tingling bliss. It had been a long time since this union of stands had felt good, and never had it felt this good. The submarine trains foundering among its vines were inconsequential now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pulse went out among the fronds, a ripple throughout the Immensity from the tiny foil adrift at its outer reaches. A mass of tentacles cradled the foil and delighted in the scent of self that it gave from its brittle skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little craft was slippery and the Immensity knew it to be extremely fragile, so it was gently tumbled frond to frond inward. Other scents mingled with that of the One. One of these scents was familiar, provocative, kelplike. The Holomaster, Rico LaPush, was in the company of someone that the kelp had encountered befor... befor... well, no matter. It would find out soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Immensity had learned to sniff out the holo language of humans from their spectrum of odd scents. It decided, early upon awakening this time, that it would have to speak with humans to live. It also concluded that it would have to speak the holo language if it wanted to speak with humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe foil tried to wriggle out of the kelp\u0027s net. There was much pain now through the vines, where all of the trains trapped in sector eight were trying to burn, cut, slash their way toward their precious atmosphere topside. Some of these the kelp crushed reflexively, but when the death scents of the crews mingled with the sea it forced itself to calm and to reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath, it reminded itself, is not the answer to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Immensity managed to open several kelpways and marveled at the easy ballet of subs heading topside. Only the bright white Holovision foil suffered the grip of the Immensity. It strained its engines trying to flee, but never lashed out at its tormentor. This the Immensity would expect of the One, who was civilized in the arms of kelp, and of the honorable associates of Holomaster Rico LaPush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conscience you find the structure, the form of consciousness, the beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Kerro Panille, \"Translations from the Avata,\" The Histories\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatriz listened to the launch crew director count down the final minute over the speaker. Her shaky fingers chattered the metal clips as she snugged up her harness. She tried to think of the straps around her as Mack\u0027s arms and she tried to imagine they held her as Ben\u0027s did the night they drove old Vashon down. It didn\u0027t work. Nothing could erase the sight of her crew, slaughtered like sebet in a pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a mistake, she thought. They all died because that bastard made a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that the captain was afraid, she could smell it on him before he gave the final order at the studio. He obviously didn\u0027t know whether Flattery would promote him or execute him for his decision. Beatriz knew that her life, perhaps many other lives, teetered in this balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten seconds to launch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inhaled a long, slow breath through her mouth and let it sigh out her nostrils. This was a relaxation technique that Rico had taught her when they all nearly drowned five years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five, fou...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a little breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... on...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe compressed-air \"boot\" punched them up the launch tube and a pair of Atkinson Rams slung them toward orbit. This was the part of the ride she hated - it reminded her of the time the fat girl sat on her chest when she was just starting school, and she didn\u0027t like the feel of her face flattening out against the strain. On this launch, however, she wasn\u0027t worried about wrinkles, engine failure, being trapped in orbit. She was worried about the captain, and how she could help convince him of the necessity of keeping her alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one in the shuttle cabin looked familiar. Most of them had changed out of their fatigues and into civilian clothes. They were quiet; Beatriz thought that they must be weighing the consequences of the shootings. She didn\u0027t see the man who started it. That was the man she feared even more than the captain - Ben had always said that the jumpy ones get you killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could he be so right and be so far away from me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed her tired face and patted her cheeks to keep hysteria at bay. She needed information, and a lot of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMack, she thought. He\u0027ll help me, I\u0027m sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant her fear included him. After all, he was an original crew member like Flattery. They had worked together long before waking from hybernation on Pandora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat i... what i... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook off her fears. If her imagination had to run away with her, she preferred that it ally her with Mack instead of against him. Mack was not at all like Flattery, this she knew. Even Mack had cringed at the news when Flattery converted Alyssa Marsh to an Organic Mental Core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never believed we needed such a thing,\" he\u0027d told her privately. \"Now, with the kelp research, I\u0027m even more convinced that OMCs were just another built-in frustration, a goad to push us even further from humanity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to reports - Flattery\u0027s reports - Marsh had been found in extremis after an accident in the kelp. He explained to her how clones were property, often merely living stores for spare parts, and how Alyssa Marsh had been prepared for this moment from her girlhood. Now Beatriz realized how fortuitous the timing had been for Flattery, how unfortunate for Marsh and her kelp studies with Dwarf MacIntosh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat will Mack do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would need information, too. Like, how many in this squad? What kinds of weapons? Do they have a plan or is this just reaction to the killings groundside? She couldn\u0027t remember how many people worked the orbiter station - two thousand? Three? And how much security did they have aloft?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much, she remembered. Just a handful to handle fights and petty theft among the workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d counted thirty-two in the captain\u0027s squad as they boarded the shuttle, and each was heavily armed. Eight of them were assigned to fill out her crew, and they grumbled under the double load. This bunch carried a lot of the old, disfiguring mutations. The gear they\u0027d loaded aboard was mostly weapons, but a few of them knew enough about holo broadcast to bring the bare bones of what they\u0027d need to get Newsbreak on the air. A couple of techs were assigned to oversee the OMC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatriz had kept the worst of the shakes at bay and now, strapped firmly into her couch, she nearly let herself go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she warned herself, hold tight. I can\u0027t help anyone dead. I am the only witness against them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hoped that the console tape survived back there, and that someone sympathetic would find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho would they show it to that could do anything? she wondered. Flattery?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatriz grunted a laugh at herself, then felt the captain\u0027s grip on her shoulder. It was firm, not painful. It was not gentle. It reminded her of her father\u0027s grip the night he died, and it lightened the same when their engines shut down. This man was the same age as her youngest brother, but there was infinity in his dark eyes. She didn\u0027t see much wisdom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you\u0027re thinking,\" he said. \"I have taken hundreds of prisoners, I have been a prisoner. Believe me, I know what you\u0027re thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured the guard beside her away and, surprisingly clumsy in zero-gee, moved up to join her. His voice sounded gravelly, strained, as though it had been screaming. He continued speaking, while his men drifted out of earshot, their glances furtive and their conversations spare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are both in a bad spot, you and I. We both need out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up here it will be all or nothing, we are trapped. There is no escape for either one of us that doesn\u0027t require both of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo this, too, she had to agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut only for the moment, she assured herself, only until I find Mack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatriz realized that, much as it disgusted her, her life depended on communicating with this man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a military man, an officer. How is it that you walk yourself out the plank like this? You wouldn\u0027t have done it on reflex. This is a plan and w... I simply fall into i...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God, you\u0027re perceptive,\" the words came in a rush, the captain\u0027s eyes aglitter. \"We can only win, Flattery is finished. We have the Voidship and Orbiter - enough food stores for years. We control their currents and weather. We have Flattery\u0027s precious Organic Mental Core - shit, we can hook it up to the ship ourselves and fly out of her...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t hear the rest. Her mind focused on what he\u0027d said at the beginning: \"enough food stores for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he kills everyone aboard the Orbiter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... He\u0027ll have to throw it in,\" the captain was saying. \"The rabble will have at him down there, and he doesn\u0027t dare destroy everything that he\u0027s worked for up here. Whoever beats him on the ground then can deal with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s really going to do this, she thought. He\u0027s going to kill everyone aboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand and she snapped it back with a revulsion that she couldn\u0027t hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Us,\" he said. \"I meant they can deal with us. You and me. They\u0027ll believe whatever you tell them, at least for a while.\" He leaned closer, whispered, \"You don\u0027t want to make another mistake, get more people killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe propelled herself out of her couch, not caring where the thrust might throw her in the gravity-free cabin. No one pursued her. The first handhold she grabbed stopped her beside a pair of security, younger than the young captain, who were reviewing the basics of holo camera triangulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey really intend to go on the air, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back at the captain. He had his back to her, briefing several men. The tone of his voice, briskness of his gestures told her that he meant business. It was true, he could do it without her. It was true, that by helping him she might save others. She could not bring herself to speak to him, to go to him in any way. She sighed, and interrupted her two new cameramen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said, \"with that setup the alpha set only gets fifteen degrees of pan. OK if you\u0027re covering a launch, but we\u0027ll be inside, in a small spac...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she instructed the two young amateurs she saw Brood watching her. He winked at her once, and she successfully suppressed the shudder that tempted her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll want to see this Organic Mental Core in transport, and they\u0027ll want to know something about its - her - background. Let\u0027s start by getting some of that in the can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe passed the two-hour flight instructing her camera operators, two men and a woman, none of whom she recognized from the massacre at the SLS studio. Beatriz preferred their company, even if they did answer to the captain. Whether by accident or design, she did not encounter any of that squad during their flight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Organic Mental Core was a living brain, enclosed in an intricate plasma-glass container that made allowances for the hookups to come. A complex plug would connect the brain with the control system aboard the Voidship. What she didn\u0027t expect horrified her the most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re supported b... bodies!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had done a report on such a thing several years ago. Scientists had connected a brain from a crushed body to a healthy body that had suffered a massive head injury. Each kept the other alive, though there had been no way to communicate with the healthy brain. At that time it was simply trapped in there, cut off from all sensation, alive and dreaming. She took a deep breath and let the reporter in her take over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe medtech in charge had a number of active facial tics and each of her questions seemed to accelerate them.
