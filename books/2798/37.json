I lean my head on the arm of the sofa and sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll just rest my eyes for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes flutter open and I see Uncle Jerm sitting behind his desk, leaning to the side with a hand over his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CD I brought with me is gone. I jerk and Uncle Jerm looks up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t look happy. Not that I thought he would be happy about my visit. His nephew wants him dead, for god sake!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI begin to speak but Uncle Jerm cuts me off with a firm, “Damn fool of a woman!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that’s not quite what I was expecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continues, “Do you realize the danger you’ve put yourself in? Nik is going to be livid. I am livid. Of all the things you could’ve done, this was the dumbest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s when I burst into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body shakes with sobs and I croak, “He wants to kill you, Jermaine. He wants Nik to hurt. I—I—I didn’t know what else to do. I heard Nik say you needed evidence that Omarr was recruiting and now you have it. So, do something!” I shake and whisper, “Please do something. I can’t lose Nik.” I cover my face with my hands and weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm pulls my hands from my face and kneels before me. He wipes tears from my cheeks and assures, “Omarr isn’t a concern anymore, child.” My body slumps back with relief. He continues, “As of ten minutes ago, Omarr has a price on his head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stammer, “B—B—But I thought you would get him some help!” My face pales and I whisper shout. “I didn’t want him dead, Jermaine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head slowly and answers me softly, “Tina, Omarr isn’t right. Think of it this way, it’s you and Nik or it’s him. And be warned, he will come after you. He will find out about this, baby girl. I know you had good intentions but it was crazy. Straightjackets, padded rooms, out of your damn mind, crazy. You feel me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I pale any more I’ll be transparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat have I done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm smirks, “But, by god, you’ve got a set of balls on you.” Then he sobers and says, “We got to tell Nik about this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat should be fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CD Uncle Jerm had expressed to The White Rabbit plays on my computer. I sit at my desk and listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy insides dip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not quite sure what I’m hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure, just so we both know what we are dealing with. I continue to work Nik and once I’m paid, I’m yours. But you have to back off. I can’t be distracted. You want Nik hurt and I’ll hurt him, baby. For you, I’ll do anything.” No mistaking it. That’s my girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can’t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can’t be happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe great misunderstanding of 2013\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm wouldn’t let me leave the warehouse he calls the factory until I had some coffee and breakfast with him. I’m glad he persuaded me. I probably would’ve passed out half way to The White Rabbit from exhaustion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon departing, Uncle Jerm pulled me into a warm hug and told me, “You saved my life, Tina, which means I owe you. Big. If you need anything from this old man, just call.” He gives me his business card and I slip it into my purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings us to now. I stand out front of The White Rabbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart races and my stomach knots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to have to tell Nik everything. And he is not going to like it. My previous experiences tell me I should be honest with Nik but I am petrified of what his reaction might be. I close my eyes and breathe deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik will understand. He has to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI compose myself as much as I can and make my way to Nik’s office. Just before I get there I’m greeted by a mad looking Max. He puts his hand up and says, “Don’t go in there, Tina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet stomp past him and I respond urgently, “Don’t try to stop me this time, Max. I have to see Nik right now. I don’t care if he’s busy and hiding out. This is priority. It’s important.” And I barge into Nik’s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik sits behind his desk staring into nothing. I approach and he stands up. Half way there I smile and say, “Hey, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes turn cold and he says, “Nik loves me, O. He’ll give me anything and everything I want. I just have to hook him a little more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face pales and my heart clenches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s already heard the CD. Which means Uncle Jerm sent it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI begin, “I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Nik cuts me off with a quiet, “Stop.” He looks hurt. I never wanted to hurt him. I thought he’d understand why I thought I had to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continues just as quietly, “Never thought I’d be one of those schmuks. I thought I did a good job of protecting myself from women like you.” There is a fist around my heart and it squeezes tight. He goes on, “But you…You really got in there. With my family and friends, too. You went the whole nine yards.” He laughs acidly. “Who the fuck sends candy to a guy?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is breaking. Nik thinks I played him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to explain, “Please, Nik. Let me exp…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cuts me off with a hard, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face bunches and I start crying. I hyperventilate, cover my cheeks with my hands and yell, “Let me explain!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head and I croak a desperate, “It’s just a misunderstanding, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik’s face steels and he whispers viciously, “Don’t say another fucking word.” He looks down and says, “You were my world. My everything. You really had me fooled. It was all just a game to you. A job. Never thought I’d end up with a woman like you. I loved you. Never believed I deserved you. But now that I know the real you, I don’t want you. So this works out okay. Another lesson learned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSobbing, I walk up to him and choke, “I love you, Nik.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t look at me when he replies coldly, “Yeah, well, I don’t love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart shatters. I feel extremely light headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat have I done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik moves passed me and nudges my body with his passing shoulder. In my weak state, the nudge feels more like a push. I stumble back and my heel catches. I fall. My back, shoulder and head hit the corner of his desk. Hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on the floor a moment and mouth, “Ow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I know what’s happening Max walks in. He takes in my weak form on the floor then Nik’s hard face. He storms up to Nik and gets right in his face and yells, “What the fuck is wrong with you? Get it under control, Nik.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take this as my cue to get the hell out of there. Max continues to yell into Nik’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crawl forward a few steps, stand unsteadily, and catch my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I’m gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax is in my face yelling at me but I can’t make out any of the words he’s saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood roars in my ears. Anger, pain, and heart-break have left me drained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t mean for Tina to fall. It was my fault, regardless, but I wished it hadn’t happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy office phone rings and I cut Max’s rant off by answering it, “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm asks, “You get the disc, son?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reply, “Yeah, Jerm. Thanks for the heads up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm tuts. “That girl of yours either has a death wish or loves you too damn much. Didn’t even flinch at going up against Omarr.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfusion settles over me and I ask, “Sorry, what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm hesitates, “You see your girl this morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reply coldly, “Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t say anything for a moment then sighs, “Please tell me you listened to the child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI retort, “What was there to listen to, Jerm? She played me. End of story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm loses his cool composure and shoots back, “Well, your girl came to see me this morning with evidence that my nephew is planning a mutiny. She played Omarr and just put herself on the hit-list of a psychopath for the man she loves and to save the life of a drug dealing old man she barely knows. So I’d say there was a lot to listen to, son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear makes my stomach dip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. That can’t be right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bark, “Explain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm replies quietly, “Just did.” Then hangs up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnxiety eats at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy experiences with money hungry women have been ridiculously high. Always a women looking for a sugar daddy. Not once had Tina asked for anything from me. I never gave her a choice when giving her gifts or doing things for her. Not her fault. I wanted to do that as her boyfriend and protector. I never got that gold digger vibe from Tina. I should have listened to my gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve made a terrible mistake. I need to find Tina. I knew in my heart something wasn’t right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou told her you didn’t love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand on the desk to hold myself up and feel something wet. I look down and there is small pool of blood on the corner of my desk mixed with a small amount of hair. Tina’s hair. The blood blends in with the mahogany, you can barely notice it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFUCK!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God. She has hemophilia. Her blood doesn’t clot well. She could be losing too much blood. Maybe she doesn’t even know she’s bleeding. I feel sick to the stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat have I done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snatch my phone up off my desk and call Tina. Her phone goes straight to voicemail. I don’t leave a message. Instead, I run out of the office and straight to Safira.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat is at the counter and greets me with a smile. She obviously doesn’t know about the misunderstanding with Tina otherwise she’d already have ripped my balls clean off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says, “Hey Nik, you just missed her. She knocked her head on the car door and has a cut on her noggin so I sent her home.” She looks left then right, comes closer and whispers, “How awesome was she with Omarr?! I didn’t think she had it in her. And please! She’s having hard times with money! Ha! Tina’s a freaking millionaire!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blanch and whisper loudly, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat’s face straightens and she asks, “She didn’t tell you yet?” She sighs, “Her mom’s life insurance policy was huge. Mia had a policy, too, but it all went to opening Safira. Tina put all her mom’s life insurance money into an interest account. Over five years, she has well over three million now. It’s a little hard to access but with my signature as well as her dad’s, she can take it all out today if she wanted to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. Just great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI accuse my girlfriend of being a gold digger and she has more money than I do!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembering my reason for being here, I ask, “You said she was hurt. How bad is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waves her hands, rolls her eyes, and says, “Don’t get all protective on me! It was just a cut. But Tina’s a bleeder so it always looks worse than it is. I cleaned it. It’s fine and no longer bleeding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank god. Now to go over to the apartment and beg on my knees for forgiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask Nat, “Is there any candy Tina likes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat looks at me like Well, Duh. And I understand it. This is Tina. She loves candy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes and ask, “What’s Tina’s favorite candy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe writes down four different names and I head down the street to the candy store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drag my sorry ass out of my car with a bag full of candy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I approach Tina’s apartment I think about my entrance. Should I knock? Or use my key?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think using my key is the better option. If I know she can pretend not to be home. But I see her car isn’t here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing my spare key, I enter the apartment and the first thing I notice is a handwritten note on the dining table. I walk closer. It’s addressed to Nat. I sit and read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey hon, sorry I didn’t talk to you about this before but I’m feeling a little raw. I don’t think I could’ve spoken about it without crying a river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik and I broke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Omarr thing worked but everything is screwed up. There was a big misunderstanding and I need some space. I’m going away a few days for some R\u0026amp;R. I’ll have my phone but it’ll be off so leave a message if you need me. I wouldn’t entrust the store to anyone but you. You know me, I’ll be fine. Just needing some time alone. Talk about it when I get home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you. You’re the best sister ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart sinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve driven the only woman I’ve wanted to protect from hurt and pain to this. I feel like the world’s biggest asshole. Actually, I am the world’s biggest asshole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Sissy office ordeal happened, Tina listened to me (with the help of Nat) and believed me. I didn’t even let her speak a word. I knew something wasn’t right but I let my pride get in the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden idea pops into my head. I flip open my cell and dial my guy. He picks up and I state, “I need someone found. Like, yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe responds with, “I need a cell number.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give it to him and tell him her cell will be off most of the time so he’ll need to check regularly. I quickly add he’ll be well paid for the time he spends on this assignment. He accepts the terms and says he’ll call as soon as he gets a hit. I end the call and pray to god that Tina is safe and well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf something happened to her I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind is only focused on one thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot being able to see for myself that she’s okay is driving me insane. I’m anxious and moody at everyone who cares about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the worst things I’ve ever had to do was admit to the girls what I’d done. To say Nat was angry at me would be an understatement. She punched me in the nose. And broke it. I took it without a word because I know I deserved it. So I’m sporting a couple of black eyes and a busted purple nose. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/friend-zoned-friend-zoned-1/page-37.html","bookId":2798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM"}
