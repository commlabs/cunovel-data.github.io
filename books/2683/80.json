Earlier in the day I was upset that Chloe and I weren\u0027t seated at Damien\u0027s table (because there were things I had to say to David Geffen and an apology I had to make to Calvin) but right now, watching Alison slumped against Damien while trying to light a joint the size of a very long roll of film, everyone very buzzed, people knocking into each other as table-hopping on a very massive scale resumes while cappuccino\u0027s served, everything sliding in and out of focus, it\u0027s okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m trying to light a cigarette someone\u0027s spilled San Pellegrino on and Lauren\u0027s talking to a kneeling Woody Harrelson about hemp production and so I tap in to Chloe, interrupting what I\u0027m sure is a stunning conversation with Baxter, and she turns reluctantly to me, finishing another Cosmopolitan, her face taut with misery, and then she simply asks, \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, baby, what\u0027s the story with Damien and Lauren?\" I inquire gingerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am so bored with you, Victor, that I don\u0027t even know how to answer that,\" she says. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you known about Damien and your so-called best friend Lauren?\" I ask again, lowering my voice, glancing over at Lauren and Woody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is my so-called boyfriend asking someone he actually thinks supposedly cares?\" she sighs, looking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey,\" I whisper patiently, \"they\u0027re having an affair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who told you this?\" she asks, recoiling. \"Where did you read this? Oh god, I\u0027m so tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you so tired of?\" I ask patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks down glassy-eyed at the scoops of sorbet melting into a puddle on her plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a big help,\" I sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you even care? What do you want me to say? You wanna f**k her? You wanna f**k him? You-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh. Hey baby, why would you think that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re whining, Victor.\" She waves a hand in front of my face tiredly, dismissing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alison and Damien are engaged-did you know that?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not interested in the lives of other people, Victor,\" Chloe says. \"Not now. Not tonight. Not when we\u0027re in serious trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you definitely need a toke off that major joint Alison\u0027s smoking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" She snaps out of something. \"Why, Victor? Why do you think I need to do drugs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I have a feeling we\u0027re on the verge of having that conversation again about how lost and fat you were at fourteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you ask me last night not to wear this dress?\" she asks, suddenly alert, arms crossed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePause. \"Because... you\u0027d resemble... Pocahontas, but really, baby, you look smashing and-\" I\u0027m just glancing around, smiling gently over at Beck, fidgeting with a Marlboro, searching for Chap Stick, smiling gently over at Beck again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, no.\" She\u0027s shaking her head. \"Because you don\u0027t care about things like that. You don\u0027t care about things that don\u0027t have anything to do with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have something to do with me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-80.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
