Then the archway unfolded and vanished into the ordinary lick of flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mistress stood, lifted her staff again, and again measured it against the stars. Her smile came brief, fierce, and sharp. “Co-yoi-tohn,” she said, pointing northwest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re looking for him,” said Zacharias suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind, a panther coughed and then, more distantly, wings whirred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZacharias yelped, drew his knife and peered eastward, but saw nothing—no winged riders among the silver-painted grass. The woman cast a glance over her shoulder. She scented the wind, then shrugged her pack down from her shoulders, pulled out a hard, round cake, and sat to eat. She offered none to him. Zacharias sharpened a stick and spitted the grouse, careful to make sure the viscera he had cleaned out and stuffed back in did not fall out of the cavity. He was too hungry to wait long. He offered the first grouse to her; she sniffed, made a face that actually made him laugh out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he caught himself, cringing, but she took no offense. She tore off a strip of meat, fingered it, touched it to her lips, licked it, chewed a corner, grunted with surprise, and finished it off, then extended a hand imperiously for more. He was starving, and he ate every bit of his own grouse even though it made his belly ache. She went so far as to crack the bones and suck the marrow out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when they were done, they did not rest. She rose, licked her fingers a final time, kicked dirt over the fire, and indicated the direction she had earlier pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Co-yoi-tohn,” she repeated. “What you would call, west of northwest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But where are we going?” he asked. “Who was the man we saw in the fire?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe only shrugged. Light tinged the east, the first herald of dawn. “Now we begin the hunt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSURELY, wicked souls consigned to the pit could not have spent an evening’s span of hours in more torment than did Alain at his wedding feast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe merriment he could stomach, barely, but the constant laughing toasts and crude jokes made him want to curl up and shrink away, and he was acutely conscious of Tallia beside him so still and withdrawn that he felt like a monster for wanting so badly what she clearly feared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut surely, when all was quiet and they were alone, he could persuade her to trust him. Surely, if he could gentle the ferocious Lavas hounds and win the trust of Liath, he could coax love from Tallia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had on a blue linen gown fantastically embroidered with gems and the springing roes that signified her Varren ancestry. A slim silver coronet topped her brow, Henry’s only concession to her royal kinship except of course for the delicate twist of gold braid that circled her neck. She wore her wheat-colored hair braided and pinned up at the back of her head; the style made her slim neck seem both more frail and more graceful. Wanting simply to touch it, to feel the pulse beating at her throat, made him ache in a peculiarly uncomfortable spot and even when he had to go pee he dared not stand to leave the table for fear of calling attention to himself in a most embarrassing way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Tallia shared a platter. He tried hard not to dip the elaborate sleeves of his tunic into the sauces that accompanied each course of the meal. Tallia did not eat more than a crust of bread and drink two sips of wine, but he was ravenous and though he feared it made him look gross and slovenly in her eyes, he could not help but eat heartily until a new toast would remind him—like a kick in the head from a panicked cow—that later this night he would at long last meet his heart’s desire on the wedding bed, where nothing more could come between them. Then he would be so stricken with nausea that he was sorry he had eaten anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, he gulped down wine one moment out of sheer nerves only to refuse the cup the next when with sick fear he recalled jokes he had heard at his Aunt Bel’s table about bridegrooms who had drunk themselves into such a sodden fog that they could not perform their husbandly duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLavastine spoke little and then only to respond laconically to congratulations thrown his way. He needed to say nothing; this triumph had cost him plenty in the lives of his men, but he had gained a nobly-connected bride for his heir together with a seat, by virtue of her lineage, among the great princes of the realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCertain distractions gnawed at the edges of the feast: Liath returned, and Prince Sanglant made such a spectacle of himself that Alain was briefly diverted from his fear that Tallia would faint dead away at the high table; the tumblers caught Tallia’s attention with their tricks, and for a happy if short span of time he got her to smile at him as he admired—not her, never her, let him show no interest in her or she would retreat as totally in spirit as a turtle pulls into its shell—but rather the lively cartwheelers and rope-balancers, thin girls of about Tallia’s age who had a kind of hard beauty to their faces composed of equal parts skill and coarse living. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-46.html","bookId":2014,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM"}
