It\u0027s because of the morphic resonance of all the camels, who have that disdainful expression and famous curled lip as a natural result of an ability to do quadratic equations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not generally realised that camels have a natural aptitude for advanced mathematics, particularly where they involve ballistics. This evolved as a survival trait, in the same way as a human\u0027s hand and eye co-ordination, a chameleon\u0027s camouflage and a dolphin\u0027s renowned ability to save drowning swimmers if there\u0027s any chance that biting them in half might be observed and commented upon adversely by other humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact is that camels are far more intelligent than dolphins.[21]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are so much brighter that they soon realised that the most prudent thing any intelligent animal can do, if it would prefer its descendants not to spend a lot of time on a slab with electrodes clamped to their brains or sticking mines on the bottom of ships or being patronised rigid by zoologists, is to make bloody certain humans don\u0027t find out about it. So they long ago plumped for a lifestyle that, in return for a certain amount of porterage and being prodded with sticks, allowed them adequate food and grooming and the chance to spit in a human\u0027s eye and get away with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this particular camel, the result of millions of years of selective evolution to produce a creature that could count the grains of sand it was walking over, and close its nostrils at will, and survive under the broiling sun for many days without water, was called You Bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was, in fact, the greatest mathematician in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou Bastard was thinking: there seems to be some growing dimensional instability here, swinging from zero to nearly forty-five degrees by the look of it. How interesting. I wonder what\u0027s causing it? Let V equal 3. Let Tau equal Chi/4. cudcudcud Let Kappa/y be an Evil-Smelling-Bugger[22] differential tensor domain with four imaginary spin co-efficients...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePtraci hit him across the head with her sandal. \u0027Come on, get a move on!\u0027 she yelled. You Bastard thought: Therefore H to the enabling power equals V/s. cudcudcud Thus in hypersyllogic notation . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic looked behind him. The strange distortions in the landscape seemed to be settling down, and Dios was . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDios was striding out of the palace, and had actually managed to find several guards whose fear of disobedience overcame the terror of the mysteriously distorted world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou Bastard stood stoically chewing. . . cudcudcud which gives us an interesting shortening oscillation. What would be the period of this? Let period \u003d x. cudcudcud Let t \u003d time. Let initial period . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePtraci bounced up and down on his neck and kicked hard with her heels, an action which would have caused any anthropoid male to howl and bang his head against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It won\u0027t move! Can\u0027t you hit it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic brought his hand down as hard as he could on You Bastard\u0027s hide, raising a cloud of dust and deadening every nerve in his fingers. It was like hitting a large sack full of coathangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come on,\u0027 he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDios raised a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Halt, in the name of the king!\u0027 he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arrow thudded into You Bastard\u0027s hump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . equals 6.3 recurring. Reduce. That gives us ouch . . . 314 seconds . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou Bastard turned his long neck around. His great hairy eyebrows made accusing curves as his yellow eyes narrowed and took a fix on the high priest, and he put aside the interesting problem for a moment and dredged up the familiar ancient maths that his race had perfected long ago:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet range equal forty-one feet. Let windspeed equal 2. Vector one-eight. cud Let glutinosity equal 7 .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic drew a throwing knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDios took a deep breath. He\u0027s going to order them to fire on us, Teppic thought. In my own name, in my own kingdom, I\u0027m going to be shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngle two-five, cud Fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a magnificent volley. The gob of cud had commendable lift and spin and hit with a sound like, a sound like half a pound of semi-digested grass hitting someone in the face. There was nothing else it could sound like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence that followed was by way of being a standing ovation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landscape began to distort again. This was clearly not a place to linger. You Bastard looked down at his front legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet legs equal four .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lumbered into a run. Camels apparently have more knees than any other creature and You Bastard ran like a steam engine, with lots of extraneous movement at right angles to the direction of motion accompanied by a thunderous barrage of digestive noises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Bloody stupid animal,\u0027 muttered Ptraci, as they jolted away from the palace, \u0027but it looks like it finally got the idea.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . gauge-invariant repetition rate of 3.5/z. What\u0027s she talking about, Bloody Stupid lives over in Tsort . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough they swung through the air as though jointed with bad elastic You Bastard\u0027s legs covered a lot of ground, and already they were bouncing through the sleeping packed-earth streets of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s starting again, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Ptraci. \u0027I\u0027m going to shut my eyes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic nodded. The firebrick-hot houses around them were doing their slow motion mirror dance again, and the road was rising and falling in a way that solid land had no right to adopt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s like the sea,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I can\u0027t see anything,\u0027 said Ptraci firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I mean the sea. The ocean. You know. Waves.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve heard about it. Is anyone chasing us?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic turned in the saddle. \u0027Not that I can make out,\u0027 he said. \u0027It looks as-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom here he could see past the long, low bulk of the palace and across the river to the Great Pyramid itself. It was almost hidden in dark clouds, but what he could see of it was definitely wrong. He knew it had four sides, and he could see all eight of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to be moving in and out of focus, which he felt instinctively was a dangerous thing for several million tons of rock to do. He felt a pressing urge to be a long way away from it. Even a dumb creature like the camel seemed to have the same idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou Bastard was thinking: . . Delta squared. Thus, dimensional pressure k will result in a ninety-degree transformation in Chi(16/x/pu)t for a K-bundle of any three invariables. Or four minutes, plus or minus ten seconds\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camel looked down at the great pads of his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet speed equal gallop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How did you make it do that?\u0027 said Teppic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I didn\u0027t! It\u0027s doing it by itself! Hang on!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t easy. Teppic had saddled the camel but neglected the harness. Ptraci had handfuls of camel hair to hang on to. All he had was handfuls of Ptraci. No matter where he tried to put his hands, they encountered warm, yielding flesh. Nothing in his long education had prepared him for this, whereas everything in Ptraci\u0027s obviously had. Her long hair whipped his face and smelled beguilingly of rare perfume.[23]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you all right?\u0027 he shouted above the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m hanging on with my knees!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That must be very hard!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You get special training!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamels gallop by throwing their feet as far away from them as possible and then running to keep up. Knee joints clicking like chilly castanets, You Bastard thrashed up the sloping road out of the valley and windmilled along the narrow gorge that led, under towering limestone cliffs, to the high desert beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd behind them, tormented beyond measure by the inexorable tide of geometry, unable to discharge its burden of Time, the Great Pyramid screamed, lifted itself off its base and, its bulk swishing through the air as unstoppably as something completely unstoppable, ground around precisely ninety degrees and did something perverted to the fabric of time and space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou Bastard sped along the gorge, his neck stretched out to its full extent, his mighty nostrils flaring like jet intakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s terrified!\u0027 Ptraci yelled. \u0027Animals always know about this sort of thing!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What sort of thing!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Forest fires and things!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We haven\u0027t got any trees!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, floods and - and things! They\u0027ve got some strange natural instinct!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . Phi* 1700[u/v]. Lateral e/v. Equals a tranche of seven to twelve . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound hit them. It was as silent as a dandelion clock striking midnight, but it had pressure. It rolled over them, suffocating as velvet, nauseating as a battered saveloy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou Bastard slowed to a walk, a complicated procedure that involved precise instructions to each leg in turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a feeling of release, a sense of stress withdrawn. You Bastard stopped. In the pre-dawn glow he\u0027d spotted a clump of thorned syphacia bushes growing in the rocks by the track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . angle left. x equals 37. y equals 19. z equals 43. Bite . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeace descended. There was no sound except for the eructations of the camel\u0027s digestive tract and the distant warbling of a desert owl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePtraci slid off her perch and landed awkwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My bottom,\u0027 she announced, to the desert in general, \u0027is one huge blister.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic jumped down and half-ran, half-staggered up the scree by the roadside, then jogged across the cracked limestone plateau until he could get a good look at the valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t there any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was still dark when Dil the master embalmer woke up, his body twanging with the sensation that something was wrong. He slipped out of bed, dressed hurriedly, and pulled aside the curtain that did duty as a door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night was soft and velvety. Behind the chirrup of the insects there was another sound, a frying noise, a faint sizzling on the edge of hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps that was what had woken him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was warm and damp. Curls of mist rose from the river, and-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pyramids weren\u0027t flaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d grown up in this house: it had been in the family of the master embalmers for thousands of years, and he\u0027d seen the pyramids flare so often that he didn\u0027t notice them, any more than he noticed his own breathing. But now they were dark and silent, and the silence cried out and the darkness glared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn\u0027t the worst part. As his horrified eyes stared up at the empty sky over the necropolis they saw the stars, and what the stars were stuck to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDil was terrified. And then, when he had time to think about it, he was ashamed of himself. After all, he thought, it\u0027s what I\u0027ve always been told is there. It stands to reason. I\u0027m just seeing it properly for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere. Does that make me feel any better?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and ran down the street, sandals flapping, until he reached the house that held Gern and his numerous family. He dragged the protesting apprentice from the communal sleeping mat and pulled him into the street, turned his face to the sky and hissed. \u0027Tell me what you can see!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGern squinted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I can see the stars, master,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are they on, boy?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGern relaxed slightly. \u0027That\u0027s easy, master. Everyone knows the stars are on the body of the goddess Nept who arches herself from . . . oh, bloody hell.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You can see her, too?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, mummy,\u0027 whispered Gern, and slid to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDil nodded. He was a religious man. It was a great comfort knowing that the gods were there. It was knowing they were here that was the terrible part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the body of a woman arched over the heavens, faintly blue, faintly shadowy in the light of the watery stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was enormous, her statistics interstellar. The shadow between her galactic breasts was a dark nebula, the curve of her stomach a vast wash of glowing gas, her navel the seething, dark incandescence in which new stars were being born. She wasn\u0027t supporting the sky. She was the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer huge sad face, upside down on the turnwise horizon, stared directly at Dil. And Dil was realising that there are few things that so shake belief as seeing, clearly and precisely, the object of that belief. Seeing, contrary to popular wisdom, isn\u0027t believing. It\u0027s where belief stops, because it isn\u0027t needed any more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-23.html","bookId":1626,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:47 PM"}
