Essie had arranged them into quite a show in Cousin Bess\u0027s big Waterford vase, culling out a trio from the field for Phoebe\u0027s bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can have the whole lot up in your room, of course, but I thought-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, this is fine. This is lovely.\" Phoebe leaned over for a sniff of them where they stood elegant and splashy on the piecrust table in the family parlor. \"We can all enjoy them here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t read the note.\" Essie handed it over. \"And I have to admit, it was a bitter war of conscience and curiosity. Even though I know who sent them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose he did. Well.\" Phoebe tapped the little envelope on her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for God\u0027s sake, Phoebe, read it!\" Ava stood behind Carly, rubbing the girl\u0027s shoulders. \"We\u0027re dying here. I considered wrestling your mama to the ground for that note.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe supposed when a man sent flowers to a house with four females, he sent them to all. She opened the envelope, and read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027See you Saturday. Duncan.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" Disappointment dragged through Ava\u0027s voice. \"Not much of a poet, is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say he\u0027s letting the flowers speak for themselves,\" Essie corrected. \"That\u0027s poetical enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mama, is he your boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just someone I\u0027m going to have dinner with tomorrow,\" Phoebe told Carly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Cause Sherrilynn\u0027s big sister has a boyfriend, and he makes her cry all the time. She lays across the bed in her room and cries all the time, Sherrilynn says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I bet Sherrilynn\u0027s big sister enjoys every minute of it.\" Phoebe reached down to cup Carly\u0027s face. \"I\u0027m not much of a crier myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cried when you called Roy last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mother could never hide tears from a child, and a mother who thought she could was delusional. \"Not so very much. I\u0027m going to go up and change. I heard a rumor it\u0027s pizza night around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And DVD and popcorn night!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard that, too. I want to go take off my work, and put on my play.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstairs, Phoebe sat on the side of the bed. Could a mother ever really protect her child from her mistakes, or the ripples from them that spread all through a life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeren\u0027t they in this house now because of a single event from more than twenty years before? Weren\u0027t they all who they were, with their lives tangled together under this roof, because of that steamy summer night when she was twelve? Decisions she made, actions she took, even words she spoke would affect her daughter forever. Just as her mother\u0027s had affected her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMama had done her best, Phoebe thought. But trusting a man with herself, with her children, had changed the course of their world. And she remembered it all, every movement, every moment, as if it were yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was a box of heat, stained with the grease of his sweat. He\u0027d begun to swig whiskey straight from the bottle of Wild Turkey Mama kept up high in the kitchen cupboard, so the stench of whiskey added another smear to the trapped air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe hoped he\u0027d drink enough to pass out before he used the.45 clutched in his free hand that he\u0027d taken to waving around like a mean little boy with a pointy stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePut your eye out, you\u0027re not careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d already fired off a few rounds, but just to kill lamps or bric-abrac and put holes in the walls. He\u0027d held it to Mama\u0027s head, too, screaming and cursing as he\u0027d dragged her across the floor by her long red hair. But he hadn\u0027t shot Mama, not yet, or made good on his threats to put a bullet in Phoebe\u0027s little brother Carter, or Phoebe herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he could, he could, and he made sure they knew he would if they gave him any goddamn lip. So fear lived in the box, too, a terrible, helpless fear that hung in the trapped air like blackflies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough all the shades were drawn or the curtains pulled tight over the windows, she knew the police were outside. He talked to them on the phone, Reuben did. She wished she knew what they were saying to him because he mostly calmed down afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she knew, for sure, what they said to calm him, maybe she could say it, too, in the in-between times he got tired of talking to them and hung up the phone and before he stirred himself up hot again and they had to try to cool him off, one more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called the person on the other end of the phone Dave, as if they were friends, and once he\u0027d gone on a long ramble about fishing. Now, he\u0027d gone back to pacing and drinking and cursing. The terrible in-between time. Phoebe no longer flinched when he swung the barrel of the gun toward the sofa where she and Carter huddled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was too tired to flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d broken in just after supper, when the sun had still been up. It had been down a long time now. So long, she thought maybe it would be coming up again before long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReuben had shot the pretty little clock with the mother-of-pearl face that had been a wedding present to Mama and Daddy, where it sat on the dropleaf table, so Phoebe couldn\u0027t be sure how many hours had passed since its death at five minutes past seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMama loved that clock. Phoebe knew that\u0027s why Reuben had killed it, because Mama set such store by that sweet little clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the phone rang again, he slammed the bottle on the little table and snatched it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dave, you son of a bitch, I said I want the electric turned back on. Don\u0027t you fucking tell me you\u0027re working on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved the gun, and Phoebe heard Carter suck in his breath. She rubbed a hand over the point of his knee to keep him still, to keep him quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much store as Mama set by the little clock, she set a lot more by Carter. Reuben knew that, too. So hurting Carter was bound to be somewhere on Reuben\u0027s list of things to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you fucking tell me we\u0027re going to work this out. You\u0027re not in here sweating like a goddamn pig, using goddamn oil lamps. You get the air back on in here, and right quick, and the lights, or I\u0027m going to hurt one of these kids. Essie, get your skinny, worthless ass over here and tell him I mean what I say. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe watched as her mother pushed out of the chair he\u0027d ordered her to sit in. Her face looked haggard in the lamplight, her eyes stunned as a trapped rabbit. When she was close enough to take the phone, he hooked an arm around her throat, pressed the barrel of the gun to her temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside Phoebe, Carter braced to leap. Phoebe gripped his hand, hard, shook her head, to keep him on the couch. \"Don\u0027t.\" She barely breathed the word. \"He\u0027ll hurt her if you try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him I mean what I say!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEssie kept her eyes straight ahead. \"He means what he says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him what I\u0027m doing now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears slid down her cheeks, bumping into the dried blood from the cut his fist had ripped there earlier. \"He\u0027s holding a gun to my head. My children are sitting together on the sofa. They\u0027re frightened. Please, do what he wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should\u0027ve done what I wanted, Essie.\" He closed his hand over her breast, squeezed. \"You should\u0027ve kept doing what I wanted, then none of this would be happening. I told you you\u0027d be sorry, didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Reuben, you told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hear that, Dave? It\u0027s her fault. Whatever happens in here, it\u0027s her fault. I was to put a bullet in her useless brain right now, it\u0027s her own damn fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Reuben?\" Phoebe heard her own voice, calm as a spring morning. It felt like it came from someone else, someone whose heart wasn\u0027t punching like fists into her throat. But Reuben\u0027s hard eyes tracked over and latched onto her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ask you to talk, little bitch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir. I just thought maybe you were getting hungry. Maybe you want me to make you a sandwich. We\u0027ve got some nice ham.\" Phoebe didn\u0027t-couldn\u0027t-allow herself to look at her mother. She felt her mama\u0027s fear rising like a flood, and if she looked at it head-on she might drown in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You figure if you fix me a sandwich, I won\u0027t shoot your whore of a mother in the head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But we got some nice ham, and some potato salad.\" She wasn\u0027t going to cry, Phoebe realized. It surprised her there weren\u0027t any tears pushing against that hammering heart. But there was fury in there, bubbling with the nerves in her belly. \"I made the potato salad myself. It\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on then, take that lamp with you. Don\u0027t think I can\u0027t see you in there. You try anything stupid, I\u0027m going to shoot your baby brother in the balls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" She rose, lifted the little oil lamp. \"Mr. Reuben? Can I use the bathroom first, please? I really have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ. Cross your legs and hold it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been holding it, Mr. Reuben. If I could just use the bathroom, real quick, I\u0027d make you a nice plate of food.\" She cast her eyes down. \"I could leave the door open. Please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better piss fast. I don\u0027t like how long you take, I\u0027ll start breaking your mama\u0027s fingers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fast.\" She hurried toward the bathroom right off the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the lamp on the back of the toilet, then, yanking down her pants, prayed that nerves and simple embarrassment wouldn\u0027t clamp her bladder shut. She shot a quick glance at the window over the tub. Too small, she knew, for her to wiggle out of. Carter could probably make it. If she could convince Reuben to let Carter use the bathroom, she\u0027d tell Carter to try to get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hopped up, flushing with one hand, reaching up to ease open the medicine cabinet with the other. \"Yes, sir!\" she called back when Reuben shouted at her to hurry the hell up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed the little bottle of her mother\u0027s Valium from the top shelf, stuffed it into her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Phoebe came out, Reuben shoved her mother so that Essie went sprawling toward the sofa. \"You there, Dave? I\u0027m going to have me a little bite to eat. If the electric isn\u0027t on by the time I finish, I\u0027m going to play eenie meenie miny mo and kill one of these kids. You go make that sandwich, Phoebe. And don\u0027t be stingy with the potato salad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a shotgun house, and small with it. Phoebe made sure she stayed in his line of sight as she took the ham and the salad out of the refrigerator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hear him talking to Dave, and struggled to keep her hands steady while she got out a plate and a saucer. A million dollars? Now he wanted a million dollars and a Cadillac, along with a free pass over the state line. Stupid as he was mean, Phoebe decided. Using the big blue bowl of potato salad as cover, she dumped pills on the saucer. Using her mother\u0027s pestle, she crushed them as best she could. She dumped a generous scoop of potato salad on the pills, mixed them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slathered mustard on two pieces of bread, slapped some ham and slices of American cheese between them. Maybe if she could get a knife out of the drawer, maybe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s taking so fucking long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe\u0027s head jerked up. He\u0027d put down the phone-she hadn\u0027t been paying close enough attention-and with the gun jammed under Carter\u0027s chin, was halfway to the kitchen doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I just have to get you a fork for the potato salad.\" Palming the pill bottle, she turned, yanked open the flatware drawer. She let the bottle drop in as she reached down for a fork. \"You want some lemonade, Mr. Reuben? Mama made it fresh just-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get that food out here, girl, and quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snatched up the plate. It was easy to let the fear show, to let it mask everything else. Seeing the gun under Carter\u0027s jaw overwhelmed even her rage. Her hands shook so the plate bobbed up and down. When he smiled, she understood their fear was part of what he wanted. Giving it to him cost her nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put that plate by the phone there, and go sit your skinny ass down on the sofa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did exactly as she was told, but before Phoebe could sit, Reuben lifted his leg to give Carter a solid boot on the ass that sent the boy pitching forward. Essie leaped up, stopping only when Phoebe blocked her way, shot her a fierce look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe walked over to pull Carter up herself. \"Hush, Carter! Mr. Reuben doesn\u0027t want to hear all that crying while he\u0027s trying to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got some sense.\" With a nod, Reuben sat, laid the gun across his lap. He picked up the fork with one hand, the phone with the other. \"Don\u0027t know where you came by it with that worthless whore who raised you. Where\u0027s that electric, Dave?\" he said into the phone, and took a forkful of potato salad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Carter sniffled in their mother\u0027s arms, Phoebe watched Reuben eat. Had she put enough pills in? Enough to make him pass out? The liquor he washed down the food with would help, wouldn\u0027t it? Maybe it would kill him. She\u0027d read about things like that, pills and liquor. Maybe the son of a bitch would just die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned down, whispered into Carter\u0027s ear. Her brother shook his head, so she pinched him, hard. \"You do just what I say, or I\u0027ll slap you stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut the hell up over there! Did I tell you to talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Mr. Reuben. I was just telling him not to cry. He\u0027s gotta pee, too. Can he just go use the bathroom, Mr. Reuben? I\u0027m sorry, Mr. Reuben, but it\u0027ll be an awful mess if he wets his pants. It\u0027ll only take him a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ\u0027s sake! G\u0027wan, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe closed her hand over Carter\u0027s, squeezed viciously. \"Go on, Carter. Do what you\u0027re told.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnuckling his eyes, Carter pushed off the sofa and dragged his heels into the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Reuben?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMama hissed at her to stay quiet, but Phoebe ignored her. Carter could get out. If Reuben didn\u0027t think about him for a few minutes, Carter could get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think if I asked that man to turn on the electric, he would?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s so hot. Maybe if I asked him, if I told him we\u0027re all so hot, he\u0027d turn it on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear that, Dave?\" Reuben kicked back in his chair and grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis glassy eyes drooped. \"Got a kid wants to negotiate with you. Sure, what the fuck. Come on over here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Phoebe stood in front of him, Reuben passed her the phone. And pressed the gun to her belly. \"Tell him what I\u0027m doing first.\" Sweat snaked a slow, fat line down her back. Why didn\u0027t the pills work? Had Carter wriggled out the window?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mister? He\u0027s got the gun at my stomach, and I\u0027m awful scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re so hot. No, we\u0027re not hurt, but we\u0027re so hot it\u0027s going to make us sick. If we could just have the air-conditioning back on, maybe we could sleep, \u0027cept we\u0027re so scared I guess we\u0027d need a bunch of sleeping pills or something. Please, mister, would you please turn on the electricity? \"And, sir?\" She gripped the phone tighter when Reuben reached for it. When he shrugged, leaned back, the wave of relief was like giddiness. \"Could you please give him the money and the car he wants? He\u0027s been real nice to us since I gave him the potato salad I made myself. He even let me go to the bathroom first. We\u0027re all just so tired we might just pass out any minute, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReuben held out a hand for the phone, then gave her a nasty little poke with the gun to move her back. \"Hear that, Dave? This girl here, she wants the electric back on. Wants me to have the money and that Caddy. Hell no, I didn\u0027t let them get anything to eat, and I won\u0027t till that electric\u0027s back on. Fact, I\u0027m gonna go eenie meenie right now and... Where\u0027s that boy? Where is that little shit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Reuben, he\u0027s right... \" Phoebe shot out her arm as if to point and knocked over the bottle of Wild Turkey. \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry! I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027ll clean it right up. I\u0027ll-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went down, pain searing over her face as the back of his hand slammed against her cheek. \"Stupid bitch!\" He lurched up, staggered. Phoebe looked straight into the barrel of the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the wrath of God, Essie leaped off the couch and onto his back. He bucked; she bit. Her nails scraped like razors down his face as they both screamed, both cursed. Phoebe scrambled back in a crab walk, barely avoiding a bullet as Reuben went down to his knees under Essie\u0027s assault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help us! Help us now!\" Phoebe shouted until her lungs burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed the bottle, prepared to whale in, but Reuben went down, flat on his face. Weeping, screaming, Essie continued to pound him with her fists, even when the door burst open. Even when men rushed in with guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t shoot us. Don\u0027t shoot us.\" Weeping, Phoebe crawled to her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings slowed down to a dream, it seemed like. And in the dream people walked her through water where voices echoed and the lights hurt her eyes. Once, she fell asleep, and did dream. But the dream was so scary she pushed herself awake again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMama had to have X-rays of her face to make sure her cheekbone wasn\u0027t broken, and stitches to close the gash. Phoebe sat in the little room in the hospital. She didn\u0027t want to lie down, didn\u0027t want to sleep again and fall back into the dream where the gun exploded, and the bullet-like a live thing-hunted her down and killed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter slept curled up in a ball on the narrow bed. His fists were clenched, and off and on his body twitched like a horse\u0027s did when flies landed on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoctors and nurses and police came in and out, and asked questions. When they did, she wanted them to go away. When they went away, she wished they\u0027d come back so she wasn\u0027t alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there\u0027d been water to drink, to wash the grit that had coated her throat. And then icy Coca-Cola, straight from the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted her mother. She wanted Mama so bad it hurt worse than Reuben\u0027s hand across her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a man came in with a big McDonald\u0027s takeout bag, the smell of burgers and fries had her stomach jittering with sudden and acute hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her, glanced at Carter, then came over to sit beside Phoebe on the bed. \"Thought you might be hungry. Don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027d rather skip the hospital food. I\u0027m Dave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she stared, knew it was rude. But she\u0027d expected Dave to be old-older anyway. He looked barely older than the high school boys Phoebe liked to sigh over in secret. His hair was a light brown with a lot of curl to it, his eyes shades lighter and blue. He wore a dark blue shirt, open at the collar. And he smelled just a little sweaty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out his hand, but when Phoebe offered hers, he didn\u0027t shake it. He held it, firm, just the way his eyes held hers. \"I\u0027m really happy to meet you, Phoebe. Really happy to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad to meet you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she did what she hadn\u0027t done in all the hours inside the hot little house, in all the time she\u0027d waited while her brother slept. She cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave sat, held her hand. He didn\u0027t say a thing. At one point he got up, dug up a box of tissues and put them in her lap. When her tears slowed, he pulled the Quarter Pounders and fries out of the bag. \"My mama,\" Phoebe began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s going to be fine. I checked on her, and I asked if I could have a little time with you before they took you and your brother to her, or brought her to you. Looks like he could use some sleep anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you were scared, but you were smart, too, and you were brave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t brave. I was mad.\" She picked up the burger, bit in. Her stomach clenched as if deciding whether or not it would accept the food. Then it relaxed again. \"Carter was brave for climbing out the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said you told him to, that you said you\u0027d slap him stupid if he didn\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flushed a little because she was forbidden to hit her brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though there were occasions she judged he\u0027d earned it enough for her to break the rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reuben would\u0027ve hurt him. He\u0027d\u0027ve hurt him bad before he hurt me, or even Mama again. Because he\u0027s the baby, and Reuben knows Mama loves him more than anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d already put the pills in the food before you told Carter to climb out the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should\u0027ve put more in. I wasn\u0027t sure how many. You knew what I was trying to tell you, right away.\" She picked up a fry. \"I felt better when I was talking to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was smart of you to find a way to tell me you put something in his food. It bought me just a little more time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come you didn\u0027t turn the electric back on? He got so mad about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you know how you talked him into letting you go to the bathroom before you fixed his food? It\u0027s kind of like that. You try to get something back, like an exchange. Fact was, I was about to when we spotted Carter climbing out the window. I wanted to keep Reuben talking-or let you talk-while we got Carter to safety and figured out the new situation. Did you knock over the bottle to distract him, so he\u0027d be mad at you and forget about Carter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured he\u0027d hit me, but I didn\u0027t know he\u0027d get that mad. I think he\u0027d have shot me if Mama hadn\u0027t jumped on him. I should\u0027ve given him more pills, is what. Then it wouldn\u0027t have taken so long for him to pass out. Mama wouldn\u0027t\u0027ve had the pills if it wasn\u0027t for him. That\u0027s irony.\" She smiled a little when Dave laughed. \"I learned about irony in English class. She got the pills because he made her so upset and nervous. He pretended to be nice when he met her, when they started going out. But he started picking on her, and us, and pushing his weight around. He slapped her once, right across the face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had a restraining order on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe nodded. \"She told him she wouldn\u0027t see him anymore and to go away. But he kept coming around, or going to her work. Following her in his car. I think more than that, but she wouldn\u0027t tell me. He came to the house one night, too, drunk, and she called the police. They made him go away, but that\u0027s all they did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry we didn\u0027t do more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They told her she could get that restraining order, so she did. I don\u0027t see how it helped her any.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m sorry about that, too. It seems to me, Phoebe, your mother did everything right, everything she could do to protect herself and her family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe stared down at the paper napkin balled in her fist. \"Why didn\u0027t he just go away when she said she didn\u0027t want him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t the answer she wanted, Phoebe decided. Worse, it was kin to a lie. She hated when grown-ups lied because they didn\u0027t think you could understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe ate more fries and shook her head. \"Maybe you don\u0027t know exactly, but you sort of do. You just think I won\u0027t understand \u0027cause I\u0027m only twelve-almost twelve. But I understand lots of things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her another moment, as if he could read something on her face like the words in a book. \"Okay, I do sort of know, or I have an opinion. I think he\u0027s mean, he\u0027s a bully, and he didn\u0027t like the idea of anyone telling him what to do, or what he could have, especially a woman like your mother. So he tried to scare her and intimidate her, and he got madder and madder because it wasn\u0027t working the way he wanted. I think he wanted to hurt her, to show her he was the boss, and it got out of hand, even for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe ate another fry. \"I think he\u0027s a son of a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that, too. Now he\u0027s going to be a son of a bitch in jail, for a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about this as she sucked on the Coke he\u0027d brought her. \"On TV, they usually shoot the bad guy. The SWAT team shoots him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it better when nobody gets shot. What you did in there? It helped it work out so nobody died. Dying\u0027s a short end, Phoebe. I know you\u0027re tired, and you want to see your mother.\" He stood, then pulled a card out of his pocket. \"I want you to know you can call me anytime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to talk about all this again, or ask questions, or you need help with anything, you just call me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the card and read: Detective David McVee. \"Carter, too? And Mama?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely. Anything, Phoebe, anytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, thanks. Thanks for the burger and fries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My pleasure, that\u0027s a fact.\" This time when he offered his hand, he shook hers. \"You take care of yourself, and your family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he left, Phoebe put his card in her pocket. She rolled up the takeout bag to help keep the food Dave had brought for Carter warm, shoved the trash in the waste bin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed to the window to look out. The sun had come up. She didn\u0027t know when dawn had broken or how long it had been light. But she knew the dark hours were over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door opened and her mother stood there, her arms open wide, Phoebe all but flew into them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mama, Mama, Mama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sweet girl. My baby girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your face. Mama-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right. I\u0027m all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could it be all right with that line of stitches running down her mother\u0027s lovely cheek, marring her soft, soft skin? When her sparkling blue eyes were dull and the bruising crawled out around them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Essie put her hands on Phoebe\u0027s shoulders. \"It\u0027s nothing. We\u0027re safe, we\u0027re all safe. That\u0027s everything. Oh God, Phoebe, I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not you. Not you.\" Tears spilled again as Essie brushed kisses over the bruise on Phoebe\u0027s jaw. \"Mama, it wasn\u0027t your fault. Dave even said so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I let Reuben into our lives. I opened the door to him. That much, at least, is my fault.\" She stepped away to walk over, to lean over Carter and rest her cheek on his head. \"God, God, if anything had happened to you, to either of you, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do. You got him out,\" she murmured. \"You got Carter out of the house. It\u0027s more than I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mama-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll never look at you quite the same way again, Phoebe.\" Essie straightened. \"I\u0027ll always look at you and see my little girl, my own baby girl, but now, every time I look at you, I\u0027ll see a hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You beat him down to the floor,\" Phoebe reminded her. \"I guess you\u0027re a hero, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe at the end of it. Well, I hate to wake him up, but I don\u0027t want to stay in this hospital anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we go home now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEssie brushed a hand over Carter\u0027s hair, faced her daughter again. \"We\u0027re never going back there. I never want to go inside that place again. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027d never feel safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where can we go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to stay with Cousin Bess. I called her, and she said we\u0027re to come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the big house?\" The idea of it had Phoebe\u0027s eyes opening wide. \"But you and Cousin Bess don\u0027t hardly speak. You don\u0027t even like her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This morning, she\u0027s my favorite person in the world, save you and Carter. And we\u0027re going to be grateful to her, Phoebe, for opening her home to us when we need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t open it to us when Daddy died, or when-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now she is.\" Essie snapped out the words. \"And we\u0027re grateful to her. It\u0027s what we have to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what we have to do,\" Essie repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rode to Cousin Bess\u0027s in a police car while Carter wolfed down the cold burger and fries, gulped down the Coke. They circled the park with the fountain sparkling in the air. The grand old house was rosy brick and soft white trim; it was lush with green lawn and tended flowers and draping trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a world away from the tiny shotgun house where Phoebe had lived for more than eight of her twelve years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noted her mother\u0027s back was poker straight as they climbed up the stone steps to the front door, so she stiffened hers as well. Mama rang the bell like company would, rather than family. The woman who answered the door was young and bright and beautiful. She made Phoebe think of a movie star with her golden fall of hair and slender build.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was sympathy on her face as she held out her hands to Essie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. MacNamara, I\u0027m Ava Vestry, Ms. MacNamara\u0027s personal assistant. Come in, come in. Your rooms are all ready for you. You must be exhausted, so I\u0027ll take you right up. Or if you\u0027d rather have some breakfast, or some tea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t need anyone fussing over them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCousin Bess made the announcement from the curve of the grand stairs. She stood, dressed in a crow-black dress, her thin face pinched with disapproval. Her hair was as gray as a Brillo pad with odd wings of black at either temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, as always, the first glimpse of her father\u0027s cousin made Phoebe think of the mean Almira Gulch, come to stuff Toto in her basket. Wicked old witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for taking us in, Cousin Bess,\" Mama said in the same quiet voice she\u0027d used when Reuben had a gun to her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t surprise me you got yourself into a mess. The three of you are to wash, thoroughly, before you sit at my table or lie on my sheets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see to it, Ms. MacNamara.\" Ava turned her beautiful, compassionate smile onto Phoebe, then Carter. \"Maybe the children are hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe after their bath, I could ask the cook to make pancakes or-\" Apparently the idea of more food after the horrors of the night, the burger, the fries, the ride in a police car, was too much for Carter\u0027s stomach. It tossed up the Quarter Pounder right there on Cousin Bess\u0027s antique Aubusson carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortified, exhausted, Phoebe just closed her eyes. Maybe she hadn\u0027t been shot and killed, but she was sure her life was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMama had tended Cousin Bess\u0027s house for twenty years now, scrubbing, polishing, arranging. She\u0027d served that demanding old woman until the day she died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough those two decades, the house had become Essie\u0027s worldnot just her home, or even her sanctuary. Her entire world. And what was outside it, her fears. It had been nearly a decade since Essie had gone beyond its terraces, its courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReuben\u0027s death in prison hadn\u0027t broken those locks for her, Phoebe thought as she rose to put her gun in the lockbox on the top shelf of her closet. The bitter end to Cousin Bess\u0027s bitter life hadn\u0027t thrown the doors open for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, it seemed to Phoebe those events had simply added more and stronger locks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Cousin Bess had done the right thing, the kind thing and-fat chance-passed the house to her mother instead of shackling Phoebe to it, would things have been different? Better? Would her mother be able to walk out of the house, stroll over to the park, pop in and visit a neighbor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere would she herself be now if not for that night? Would she have married Roy? Would she have found a way to keep her marriage together, to give her daughter the father she deserved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never know that either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they\u0027d have the lilies in the parlor, order pizza, and settle in together for a Friday night at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Phoebe would go out to dinner Saturday-just this once. There was too much in her life already that needed tending without adding a man to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d cried when she spoke to Roy last, yes, she had. But those tears had mostly been anger. She\u0027d shed most of the sorrow and disappointment long before, when Carly had been only a baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo much that needed tending, Phoebe thought again as she changed. She glanced at the blush pink lilies in the cobalt-blue vase on her dresser. Flowers were lovely. But blooms faded and died. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-5.html","bookId":2412,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM"}
