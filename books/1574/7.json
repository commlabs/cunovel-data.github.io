{"id":110275,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003eVolger switched off the wireless, and the cabin fell into silence. The flutter of birds filtered down from the rafters of the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You matter more than anyone knows, Aleksandar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How? I have no parents, no real title.\" Alek looked down at himself, dressed in stolen farmer\u0027s clothes and covered with hay. \"I haven\u0027t even had a proper bath in two weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, indeed.\" Volger sniffed. \"But your father planned carefully for the coming war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we get to Switzerland, I will explain.\" Volger switched the wireless on again. \"But that won\u0027t happen unless we can buy fuel and parts tomorrow. Go wake the men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek raised an eyebrow. \"Did you just give me an order, Count?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go wake the men if you please, Your Serene Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re only being insolent to distract me from your little secret, Count. But that doesn\u0027t make it any less annoying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger let out a laugh. \"I suppose not. But I can\u0027t give up my secret yet. I promised your father to wait till the proper time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek\u0027s fists tightened. He was growing tired of being treated like this, never told what Volger\u0027s plans were until the last moment. Maybe he\u0027d been a child the day his parents had died, but no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last two weeks he\u0027d learned how to start a fire, how to replace the engines\u0027 glow plugs, how to track their nighttime progress toward Switzerland with a sextant and the stars. He could squeeze the Stormwalker under bridges and into barns, and strip and clean the Spandau machine guns as easily as washing his own clothes -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;another thing he\u0027d learned to do. Hoffman had even taught him to cook a little, boiling dried meat to soften it, adding the vegetables they\u0027d gathered while trampling some unlucky farmer\u0027s field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut most important, Alek had learned to shut away despair. He hadn\u0027t cried since that first day, not once. His misery was locked away in a small, hidden corner of himself. The only time the awful hollowness struck now was when he was alone on watch, while the others were asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even then Alek practiced the art of keeping his tears inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a child anymore,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Volger\u0027s voice softened. \"But your father asked me to wait, Alek, and I intend to honor his wishes. Go wake the men, and after breakfast we\u0027ll have a fencing lesson. You\u0027ll need your reflexes sharp for this afternoon\u0027s piloting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek stared at Volger another moment, then finally nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the need for a sword in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On guard, if you please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek raised his saber and assumed his guard. Volger walked in a slow circle around him, inspecting Alek\u0027s stance for what felt like a solid minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More weight on your back foot,\" the man finally said. \"But otherwise acceptable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek shifted his weight, his muscles already beginning to cramp. Long days in the pilot\u0027s cabin had ruined his form. This lesson was going to hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain was always Count Volger\u0027s objective, of course. When Alek had started his training at ten years old, he\u0027d expected swordplay to be exciting. But his first lessons had consisted of standing motionless like this for hours, with Volger taunting him whenever his outstretched arm began to quiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least now, at fifteen, he was allowed to cross swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger took his own guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slowly at first. I shall call your parries,\" Volger said, and began to attack, shouting out the names of defensive movements as he lunged. \"Tierce ... tierce again. Now prime. That\u0027s awful, Alek. Your blade\u0027s too far down! Two in tierce. Now go back covering. Now quarte. Simply dreadful. Again ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe count\u0027s attacks continued, but his voice dropped off, relying on Alek to choose his own parries. The swords flashed, and their shuffling feet stirred up dust into the shafts of sunlight lancing through the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"PRACTICE.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt odd fencing in farmer\u0027s clothes, without servants standing ready to bring water and towels. Mice scrambled underfoot, and the giant Stormwalker watched over them like some iron god of war. Every few minutes Count Volger called a halt and stared up at the machine, as if hoping to find in its stoic silence the patience to endure Alek\u0027s clumsy technique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he would sigh and say, \"Again ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek felt his focus sharpening as they fought. Unlike in the fencing salon at home, here there were no mirrors along the wall, and Klopp and the other men were too busy checking over the walker\u0027s engines to watch. No distractions, just the clear ring of steel and the shuffle of feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the sparring grew more intense, Alek realized they hadn\u0027t put on masks yet. He\u0027d always begged to fight without protection, but his parents had never allowed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why Serbia?\" Volger suddenly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek dropped his guard. \"Pardon me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger pushed aside Alek\u0027s half-ready parry and landed a touch on his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in blazes?\" Alek cried out, rubbing his hand. The sporting saber\u0027s edge was dull, but could still bruise when it landed on flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not drop your guard until the other man does, Your Highness. Not in time of war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you just asked me ...,\" Alek began, then sighed and raised his sword again. \"All right. Continue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe count began with another flurry of blows, pushing Alek backward. By the rules of saber any contact with the opponent\u0027s sword ended a legal attack. But Volger was ignoring every parry, using brute strength to gain his ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why Serbia?\" the count repeated, pushing Alek toward the back wall of the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the Serbs are allied with Russia!\" Alek cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed.\" Volger suddenly ended his attack, turning his back and walking away. \"The old alliance of the Slavic peoples.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek blinked. Sweat was running into his eyes, and his heart was racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger took up his stance in the center of the barn. \"On guard, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek approached warily, his sword up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger attacked again, still ignoring the rules of priority. This wasn\u0027t fencing, Alek realized, this was more like ... a sword fight. He let his concentration narrow, his awareness extending down the length of his saber. Like the Stormwalker, the length of steel became an extension of his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who is most closely allied with Russia?\" Volger asked, not even a little breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Britain,\" Alek said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so.\" Volger\u0027s blade slipped inside Alek\u0027s guard, whacking his right arm hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch!\" Alek dropped his guard and rubbed the wound. \"For heaven\u0027s sake, Volger! Are you teaching me fencing or diplomacy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger smiled. \"You are in need of instruction in both, obviously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the British navy command met with the Russians last year! Father said it drove the Germans wild with worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is not an alliance, Alek. Not yet.\" Volger raised his sword. \"So who is allied with Russia, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"France, I suppose.\" Alek swallowed. \"They have a treaty, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct.\" Volger paused for a moment, sword point tracing a pattern in the air, then frowned. \"Raise your sword, Alek. I won\u0027t warn you again; nor shall your enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek sighed and took his guard. He felt himself gripping the saber too tightly, and forced his hand to relax. Did Volger think these distractions were useful?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Focus on my eyes,\" Volger said. \"Not the tip of my sword.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of eyes, we aren\u0027t wearing masks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are no masks in war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There aren\u0027t many sword fights in war either! Not lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger raised an eyebrow at this, and Alek felt a moment of triumph. Two could play at this game of being annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man lunged, and Alek parried, counterattacking for once. His saber\u0027s edge missed Volger\u0027s arm by a hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled back and covered himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So let us review,\" Volger said, his sword still flashing. \"Austria gets revenge on Serbia. Then what happens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To protect Serbia, Russia declares war on Austria.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Alek spoke, somehow his mind stayed focused on the play of sabers. It was strangely clarifying, wearing no mask. He\u0027d met German officers from the military schools where protection was considered cowardly. Scars stretched across their faces like cruel smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\" Volger said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Germany protects Clanker honor by declaring war on Russia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger lunged at Alek\u0027s knee, an illegal target. \"And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"France makes good its treaty with Russia, and declares war on Germany.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows?\" Alek shouted, thrashing at Volger\u0027s saber. He\u0027d lost his footing, he realized - too much of his body was exposed. He turned to correct it. \"Britain finds her way in somehow. Darwinists against Clankers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger lunged forward and his saber spun, wrapping around Alek\u0027s like a snake and yanking it from his grasp. Metal flashed as the sword soared across the barn, burying itself in the half-rotten wall with a thunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wildcount stepped forward and held his saber at Alek\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what can we conclude from this lesson, Your Highness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek glared at the man. \"We can conclude, Count Volger, that discussing politics while fencing is idiotic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger smiled. \"For most people, perhaps. But some of us are born without the choice. The game of nations is your birthright, Alek. Politics is part of everything you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek pushed Volger\u0027s saber aside. Without a sword in his hand he suddenly felt numb and exhausted, and he didn\u0027t have the strength to argue against the obvious. His birth had shaken the Austro-Hungarian throne, and now his parents\u0027 death had unsettled the delicate balance of Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this war is my responsibility,\" he said bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Alek. The Clanker and Darwinist powers would have found a way to fight, sooner or later. But perhaps you can still make your mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" Alek asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wildcount did a strange thing then. He took his own saber by the blade and handed it to Alek, pommel first, as if offering it to a victor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall see, Alek. We shall see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased the saunters sideways and felt the Storm-walker\u0027s right foot shift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" Otto Klopp said. \"Slowly now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek nudged the controls again, and the walker slid a little farther. It was frustrating, maneuvering in tight quarters like this. One bump of the walker\u0027s shoulder could send the whole rotten barn crashing down around them. At least the trembling gauges and levers had begun to make sense. A little more pressure in the knees might help... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith another nudge he\u0027d done it - the viewport was lined up with a ragged gap in the wall of the barn. The late afternoon sun shone into the cabin, the fields stretching out before them. A harvesting combine rumbled along on twelve legs in the distance, a dozen farmers and a four-legged truck following to collect the bundled grain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCount Volger put a hand on Alek\u0027s shoulder. \"Wait till they\u0027re out of sight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, obviously,\" Alek said. With his bruises still throbbing, he\u0027d had enough of Volger\u0027s counsel for one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe combine made its slow way across the field, finally disappearing behind a low hill. A few workmen straggled behind, black dots on the horizon. Alek soon lost them in the distance, but waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Bauer\u0027s voice crackled on the intercom, \"That\u0027s the last one gone, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorporal Bauer had the uncanny eyesight of an expert gunner. Two weeks ago he\u0027d been on his way to commanding a machine of his own. Master Hoffman had been the Hapsburg Guards\u0027 best engineer. But now the two were nothing more than fugitives. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-leviathan-1/page-7.html","bookId":1574,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:57:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:57:00 PM"}
