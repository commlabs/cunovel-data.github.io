They\u0027d met for coffee at a Gooville caf�� that catered to whaley boys. She\u0027d assured him that no one would notice them, and, strangely enough, the whaley boys had completely ignored them.

You promised you wouldn\u0027t laugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you meant even this early in the story I\u0027m not supposed to laugh? Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, I\u0027m sure it doesn\u0027t measure up to Gooville Community College\u0026nbsp; - \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Home of the Gooville Fighting Loogies\u0026nbsp; - \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, you made your point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. So a friend and I decided that we\u0027re going to go to break out of our boring small-college lives, we were going to take some risks, we were going to\u0026nbsp; - \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk to a girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We decided to drive all the way to Florida for spring break just like American kids, where we would then drink beer, get sunburned, and then talk to a girl\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you went.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Took almost a week to get there, but yes, we drove in his dad\u0027s Vista Cruiser station wagon. And I did indeed meet a girl. In Fort Lauderdale. A girl from Fort Lauderdale. And I talked to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dirty little tramp. Like, \u0027How\u0027s it going, eh? \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Among other things. We conversed. And so she invited me to go see a manatee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He shoots! He scores!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I thought it was an American way of saying matinee. I thought we were going to a movie. You know, you don\u0027t think about those things as being real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She did volunteer work for a rescue hospital for injured marine mammals, mostly manatees that had been hit by boats. They had a bottlenose dolphin, too. We stayed there for hours, caring for the animals, her teaching me about them. I was hooked. I hadn\u0027t even picked my undergrad major, but as soon as I got back to school, I went for biology, and I\u0027ve been studying marine mammals ever since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God, you didn\u0027t get laid, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found a passion for life. I found something that drives me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe I fell for such a pathetic loser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027m pretty good at this whale stuff. I\u0027m respected in my field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, before then, I mean. Hey, did you say that you fell for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I fell for a pathetic loser, if the shoe fits...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her. She kissed him back. That went on for a while. They both found it excellent. Then they stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you wanted to talk about our age difference,\" Nate said, because he always picked women who broke his heart, and, figuring that his heart was now into this whole thing far enough to be broken, he wanted to get on with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we probably should. Maybe we should sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, at the table.

They sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" she said, curling her legs up under her, sitting like a little kid, making him feel ever more the creepy old guy leching on the young girl, \"you know that the whaley boys have been pulling people in here from shipwrecks and plane crashes for years, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what Cielle said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wants you, I can tell, but that\u0027s beside the point. Do you know that they pulled whole crews off sunken submarines, plus they\u0027ve yanked sonar guys out of port for years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter, has nothing to do with what I\u0027m telling you. So you realize that some people who have been lost at sea, like the crew of the American sub Scorpion that sank back in 67, actually ended up here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. That makes sense. More of the Goo looking out for itself. Gaining knowledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but that\u0027s not the point. I mean, those guys helped put together a lot of the technology you saw on the whale ship, the human technology, but that doesn\u0027t matter. The important part is that the world thinks that the crew of the Scorpion is at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, even though they\u0027re not. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Nate said, really slowly, the way he had spoken to the Colonel when he was losing the point\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; much the way he was waving in the conversational wind right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you realize that when I applied with you and Clay, that I gave my real name, which is Amy Earhart, and that Amy is short for Amelia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God,\" Nate said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha!\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship broker found Clay\u0027s ship in the Philippines, in Manila Harbor. Clay bought it based on faxed photographs, a spec sheet, and a recent hull certification for just under $2 million of the Old Broad\u0027s money. It was a 180-foot-long U.S. Coast Guard fisheries patrol vessel built in the late fifties. It had been refitted several times since then, once in the seventies for fishing, once in the eighties for ocean survey, and finally in the nineties as a live-aboard dive boat for the adventure tourist. It had plenty of comfortable cabins as well as compressors, dive platforms, and cranes to raise and lower support vessels onto the rear deck, although, except for the lifeboats, it came with no support craft. Clay thought they could use the rear deck as a helicopter-landing pad, even if there wasn\u0027t a budget for a helicopter, but\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; you know\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; someone with a helicopter might want to land there, and it helped no end to have a big H painted on the deck. There was a budget for painting a big H. The ship had efficient, if not quite state-of-the-art, navigation equipment, radar, autopilot, and some old but functioning sonar arrays left over from its days as a fishing ship. It had twin twelve-hundred-horsepower diesel engines and could distill up to twenty tons of freshwater a day for the crew and passengers. There were cabins and support for forty. It was also rated a class-three icebreaker, which was a feature that Clay hoped they wouldn\u0027t have to test. He really didn\u0027t like cold water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough another broker Clay hired the crew of ten men, sight unseen, right off the docks of Manila: a group of brothers, cousins, and uncles with the last name of Mangabay, among whom the broker guaranteed that there were no murderers, or at least no convicted murderers, and only petty thieves. The eldest uncle, Ray Mangabay, who would be Clay\u0027s first mate, would sail the ship to Honolulu, where Clay would meet them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to be driving my ship,\" Clay said to Clair after he\u0027d gotten the news that he had a crew and a first mate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to let your ship go, Clay,\" Clair said. \"If he sinks it, it wasn\u0027t really yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s my ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to call it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was thinking about the Intrepid or the Merciless or some other big-dick, blow-shit-up kind of name. He was thinking about Loyal or Relentless or the Never Surrender, because he was determined now to find his friend, and he didn\u0027t mind putting that right on the bow. \"Well, I was thinking about\u0026nbsp; - \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were thinking deeply about it, weren\u0027t you?\" Clair interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I thought I\u0027d call her the Beautiful Clair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just the Clair will be fine, baby. You don\u0027t want the bow to look busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. The Clair.\" Strangely enough, on second thought, that pretty much encompassed Intrepid, Merciless, Relentless, and Loyal. Plus, it had the underlying meaning of keeper of the booty, which was sort of a bonus in a ship name, he thought. \"Yeah, that\u0027s a good name for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long before she gets here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two weeks. She\u0027s not fast. Twelve knots cruising. If we have somewhere to go, I\u0027ll send the ship directly there and meet it at a port along the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now that she\u0027s called the Clair, I hope they bring her in safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My ship,\" Clay said anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Nate said, \"You\u0027re what, in your nineties? A hundred?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look it, do I?\" Amy posed: a coquettish half curtsy with a Betty Boop bump at the end. Indeed, it would have been a spry move for a woman in her nineties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate was really glad he was sitting down, but he missed the sensation he would have had of needing to sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your whole attraction was based on my age, wasn\u0027t it?\" She sat across from him. \"You were working out your male menopause on the fantasy of my young body. Somehow you were going to try to recapture your youth. Once again you\u0027d feel like more than a footnote to humanity. You\u0027d be virile and vital and relevant and all alpha male, just because a younger\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; and decidedly luscious, I might add\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; woman had chosen you, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nuh-uh,\" Nate said. She was wrong, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, Nate, were you on the debate team at Moose Dirt U? I mean, your talent\u0026nbsp; - \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sasketchewan in the Sticks,\" he corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the age thing? It\u0027s a problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re like a hundred. My grandma isn\u0027t even a hundred, and she\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not really that old.\" She grinned and reached across the table, took his hand. \"It\u0027s okay, Nate. I\u0027m not Amelia Earhart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not?\" Nate felt his lungs expand, as if a steel band around his chest had broken. He\u0027d been taking tiny yip breaths, but now oxygen was returning to his brain. Funny, he was pretty sure that none of the other women he\u0027d been with had been Amelia Earhart either, but he didn\u0027t remember feeling quite so relieved about it before. \"Well, I should have known. I mean, you don\u0027t look anything like the pictures. No goggles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just messin\u0027 with you. I\u0027m her daughter. Ha!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it! This isn\u0027t funny, Amy. If you\u0027re trying to make a point, you\u0027ve made it. Yes, you\u0027re an attractive young woman, and maybe your youth\u0027s a part of why I\u0027m attracted to you, but that\u0027s just biology. You can\u0027t blame me for that. I didn\u0027t make a move on you, I didn\u0027t harass you when we were working together. I treated you exactly as I would have treated any research assistant, except maybe you got away with more because I liked you. You can\u0027t ridicule me for responding to you sexually down here when you came on to me. The rules had changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not ridiculing you. Amelia Earhart really is my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to meet her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate searched her face for signs of a grin or a tremble in her throat that might indicate the rise of an Amy Ha! Nothing there, just that little bit of sweetness that she usually tried to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So somehow, living down here, you haven\u0027t aged. Your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We age, but not like on the surface. I was born in 1940. I\u0027m about the same number of years older than you than you were older than me a half hour ago\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; kinda sorta. You going to dump me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s so hard to believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, after you\u0027ve seen all this? You\u0027ve seen what the Goo can do. Why is it so hard to believe that I\u0027m sixty-four?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, for one, you\u0027re so immature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up. I\u0027m young at heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But for a second there I was so sure we were doomed.\" Nate rubbed his temples\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; trying to stretch them, maybe\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; to make his head bigger to hold the whole concept of Amy\u0027s being sixty-four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s okay, we just haven\u0027t gotten to that yet. We\u0027re still doomed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, thank goodness,\" Nate said. \"I was worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, after they had pushed the world away for a while, made love and napped in each other\u0027s arms, Amy made a move to start another round, and Nate awoke to an immediate and uncertain anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we really doomed?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, goddamn it Nate!\" She was straddling him, so she was able to get a good windup before thumping him hard in the chest with her fist. \"That\u0027s just un-fucking-professional!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate thought about how the praying mantis female will sometimes bite off the male\u0027s head during copulation and how the male\u0027s body continues to mate until the act is finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled off him and stared up at dim strips of green luminescence on the ceiling. \"It\u0027s okay. I didn\u0027t mean to bite your head off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we\u0027re probably doomed. We\u0027re doomed for the same reason that I look the way I do, that most of the Goos look much younger than we really are. Turn a gene on, you age; turn it off, you don\u0027t. I\u0027ve even seen some people down here who seem to get younger. Flip a switch, pancreatic cancer at age twenty-two; flip another, you can smoke four packs a day and live to be a hundred. If the Goo thinks that the human race is a danger to it, it just has to flip a switch, pick a gene, make a virus, and the human race would blink out. I hadn\u0027t really thought about it as a threat before. My whole life I\u0027ve worked for the Goo. Service, you know? It takes care of us. It\u0027s the source.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know what to say. Did he need to actually take the Colonel\u0027s request for help seriously? Did he need to help find a way to kill this amazing creature in order to save his own species? \"Amy, I don\u0027t know what to do. Two days ago I just wanted to get out of here. Now? The Colonel and you both said I was lucky to be alive. Has the Goo killed people who were close to finding out about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly, I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve never seen it or heard of it happening, but I\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; we\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; each just do our own part down here. We don\u0027t ask a lot of questions. Not because we\u0027re told not to or anything\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; it\u0027s just that you can live a long time without asking yourself big questions when your needs are looked after.\" For the first time Nate could see the experience of years in Amy\u0027s face, marked not by wrinkles but by a shadow in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m asking,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I think the Goo is ethically capable of killing the human race?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even know if the Goo has ethics, Nate. According to the Colonel, it\u0027s just a vehicle for genes and we\u0027re just vehicles for memes and nature says that a head-on collision is inevitable. What if it\u0027s not? This battle has supposedly gone on for millions of years, and now the Colonel wants to force an endgame? What I do know is that you\u0027ve got to talk him out of trying to kill it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s your leader.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but he didn\u0027t tell any of us about this. I think he\u0027s doubting his own judgment. So am I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said that it could kill everyone on the planet at the flick of a switch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" She rolled over and propped herself up on her elbow. \"You hungry? I\u0027m hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fluke-or-i-know-why-the-winged-whale-sings/page-17.html","bookId":2050,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:48 PM"}
