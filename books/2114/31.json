His hands molded me to him, circling on my back, in the tendrils of my hair at my neck. I knew the lassitude that possessed me. I\u0027d met it with Ric. Postcoital stupor. But this had been only a kiss. Hadn\u0027t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took advantage. He shifted again until my lax lips became a bezel for his erect nipple. I gritted my teeth. Not reciprocal. Never reciprocal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was so sleepy. So very sated...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd by now, my body was mindlessly stimulated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally stirred, my arms struggling to push him away. His chest rumbled against me, under me. His heartbeat was steady, strong, and rhythmic. Heartbeat. Proof he was not a vampire, although some post-Millennium Revelation vamps could be a different breed abiding by different characteristics and rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut my eyes. He pressed my head against him, his hand tangled in my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distant part of my mind I\u0027d deadened for this dreaded moment noted that I was still sleepwalking like a zombie succubus, or some recently killed creature whose nerves and muscles still twitched with counterfeit life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed somehow uncontrolled as well. He loosened his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head until I seemed to hear something rattle inside and reared away, pulling my gown shut, pulling my mind and will together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d suffered the Brimstone Kiss. For ages longer than the most frantic mosh-pit groupie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I had not climaxed, not even once, and especially not many times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood! For once it wasn\u0027t Irma talking in my head, only me. Loud and clear. Go suck yourself, Snow! I\u0027m done! It\u0027s over. I fulfilled my part of the bargain and I bet you didn\u0027t even get off yourself. Too bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrdinarily, my invisible inner friend Irma would be this spitting mad on my behalf, but I\u0027d exiled her far inside. Not even she could witness my voluntary degradation. No one would know of this but Snow and myself, and that was two too many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had only hollow threats to offer, but the words came from my soft center, spit out hard. A mirrored threat. From me to him. I was good with mirrors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someday you\u0027ll beg to kiss me. Someday everything you value will be at risk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what will you do, then, Delilah?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something you won\u0027t like. And I\u0027ll use you as coldly as you used me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was drawing myself up in indignation, trying to banish a sickening wave of inner disgust at what my outer self had done, when I noticed that Snow was standing dazed himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunglasses were in his hand and he was putting them over eyes that were all glittering magenta facets again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Delilah,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould I believe this? What nerve!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d hoped you\u0027d be the one woman in the world who\u0027s impervious to the Brimstone Kiss. I\u0027d really hoped it was you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy righteous anger revived me, and my temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was me, right here and now. And I\u0027m here to testify that this rotten deal did not result in giving me one orgasm, stud. Not one. Zero, Mr. Multiple Answer to a Woman\u0027s Prayer. I did not come from your infamous Brimstone Kiss. You are a dud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe actually smiled. \"Your spirit is remarkably resilient. A good thing. We have a man to free from a nexus of vampires. Would you rather do it naked? Without the services of your familiar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word \"naked\" scorched me; the word \"familiar\" also, but I now knew the artifact for shield and weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I stood there, gathering strength, trying to escape the strange, timeless bubble in which he could wrap himself at will, he held out his arms for me to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forearm-long silver cuffs called to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are yours, they said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I realized that I was...free... of the silver familiar. Free of Snow\u0027s unsuspected attachment. Of his lock-of-hair turned trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure I believed Snow in saying that it answered only to me, but it had even shielded me against its source tonight. It had saved my flesh if not my soul a few times earlier. I was used to its incursions, its presence, and its useful applications as a weapon of defense and aggression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it was of Snow. I wanted nothing of his to ever touch me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I could use it. Especially now. To save Ric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my recent state of mindless sexual thralldom was not the most humiliating moment of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat moment was still forthcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted both arms straight out. Let Snow\u0027s pallid fingers that had so recently twined in my hair touch my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the silver familiar came weaving and quivering, warm and liquid and enthralling, over my skin, melding with me, arming me, perhaps disarming me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnow snapped his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grizelle, Miss Street needs clothes more suitable to stalking vampires. I need to change myself. Of course, as usual, we have no time whatsoever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to eye his security chief who\u0027d appeared from nowhere again. She must have seen me plastered half-naked to her master\u0027s body like a temple virgin, to which I was still way too close. I wanted to descend to the ninth circle of his ersatz Dante\u0027s Inferno and stay there for eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrizelle had no time for my sensitivities, but snapped shut her cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will require actual outfitting,\" she said, finally glancing my way, mightily imposed upon. \"Follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did, finally, understand the phrase \"mortified to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this wasn\u0027t about me and my pride or even my sanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrizelle led me to a cool, blue-lit room where she pulled black leather catsuits from a row of Ikea-looking white wood and glass cabinets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose you want to retreat to human-style privacy,\" she said, waving me to a room around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d made modesty sound like the refuge of the feeble-minded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dashed to the security of some privacy, letting my tarnished, once-loved vintage gown fall into an abused crumple at my feet. My slick thighs reminded me my body had responded if my mind and will hadn\u0027t. Then I thought of what Ric might have faced and be facing. That knocked me out of my self-pity party. He was my beloved, not some demonic manipulator, and he was worth any price I could pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tight pants zipped up the side and the leather was steel-studded everywhere to foil vampire teeth, but the creatures had supernatural strength that might allow them to tear your head off without a tooth touching you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo counter that, a ninja-style hood and neck-and-shoulder piece reminded me of what the older nuns at Our Lady of the Lake Convent wore despite modernization, a very medieval wimple, only here the same form was studded black leather instead of starched linen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, I suspected that nun-like starched linen might be the better defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed there naked while changing, imagining what those good, long-gone nuns would think of me right now...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn image of a bare female arm thrusting a sword out of a body of water was so vivid in my mind it almost knocked me over. Excelsior, a female voice-not Irma\u0027s-said. Not Excalibur. Excelsior. Onward. Upward. I guess that meant I couldn\u0027t sink any lower than I had earlier tonight. Even Irma was still AWOL. Her usual nervy, naughty advice wouldn\u0027t be welcome after an encounter like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. Joan of Arc had heard voices too and she didn\u0027t let that stop her. In fact, she let that start her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled on the thigh-high, flat-heeled boots that shielded my femoral arteries. My returned silver familiar assumed the likeness of steel mail for the second time in an hour, forming not a bustier but a protective vest up to my ears and down over my knuckles like the long, fingerless gloves prom-going girls in Loretta Cicereau\u0027s day would wear in pastel shades of lace. Nothing could easily breach my elbows and wrists, or the vulnerable neck where both carotid and heart-bound jugular came within almost kissing contact of each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing lacy about my protective armor except its amazingly light weight. I bounded around the corner, regrets shoved far away for pawing over later, thinking only of confronting the literal fiends who assuredly had Ric and who would assuredly do far more vicious things than kiss. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/brimstone-kiss-delilah-street-2/page-31.html","bookId":2114,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:55:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:55:35 PM"}
