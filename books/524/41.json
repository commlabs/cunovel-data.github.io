{"id":21292,"no":41,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"Bessie tinted the world for Robert like a sunrise. All through the day he carried memories of lightless woods, of fields hushed in the swale, of the smudge of her old purple cotton beside him—of, perhaps, some dim divine moment when his hand had touched hers hanging at her side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then winter came, with carol-singing, and the choristers tramped round, lantern-led, from farm to farm. There in the fluttering light outside Kitchenhour, Old Turk, Ellenwhorne, or Edzell, Robert would watch Bessie\u0027s chicory-flower eyes under her hood, while the steam of their breath mingled in the frosty air, and they drooped their heads together, singing to each other, only to each other, \"Good King Wenceslas,\" \"As Joseph was a-walking,\" or \"In the Fields with their Flocks.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As they were both simple souls, their love only made the words more real. Sometimes it seemed almost as if they could see up in the white glistering field behind the barn, the manger with the baby in it, the mother watching near, and the ox and the ass standing meekly beside them in the straw. Bessie said she felt sure that the shepherds watched their flocks by night in the little old meadow at the corner of Totease ... she once thought she had heard them singing. But she would not go and look.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the year climbed up again into spring, a tender pity for Bessie mingled with Robert\u0027s love. It was not the pity which begets love, but the sweeter kind which is begotten of it. Robert forgot all about his own hard life, the monotonous ruthless grind of work, the absence of all softness, homeliness, or sympathy, the denial of all gaiety and sport. He thought only of Bessie\u0027s troubles, and would have given the world to lighten[Pg 144] them. He longed to give her some little treat, or a present. But he had no money. For the first time he inwardly rebelled against the system which kept him penniless. None of the boys had any money, except Pete on Fair days—not even Albert, for the Rye Advertiser did not pay its poets. For the first time Robert saw this as unjust.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e March blew some warm twilights to Peasmarsh, and the choristers began their summer lingering. Bessie and Robert often took the longer way home by Ellenwhorne—he would not leave her now till they were at her cottage door, and often he would run home hare-footed from Eggs Hole, afraid that he might be shut out of Odiam, and perhaps his precious comradeship discovered and put under the tyrant\u0027s ban.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then came an evening in April, when the air smelled of primroses and young leaves. The choir practice was early, and rifts of sunshine sloped up the clerk\u0027s kitchen, linking in one golden slant Robert\u0027s dark healthy face just under the ceiling, Bessie\u0027s shoulders pressed against his arm, the frail old hands of Joe Hearsfield on his flute, and the warm plum-brown of the bass viol close to the floor. To Robert it was all a dream of holiness and harmony. Old Spodgram confined himself almost entirely to two notes, Miss Hubble insisted on her four bars of arrears, young Ditch extemporised an alto of surprising reediness, and Robert bellowed the last lines of the last verse just as the other choristers were loudly taking in breath preparatory to line three—but the whole thing was to him a foretaste of Paradise and the angels singing ever world without end.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the practice was over it was still light, and Robert and Bessie turned inevitably along the little bostal that trickles through the fields towards Ramstile. As usual they did not speak, but in each glowed the thought that they had a full two hours to live through together in the mystery of these sorrowless fields.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sun set as they came to Ellenwhorne. They stood and watched it dip behind the little cluster of roofs and oast-houses in the west. The turrets of the oasts stood out black against the crimson, then suddenly they purpled, faded into their background of night-washed cloud.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fields were very dark in their low corners, only their high sweeps shimmered in the ghostly lemon glow. Out of the rabbit-warrens along the hedges, from the rims of the woods, ran the rabbits to scuttle and play. Bessie and Robert saw the bob of their white tails through the dusk, and now and then a little long-eared shape.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The boy and girl were still silent. But in the consciousness each had of the other, kindled and spread a strange dear poignancy. They walked side by side through the dusk, now faintly cold. Dew began to tremble and shine on the grass, to pearl the brambles and glimmer on the twigs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert looked sideways at Bessie. She was colourless in the dark, or rather coloured all over with the same soft grey, which gathered up into itself the purple of her gown and the pale web of her hair. In her eyes was a quiver of starlight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Their feet splashed on the soaking grass, and suddenly Bessie stopped and lifted her shoe:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s justabout wet, Robby.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So it be—I shudn\u0027t have brought you through all this damp grass. We shud have gone by the lane, I reckon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no,\" she breathed, and her voice and the half-seen glimmer of her eyes troubled him strangely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lookee, I\u0027ll carry you—you mustn\u0027t git wet.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She opened her lips to protest, but the sound died on them, for he stooped and swept her up in his arms. She slipped her hand to his neck to steady herself, and they went forward again towards the south.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e Bessie was a sturdily built little person, but the weight of her was a rich delight, and if his arms strained, they strained with tenderness as well as with effort. Under them her frock crushed and gave out a fragrance of crumpled cotton, her hand was warm against his neck, and on his cheek tickled her soft hair. The shadows ran towards them from the corners of the field, slipping like ghosts over the grass, and one or two pale stars kindled before them, where the sky dropped into the woods.... An owl lifted his note of sadness, which wandered away over the fields to Ellenwhorne....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her young face bowed to his neck, and suddenly his lips crept round and lay against the coolness of her cheek. She did not move, and he still walked on, the grass splashing under his feet, the rabbits scampering round him, showing their little cotton-tails in the dark.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then his mouth stole downwards and groped for hers. Their lips fluttered together like moths. Then suddenly she put her arms round his neck, and strained his head to her, and kissed him and kissed him, with queer little sobs in her throat....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He still walked on through the deepening night and skipping rabbits. He never paused, just carried her and kissed her; and she kissed him, stroking his face with her hands—and all without a word.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At last they reached the lane by Eggs Hole Cottage, which with shimmering star-washed front looked towards the south. He stopped, and she slid to the ground. Then suddenly the words came.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, my liddle thing! My dear liddle thing ... my sweet liddle thing!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Robby, Robby....\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They kissed each other again and again, eagerly like children, but with the tears of men and women in their eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Robby ... I love you ... I love you so!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, you liddle thing!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e They were hungry ... their arms wound about each other and their faces pressed close, now cheek to cheek, now with lips fluttering together in those sweet kisses of youth which have so much of shyness in their passion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly a light kindled in the little house. Bessie slipped from him, and ran up the pathway into the dark gape of the door.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59413.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM"}
