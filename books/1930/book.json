Reeling from a profound loss, Tristan and Danika struggle to pick up the pieces and build a life together, but the hard habits of a lifetime are not so easy to escape. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eRock Bottom takes us on a dual point of view journey through addiction and desire, through love and agony, and answers the question we’ve been asking since these characters were introduced in Grounded: “What happened between Tristan and Danika?” \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eDANIKA \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eEven love couldn’t cushion a fall like ours. My love for Tristan was so big that I felt consumed by it, and even so, it was not enough to overpower our combined demons. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eI struggled. I yelled and screamed. I scratched and kicked. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eI fought like hell, but even the most determined fighters have to stop before they break. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eNo one could say I didn’t fight for him. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e“I love you,” I spoke softly into his ear. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eHe gripped me harder. “I can’t ever lose you, Danika. I’m not sure I’d survive it.” \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e“You’ve got me. And I’m not going anywhere. Not ever.” \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eI meant the words when I said them, but life had other plans for us. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eI’d have given my life for that fight. In fact, I very nearly did. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eTRISTAN \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eShe was the one. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIf I’d ever had a doubt, I didn’t now. She was the one I’d be thinking about, longing for, until I took my last breath. If I lost her tomorrow, I’d pine for her like a lovesick fool. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThis was the kind of love that only hit you once in your life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/rock-bottom-tristan-danika-2.jpg","author":"R.K.
