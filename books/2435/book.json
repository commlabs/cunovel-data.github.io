{"id":2435,"title":"The Forbidden Game: The Chase (The Forbidden Game #2)","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eJenny and her friends are dealing with the aftermath of the events of the first book. No one believes them about their friend\u0027s death and the paper house is still missing. When they finally find the paper house it is ripped to shreds and they don\u0027t know if Julian was released or not. All is soon reveled and they begin a new deadly game where Jenny\u0027s friends are disappearing one by one. This book wasn\u0027t nearly as good as the first one. The first half of the book is pretty dull. The action does pick up but it\u0027s barley enough to make up for the first half. I did like how we got to know the characters better but I didn\u0027t like how little Julian there was. The book kind of struck me as a filler book but I\u0027m sure the last in the series will be much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-forbidden-game-the-chase-the-forbidden-game-2.jpg","author":"L.J.
