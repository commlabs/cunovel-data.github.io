It was a curtain now closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara gazed at the people of a rival kingdom, now shut out from hers and gave a shaky sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb Hart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master of Death. It was time to restore the dead of her sphere to their proper resting place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied Queen Clara as everything was put into its rightful place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes met mine then traveled to Jade\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth to speak but I answered her unspoken question, \"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and with a silent command, the dead of Clara\u0027s kingdom followed me Outside to rest once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the Band stoke the blazing fire with the bits and pieces of zombie royalty and had an aching joy bleed into my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d totally needed to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked toward the heat of the fire, my hand shielding my face from the intense warmth, the smell was the most disgusting I\u0027d ever been around, my eyes instantly watered in reaction, my nostril hairs protesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess that happened when you burned dead bodies, they smelled rank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will this stop them?\" Daniel asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. I didn\u0027t think anyone could raise a headless corpse, or resurrect something from ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod help us if there were, I shuddered at the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Queen Clara. Her eyes shone with unshed tears as she gazed at the flames that licked the remains of those that\u0027d been the worst of this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn insane Prince and Queen, bent on abusing everyone in their path. But their main focus had been Clara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze shifted to the zombies that restrained the Zondorae brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI instructed my dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! You can\u0027t do this! You can\u0027t use these corpses to keep us here!\" Joe yelled, trying to wrench himself free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whirled around as I stalked toward them, the zombies clutching the brothers tighter in response to the automatic rage that leaked out of me. When I was so close I could have kissed them, I stabbed a finger into the chest of the brother with the biggest mouth. \"You\u0027re the one that screwed this six ways to Sunday. You created us by using them. Now your pet projects are taking over and you\u0027re pissed?\" I yelled in his face, the force of my voice hurting my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, what he said!\" Jonesy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Jonesy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw up his hands. \"Chillax, dude. Let\u0027s get the hell outta Dodge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave the zombies their final instructions while the remaining dead poured back into the wounded and frozen ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe watched as the ice slid over the graves, hiding them again until they would be small hills of earth when the spring\u0027s warmth returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Queen approached me and offered her hand. I took it, shaking it gently and releasing it. A ghost of a smile appeared on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were supposed to kiss her hand,\" John said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you want to do this?\" I returned, just as quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn shook his head. \"No, you\u0027re boss this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my back on the Js, looking at Queen Clara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are well met, young Traveler,\" Clara said as I studied her, memorizing her. My gaze shifted to all the strong men who stood behind her, gills of pink flesh ribbons twined around thick necks, eyes different colors but with the same look in each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoyalty and protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Clara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one that stood at her back had the bluest eyes I\u0027d ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the most unflinching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara came forward and reaching up, cupped her hand on my cheek. I made a little sound of surprise, her tender touch caused me to respond in kind and I wrapped her small hand as it lay against my face. Our hands pressed together for a moment and she stunned me with her words... the expression on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAimed at me, its solidarity rooted me to the spot more than anything could have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You honor your world this day. I thank you for saving all that we are.\" Her hand slipped out of mine and I felt the loss of it like fresh grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood that royalty was different than birthright, it was a trueness in character, a desire to do the right thing at any cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was reminded of my reason for being here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Queen Clara.\" I crept backward, our gazes locked as I joined the others, Randi in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandi was ready. Ready to cast the net of her power for the return to our world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew\u0027s large hand held Clara\u0027s small one, his chin clearing the top of her head with ease, those blue eyes trained on mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will we ever see you again, young Traveler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb,\" I corrected softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen Clara inclined her head slightly in acknowledgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadness crossed her features briefly then vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I bid you good fortune, Caleb Hart,\" Clara said, her face a mix of grateful sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bittersweet feeling tightened inside of me. Later, when I was older than Gramps, I would recognize it as nostalgia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn answered for him, \"I think Caleb makes his own fortune, Queen Clara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel translated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, we are more alike than you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my sad smile transform into a grin. The most unlikely of allies, from two separate worlds, a common goal for both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing all that we were for the good of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw her watch us as we slipped out of their world, a wash of brilliant kaleidoscopic colors coalesced into a searing brightness which blinded, a constellation of fallen stars, eight in all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeparted forever from her world, Queen Clara\u0027s solemn face never left my memory, my lifetime altered because of our acquaintance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, Hart, that was completely weird!\" Alex said, his hands on his knees, while he stooped over, trying not to puke up a lung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t feeling that special myself as I looked around at my friends. Most of their heads were hanging but a few looked almost perky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Randi was doing the best because she was using a natural ability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, unnatural if you figured in the evolutionary leap that had been forced on us by the Graysheet\u0027s interference. Just thinking about all that they\u0027d done and how they\u0027d made it happen got me just as pissed as I could be. I helped Jade up and her hair swung forward in a black curtain in front of her face. I pulled the chunk that stood in front of her vision and tucked it behind her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked green. \"Ugh!\" Jade covered her mouth and I watched as she struggled to clamp down on her nausea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, \"I think it\u0027s some sort of extreme motion sickness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vertigo?\" Archer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah,\" Alex said. He gave us serious eyes, \"I saw those dick holes jab each other with serum or some crap after they fell out of their Interference Pathway.\" He looked at us and it started to come together for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. It makes them sick and they were shooting themselves up with the counter,\" I assessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia crossed her arms, her hands trembling as she did. \"This is not a pulsegame, Caleb. Plain speak please,\" she said, still polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess girls didn\u0027t dig gaming talk. You had a skill and there was always a way to counter said skill. Duh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. I looked at her. \"The deal is, the...\" I looked at the girls and tempered my language, a little, \"scientists,\" I said with keen derision, \"are just regular guys.\" My eyes met theirs and they nodded. \"So, the pathway must shift their shit around, and when they come back together, their bodies are all misplaced.\" I thought of my dad and added, \"At the molecular level, even.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn rolled his eyes at my explanation but it was simplified for the mouth-breather challenges I might encounter. Like Jonesy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut surprisingly, he was on board. \"So they use some crap that neutralizes the effects of the transport?\" His eyebrows rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and John made a low noise in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounded like surprise to my well-trained ears. I had grunts and non-articulated verbiage down to a damn science. Hell, I was male, I was born to understand that. That females couldn\u0027t understand all that and they were supposed to be communicators? A mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade scowled at my thought processes, which had slid right to her from our clasped hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried not to laugh and got the crooked mouth instead. I had made that a contagion in my group, I thought with perverse pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Tiff asked, seeing the private joke as it formed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade flicked her eyes to mine, the color gradually returning to her sallow complexion. \"I think Caleb was wondering why girls don\u0027t understand caveman speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. Actually, that was not totally it, but....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, ya morons,\" Tiff said, another bubble collapsing the oxygen in the small space of the hideaway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course she did. It was almost a cheat, with the five brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie uncovered her ears and glared at Tiff, who smiled back. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a \u0027skill\u0027,\" Sophie said, air quoting with her crimson fingernails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" Bry began, deflecting a cat fight with ease, \"they get sick so... it\u0027s bad news for me.\" He jabbed a finger in his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, he was a mundane. He just got his atoms or whatever rearranged and now he was gonna croak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry saw my face fall and got fear on the edges of his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandi shook her head. \"No, I think my power, whether we traveled the dimensional highway or not...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Negated,\" John prompted and she nodded at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Canceled out the sickness problem.\" Her eyes met Bry\u0027s and he exhaled in a relieved expulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God,\" he muttered, his hand stroking his chest like his heart was going to fall out of his ribcage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chill, you\u0027re fine, Weller,\" Jonesy said, crushing his second lollipop and grinding the sweet sugared crystals with his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie smiled. \"If we\u0027re alive then everything is okay with you, right Jonesy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her in a puzzled way. \"Well, yeah. Why wouldn\u0027t it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys looked at the chicks and felt the weight of the difference in the sexes descend, the barrier there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe smiled at each other, the boys on target and the girls confused about our willingness to brave the unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled as we straggled out of the hideaway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe felt like we\u0027d accomplished something that day. The memory of helping a world that wasn\u0027t our own, stranding the scientists in the middle of the shit they\u0027d started, it was an accomplishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, that just meant that Parker and the Graysheets were going to duel. They\u0027d eventually find out about his involvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, as Gramps would say, it was coming full circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was going to bite me in the ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStory of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunlight winked off my windshield, temporarily blinding me. It speared my eyes as I slowed beside the curb of Jade\u0027s foster family\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew before I pushed the shifter into park that Howie would be there, gunning to give me shit again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was painful in his regularity. It was almost like taking a crap, it happened every day. But he was like constipation or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA turd to be flushed down the porcelain goddess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swept out of the car, the morning biting at my heels a little, autumn had come and with it, that familiar crispness. I gazed up at the sky, the summer hanging on even as fall deepened the blue unmercifully, the sky went on forever in the month of October. I tore my gaze away, clamping down on my daydreamer tendencies with an effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weekend was here and the whole pack of us were headin\u0027 out to Gramps, The Parents too. Gramps was my house for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnyx had transitioned right into living with Gramps. Sometimes, like the traitor he was, he\u0027d even sleep at the foot of Gramps\u0027 bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the crooked stoop where Jade lived and saw her descend the steps, Howie barking at her heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what I saw anyway, a well-trained guard dog on a leash it didn\u0027t like, sniffing for trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was here to deliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee how that shit worked out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d rounded the back end of the Camaro before I even knew it, bouncing up on the curb and striding to where Jade was walking, her high heeled boots clicking on the cracked cement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrazier saw me coming and smiled evilly. The asshat knew I had to watch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe probation wasn\u0027t up yet. If I used the dead, they\u0027d lock me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he said next slowed my step. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-weeps-death-5/page-19.html","bookId":2493,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM"}
