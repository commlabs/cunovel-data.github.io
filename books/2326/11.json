{"id":63361,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\u003cp\u003eI thought about Connie. Prostitution isn\u0027t necessarily a bad life, not at the level she and Elaine had practiced it, with East Side apartments and an executive clientele. But she had taken her shot at a much better life, and she\u0027d been living it in the house in Walnut Hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it ended. And Jesus, the way that it endedâ€¦\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever happens at all happens as it should. Maybe it would be nice to reach the point where I found that true, but I wasn\u0027t there yet. Perhaps I just wasn\u0027t watching narrowly enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got my wake-up call in the morning and checked out after breakfast. At eight sharp I gave my name to the desk officer. He had been told to expect me, and sent me back to Havlicek\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wearing a gray suit this morning, and another striped tie, this one red and navy. He came out from behind his desk to shake hands and asked me if I\u0027d had coffee. I said I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we might as well go see Doc Wohlmuth,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose there are older buildings in Massillon, but in my short time there everything I saw looked to have been built within the past ten years. The hospital was new, its walls bright with fresh pastel shades, its floors antiseptically clean. The pathology department was in the basement. We rode down in a silent elevator and walked the length of a hallway. Havlicek knew the route and I tagged along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know why, but I expected Doc Wohlmuth to be a cantankerous old bastard a few years past retirement age. He turned out to be around thirty-five, with a mop of streaky blond hair and a receding chin and an open boyish face off a Norman Rockwell cover. He shook hands when Havlicek introduced me, then stood there gamely through a round of the badinage cops and pathologists visit upon one another. When Havlicek asked him if he\u0027d found traces of semen or any other evidence of recent sexual activity upon the corpse of Cornelia Sturdevant, he didn\u0027t mind showing that the question came as a surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hell,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t know I was supposed to look for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a possibility the case is more complicated than it looked at first,\" I said. \"Do you have the body on hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you check?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see why not. She\u0027s not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was halfway to the door when I remembered my conversation with Elaine. \"Check for anal as well as vaginal entry,\" I suggested. He stopped in mid-stride, but he didn\u0027t turn around so I don\u0027t know what showed on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will do,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom Havlicek and I sat around waiting for him. Wohlmuth had some family snapshots in a lucite cube on his desk. That inspired Tom to tell me that Harvey Wohlmuth had himself a real sweetheart of a wife. I admired her photograph, and he asked me if I was a family man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to be,\" I said. \"The marriage didn\u0027t last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a long time ago. She\u0027s remarried, and my boys are pretty much grown. One\u0027s in school and the other\u0027s in the service.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have much contact with them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as much as I\u0027d like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a stopper, and the silence hung for a moment before he picked up the ball and talked about his own children, a girl and a boy, both of them in high school. We moved from family to police work, and then we were just a pair of old cops telling stories. We were still at it when Wohlmuth returned, an owlish expression on his face, to tell us that he\u0027d found semen traces in Mrs. Sturdevant\u0027s anus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you called that,\" Havlicek said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWohlmuth said he hadn\u0027t expected to find anything. \"There was no evidence of struggle,\" he said. \"Nothing. No skin particles under her nails, no bruises on her hands or forearms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHavlicek wanted to know if he could type the sperm and prove that it was or wasn\u0027t Sturdevant\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might be possible,\" Wohlmuth said. \"I\u0027m not sure, with all the time that\u0027s gone by. We can\u0027t do it here, I can tell you that much. What I want to do is send slides and specimens and tissue samples to Booth Memorial in Cleveland. They can do a workup beyond what we\u0027re capable of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be interested in the results.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So will I,\" Wohlmuth said. I asked if there\u0027d been anything else remarkable about the body. He said she appeared to be in good health, which has always struck me as a curious thing to say about a dead person. I asked if he\u0027d spotted any contusions, especially around the rib cage or the thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHavlicek said, \"I don\u0027t get it, Matt. What would bruises there indicate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Motley had a lot of strength in his hands,\" I said. \"He liked to use his fingers on a spot on the rib cage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWohlmuth said he hadn\u0027t noticed anything out of the ordinary in that respect, but that bruises weren\u0027t always that pronounced if the victim died shortly after the injury was inflicted. The injured area didn\u0027t discolor a day later in the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you could have a look for yourself,\" he offered. \"You want to come see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t really, but I dutifully followed him down a hall and through a door into a room as cold as a meat locker, and with a not entirely dissimilar odor to it. He led me to a table where a body lay beneath a sheet of translucent plastic and drew the sheet aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Connie, all right. I don\u0027t know that I\u0027d have recognized her alive, let alone dead, but knowing who she was I was able to see the girl I\u0027d met a few times a dozen years ago. I felt a sickness deep in my gut, not nausea so much as a deep acidic sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to look for contusions, but it was hard for me to violate her nakedness with my eyes, and impossible to lay hands on her. Wohlmuth had no such compunctions, and a good thing, given the line of work he was in. Without ceremony he shunted a breast aside and palpated the sides of the rib cage, and his fingers found something. \"Right here,\" he said. \"See?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t see anything. He took my hand and guided my fingers to a spot. She was cold to the touch, of course, and there was a flaccidity to her flesh. I could see what he\u0027d found; there was a spot where the flesh was softer, less resilient. There wasn\u0027t much in the way of discoloration, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you said the inside of the thigh? Let\u0027s have a look. Hmmm. Here\u0027s something. I don\u0027t know if it would be a particularly sensitive pressure point for pain. Not an area I\u0027ve got much expertise in. But there\u0027s been some trauma here. You want to see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. I was unwilling to look between her parted thighs, let alone touch her. I didn\u0027t want to see any more, didn\u0027t want to be in that room any longer. Havlicek evidently felt the same way, and Wohlmuth sensed it and led us back to his office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere he said, \"I, uh, checked the children for semen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ!\" Havlicek said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t find any,\" Wohlmuth added quickly. \"I thought I ought to check, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw the stab wounds, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027d have been hard to miss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" He hesitated. \"Well, they were all inflicted from the front. Three stab wounds between the ribs and into the heart, and any one of them would have done it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he do, sodomize her and then roll her over and kill her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find her? Lying on her back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHavlicek frowned, summoning the memory. \"On her back,\" he said. \"She\u0027d slid down off the foot of the bed. Stabbed through the nightgown, and it covered her to her knees. Maybe that semen was from much earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way to tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or later,\" I suggested. They looked at me. \"Try it this way. She\u0027s on her back in bed and he stabs her. Then he rolls her over onto her stomach, lifts her nightgown, and pulls her halfway off the bed so he can get at her better. He sodomizes and turns her over and pulls her nightgown down, and in the process she slides the rest of the way off the bed. Then he goes into the bathroom to wash up and rinses the knife while he\u0027s at it. That would account for the evident lack of struggle, wouldn\u0027t it. They don\u0027t offer a whole lot of resistance when they\u0027re already dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Wohlmuth agreed. \"They don\u0027t insist on a whole lot of foreplay, either. I don\u0027t have any knowledge of the man you\u0027re talking about. Is that kind of behavior consistent with what you know about him? Because I don\u0027t think it\u0027s in conflict with the physical evidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of what he\u0027d said to Elaine, about dead girls being as good as live ones if you got them early on. \"It\u0027s consistent,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re talking about a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Jesus God,\" Tom Havlicek said. \"It wasn\u0027t Saint Francis of Assisi killed those kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"James Leo Motley,\" Havlicek said. \"Tell me about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know about his priors and what he went away for. What else do you want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forty or forty-one. He was twenty-eight when I arrested him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got a photo of him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I could probably dig up a photo but it would be twelve years old.\" I described Motley as I remember him, his height and build, his facial features, his haircut. \"But I don\u0027t know if he still looks like that. His face wouldn\u0027t have changed much, not with the kind of strong features he had. But he could have gained or lost weight in prison, and he might not still have the haircut. As far as that goes, he could have lost the hair. It\u0027s been a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some prisons will photograph a prisoner at the time of his release.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s policy at Dannemora or not. I\u0027ll have to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where they had him? At Dannemora?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where he finished up. He started at Attica, but after a couple of years they transferred him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Attica \u0027s where they had the riot, isn\u0027t it? But that would have been before his time. The years seem to go by faster and faster, don\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were having lunch at the Italian place he\u0027d recommended the night before. The food was good enough but the decor had a determinedly ethnic feel to it, and it came off like a stage set from one of the Godfather movies. Tom had turned down the waitress\u0027s suggestion of wine or a cocktail. \"I\u0027m not much of a drinker,\" he said to me, \"but you go right ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d said it was a little early for me. Now he apologized for having stranded me after we\u0027d left Wohlmuth. \"Hope you found things to keep you busy,\" he said. I told him I\u0027d had a chance to read the newspapers and walk around town a little. \"What I should have told you,\" he said, \"is we\u0027ve got the Pro Football Hall of Fame right off Seventy-seven in Canton. If you\u0027re any kind of a football fan, it\u0027s something you wouldn\u0027t want to miss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat got us onto football, and that carried us through to the coffee and cheesecake. Massillon, he said, was like Kansas during the Civil War, with brother against brother when it came to the Browns and the Bengals. And they both had good teams this year, and if Kosar stayed healthy both teams ought to make the playoffs, and that was about as much excitement as the town could be expected to handle. They\u0027d never face each other in the Super Bowl, not with both of them being in the same conference, but it was conceivable that they\u0027d be matched up for the conference championship, and wouldn\u0027t that be something? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-11.html","bookId":2326,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:56 AM"}
