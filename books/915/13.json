{"id":34894,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII AN INTERRUPTED EVENING","content":"The lustre of the victory over Hillbury rested on the quartette about forty-eight hours. Had Royce got beyond Benton on that last curve, as he had almost succeeded in doing, and Seaton\u0027s portion been defeat instead of victory, there would have been a cloud over the school for a much longer period. Owen, having never felt the change in atmosphere which defeat brings, did not appreciate his escape. The victory seemed an unimportant matter, taken lightly, soon forgotten. The school looked up, smiled, and went about its daily routine. Rob put his prize in his desk drawer, and followed the school\u0027s example.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One of his unconfessed ambitions had been to win a prize for composition. Wolcott Lindsay had put the idea into his head, not by any direct suggestion, but by the respect with which he spoke of some of the fellows who had succeeded. Lindsay himself was on the Seatonian, but Owen[Pg 123] felt no ambition to enter into competition before his schoolmates for a position on that paper. The composition was comparatively secret. If he tried and failed, nobody need know the fact but the judges who read the compositions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Owen\u0027s production on—let us not say what—was nearly ready to hand in. He had built no elaborate hopes upon it, but he would have liked sincerely to surprise his father with some achievement which Mr. Owen would value. Prowess in athletics was to Mr. Owen but superiority in play, often shared with the idle and the vicious. In scholarship Rob could never hope to rank above a low B; he had no gift for public speaking; no one ever urged him for office. In the composition, perhaps, he might win some place; it was at least worth trying.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was busy with this effort one evening after the rest of his work was done, when his attention was suddenly distracted by a hubbub which arose at that end of the corridor where lay the abiding-place of the Pecks. He knew they were both on study hours, Donald having just been put on along with French and Jacobson, as the result[Pg 124] of a series of petty and apparently accidental annoyances in poor Mr. Payne\u0027s recitation room. It was hardly conceivable, therefore, that the twins would have attempted any noisy demonstration on their own initiative. Owen remembered the plagues, and hastened forth to have a part in the spectacle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Others were also curious. He noticed, as he hurried past, that Payner\u0027s door was just ajar; and through the six-inch crack to which Smith cautiously limited the opening of his door, his lank, narrow-shouldered form was silhouetted against the light of the study lamp in the background, while curious eyes, doubly protected by glasses and a study shield, peered wonderingly forth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Owen knocked at the Pecks\u0027 door, but received no response. Instead came the sound of blows struck with some hard object, of running, jumping feet, and of heated exclamations, some inarticulate, some distinct but mysterious, mingled in rapid exchange. \"There he goes!\" \"Look out!\" \"I hit him then!\" \"Never touched him!\" \"Where is he?\" Then more whacks,[Pg 125] more jumps, and more exclamations. Rob pushed the door open a few inches, and perceived a Peck armed with a golf club sweeping it beneath the sofa. The wielder of the club seemed to be successful in his search, for he jumped suddenly back, smote the floor savagely with the brassey, and catching sight of a face peering in through the crack, shouted to his twin: \"Shut the door, can\u0027t you? Lock it!\" A command which was obeyed so promptly that had Owen\u0027s nose been longer, or his disposition more pushing, he must inevitably have suffered personal injury. While he stood irresolute, uncertain whether to accept the indignity as deserved, or threaten reprisal, he heard steps ascending the stairs with labored celerity, and the face of Dr. Mann, swollen with indignation, appeared at the corner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Owen, what is the meaning of this disturbance?\" the teacher demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know, sir,\" replied Rob. \"They seem to be hunting something in there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Mann knocked, but as one of the inmates was at that moment thrashing wildly at an object in a corner, and the other was vociferating advice[Pg 126] and encouragement, naturally no heed was given to the summons.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Open the door!\" commanded Dr. Mann. Still no answer. The noise of blows ceased. Favored by the lull, the teacher again lifted up a voice of sternness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is I, Dr. Mann. I demand that you open the door instantly!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At last he had made himself heard. \"Coming, sir!\" shouted one within, and the door was thrown open. Dr. Mann strode in, followed by Owen. Duncan was mopping up ink on the floor with a towel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will you be good enough to explain this outrageous disturbance!\" began the teacher. \"Why is it that I am compelled to come up here to secure for my guests below the privilege of ordinary peace and quiet? And you are both on study hours!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rob turned abruptly away and grinned discreetly at the Indian\u0027s head over the fireplace. Those guests made the case doubly hard for the rioters. Dr. Mann could not allow his colleagues to suppose that he was accustomed to put up with[Pg 127] such disorder. The ill-starred Pecks were evidently up against it!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e rat\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s the rat, sir,\" said Duncan.—Page 127.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027re very sorry, sir, that you were disturbed,\" Donald was saying, \"but it really wasn\u0027t our fault. Some one threw a live rat in at the door and we\u0027ve been hunting it. We didn\u0027t mean to make any disturbance.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Incredible!\" exclaimed Dr. Mann.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s the rat, sir,\" said Duncan, holding up by the tail the unfortunate cause of all the trouble. \"You can see it yourself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Mann could see it. There was unquestionably a dead rat; and the ink spilled on the floor, the jar knocked from the mantel, the disordered furniture, scattered books, and the excited faces of the boys attested the fact that the poor animal had not been an expected guest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who could have played such a contemptible trick!\" exclaimed the teacher, in disgust. \"Did you see who threw it in?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, we were studying at the desk, and some one opened the door so quietly we didn\u0027t notice it, and chucked the thing right at us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Strange!\" mused Dr. Mann. Strange, in[Pg 128]deed! Yet after all not so strange to one who possessed the key. Rob held rolled in his hand a slip of paper which he had taken from the floor during the discussion. He glanced at it furtively as he stood listening, and smiled an involuntary and promptly extinguished smile as he read the expected legend, \"The Third Plague.\" Even Dr. Mann might have formed a fairly accurate suspicion if he had considered the manner of the twins. Here was no wondering indignation, no loud invective against an unknown perpetrator, but the sullen bitterness of those who nourish a personal spite. But Dr. Mann, learned in ancient lore, had but slight knowledge of boys.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can\u0027t understand it,\" he said at length. \"The matter must be looked into. It shows a sad misunderstanding of the Seaton spirit. One of you will please carry the animal to some proper place, and then perhaps we may have quiet again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Duncan volunteered for this duty, and Dr. Mann and Owen retired. The latter reappeared, however, as soon as he heard Duncan\u0027s step on the stairs, in order to deliver the paper which he had secured.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 129]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, you had it!\" exclaimed Duncan, as he read the label. \"I thought it must be somewhere. Seven more! Gee whiz! I don\u0027t believe I can stand it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027d better come to terms with him,\" said Owen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wish we could,\" sighed Duncan, \"but Don\u0027s got his back up and he will never give in. This living in perpetual fear of your life is wearing. I always pull my bed to pieces every night to make sure there isn\u0027t anything there, and I never can get it together tight again. Go and see him, won\u0027t you, and see what he says.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Owen grinned. The prospect of acting as intermediary pleased him. \"All right,\" he said cheerfully. \"What terms do you offer?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"None,\" replied Duncan. \"Just sound him and get his terms. And don\u0027t say we sent you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Duncan returned to his room and Owen knocked at Payner\u0027s door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who\u0027s there?\" demanded the cautious inmate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Owen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 130]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Any one with you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The door was unlocked to admit Rob, the catch being immediately snapped behind him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Fraid of burglars?\" asked Rob, facetiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Fraid of something, sure enough,\" replied Payner, quietly. \"You can\u0027t be any too careful in this place.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Payner, how long are you going to keep this thing up?\" asked Rob, coming with most undiplomatic directness straight to his point.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What up?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, all this plague business,—eels and guinea pigs and rats.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Payner snickered. \"Did they send you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, they didn\u0027t. That is, not really and officially. I\u0027m just making inquiries in the general interest of peace.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Payner sniffed. \"What business is it of yours?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Owen hesitated. \"Oh, I\u0027d like to help both sides. I don\u0027t want to see either suffer.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m not suffering, I can tell you that. I didn\u0027t begin this thing, and I\u0027m not going to cry[Pg 131] baby. Those fellows attacked me without any kind of provocation, sneaked into my room, ripped it up, and damaged a lot of valuable specimens. If they\u0027ve had enough, the least they can do is to come here and apologize and promise to behave.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And you\u0027ll agree to apologize, too?\" asked the mediator.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Apologize nothing! I\u0027ll tell \u0027em what I\u0027ll do, when they come.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Feeling somewhat humble over the failure of his mission, and at the same time more or less persuaded of the justice of Payner\u0027s cause, Owen returned to Number 7 and called the Pecks to the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Apologize!\" cried Donald, when Owen finished his report; \"apologize for having eels put in your bed and rats thrown at you? Never!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We did begin it,\" observed Duncan, in a less violent tone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We didn\u0027t; he began it,\" returned Donald. \"Didn\u0027t he butt in about the Moons\u0027 room?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Owen turned away in annoyance. \"Do as you please,\" he said, \"but you\u0027re fools not to patch up with him some way.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 132]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rob sat down at his desk, less disposed to find excuse for the Pecks than ever before. \"It\u0027s that pig-headed Donald that causes the trouble,\" he was thinking. \"Duncan would settle the thing right off, but he\u0027s scared of his brother;\" and while his mind was rebelliously following the affairs of the Pecks, and refusing to apply itself on the composition, a knock was heard at the door, and the unfinished work was again shoved into a drawer out of sight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hello, Ned!\" cried Owen, looking up in surprise as Carle appeared. \"Glad to see you,\" he added cordially; \"sit down.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His first impression at sight of Carle\u0027s serious face was that the pitcher had reconsidered the interview of last week and come to make amends. Otherwise I am afraid his greeting would have been less cordial.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is your room-mate in?\" Carle asked, looking toward the bedroom door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s getting his Greek with a fellow downstairs. Do you want him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I want you. Can you lend me twenty dollars?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 133]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rob knew that he had not twenty dollars on hand, or half that sum, but instead of saying so, he answered by a question:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What for?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve got to have twenty to settle with a man before to-morrow morning. If I don\u0027t ante up he\u0027s going to see Graham, and I\u0027ll be fired sure.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m short,\" said Owen, wondering what this trouble was about. \"I might let you have five.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That isn\u0027t enough,\" replied Carle, evidently disappointed, turning toward the door. \"I\u0027ve got to have twenty anyway. I\u0027ll try some one else. Good night.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And before Owen had time for further questions, the door closed behind his visitor, and Rob was left alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now more time was wasted in considering Carle\u0027s case, and guessing at the cause of his urgent need. The composition at last came out, but not until Simmons had returned with his Greek books under his arm, and the lessons for the morning packed away in complete order in his little brain. Presently another knock was heard, and the literary work was definitely abandoned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 134]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hello, Owen,\" said Poole, rushing in. \"Can I see you a minute?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Simmons obligingly retired to his bedroom, and Poole began:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve just been talking with Mr. Lovering about Carle. He says the faculty are very much dissatisfied with him and he\u0027s very likely to lose his scholarship. I heard yesterday that he owed a lot of different fellows. What are we going to do about it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Owen shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t do anything with him. His father wrote me last week, asking me to talk with Ned. I tried it, but it didn\u0027t amount to anything.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But we must do something,\" persisted Poole. \"A good pitcher is half the nine, and we haven\u0027t any one else within sight of him. I don\u0027t believe O\u0027Connell will come to anything.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But Patterson will,\" was on Owen\u0027s lips. He checked the words, however, before they were uttered, and said instead: \"Carle was here just before you came in, trying to borrow some money. He said he must have twenty dollars before tomorrow morning. I couldn\u0027t lend him anything.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 135]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where did he go?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"After some one who could get him the money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And he\u0027s on study hours. What a fool!\" cried Poole, as he clapped on his hat and started for the door. \"He acts as if he\u0027d set his heart on getting fired. Good night!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Owen echoed the salutation with emphasis, and got himself ready for bed. It was depressing to spend so much time on other people\u0027s affairs, and yet be of no apparent use. Then he bethought himself of Patterson, and felt better. There was one fellow who took his advice!\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1912/54992.html","bookId":915,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 5:59:50 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 5:59:50 AM"}
