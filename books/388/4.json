AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Dr. Crawford stopped short, and eyed Gilbert attentively. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t know you,” he said, in a querulous tone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am a schoolmate of your son, Carl. My name is Gilbert Vance.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you have come to see my son you will be disappointed. He has treated me in a shameful manner. He left home yesterday morning, and I don’t know where he is.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can tell you, sir. He is staying—for a day or two—at my father’s house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where is that?” asked Dr. Crawford, his manner showing that he was confused.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In Warren, thirteen miles from here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know the town. What induced him to go to your house? Have you encouraged him to leave home?” inquired Dr. Crawford, with a look of displeasure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir. It was only by chance that I met him a mile from our home. I induced him to stay overnight.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Did you bring me any message from him?” “No, sir, except that he is going to strike out for himself, as he thinks his home an unhappy one.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is his own fault. He has had enough to eat and enough to wear. He has had as comfortable a home as yourself.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t doubt that, but he complains that his stepmother is continually finding fault with him, and scolding him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He provokes her to do it. He is a headstrong, obstinate boy.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He never had that reputation at school, sir. We all liked him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose you mean to imply that I am in fault?” said the doctor, warmly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t think you know how badly Mrs. Crawford treats Carl, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course, of course. That is always said of a stepmother.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not always, sir. I have a stepmother myself, and no own mother could treat me better.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are probably a better boy.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can’t accept the compliment. I hope you’ll excuse me saying it, Dr. Crawford, but if my stepmother treated me as Carl says Mrs. Crawford treats him I wouldn’t stay in the house another day.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Really, this is very annoying,” said Dr. Crawford, irritably. “Have you come here from Warren to say this?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir, not entirely.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps Carl wants me to receive him back. I will do so if he promises to obey his stepmother.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That he won’t do, I am sure.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then what is the object of your visit?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To say that Carl wants and intends to earn his own living. But it is hard for a boy of his age, who has never worked, to earn enough at first to pay for his board and clothes. He asks, or, rather, I ask for him, that you will allow him a small sum, say three or four dollars a week, which is considerably less than he must cost you at home, for a time until he gets on his feet.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t know,” said Dr. Crawford, in a vacillating tone. “I don’t think Mrs. Crawford would approve this.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It seems to me you are the one to decide, as Carl is your own son. Peter must cost you a good deal more.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you know Peter?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have met him,” answered Gilbert, with a slight smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t know what to say. You may be right. Peter does cost me more.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And Carl is entitled to be treated as well as he.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think I ought to speak to Mrs. Crawford about it. And, by the way, I nearly forgot to say that she charges Carl with taking money from her bureau drawer before he went away. It was a large sum, too—twenty-five dollars.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is false!” exclaimed Gilbert, indignantly. “I am surprised that you should believe such a thing of your own son.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mrs. Crawford says she has proof,” said the doctor, hesitating.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then what has he done with the money? I know that he has but thirty-seven cents with him at this time, and he only left home yesterday. If the money has really been taken, I think I know who took it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Peter Cook. He looks mean enough for anything.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What right have you to speak so of Peter?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Because I caught him stoning a cat this morning. He would have killed the poor thing if I had not interfered. I consider that worse than taking money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I—I don’t know what to say. I can’t agree to anything till I have spoken with Mrs. Crawford. Did you say that Carl had but thirty seven cents?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir; I presume you don’t want him to starve?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, of course not. He is my son, though he has behaved badly. Here, give him that!” and Dr. Crawford drew a ten-dollar bill from his wallet, and handed it to Gilbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, sir. This money will be very useful. Besides, it will show Carl that his father is not wholly indifferent to him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course not. Who says that I am a bad father?” asked Dr. Crawford, peevishly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t think, sir, there would be any difficulty between you and Carl if you had not married again.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Carl has no right to vex Mrs. Crawford. Besides, he can’t agree with Peter.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is that his fault or Peter’s?” asked Gilbert, significantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am not acquainted with the circumstances, but Mrs. Crawford says that Carl is always bullying Peter.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He never bullied anyone at school.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is there anything, else you want?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir; Carl only took away a little underclothing in a gripsack. He would like his woolen clothes put in his trunk, and to have it sent——”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps it had better be sent to my house. There are one or two things in his room also that he asked me to get.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why didn’t he come himself?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Because he thought it would be unpleasant for him to meet Mrs. Crawford. They would be sure to quarrel.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, perhaps he is right,” said Dr. Crawford, with an air of relief. “About the allowance, I shall have to consult my wife. Will you come with me to the house?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir; I should like to have the matter settled to-day, so that Carl will know what to depend upon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gilbert rather dreaded the interview he was likely to have with Mrs. Crawford; but he was acting for Carl, and his feelings of friendship were strong.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So he walked beside Dr. Crawford till they reached the tasteful dwelling occupied as a residence by Carl and his father.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How happy Carl could be here, if he had a stepmother like mine,” Gilbert thought.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They went up to the front door, which was opened for them by a servant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Jane, is Mrs. Crawford in?” asked the doctor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir; not just now. She went to the village to do some shopping.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is Peter in?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then you will have to wait till they return.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Can’t I go up to Carl’s room and be packing his things?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, I think you may. I don’t think Mrs. Crawford would object.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good heavens! Hasn’t the man a mind of his own?” thought Gilbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Jane, you may show this young gentleman up to Master Carl’s room, and give him the key of his trunk. He is going to pack his clothes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When is Master Carl coming back?” asked Jane.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I—I don’t know. I think he will be away for a time.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish it was Peter instead of him,” said Jane, in a low voice, only audible to Gilbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She showed Gilbert the way upstairs, while the doctor went to his study.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Are you a friend of Master Carl’s?” asked Jane, as soon as they were alone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, Jane.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And where is he?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “At my house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is he goin’ to stay there?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For a short time. He wants to go out into the world and make his own living.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And no wonder—poor boy! It’s hard times he had here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Didn’t Mrs. Crawford treat him well?” asked Gilbert, with curiosity\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is it trate him well? She was a-jawin’ an’ a-jawin’ him from mornin’ till night. Ugh, but she’s an ugly cr’atur’!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How about Peter?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He’s just as bad—the m’anest bye I iver set eyes on. It would do me good to see him flogged.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She chatted a little longer with Gilbert, helping him to find Carl’s clothes, when suddenly a shrill voice was heard calling her from below.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Shure, it’s the madam!” said Jane, shrugging her shoulders. “I expect she’s in a temper;” and she rose from her knees and hurried downstairs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2963/81546.html","bookId":388,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 4:08:52 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 4:08:52 AM"}
