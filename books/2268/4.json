I\u0027ll bet she could tell I\u0027d been a junkie once upon a time.\" Andy sighed. \"Hey… you don\u0027t think, if Max knew about my past, that he\u0027d fire me, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. And who knows about Max\u0027s past, anyway?\" Nikki joked. Then she turned serious. \"Andy, you had a hard life, but you\u0027ve risen above it. Contessa gave you good advice. Watch out for anyone who might want to drag you down again. That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She warned me to watch out for strangers. Let me tell you, there were some damn strange people in my past, that\u0027s for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So leave them in the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well… sometimes I wonder if they\u0027ll come back to haunt me, no matter where I leave them.\" She hesitated. \"Did you ever smoke, Nikki?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smoke… you mean cigarettes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy laughed. \"Yes, I meant cigarettes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In high school and college. Then I quit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but were you ever really addicted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet. I went to a hypnotist, and I chewed the gum like crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They say cigarettes are the hardest addiction to break,\" Andy said. \"But you know how it is. You quit smoking—you may have given it up for years—but sometimes you\u0027ll see someone with a cigarette, and you just want one so badly you can barely stand it. But you know you can\u0027t have that one cigarette because you\u0027ll wind up with the addiction all over again, no matter what you tell yourself. Do you know what I\u0027m saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know I can\u0027t have one cigarette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like that with other stuff… Every once in a while, you think, man, I\u0027d love to have that high, just one more time. But you know you can\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not afraid you\u0027ll be tempted, are you?\" Nikki asked her, worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy shook her head. \"No. Because I know what could happen. And I\u0027ve seen far too many lives destroyed. I\u0027m straight as an arrow now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for you,\" Nikki said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I love my job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great. Hey!\" Nikki said suddenly. She lowered her voice. \"Speaking of drugs and addictions… look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s that guy again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one we saw today, at Madame D\u0027Orso\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy turned, looking across Conte. There was a crowd around the popular bar on the corner, which was supposedly haunted by a cool jazz guitarist. \"Where?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right there. Great. I gave him a twenty, and he used it to go drinking,\" Nikki said in disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see him,\" Andy said, craning her neck and frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There… right there.\" Nikki pointed. The man was there, staring straight at her. He still looked as if he longed to reach out, touch her… talk to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the crowd moved. People laughing, talking. A sad trumpet lament began to play. And he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, go figure. No more twenties to junkies, huh?\" Andy said. She walked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Nikki followed, trying to shake off the sudden chill that seemed to wash over her like ice from a not-so-distant past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA junkie, lying beneath one of the highway overpasses, nearly covered by newspapers and other debris, needle by his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetective Owen Massey and his partner had been called in after the patrol cops had cordoned off the scene. The ME had arrived, too, and agreed that this was just another life wasted, tragic but simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot dead too long. At least the poor sucker hadn\u0027t rotted and decayed like a misbegotten rat. By the ME\u0027s estimation, this particular John Doe had only been a goner for a matter of hours. Cause of death seemed obvious. Heroin overdose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly quitting time, and he was tired. He loved the French Quarter like he might his child, if he\u0027d ever had one. But there were days…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few more lines to fill in, and he could go home, he thought, sitting at his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey had nearly finished with the paperwork—not a homicide, death by misadventure—when his partner came striding across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold the presses,\" Marc Joulette said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got an ID?\" Massey asked. \"A match on the prints\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Tom Garfield. FBI. Under cover for the last three months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"FBI,\" Joulette repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey groaned, nearly letting his head fall on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be one hell of a long time before he\u0027d be going home that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The feds will be sending someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let his head crash to the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one noticed. A bunch of uniforms were heading out, talking as they went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey looked up, frowning. \"Politics,\" Joulette told him. \"Going to provide security for some rally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey arched both brows. Joulette shrugged. \"It\u0027s a hot race for that senate seat,\" he explained. \"I haven\u0027t seen this much activity in a coon\u0027s age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Politics. In Louisiana. There\u0027s a cesspool for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Joulette protested. \"There are a lot of good guys out there, trying to make a difference. Not to mention right here in the department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, Massey agreed. There were plenty of good men in the department. And he hated the fact that Louisiana politics had too often been on the shady side. It was a good state. He loved New Orleans with a passion. He shrugged. \"Problem is, no two guys seem to have the same opinion when it comes to what constitutes the greater good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we\u0027re not politicians. We\u0027re cops. And we\u0027ve got a dead fed on our hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Massey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Massey, Joulette.\" It was Robinson, a street cop who had spent some time in forensics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" Joulette asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Purse snatcher,\" Robinson said. Young and wiry, he was a good cop, capable of running down perps who were convinced they could outrun any of the parish\u0027s beignet-eaters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey cleared his throat. \"Um… wrong fellow to get after a purse snatcher,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobinson grinned. \"Hey, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you didn\u0027t run the guy down?\" Joulette asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw, I got the call too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So… ?\" Massey prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is just curious. Maybe nothing. But I thought that I\u0027d show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobinson produced the small sketchbook he\u0027d been carrying. He was a good artist, and the sketch he\u0027d produced appeared to be a likeness of Tom Garfield, their dead FBI agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Massey stared hard at the picture. \"What\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The woman whose purse was snatched told me that she never saw the man who swiped her bag, but she said she\u0027d seen a suspicious-looking down-and-outer right before it happened. On Bourbon Street. I asked her to describe the guy. And this is what I got. A picture of your corpse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robinson, you\u0027ve seen the pictures of Garfield. You just drew him \u0027cause those images were in your mind,\" Joulette said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The woman told me this was the guy she saw—to a T.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t have been. If this purse snatching just happened, Garfield was already dead,\" Massey said more gently. He liked Robinson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The woman swears up and down that this is who she saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So our fed is dead but snatching purses?\" Joulette scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027s got a look-alike running around the city, that\u0027s what I\u0027m suggesting,\" Robinson said. \"Who knows how or why, but it could mean something. I just thought you two should know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you show the boss?\" Massey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobinson nodded. \"Weird, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Massey told him. \"Hey, can I keep the sketch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make you a copy,\" Robinson assured him. \"The boss already has one.\" He gave Joulette an aggravated stare and moved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody\u0027s just got to get in on the act, huh?\" Joulette said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey shook his head. Robinson was a bright officer, and the sketch was disturbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was going to be a hell of a long night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent Blackhawk fought the dream, because he knew what the dream meant. But it was too strong for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst there was the mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was his grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he was back on the day when they had gone to the battlefield where Custer had made his last stand. Where the combined forces of many tribes had conquered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a child, he had seen them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been awful moments when he had felt sheer terror. He had seen the soldiers and the warriors. Heard the savage war cries. The shouts of the cavalry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cries for mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had seen the agony and fear, tasted the acrid scent of gunpowder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had kept silent, had not corrected the tour guide. It would be wrong for a little boy to correct his elders, even though he knew what they did not. He had listened to the tours; he had gone to the encampments. He had sat with his grandfather in a sweat lodge, and the old men and the younger ones had discussed how Custer\u0027s last stand had in reality been the last stand of the American Indian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater his grandfather had talked to him. He had known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" he had assured him. \"It\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it because I\u0027m a quarter Indian?\" he had asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his grandfather had taken him into his arms. \"Well, boy, I don\u0027t know. Your mom, now, she was what they called a truly lovely lass from the old country. And her people are known for being what they call a bit \u0027fey.\u0027 What matters is that you have a gift, and you have it for a reason. Perhaps in time you\u0027ll see that it\u0027s not frightening, and you\u0027ll know why it\u0027s been given to you. And that it\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, he still wondered when the \"good\" would kick in. He had learned to use it, just as a policeman learned to use his weapon. There were times when he knew that his help changed lives, even made them bearable again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-4.html","bookId":2268,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
