{"id":10292,"no":121,"title":"CHAPTER 121","content":"“You can speak to servants or hold your silence.”\u0026nbsp; “As you will,” Ser Alliser said, displeasure in every word. “I am sent to tell you that we found two rangers, long missing. They were dead, yet when we brought the corpses back to the Wall they rose again in the night. One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker, while the second tried to murder the Lord Commander.”\u0026nbsp; Distantly, Tyrion heard someone snigger. Does he mean to mock me with this folly? He shifted uneasily and glanced down at Varys, Littlefinger, and Pycelle, wondering if one of them had a role in this. A dwarf enjoyed at best a tenuous hold on dignity. Once the court and kingdom started to laugh at him, he was doomed. And yet... and yet...\u0026nbsp; Tyrion remembered a cold night under the stars when he’d stood beside the boy Jon Snow and a great white wolf atop the Wall at the end of the world, gazing out at the trackless dark beyond. He had felt-what? something, to be sure, a dread that had cut like that frigid northern wind. A wolf had howled off in the night, and the sound had sent a shiver through him.\u0026nbsp; Don’t be a fool, he told himself. A wolf, a wind, a dark forest, it meant nothing. And yet... He had come to have a liking for old Jeor Mormont during his time at Castle Black. “I trust that the Old Bear survived this attack?”\u0026nbsp; “He did.”\u0026nbsp; “And that your brothers killed these, ah, dead men?”\u0026nbsp; “we did...”\u0026nbsp; “You’re certain that they are dead this time?” Tyrion asked mildly. When Bronn choked on a snort of laughter, he knew how he must proceed. “Truly truly dead?”\u0026nbsp; “They were dead the first time,” Ser Alliser snapped. “Pale and cold, with black hands and feet. I brought Jared’s hand, torn from his corpse by the bastard’s wolf.”\u0026nbsp; Littlefinger stirred. “And where is this charming token?”\u0026nbsp; Ser Alliser frowned uncomfortably. “it... rotted to pieces while I waited, unheard. There’s naught left to show but bones.”\u0026nbsp; Titters echoed through the hall. “Lord Baelish,” Tyrion called down to Littlefinger, “buy our brave Ser Alliser a hundred spades to take back to the Wall with him.”\u0026nbsp; “Spades?” Ser Alliser narrowed his eyes suspiciously.\u0026nbsp; “If you bury your dead, they won’t come walking,” Tyrion told him, and the court laughed openly. “Spades will end your troubles, with some strong backs to wield them. Ser Jacelyn, see that the good brother has his pick of the city dungeons.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Ser Jacelyn Bywater said, “As you will, my lord, but the cells are near empty. Yoren took all the likely men.”\u0026nbsp; “Arrest some more, then,” Tyrion told him. “Or spread the word that there’s bread and turnips on the Wall, and they’ll go of their own accord.” The city had too many mouths to feed, and the Night’s Watch a perpetual need of men. At Tyrion’s signal, the herald cried an end, and the hall began to empty.\u0026nbsp; Ser Alliser Thorne was not so easily dismissed. He was waiting at the foot of the iron Throne when Tyrion descended. “Do you think I sailed all the way from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to be mocked by the likes of you?” he fumed, blocking the way. “This is no jape. I saw it with my own eyes. I tell you, the dead walk.”\u0026nbsp; “You should try to kill them more thoroughly.” Tyrion pushed past. Ser Alliser made to grab his sleeve, but Preston Greenfield thrust him back. “No closer, ser.”\u0026nbsp; Thorne knew better than to challenge a knight of the Kingsguard. “You are a fool, Imp,” he shouted at Tyrion’s back.\u0026nbsp; The dwarf turned to face him. “Me? Truly? Then why were they laughing at you, I wonder?” He smiled wanly. “You came for men, did you not?”\u0026nbsp; “The cold winds are rising. The Wall must be held.”\u0026nbsp; “And to hold it you need men, which I’ve given you... as you might have noted, if your ears heard anything but insults. Take them, thank me, and begone before I’m forced to take a crab fork to you again. Give my warm regards to Lord Mormont... and to Jon Snow as well.” Bronn seized Ser Alliser by the elbow and marched him forcefully from the hall.\u0026nbsp; Grand Maester Pycelle had already scuttled off, but Varys and Littlefinger had watched it all, start to finish. “I grow ever more admiring of you, my lord,” confessed the eunuch. “You appease the Stark boy with his father’s bones and strip your sister of her protectors in one swift stroke. You give that black brother the men he seeks, rid the city of some hungry mouths, yet make it all seem mockery so none may say that the dwarf fears snarks and grumkins. Oh, deftly done.”\u0026nbsp; Littlefinger stroked his beard. “Do you truly mean to send away all your guards, Lannister?”\u0026nbsp; “No, I mean to send away all my sister’s guards.”\u0026nbsp; “The queen will never allow that.”\u0026nbsp; “Oh, I think she may. I am her brother, and when you’ve known me longer, you’ll learn that I mean everything I say.”\u0026nbsp; “Even the lies?”\u0026nbsp; “Especially the lies. Lord Petyr, I sense that you are unhappy with me.”\u0026nbsp; “I love you as much as I ever have, my lord. Though I do not relish being played for a fool. If Myrcella weds Trystane Martell, she can scarcely wed Robert Arryn, can she?”\u0026nbsp; “Not without causing a great scandal,” he admitted. “I regret my little ruse, Lord Petyr, but when we spoke, I could not know the Dornishmen would accept my offer.”\u0026nbsp; Littlefinger was not appeased. “I do not like being lied to, my lord. Leave me out of your next deception.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Only if you’ll do the same for me, Tyrion thought, glancing at the dagger sheathed at Littlefinger’s hip. “If I have given offense, I am deeply sorry. All men know how much we love you, my lord. And how much we need you.”\u0026nbsp; “Try and remember that.” With that Littlefinger left them.\u0026nbsp; “Walk with me, Varys,” said Tyrion. They left through the king’s door behind the throne, the eunuch’s slippers whisking lightly over the stone.\u0026nbsp; “Lord Baelish has the truth of it, you know. The queen will never permit you to send away her guard.”\u0026nbsp; “She will. You’ll see to that.”\u0026nbsp; A smile flickered across Varys’s plump lips. “Will I?”\u0026nbsp; “Oh, for a certainty. You’ll tell her it is part of my scheme to free Jaime.”\u0026nbsp; Varys stroked a powdered cheek. “This would doubtless involve the four men your man Bronn searched for so diligently in all the low places of King’s Landing. A thief, a poisoner, a mummer, and a murderer.”\u0026nbsp; “Put them in crimson cloaks and lion helms, they’ll look no different from any other guardsmen. I searched for some time for a ruse that might get them into Riverrun before I thought to hide them in plain sight. They’ll ride in by the main gate, flying Lannister banners and escorting Lord Eddard’s bones.” He smiled crookedly. “Four men alone would be watched vigilantly. Four among a hundred can lose themselves. So I must send the true guardsmen as well as the false... as you’ll tell my sister.”\u0026nbsp; “And for the sake of her beloved brother, she will consent, despite her misgivings.” They made their way down a deserted colonnade. “Still, the loss of her red cloaks will surely make her uneasy.”\u0026nbsp; “I like her uneasy,” said Tyrion.\u0026nbsp; Ser Cleos Frey left that very afternoon, escorted by Vylarr and a hundred red-cloaked Lannister guardsmen. The men Robb Stark had sent joined them at the King’s Gate for the long ride west.\u0026nbsp; Tyrion found Timett dicing with his Burned Men in the barracks. “Come to my solar at midnight.” Timett gave him a hard one-eyed stare, a curt nod. He was not one for long speeches. That night he feasted with the Stone Crows and Moon Brothers in the Small Hall, though he shunned the wine for once. He wanted all his wits about him. “Shagga, what moon is this?”\u0026nbsp; Shagga’s frown was a fierce thing. “Black, I think.”\u0026nbsp; “In the west, they call that a traitor’s moon. Try not to get too drunk tonight, and see that your axe is sharp.”\u0026nbsp; “A Stone Crow’s axe is always sharp, and Shagga’s axes are sharpest of all. Once I cut off a man’s head, but he did not know it until he tried to brush his hair. Then it fell off.”\u0026nbsp; “Is that why you never brush yours?” The Stone Crows roared and stamped their feet, Shagga hooting loudest of all.\u0026nbsp; By midnight, the castle was silent and dark. Doubtless a few gold cloaks on the walls spied them leaving the Tower of the Hand, but no one raised a voice. He was the Hand of the King, and where he went was his own affair.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The thin wooden door split with a thunderous crack beneath the heel of Shagga’s boot. Pieces went flying inward, and Tyrion heard a woman’s gasp of fear. Shagga hacked the door apart with three great blows of his axe and kicked his way through the ruins. Timett followed, and then Tyrion, stepping gingerly over the splinters. The fire had burned down a few glowing embers, and shadows lay thick across the bedchamber. When Timett ripped the heavy curtains off the bed, the naked serving girl stared up with wide white eyes. “Please, my lords,” she pleaded, “don’t hurt me.” She cringed away from Shagga, flushed and fearful, trying to cover her charms with her hands and coming up a hand short.\u0026nbsp; “Go,” Tyrion told her. “It’s not you we want.”\u0026nbsp; “Shagga wants this woman.”\u0026nbsp; “Shagga wants every whore in this city of whores,” complained Timett son of Timett.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1522/45532.html","bookId":1301,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:58:55 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:58:55 AM"}
