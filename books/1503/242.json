I do not recognize you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe in-charge of the level, Wu Wenjie, seeing the confusion in Shangguan Bing’er’s eyes, actually revealed a look of realization before saying: “Yes, of course. Miss would not recognize us naturally. Since Miss is here to inspect the Pavilion, you can instruct us if you have any requirements, this subordinate will do his best to complete any tasks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er stepped closer to Zhou Weiqing, saying: “But… I really do not recognize you two!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Wenjie said respectfully: “Yes… yes… Of course Miss doesn’t recognize us. Uh, perhaps we have made a mistake. Since that is so, since you have already come to our Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, and this subordinate has been blind and rude, please take this plaque with you. With it, you can enter any of the levels. If you or your friend has anything you need, you can just take it directly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, he respectfully held out a gold plaque in both hands, holding it in front of Shangguan Bing’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gold plaque was embedded with ten gemstones of different sizes, shapes and colours, forming a ‘Consolidated’ word, and it seemed to give forth an aura of Heavenly Energy itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er was about to reject it, but Zhou Weiqing abruptly took the plaque on her behalf, giving her a meaningful look. Shangguan Bing’er could only say: “Thank you then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Wenjie said respectfully, with some trepidation: “No need, no need. It is this subordinate’s great honour to be able to serve you. I shall not disturb you any further and take my leave now, you can inform any of our staff if you have any requirements. Thank you.” After saying that, he bowed deeply towards Shangguan Bing’er again, before leaving with the middle aged man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at that valuable plaque in Zhou Weiqing’s hands, Shanguan Bing’er said in confusion: “What is going on? Why did they call me Young Miss [1. Honorific like ‘Young Master/ Young Miss]?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “I do not know either, that fast switch from arrogance to deference, they sure changed faces quickly. My guess is that they have recognized the wrong person… perhaps some important person in the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion looks like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er: “Then are we really going to use the plaque? Won’t that get us into trouble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said: “Of course we should use it, after all they gifted it to us, we did not steal or rob it. Even if we are found out, it is their mistake, not ours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er giggled and said: “They even said to let us take anything we want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing: “As for taking things, that would be too far, and if we’re found out that would truly cause trouble. We can go and have a look and expand our horizons, but we better not take anything; such advantages are not to be taken easily.” Although he had never thought himself to be a good person, but taking advantage of such situations so easily was not something he wanted to do. Furthermore, this was the ZhongTian Empire… it was better to play safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stairway from the first level to the second level was at the main hall, guarded by two white robed guards. Perhaps they had seen Wu Wenjie bowing politely to the two of them, as such they weren’t even stopped or asked for any identification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the two of them had ascended the stairs, only then did Wu Wenjie and the white robed man appear once more from the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white robed man said: “Manager, is that really Young Miss? I knew it, I had seen Young Miss once before, and with her looks, I couldn’t possibly be mistaken.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Wenjie’s dignified air returned as he said solemnly: “This time, you did very well. That is undoubtedly Young Miss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white robed man continued asking curiously: “But… why did Young Miss not admit it? She should definitely recognize you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Wenjie glanced at him and said: “You wouldn’t know this but that was probably Second Young Miss just now. Her character is lively and vivacious, mischievous even. Not even counting us here, even if it were on the Heavenly Jewel Island, even the Palace Masters have a headache dealing with her, known as their dear little demonic girl. I heard that her favourite game is to act out roles, who knows what she is acting as this time. The only thing I do not know is who that youth beside Second Young Miss is… for her to hold his hand, that is something I have never heard of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white robed man said respectfully: “Should we report this to the higher ups?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Wenjie glared at him and said: “Report what? Let alone you, I myself would be in deep trouble if we anger Second Young Miss. Although First Young Miss is rather cold, but she at least listens to reason. Second Young Miss wouldn’t care what our reasons were if she was angry. For you, today just never happened, understood?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white robed man started, staring blankly for a while before recovering, and he nodded quickly as he said: “I understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at that moment, from the entrance of the Pavilion, a young lady walked in. She was dressed in a white gown, with the sleeves and neck embroidered with purple-gold thread. Her hair was black, tied up neatly with a gold hair tie. Her expression was slightly cold as she walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the young lady walk in, both Wu Wenjie and the white robed man started, and Wu Wenjie waved his hand saying: “See? That is our First Young Miss, only she has noble grace and aura of a goddess. You head back first, I shall greet her.” The white robed man glanced once more at the young lady before rushing away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Wenjie straightened his clothes before walking forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young lady’s gaze was naturally drawn to Wu Wenjie who was walking towards her, and she stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter walking to about five yards from her, Wu Wenjie stopped as well, bowing down as he greeted: “Subordinate, First Floor Manager greets First Young Miss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young lady said passively: “No need to be so polite Manager Wu, I am just here to head to the fifth level to see if there are some materials I require. Please go ahead.” Her voice was emotionless, although it could not be said to be distancing, it sparked a pressure and respect instantly. Wu Wenjie nodded and bowed respectfully again. Just as the young lady was about to continue to head up the stairs, he quickly remembered something and said: “Oh, right, First Young Miss, Second Young Miss was just here as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” Hearing his words, signs of emotion appeared on her gentle face. “Second sis is here? Where is she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Wenjie said: “Second Young Miss went up the stairs with her companion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Understood.” The young lady said passively, before heading up the stairs, almost as if she were gliding like smoke from a fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er naturally did not know what happened below them. As they reached the second level and beyond, although there were guards, with the plaque from Wu Wenjie, they easily passed the guards to head upwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore long, they had reached the fourth level. As soon as they passed the third level to the fourth, the scene in front of them changed. The stairs of the first three floors were constructed of ordinary Stars Wood, but at the fourth level, it was made out of Purple Dawn Wood [2. 100 years Stars Wood, ie the Purple Dawn Bow]. At the entrance of the fourth level, a large screen blocked it, made out of a huge green jade, with carvings of mountains, rivers and animals upon it, giving a rather gentle imperssion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty, I am going to the toilet first, wait for me here.” Shangguan Bing’er said softly, a little shy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing released her hand and grinned, saying: “You take the plaque then, I’ll stand here and wait for you, and admire this jade screen while waiting for you.” The carvings on the jade screen gave him a strange feeling, as if each line was so natural, as if it were inborn and not carved by man. It was as if the entire carving was part of nature, and there was no sign or markings as if it had been done by the human hand. Zhou Weiqing had the strange feeling that these markings had something to do with Consolidating Equipment, and more so, held some strange similarities with the designs he had seen previously on his Legendary Consolidating Equipment Designs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er turned and left, while Zhou Weiqing continued standing there admiring the carving. The more he looked, the more he felt as if something was sparked in his heart, as if his Consolidating Equipment Master accumulated knowledge was being raised. This wasn’t something that could be described, but he knew in his heart that these lines were sparking a change in his understanding towards Consolidating Equipment and their designs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at that moment, Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt a strange coldness in his body, as if a block of ice was approaching him. Involuntarily, he turned back to look, and couldn’t help but start in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er was walking up the stairs, but she wasn’t wearing the Fei Li Battle Team uniform anymore, having changed to a set of beautiful white robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the accentuation from the white robes, Shangguan Bing’er looked like a beautiful white orchid rising from the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing did not think much, as a fire lit in his heart. Seeing that no one was around, he suddenly used the Blink skill, appearing right in front of Shangguan Bing’er, holding her in his embrace and kissing her soft red lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking slowly up the stairs, ‘Shangguan Bing’er’ was caught by surprise by this sudden ‘ambush’, and her entire body stiffened as she stared in shock, her eyes widened. Looking at Zhou Weiqing right in front of her, his eyes filled with fiery hot passion, it was as if her body had turned into an ice statue, frozen in place. At that moment, her mind blanked. From young, no male had ever done that to her. No one but her relatives had even gone near three yards of her, let alone hug and kiss her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-9-chapter-75-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-9-chapter-75-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-9-chapter-75-02","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
