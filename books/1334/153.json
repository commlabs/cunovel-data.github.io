And see! amid the blaze of banners, and the pawings of ten thousand thousand golden hoofs, day\u0027s mounted Sultan, Xerxes-like, moves on: the Dawn his standard, East and West his cymbals.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, morning life!\" cried Yoomy, with a Persian air; \"would that all time were a sunrise, and all life a youth.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah! but these striplings whimper of youth,\" said Mohi, caressing his braids, \"as if they wore this beard.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But natural, old man,\" said Babbalanja. \"We Mardians never seem young to ourselves; childhood is to youth what manhood is to age:—something to be looked back upon, with sorrow that it is past. But childhood reeks of no future, and knows no past; hence, its present passes in a vapor.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mohi, how\u0027s your appetite this morning?\" said Media.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thus, thus, ye gods,\" sighed Yoomy, \"is feeling ever scouted.

Bardianna was not at all proud; though he had a queer way of showing the absence of pride. In his essay, entitled,—\"On the Tendency to curl in Upper Lips,\" he thus discourses. \"We hear much of pride and its sinfulness in this Mardi wherein we dwell: whereas, I glory in being brimmed with it;—my sort of pride. In the presence of kings, lords, palm-trees, and all those who deem themselves taller than myself, I stand stiff as a pike, and will abate not one vertebra of my stature. But accounting no Mardian my superior, I account none my inferior; hence, with the social, I am ever ready to be sociable.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"An agrarian!\" said Media; \"no doubt he would have made the headsman the minister of equality.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"At bottom we are already equal, my honored lord,\" said Babbalanja, profoundly bowing—\"One way we all come into Mardi, and one way we withdraw.
