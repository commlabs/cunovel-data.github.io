The writer could leave himself unnamed (\"anonymous\"-from Greek words meaning \"no name\"), or else he could use a false name (\"pseudonym\"-from Greek words meaning \"false name\"). So common was the practice that a pseudonym is often referred to as a \"pen-name,\" or, to give it greater elegance by placing it in French, a \"nom de plume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a variety of reasons for this. In most places in the world and at most times, it was all too easy to write something that would get you in trouble. The corruption, venality, and cruelty of those in power cried out for exposure, and those in power had the strongest objections to being exposed. For that reason, writers had to expect all sorts of governmental correction if caught-anywhere from a fine to death by torture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best-known example of this type of pseudonym was Voltaire, the eighteenth century French satirist, whose real name was Francois-Marie Arouet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second major reason was that any nonscholarly writing was looked upon as rather frivolous, and a decent person guilty of concocting such material might well be looked upon askance by society, and considered as having lost caste. A pseudonym, therefore, preserved respectability. This was especially true of women who were widely considered subhuman in mentality (by men) and who would have shocked the world by a too-open demonstration of the possession of brains. Mary Ann Evans, therefore, wrote under the name of George Eliot, and Charlotte Bronte at first wrote under the name of Currer Bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne would think that neither reason would hold for the world of modern American science fiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy should anyone fear punishment for writing science fiction in our free land, or why should anyone fear the loss of respectability if convicted of the deed. And yet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is conceivable, particularly in the early days of magazine science fiction, that people in the more sensitive professions, such as teaching, would not have cared to have it known that they wrote \"pseudoscientific trash \" and so would protect themselves from lack of promotion, or outright dismissal, by the use of a pseudonym. I don\u0027t know of such cases definitely, but I suspect some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is even more likely that in the bad old days before the women\u0027s movement became strong, women who wrote science fiction concealed their sex from the readers (and even, sometimes, from the editors). Science fiction was thought to be a very masculine pursuit at the time and I know two editors (no names, please, even though both are now dead) who insisted on believing that women could not write good science fiction. Pseudonyms were therefore necessary if they were to sell anything at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, women did not have to use pseudonyms. Their first names might be epicene, and that would be protection enough. Thus, Leslie F. Stone and Leigh Brackett were women but, as far as one could tell from their names, they might be as masculine as Leslie Fiedler and Leigh Hunt. Editors and readers at first believed they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr women might simply convert names to initials. Could you tell that A. R. Long owned up to the name of Amelia, or that C. L. Moore was Catherine to her friends?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were other reasons for pseudonyms in science fiction. In the early days of the magazine many of the successful writers could only make a living by writing a great deal just as fast as they could, for a variety of pulp markets. They might use different names for different markets, creating separate personalities, so to speak, that wouldn\u0027t compete with each other. Thus Will Jenkins wrote for the slicks under his own name, but adopted the pseudonym Murray Leinster when he wrote science fiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, even within the single field of science fiction, particular writers wrote too many stories. They were so good that editors would cheerfully buy, let us say, eighteen stories from them in a particular year in which they only published twelve issues of their magazines. This meant (if you work out the arithmetic carefully) that it would be necessary to run more than one story by them in a single issue now and then, and editors generally have a prejudice against that. Readers would feel they were cheated of variety, or suspect that editors were showing undue favoritism, or who knows what. Therefore some of the stories would be put under a pseudonym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pseudonyms might be transparent enough. For instance, Robert A. Heinlein at the height of his magazine popularity wrote half his stories under the name of Anson MacDonald, but Bob\u0027s middle initial A. stood for Anson, and MacDonald was the maiden name of his then-wife. Similarly, L. Ron Hubbard wrote under the name of Rene Lafayette, but the initial L. in Hubbard\u0027s name was Lafayette, and Rene was a not-too-distant version of Ron. Still, as long as the readers were led to believe that not too many stories of one author were included in the inventory, all was well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, an author is so identified with a particular type of story, that when he writes another type of story, he doesn\u0027t want to confuse the reader by false associations-so he adopts a new name. Thus, John w. Campbell was a writer of super-science stories of cosmic scope, and one day he wrote a story called \"Twilight\" which was altogether different. He put it under the name of Don A. Stuart (his then- wife\u0027s maiden name was Dona Stuart, you see) and rapidly made that name even more popular than his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, an author simply wants to separate his writing activities from his nonwriting activities, if they are of equal importance to him. Thus, a talented teacher at Milton Academy, who is named Harry C. Stubbs, writes under the name of Hal Clement. He\u0027s not hiding. Hal is short for Harry, as all Shakespearian devotees know, and the C. in his full name stands for Clement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, my dear wife has practiced medicine for over thirty years as Janet Jeppson, M.D. As a writer she prefers J. O. Jeppson. The earnings fall into two different slots as far as the I.R.S. is concerned and that makes it convenient for her bookkeeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my own case, I have eschewed pseudonyms almost entirely; I am far too fond of my own name, and far too proud of my writing to want to sail under false colors for an y reason. And yet, in one or two cases...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus in 1951, I was persuaded to write a juvenile science fiction novel in the hope that it would be sold as the beginning of a long-lived television series. (Those were early days, and no one understood how television was going to work.) I objected, very correctly I think, that TV might ruin the stuff and make me ashamed of having my name associated with it. My editor said, \"Then use a pseudonym.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did, plucking Paul French out of the air for the purpose, and eventually wrote six novels under that name. (Some people, with little knowledge of science fiction, assumed from this that all my SF was written under Paul French, a suggestion that simply horrified me.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as it was clear that TV was not interested in my juveniles, I dropped all pretense, and made use of the Three Laws of Robotics, for instance, which was a dead giveaway. Eventually, when it was time for new printings, I had my own name put upon it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, in 1942, I wrote a short story for an editor who wanted it done under a pseudonym in order to give the impression that it was bya brand-new author. (The reason is complicated and I won\u0027t bore you with it. You\u0027ll find it in my autobiography.) I wrote it, reluctantly, under the name George E. Dale, but eventually included it in my book The Early Asimov as a story of my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, in 1942, I sold a story to the magazine Super Science stories which printed it under the pseudonym H. B. Ogden, for reasons I no longer remember. (Even my memory has its limits.) So little did I care for the story, and so unhappy was lover the nonuse of my name that I totally forgot about it, until nearly forty years later when I was going over my diary carefully in order to prepare my autobiography.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was shocked to find there was a story of mine that I had forgotten and didn\u0027t own in printed form. Fortunately, with the help of Forrest 1. Ackerman I got the issue and reprinted the story in the first volume of my autobiography, In Memory Yet Green, acknowledging it as my own. In 1971, I was persuaded to write a book entitled The Sensuous Dirty Old Man, in which I gently satirized sexual how-to books such as The Sensuous Woman. Since the latter book was written by a writer identified only as \"1,\" my editor felt the joke should be carried on by having my book written by \"Dr. A.\" Even before publication day, however, it was announced that I was the author and my identity was never a secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the present moment, then, absolutely none of my writing appears under anything but my own name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings up one puzzle. The early pulps occasionally made use of \"house names.\" A particular magazine would use a pseudonym that was never used except in that magazine, but that pseudonym might be used by any number of different writers. I have never really understood why this was done and if any reader knows I would appreciate being told. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gold-the-final-science-fiction-collection/page-50.html","bookId":1733,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:11 AM"}
