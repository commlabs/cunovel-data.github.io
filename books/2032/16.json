Several vows, in fact, about using the Powers he sensed within himself, and about how to treat the weak, blundering, but still-human creatures around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was going to break them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he\u0027d thought, the surge of Power had passed over Bonnie and Meredith and followed him, but it had receded again, and was now drawn back, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t let it wait long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnencumbered by the burden of Elena\u0027s body, he broke into a predator\u0027s lope on the empty road. The freezing sleet and wind didn\u0027t bother him much. His hunter\u0027s senses pierced through them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned them all to the task of locating the prey he wanted. No thinking of Elena now. Later, when this was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler and his friends were still in the Quonset hut. Good. They never knew what was coming as the window burst into flying glass shards and the storm blew inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan meant to kill when he seized Tyler by the neck and sank his fangs in. That had been one of his rules, not to kill, and he wanted to break it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut another of the toughs came at him before he had quite drained Tyler of blood. The guy wasn\u0027t trying to protect his fallen leader, only to escape. It was his bad luck that his route took him across Stefan\u0027s path. Stefan flipped him to the ground and tapped the new vein eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hot coppery taste revived him, warmed him, flowed through him like fire. It made him want more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower. Life. They had it; he needed it. With the glorious rush of strength that came with what he\u0027d already drunk, he stunned them easily. Then he moved from one to another, drinking deep and throwing them away. It was like popping tops on a six-pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was on the last when he saw Caroline huddling in the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth was dripping as he raised his head to look at her. Those green eyes, usually so narrow, showed white all around like those of a terrified horse. Her lips were pale blurs as she gabbled soundless pleas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled her to her feet by the green sashes at her waist. She was moaning, her eyes rolling up in their sockets. He wound his hand in her auburn hair to position the exposed throat where he wanted it. His head reared back to strike - and Caroline screamed and went limp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped her. He\u0027d had enough anyway. He was bursting with blood, like an overfed tick. He had never felt so strong, so charged with elemental power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was time for Damon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went out of the Quonset hut the same way he\u0027d come in. But not in human form. A hunting falcon soared out the window and wheeled into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new shape was wonderful. Strong... and cruel. And its eyes were sharp. It took him where he wanted, skimming over the oak trees of the woods. He was looking for a particular clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan ripped bloody strips out of his arms and heard Damon\u0027s answering scream of pain and anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not your weak little brother any more. He sent the thought down to Damon on a stunning blast of Power.And this time I\u0027ve come for your blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the backwash of hatred from Damon, but the voice in his mind was mocking.So this is the thanks I get for saving you and your betrothed ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan\u0027s wings folded and he dived again, his whole world narrowed to one objective. Killing. He went for Damon\u0027s eyes, and the stick Damon had picked up whistled past his new body. His talons tore into Damon\u0027s cheek and Damon\u0027s blood ran. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou shouldn\u0027t have left me alive, he told Damon.You should have killed both of us at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be glad to correct the mistake! Damon had been unprepared before, but now Stefan could feel his drawing Power, arming himself, standing ready.But first you might tell me whom I\u0027m supposed to have killed this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe falcon\u0027s brain could not deal with the riot of emotions the taunting question called up. Screaming wordlessly, it plummeted on Damon again, but this time the heavy stick struck home. Injured, one wing hanging, the falcon dropped behind Damon\u0027s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan changed to his own form at once, scarcely feeling the pain of his broken arm. Before Damon could turn, he grabbed him, the fingers of his good hand digging into his brother\u0027s neck and spinning him around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he spoke, it was almost gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena,\" he said, whispered, and went for Damon\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dark, and very cold, and someone was hurt. Someone needed help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was terribly tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena\u0027s eyelids fluttered and opened and that took care of the darkness. As for the cold... she was bone-cold, freezing, chilled to the marrow. And no wonder; there was ice all over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere, deep down, she knew it was more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had happened? She\u0027d been at home, asleep - no, this was Founders\u0027 Day. She\u0027d been in the cafeteria, on the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone\u0027s face had looked funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too much to cope with; she couldn\u0027t think. Disembodied faces floated before her eyes, fragments And so tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter go back to sleep then. The ice wasn\u0027t really that bad. She started to lie down, and then the cries came to her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard them, not with her ears, but with her mind. Cries of anger and of pain. Someone was very unhappy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat quite still, trying to sort it all out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a quiver of movement at the edge of her vision. A squirrel. She could smell it, which was strange because she\u0027d never smelled a squirrel before. It stared at her with one bright black eye and then it scampered up the willow tree. Elena realized she\u0027d made a grab for it only when she came up empty with her fingernails digging into bark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that was ridiculous. What onearth did she want a squirrel for? She puzzled over it for a minute, then lay back down, exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cries were still going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to cover her ears, but that did nothing to block them out. Someone was hurt, and unhappy, and fighting. That was it. There was a fight going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right. She\u0027d figured it out. Now she could sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t, though. The cries beckoned to her, drew her toward them. She felt an irresistible need to follow them to their source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndthen she could go to sleep. After she saw... him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes, it was coming back now. She rememberedhim. He was the one who understood her, who\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eloved her. He was the one she wanted to be with forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face appeared out of the mists in her mind. She considered it lovingly. All right, then. Forhim she would get up and walk through this ridiculous sleet until she found the proper clearing. Until she could join him. Then they\u0027d be together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very thought of him seemed to warm her. There was a fire inside him that few people could see. She saw it, though. It was like the fire inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to be having some sort of trouble at the moment. At least, there was a lot of shouting. She was close enough to hear it with her ears as well as her mind now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, beyond that grandfather oak tree. That was where the noise was coming from. He was there, with his black, fathomless eyes, and his secret smile. And he needed her help. She would help him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking ice crystals out of her hair, Elena stepped into the clearing in the wood. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-struggle-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-16.html","bookId":2032,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:24:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:24:47 PM"}
