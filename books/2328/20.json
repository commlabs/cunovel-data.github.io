I\u0027ll tell you, you can\u0027t turn around these days without trampling all over the penal law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you think it\u0027s worth it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they\u0027re just kids.

I have a feeling I could have talked them into doing the job for free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By appealing to their better nature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And their desire to be in on something exciting.

But I couldn\u0027t find anybody who\u0027d admit what I wanted was technologically possible. Why not give it to the Kongs? It\u0027s not my money, and Kenan Khoury says you can always afford to be generous.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-20.html","bookId":2328,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM"}
