Arc de Triomphe to the Bois de Boulogne, it had ornamental gardens on both sides flanked by inner roads giving access to the palatial houses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber 84 was an elegant residence with a broad staircase leading to five stories of charming rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gestapo had turned it into a house of torture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter sat in a perfectly proportioned drawing room, stared at the intricately decorated ceiling for a moment, then closed his eyes, preparing himself for the interrogation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to sharpen his wits and at the same time numb his feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome men enjoyed torturing prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Becker in Reims was one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey smiled when their victims screamed, they got erections as they inflicted wounds, and they experienced orgasms during their victims\u0027 death throes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they were not good interrogators, for they focused on pain rather than information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best torturers were men such as Dieter who loathed the process from the bottom of their hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he imagined himself closing doors in his soul, shutting his emotions away in cupboards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of the two women as pieces of machinery that would disgorge information as soon as he figured out how to switch them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a familiar coldness settle over him like a blanket of snow, and he knew he was ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring the older one,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Hesse went to fetch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her carefully as she came in and sat in the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had short hair and broad shoulders and wore a man-tailored suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer right hand hung limply, and she was supporting the swollen forearm with her left hand: Dieter had broken her wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was obviously in pain, her face pale and gleaming with sweat, but her lips were set in a line of grim determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke to her in French.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything that happens in this room is under your control,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The decisions you make, the things you say, will either cause you unbearable pain or bring you relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is entirely up to you.\" She said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was scared, but she did not panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to be difficult to break, he could tell already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"To begin with, tell me where the London headquarters of the Special Operations Executive is located.\" \"Eighty-one Regent Street,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me explain something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize that SOE teaches its agents not to remain silent under questioning but to give false answers that will be difficult to check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I know this, I will ask you many questions to which I already know the answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis way I will know whether you are lying to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere is the London headquarters?\" \"Carlton House Terrace.\" He walked across to her and slapped her face as hard as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cried out in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cheek turned an angry red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was often useful to begin with a slap in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain was minimal, but the blow was a humiliating demonstration of the helplessness of the prisoner, and it quickly sapped their initial bravery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she looked defiantly at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that how German officers treat ladies?\" She had a haughty manner, and she spoke French with the accent of the upper classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was some kind of aristocrat, he guessed, \"Ladies?\" he said scornfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have just shot and killed two policemen who were going about their lawful business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecht\u0027s young wife is now a widow, and Rolfe\u0027s parents have lost their only child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re not a soldier in uniform, you have no excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer to your question-no, this is not how we treat ladies, it\u0027s how we treat murderers.\" She looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had scored a hit with that remark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was beginning to undermine her moral foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me something else,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How well do you know Flick Clairet?\" Her eyes widened in an involuntary expression of surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat told him he had guessed correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two were part of Major Clairet\u0027s team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had shaken her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she recovered her composure and said, \"I don\u0027t know anyone of that name.\" He reached down and knocked her left hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cried out in pain as her broken wrist lost its support and sagged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her right hand and jerked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why were you having dinner at the Ritz, for God\u0027s sake?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe repeated the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught her breath and said, \"I like the food there.\" She was even tougher than he had thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take her away,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring the other one.\" The younger girl was quite pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had put up no resistance when arrested, so she still looked presentable, her dress unruffled and her makeup intact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe appeared much more frightened than her colleague.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked her the question he had asked the older one: \"Why were you having dinner at the Ritz?\" \"I\u0027ve always wanted to go there,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hardly believe his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weren\u0027t you afraid it might be dangerous?\" \"I thought Diana would look after me.\" So the other one\u0027s name was Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your name?\" \"Maude.\" This was suspiciously easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what are you doing in France, Maude?\" \"We were supposed to blow something up.\" \"What?\" \"I don\u0027t remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould it have something to do with railways?\" Dieter began to wonder whether he was being led up the garden path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you known Felicity Clairet?\" he tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mean flick? Only a few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s awfully bossy.\" A thought crossed her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was right, though-we shouldn\u0027t have gone to the Ritz.\" She began to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never meant to do anything wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just wanted to have a good time and see places, that\u0027s all I\u0027ve ever wanted.\" \"What\u0027s your team\u0027s code name?\" \"The Blackbirds,\" she said in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio message to Helicopter had referred to them as Jackdaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" \"Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s because of some poem, \u0027The Blackbird of Reims,\u0027 I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, \u0027The Jackdaw of Reims,\u0027 that\u0027s it.\" If she was not completely stupid, she was doing a very good imitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you think Flick is now?\" Maude thought for a long moment, then said, \"I really don\u0027t know.\" Dieter sighed in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne prisoner was too tough to talk, the other too stupid to know anything useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was going to take longer than he had hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere might be a way of shortening the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was curious about the relationship between these two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy had the dominant, mannish older woman risked her life to take the pretty, empty-headed girl to dinner at the Ritz? Perhaps I\u0027ve got a dirty mind, he said to himself But still...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take her away,\" he said in German.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put her in with the other one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake sure the room has a judas.\" When they had been locked away, Lieutenant Hesse showed Dieter to a small room in the attic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked through a peephole into the room next door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women were sitting side by side on the edge of the narrow bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaude was crying and Diana was comforting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter watched carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s broken right wrist rested in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her left hand she stroked Maude\u0027s hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was talking in a low voice, but Dieter could not hear the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow close a relationship was this? Were they comrades in arms, bosom friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eor more? Diana leaned forward and kissed Maude\u0027s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat did not mean much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Diana put a forefinger on Maude\u0027s chin, turned the girl\u0027s face to her own, and kissed her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a gesture of comfort, but surely too intimate for a mere friend? Finally Diana poked out the tip of her tongue and licked Maude\u0027s tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made up Dieter\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not foreplay-no one could have sex in such circumstances-but it was the kind of comfort that would be offered only by a lover, not by a mere friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana and Maude were lesbians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that solved the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring the older one again,\" he said, and he returned to the interview room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Diana was brought in the second time, he had her tied to the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he said, \"Prepare the electrical machinery.\" He waited impatiently while the electric shock machine was rolled in on its trolley and plugged to a socket in the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery minute that passed was taking Flick Clairet farther away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen everything was ready, he seized Diana by the hair with his left hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding her head still, he attached two crocodile clips to her lower lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned the power on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left it on for ten seconds, then switched off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her sobbing began to ease he said, \"That was less than half power.\" It was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had rarely used full power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly when the torture had gone on a long time, and the prisoner kept passing out, was full power used in an effort to penetrate the subject\u0027s fading consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd by then it was generally too late, for madness was setting in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Diana did not know that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not again,\" she begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, please, not again.\" \"Are you willing to answer my questions?\" She groaned, but she did not say yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter said, \"Bring the other one.\" Diana gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Hesse brought Maude in and tied her to a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" Maude cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana said, \"Don\u0027t say anything-it\u0027s better.\" Maude was wearing a light summer blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a neat, trim figure with full breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter tore her blouse open, sending the buttons flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please!\" Maude said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you anything!\" Under her blouse she wore a cotton chemise with a lacy trim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took hold of the neckline and ripped it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaude screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood back and looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaude\u0027s breasts were round and firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA part of his mind noticed how pretty they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana must love them, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the crocodile clips from Diana\u0027s mouth and carefully fastened one to each of Maude\u0027s small pink nipples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he returned to the machine and put his hand on the control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Au right,\" Diana said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDIETER ARRANGED FOR the railway tunnel at Manes to be heavily guarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Jackdaws got that far, they would find it almost impossible to enter the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt confident that Flick would not now achieve her objective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was secondary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis burning ambition was to capture her and interrogate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was already two o\u0027clock on Sunday morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuesday would be the night of the full moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe invasion could be hours away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in those few hours Dieter could break the back of the French Resistance-if he could get Flick in a torture chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe only needed the list of names and addresses that she had in her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gestapo in every city in France could be galvanized into action, thousands of trained staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were not the brightest of men, but they knew how to arrest people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a couple of hours they could jail hundreds of Resistance cadres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of the massive uprising that the Allies were no doubt hoping for to aid their invasion, there would be calm and order for the Germans to organize their response and push the invaders back into the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had sent a Gestapo team to raid the Hotel de la Chapelle, but that was a matter of form: he was certain Flick and the
