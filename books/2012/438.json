He twisted, slashed, ducked, kicked and closed. Bodies fell away. Blood sprayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a blow hammered his lower back, lifted him from his feet. He tried curling away from the blow, but something was jammed in his body, a hard edge crunching and grinding against his spine. He was driven to the ground face first, and then they were beating on him – heavy edges chopping into his muscles and bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne struck the back of his head and there was darkness, and then oblivion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge stood over the corpse of Bavedict – the damned fool had been killed outright by that first shower of arrows, taking one through an eye. From his vantage point Hedge could see the ring of defenders contracting as the enemy pushed higher up the slope. He watched Fiddler moving down to block an imminent breach where most of a squad had gone down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You – archers – keep an eye on there. If they get through it’s a straight path to the Crippled God.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now, the rest of you – we got to relieve the pressure. Take those coppery ones and throw for the fifth and sixth ranks – use ’em all up. If we don’t make ’em reel right now we’re done for.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s the copper kittens do, sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge shook his head. ‘I forget, and the alchemist’s dead. Just go – spread out, get moving!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they left, the sapper took up his crossbow – he only had half a dozen quarrels left. The occasional arrow still sailed down here and there, but either the sappers he’d dug in below the slope were all dead or they’d used up their munitions – it’d be just his luck if some errant arrow took him or Fiddler out now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoading his weapon, he moved down past his four remaining archers, who were sending arrows into the breach. He could see Fiddler, there with those Dal Honese sisters and a lone heavy infantryman shorter than any of them. The Kolansii who’d been advancing to flank them were all down, feathered with arrows. ‘Good work,’ barked out Hedge to his archers. ‘Now find somewhere else you’re needed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stone turned underfoot and Fiddler’s left ankle gave way in a stab of pain. Cursing, he stumbled. Looked up to see a Kolansii closing – the eyes manic and wild beneath the helm, a heavy axe lifting high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quarrel punched the man back a step, and he looked down in astonishment at the heavy bolt buried in his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hand closed on Fiddler’s collar, dragged him clear. An all-metal crossbow landed in his lap, followed by a quiver. ‘Load up, Fid,’ said Hedge, drawing his short sword. ‘Keep ’em off my left flank, will you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You getting mad, Hedge?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gods help them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis attacker had pushed his spear right through Bottle’s right thigh, pinning him down, but Bottle had replied with a sword through the stomach, and as the Kolansii sagged back voicing terrible screams the marine decided he’d come away the winner of the argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that what this is? An argument? But look at them – they’re slaves. They’re not asking for this .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarr dropped down beside him, blood streaming from a gash in his face. ‘You want that spear out, Bottle? It ain’t bleeding much for the moment, but if I take it out …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know,’ Bottle said. ‘But it’s pushed right through – I want it gone, Sergeant. I’ll stuff rags in.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A bleeder—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It ain’t one, Sergeant. It’s just a big fucking hole.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarr pushed Bottle on to his side, and then quickly drew out the spear. ‘Bleeding,’ he said after a moment, ‘but not spurting. When I see Deadsmell I’ll send him your way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, feeling faint, Bottle pushed himself upright, fumbling at the pouch at his side, where he found a roll of bandages. He was working a wad into one end of the hole when there was a flash of heat from downslope and then blood-chilling screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Grave stared, in shock, furious at his own helplessness, as copper-hued grenados sailed down from the defenders to strike the Kolansii ranks at the foot of the barrow and on the level ground beyond it. The emerald fires that erupted when they shattered seemed almost demonic as they spread with terrible ferocity through the ranks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attack was a shambles – he saw his soldiers reeling, flinching back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is going to take longer than I anticipated . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-438.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
