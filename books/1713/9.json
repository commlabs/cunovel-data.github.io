It seems there\u0027s a problem with my husband\u0027s cremation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of problem?\" Marty Roberts said, sitting in his office in the pathology lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re saying they can\u0027t cremate my Jack if he contains metal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Metal? What do you mean, metal? Your husband didn\u0027t have any hip replacements or war injuries, did he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. They are saying that his arms and legs have metal pipes in them. And the bones have been removed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really.\" Marty stood up in his chair and snapped his fingers in the air, getting Raza\u0027s attention in the autopsy room outside. \"I wonder how that could have happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was calling to ask you the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what to say. It\u0027s quite beyond me, Mrs. Weller. I must say, I\u0027m shocked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy then Raza had come in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to put you on speaker, Mrs. Weller, so I can make some notes as we speak. Are you with your husband at the crematorium now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"And they are saying he has lead pipes in his arms and legs, so they can\u0027t cremate him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" Marty said, looking at Raza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaza shook his head. He scrawled on a pad,We just took one leg. Put in wood dowel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty said, \"Mrs. Weller, I can\u0027t imagine how this might have happened. There may have to be an inquiry. I am concerned that the funeral home, or perhaps the cemetery, may have done something improper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" she said, \"they say he has to be reburied. But they also say maybe I should call the police, because it looks like his bones were stolen. But I don\u0027t want to go through the ordeal of the police and everything.\" A long, pregnant pause. \"What do you think, Dr. Roberts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Weller,\" he said, \"let me call you right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty Roberts hung up the phone. \"You dumb fuck! I told you: Wood, always wood!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it,\" Raza said. \"We didn\u0027t do that lead job. I swear we didn\u0027t. We always use wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lead pipe...\" Marty said, shaking his head. \"That\u0027s crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t us, Marty. I swear it wasn\u0027t us. Must have been those bastards at the cemetery. You know how easy it is. They hold the ceremony, the family shovels a little dirt, and everybody goes home. Coffin isn\u0027t buried. They don\u0027t do the actual burial sometimes for a day or so. That night, they come in, take the bones. You know how it works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How doyou know?\" Marty said, glaring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, one time last year, woman calls, her husband is buried with the wedding ring, and she wants the ring. Wants to know if we took it off him for the autopsy. I said we didn\u0027t have any effects, but I would call the cemetery. And they hadn\u0027t buried him yet, and she got the ring back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty Roberts sat down. \"Look,\" he said, \"if there is an investigation, if they start looking at bank accounts...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a laugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marty, I\u0027m telling you.We didn\u0027t do it. No metal pipe. No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I heard you. I just don\u0027t believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaza tapped the desk. \"You\u0027d better use the prescription with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. Now get out of here while I call her back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaza crossedthe autopsy room and went into the changing room. No one was there. He dialed his cell phone. \"Jesu,\" he said. \"What the fuck you doing, man? You put lead pipes in that car crash guy. Shit, Marty\u0027s mad. They\u0027re trying to cremate the dude, he\u0027s got lead pipes in him...Man, how many times do I have to tell you? Use wood!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Weller,\"Marty Roberts said, \"I think you better rebury your husband. That seems to be your only option.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, unless I go to the police. About the stolen bones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you what to do,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll have to decide the best course of action. But I\u0027m sure a prolonged police investigation will turn up a prescription in your name for ethacrynic acid from Longwood Pharmacy, on Motor Drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was for my personal use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know that. It\u0027s just a question of how ethacrynic acid happened to end up in your husband\u0027s body. That could be awkward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your hospital lab has found traces of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I am sure the hospital would stop the lab work as soon as you dropped your lawsuit against them. Let me know what you decide to do, Mrs. Weller. Good-bye for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up and looked at the thermometer in the autopsy room. The temperature was 59 degrees. But Marty was sweating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wonderingwhen you\u0027d show up,\" Marilee Hunter said, in the genetics lab. She didn\u0027t look happy. \"I\u0027d like to know exactly what part you played in all this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In all what?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kevin McCormick called today. There\u0027s another lawsuit from that Weller family. This time it\u0027s the son of the deceased, Tom Weller. The one who works for a biotech company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his suit about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was only following protocol,\" Marilee said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh...What\u0027s the suit about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently his health insurance was canceled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His father has theBNB 71 gene for heart disease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He does? That makes no sense. The guy was a health nut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had the gene. Doesn\u0027t mean it was expressed. We found it in the tissues. And that fact was duly noted. The insurance company picked it up and canceled the son as \u0027pre-ill.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did they get the information?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s online,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027sonline ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a legal inquiry,\" she said. \"Under state law it\u0027s all discoverable. We\u0027re required to post all lab findings to an FTP address. In theory it\u0027s password-protected, but anyone can get to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You put genetic dataonline ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not everyone\u0027s data. Just the lawsuits. Anyway, the son is saying he did not authorize the release of genetic information about himself, which is true. But if we release the father\u0027s information, as we\u0027re required by state law to do, we also release the son\u0027s, which we\u0027re required by lawnot to do. Because his children share half the same genes as the father. One way or another, we break the law.\" She sighed. \"Tom Weller wants his insurance back, but he won\u0027t get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty Roberts leaned against the desk. \"So where does it stand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Weller sued me along with the hospital. Legal is insisting this lab no longer touches any material from the Wellers.\" Marilee Hunter sniffed. \"We\u0027re off the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff the case! No more investigation, no digging up the body! Marty Roberts felt nothing but relief, although he did his best to appear distressed. \"It\u0027s so unfair,\" he said, \"the way lawyers just run our society.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s over, Marty,\" she said. \"It\u0027s done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty went backto the pathology lab later that day. \"Raza,\" he said, \"one of us has to leave this lab.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Raza said. \"And I\u0027m going to miss you, Marty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a new job,\" he said, smiling. \"Hamilton Hospital in San Francisco. Their diener just had a heart attack. I start day after tomorrow. So with packing and everything, this is my last day on the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty Roberts stared. \"Well,\" he said. He didn\u0027t know what else to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you get two weeks,\" Raza said, \"but I told the hospital this was a special case and you would understand. By the way, I have a guy who would be a good replacement. He\u0027s a friend of mine, Jesu. Very good guy. Works in a funeral home right now, so it would not be a big transition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll meet with him,\" Marty said. \"But I think maybe I will pick my own guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, sure, no problem,\" Raza said. He shook hands with Marty. \"Thanks for everything, Dr. Roberts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remembered.\" Marty smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaza turned and left the lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHapter 023\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh Winklerwas staring out his office window that overlooked the reception area at BioGen. Things were up in the air. Josh\u0027s assistant, Tom Weller, had taken the week off because his father had died in a car crash in Long Beach. And now there was a problem with his health insurance, as well. Which meant Josh had to work with another assistant, who didn\u0027t know the routines. Outside, repair crews were fixing the surveillance cameras in the parking lot. At the reception desk below, Brad Gordon was again chatting up the beautiful Lisa. Josh sighed. What kind of juice did Brad have, that he could do whatever he wanted, including chasing the boss\u0027s trim? Because Brad was clearly never going to be fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa had beautiful breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh? Are you listening to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something on your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom above, he could look down at Lisa\u0027s scoop-neck blouse, which revealed the smooth contours of her firm breasts. Undoubtedly too firm, but that didn\u0027t bother Josh. Everybody and everything was surgically enhanced these days. Including guys. Even guys in their twenties were getting face-lifts and penile implants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what about it?\" his mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Sorry, Mom. What were you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the Levines. My cousins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Where do they live again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scarsdale, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered now. The Levine family had parents that spent too much. \"Mom, this is not legal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You went and did it to Lois\u0027s boy. You did it yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true.\" But he had only done it because he thought nobody would ever catch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now that boy has quit drugs and is working.At a bank, Josh. Abank. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, a teller or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s more than great,\" his mother said. \"This spray of yours could be a real moneymaker, Josh. It\u0027s the drug everybody wants. You could finally make something of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I mean. The spray could be great.\" She paused. \"But you need to know how it affects older people, don\u0027t you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. It was true. \"Yes...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why the Levines might work out for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll try to get a canister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For both parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mom. For both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flipped the phone shut. He was contemplating what, exactly, he should do about this - and deciding to do something else entirely - when he heard the sound of sirens. A moment later two black-and-white police cars pulled up in front of the building. Four cops piled out of the cars, entered the building, and walked right up to Brad, who still leaned on the counter talking to Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you Bradley A. Gordon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, one spun him around, pulled his arms back, and handcuffed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly shit, Josh thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrad was bellowing.\"What the hell is this? What thehell is this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Gordon, you are under arrest for aggravated assault and rape of a minor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the right to remain silent - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" He was shouting. \"What minor? Goddamn it, I don\u0027t know any fucking minor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cop stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, wait - wrong word! I don\u0027t know any minor!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you do, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys are making one big-ass mistake!\" Brad said, as they started to lead him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just come with us, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to sue your freaking asses off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way, sir,\" they said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he went through the doors to the sunlight outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bradhad gone, Josh looked over at the other people standing at the railing. Half the office was looking down, talking, whispering. And at the far end of the balcony, he saw Rick Diehl, the head of the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust standing there, with his hands in his pockets. Watching the whole thing play out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Diehl was upset, he certainly didn\u0027t show it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHapter 024\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrad Gordonfrowned unhappily at the toilet in his jail cell. A strip of damp toilet paper clung to the side of the metal bowl. There was a puddle of brownish liquid in front of the seat. It had flecks of stuff floating in it. Brad wanted to pee, but he wasn\u0027t going to step in that liquid, whatever the hell it was. He didn\u0027t even like to think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA key turned in the lock behind him. He stood. The door swung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gordon? Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attorney\u0027s here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cop pushed Brad down a hallway and into a small room. There was an older man in a pinstripe suit and a younger kid in a Dodgers jacket, sitting at a table with a laptop. The kid had thick horn-rim glasses, which made him look like an owl, or Harry Potter or something. They both stood up, shook his hand. He didn\u0027t catch their names. But he knew they were from his uncle\u0027s law firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on here?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older lawyer opened a folder. \"Her name is Kelly Chin,\" he said. \"You met her at a soccer game, you came on to her - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Icame on toher ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then you took her to the Westview Plaza Hotel, room four-thirteen...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have this story right...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And once in the room you had oral, genital, and anal sex with her. And she\u0027s sixteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ,\" he said. \"It never happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older attorney just stared at him. \"You\u0027re in very deep shit, my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling youit never happened. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. The two of you were photographed on hotel security cameras in the lobby and again in the elevator. Hallway cameras on the fourth floor recorded you with Miss Chin as you entered room four-thirteen. You were there one hour and seven minutes. Then she left by herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, sure, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was crying in the elevator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She drove to the Westview Community Hospital and reported she had been assaulted and raped. She was examined at that time, and photographs were taken. She had vaginal tears and contusions, and anal tears. Semen was obtained from her rectum. It is being analyzed now, but she says it\u0027s yours. Is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit,\" Brad said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s best to come clean,\" the attorney said. \"Tell me exactly what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That little bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s begin with the soccer game where you met her. Witnesses say that you have been seen at girls\u0027 soccer games before. What are you doing at those games, Mr. Gordon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Jesus,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrad toldthe story, but the older man interrupted a lot. It took nearly half an hour to explain exactly what had happened. And to get to the hotel room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say this girl was turned on to you,\" the attorney said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, she sure was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no kissing or signs of affection in the elevator, going up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she had that reserved exterior. You know, the Asian thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. The Asian thing. Unfortunately, on the cameras it doesn\u0027t appear that she was an entirely willing participant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she got cold feet,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we were in the bedroom making out, and she was kind of hot, but also a little weird, you know, backing off. Like she\u0027d want to do it, and then not want to. But mostly she was going for it. I mean, she put the rubber on me. I was ready, and she lies back with her legs open and suddenly she goes, \u0027No, I don\u0027t want to do it.\u0027 I\u0027m beside her with my pecker sticking up, and I started to get peeved. So she says she\u0027s really sorry and she goes down on me, and I come in the rubber. She was as good as a pro, but you know young chicks today. Anyway, she takes it off me, carries it into the bathroom, and I hear her flushing the toilet. She comes back with a hot washcloth, wipes me down, says she\u0027s sorry, but she thinks she needs to go home now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m like, hey, whatever. Because by now I figure something\u0027s wrong with this chick. She\u0027s kinky or something, maybe she\u0027s a tease, I seen that before - or mentally disturbed, in which case I want her the hell out of my room. So I say, \u0027Sure, go, sorry it wasn\u0027t comfortable for you.\u0027 And she tells me maybe I should wait a while before I leave. I say, \u0027Sure, okay.\u0027 She leaves. I wait. Then I left, too. And I swear,\" he said, \"that\u0027s all there was to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She never told you her age?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never asked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She said she was out of high school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not. She\u0027s a sophomore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA silence. The attorney thumbed through the pages of the folder in front of him. \"So your story is, this girl seduced you at the soccer game, you took her to a hotel room, she collected your sperm in a condom, left you, gave herself self-inflicted genital injuries, put your sperm up her rectum, drove to the hospital, and reported a rape. Is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It had to be that way,\" Brad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a difficult story, Mr. Gordon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it had to be that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any proof at all that your story is true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrad fell silent. Thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said finally. \"I don\u0027t have anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s going to be a problem,\" the attorney said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Brad was takenback to his cell, the attorney turned to the young man in the Dodgers jacket and horn-rim glasses. \"You have anything to contribute here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He flipped his screen around so the senior man could see a series of jagged black lines. \"Audio stress meters remained in the normal range. Hesitation patterns that indicate prefrontal interference with cognition were absent at all times. The guy isn\u0027t lying. Or at least, he\u0027s convinced it happened his way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting,\" the attorney said. \"But it doesn\u0027t matter. There\u0027s not a chance in hell we\u0027ll ever get this guy off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHapter 025\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry Kendallparked in the Long Beach Memorial parking lot, and walked into the side door of the hospital, carrying a tissue container. He went down to the basement to the pathology lab and asked to see Marty Roberts. They had been high school friends in Marin County. Marty came out at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God,\" he said, \"I heard your name and I thought you were dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" Henry said, shaking his hand. \"You look good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I look fat. You look good. How\u0027s Lynn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Kids are good. How\u0027s Janice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She took off with a cardiac surgeon a couple of years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, I didn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m over it,\" Marty Roberts said. \"Life is good. Been hectic around here, but things are good now.\" He smiled. \"Anyway, aren\u0027t you a ways from La Jolla? Isn\u0027t that where you are now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, right. Radial Genomics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty nodded. \"So. Uh...what\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to look at something,\" Henry Kendall said. \"Some blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, no problem. Can I ask whose it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can ask,\" Henry said. \"But I don\u0027t know. I mean, I\u0027m not sure.\" He handed Marty the tissue container. It was a small styrofoam case, lined with insulation. In the center was a tube of blood. Marty slid the tube out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Packing label says, \u0027From the Laboratory of Robert A. Bellarmino.\u0027 Hey, the big time, Henry.\" He peeled it back, looked closely at the older label beneath. \"And what\u0027s this? A number? Looks like F-102. I can\u0027t quite make it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think that\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty stared at his old friend. \"Okay, level with me. What is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to tell me,\" Henry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let me tell you straight off,\" Marty said, \"I won\u0027t do anything illegal. We just don\u0027t do things like that here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not illegal...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. You just don\u0027t want to analyze it at your lab.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you drive two hours up here to see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marty,\" he said, \"just do it. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty Roberts peeredthrough the microscope, then adjusted the video screen so they could both look. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Red cell morphology, hemoglobin, protein fractions, all completely normal. It\u0027s just blood. Whose is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it human blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell yes,\" Marty said. \"What, you think it\u0027s animal blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just asking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if it\u0027s certain kinds of ape blood, we can\u0027t distinguish it,\" Marty said. \"Chimps and people, we can\u0027t tell the difference. Blood\u0027s identical. I remember cops arrested a guy worked in the San Diego zoo, covered in blood. They thought he was a murderer. Turned out to be menstrual blood from a female chimpanzee. I had that one when I was a resident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t tell? What about sialic acid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sialic acid\u0027s a marker for chimp blood...Soyou think this is chimp blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Marty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t do sialic acid at our lab. No call for it. I think Radial Genomics in San Diego can do it, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to tell me what this is, Henry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"But I want you to do a DNA test on it. And on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty Roberts sat back. \"You\u0027re making me nervous,\" he said. \"You getting into anything kinky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, nothing like that. It was a research project. From a few years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you think this might be chimp blood. Or your blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or both?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you do the DNA test for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I\u0027ll take a buccal swab, and get back to you in a few weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. Can we keep this between us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Marty Roberts said, \"you\u0027re scaring me again. Sure. We can keep it between us.\" He smiled. \"I\u0027ll call you when it\u0027s done.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/next/page-9.html","bookId":1713,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:14 AM"}
