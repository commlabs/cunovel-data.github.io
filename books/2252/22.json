Whatever it had been, Walker gave only an incurious glance in its direction, and Matthew knew it had not been Slaughter taking to his heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink,\" said Walker, as if they needed encouragement. The last two miles had been a rugged, hard go, through tangles of brush, hanging vines, and thorns; but Matthew was pleased to note, as Walker indicated all the broken vegetation and the bootmarks in the dirt and fallen leaves, that Slaughter had already blazed this trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalker knelt down, cupped his hands for a drink, and left them to their own devices. Matthew stretched out, put his face in the cold water and drank directly from it; Lark took the waterflask from her bag, filled it, and let Faith ease her thirst before she drank. Matthew sat up, rubbed his mouth with his buckskin sleeve and watched as the Indian set foot in the stream, which was about a foot deep, and waded to the other side. The current swirled around Walker\u0027s legs. He examined the bank, bent down for a closer look, and then regarded the foliage ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting,\" Walker said. He stood up. \"It seems Slaughter doesn\u0027t trust you, Matthew. He didn\u0027t think you\u0027d go home, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you meani\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t come out here. He followed the stream for a distance. That means he suspects you wouldn\u0027t give up-gold coins or not-and he\u0027s making an effort to elude us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Momma,\" Faith said quietly. \"My feet hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine too,\" Lark answered, and patted her mother\u0027s shoulder. \"We\u0027ll just have to bear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew got to his own feet, which were certainly no strangers to pain. \"You\u0027re not saying he\u0027s gotten away, have youi\" he asked urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saying he\u0027s making an effort. We\u0027ll have to follow him. In the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But which wayi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalker pointed to the left, upstream. \"Humans and animals alike usually have a desire to reach higher ground. Unless Slaughter knows I\u0027d think that, in which case \" He shrugged. \"I say we go upstream first. If I can\u0027t find where he came out-and it won\u0027t be beyond a hundred yards, most likely-we\u0027ll go downstream. Everyone readyi\" He waited for Lark to nod assent, and then he turned and began wading against the current.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLark and Faith followed, with Matthew at the rear. That had been the order of progression since they\u0027d started off, nearly three hours ago. Matthew was in fact situated there by Walker\u0027s command, to make sure the girl and her mother did not falter and to lend a hand if one of them fell. So far, they were both doing an admirable job of coping with this torturous course, though Walker had been right about their being slowed to a crawl. But if the Indian was frustrated about their lack of speed, he didn\u0027t show it; he simply plodded on ahead, waited for them to catch up, and did the same over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey weren\u0027t in the stream a matter of minutes before Faith slipped. She went down on her knees, crying out with pain, and at once Matthew was at her side helping Lark stand her up. Walker stopped a distance ahead to mark their struggle, for the current was indeed strong, and then he continued forward, his eyes searching the right bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hurt my knee,\" Faith said. \"Momma, I hurt my knee.\" Her lower lip quivered, but she was a big girl and did not weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be all right. Can you lean on mei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\u0027m, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew saw Lark lower her head and quickly squeeze her eyes shut. He said, \"Faith, let me help you,\" and took her weight against his shoulder so Lark could keep her own balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, sir,\" said the child, whose parents should be ever so proud of her manners. \"It just hurts a little bit now.\" She gave him a sideways glance. \"Water\u0027s cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Shaynei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew replied, \"Yesi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come you to visit us todayi I thought you went to London.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you thought correctly. But I\u0027m here now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you like Londoni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a very large city,\" Matthew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to go someday. Momma and Daddy say we will. Just yesterday. We were sitting at the table and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew felt the shock go through her. Felt her seize up and tremble, as if her heart was about to burst. She stopped moving and stood very still, while the current pulled at her dress and decorated it with dead leaves. Matthew did not wish to look at her face; he was tensed and ready for the scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faithi\" Lark\u0027s voice was miraculously steady and as calm as the underwater stones. \"Deari\" She put her arm around the woman. \"We have to keep going. Come on.\" She glanced at Matthew, because still Faith would not be moved. \"Tell her we have to keep going, Mr. Shayne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew said, in as gentle a voice as he could manage, \"Mind your mother, now. Like a good girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand Faith Burgess, if anything, was a good girl. In another few seconds she came back to them, and she breathed deeply of the crisp air and rubbed the back of her neck and picked up the hem of her dress to view her scraped right knee. She did not speak, for perhaps somewhere in her mind the shadow of Faith Lindsay knew that things were best left unsaid, untouched and unremembered. She went on, silently, between Lark and Matthew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew saw that Walker had drawn his bow and nocked an arrow, and was aiming it into the woods as he waded forward. The Indian had obviously seen something he didn\u0027t like, or else he expected that Slaughter might choose this place as a shooting gallery. I do know pistols, sir, as well as I know razors, Slaughter had said to Greathouse. and another statement Matthew recalled Slaughter making: I know the look of captains, because I myself have been a soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich meant Slaughter must have had experience quick-loading pistols. Matthew had heard from Greathouse, during his own firearms training, that a real expert could eye-measure the powder, pour it down, ram the ball and cloth patch, prime the pan and fire a shot within fifteen seconds. Of course the faster the process was done, the more chance there was for a mistake, which meant a misfire or even an explosion, rendering both the pistol and the hand useless pieces of junk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalker continued along the stream, moving the arrow\u0027s point to follow his line of sight. But in another moment he lowered the bow, climbed up upon the right bank, and motioned for the others to come ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He came out here. The mark is very fresh, maybe an hour old.\" Walker showed Matthew an area of crushed weeds and among them the impression of a bootheel. When he located two more, he said, \"Going this way,\" and pointed to the southeast. \"Moving slowly. His legs are tired and he ate too much.\" He stood up and returned the arrow to its quiver and the bow to its sheath. \"Is the woman all righti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith didn\u0027t speak, though her mouth was moving as if reciting a childhood conversation. Her eyes were glazed over, her face slack. Though her body was here, her mind was far distant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLark said, \"She can keep going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalker looked up through the trees toward the sun. \"about two hours of light left. Can we pick up our pacei\" He had directed this question to Matthew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"all right, then.\" There was no reason for argument; things were as they were. \"If possible, we should be silent from here on. We don\u0027t want him to hear us as we get closer. I\u0027m going to go ahead a distance, but not so far that I can\u0027t see you. If you\u0027re getting too much off the track, I\u0027ll correct you.\" With that pronouncement, Walker trotted quietly away into the woods, nimbly leaping gnarled roots and ducking under low-hanging branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew had never bargained to be a pioneer, but he\u0027d learned that many things in this life were thrust upon you whether you wanted them or not. He had not a clue about how to follow Walker\u0027s trail. a disturbance of leaves and a crushed weed spoke volumes to the Indian, but withheld from him even a short story. Walker was out of sight now, and the forest seemed vast and darker. Still, Matthew could only do as he was instructed; he started off in what he hoped was Walker\u0027s path, and behind him followed his army of two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful here,\" Matthew said, as softly as was practical, to warn them of a place where the ground abruptly sloped into a hollow full of tangled vines and roots before it rose up again. Lark nodded; Faith was still absent, but she clung to Lark\u0027s hand and let herself be guided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are youi\" Lark asked, coming up beside him. \"a constablei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a way. I\u0027m a problem-solver. In New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of problemsi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This kind,\" he replied. He motioned toward a patch of thorns that blocked their way, so they had to change course a few degrees. They walked for a while in silence, as Walker had directed, but Matthew found himself compelled to speak again. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had nothing to do with it.\" She paused, and Matthew thought she might be able to sense the bitter anger that suddenly seemed to be, like one of Slaughter\u0027s claw-nailed hands, closing around his throat. \"Did youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew didn\u0027t reply. But he knew he would have to, eventually; if not here, then somewhere else, for he could not let himself wander a path that had no end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am responsible for his escape,\" Matthew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt Lark staring at him. He kept his head down, in pretense of examining the way ahead for pitfalls. Lark said nothing else. Soon he\u0027d either picked up his pace or she had drifted back, he wasn\u0027t sure which, but he might as well have been a solitary traveler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came out of the forest into a small clearing. Matthew was pleased with his sense of direction, because Walker was kneeling down under a group of oaks at the clearing\u0027s edge only a few yards away. Before them rose another hill, easily twice the height of the one they\u0027d climbed when leaving the Lindsay house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew, Lark and Faith approached the Indian. They were almost beside him when Matthew caught from the corner of his eye a sharp glint of glass or metal catching the sun. He looked up the hillside, toward the top where the trees grew thick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s up there,\" Walker whispered, motioning them to remain under the trees. \"Taking a look around with his spyglass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew crouched against an oak\u0027s trunk and scanned the hilltop. The reflection did not repeat itself. \"Do you think he\u0027s seen usi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited. Slaughter might have moved to a different spot, and be watching them even now, or he might have made a single quick pass across the clearing. In any case, they couldn\u0027t stay here forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafter about three minutes during which both he and Matthew intently watched for any sign of movement and saw none, Walker got to his feet. \"I want to get up there as fast as we can. You help the girl. and if you see anything, call out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalker found the trail that Slaughter had already broken through the underbrush, but it was an arduous climb. at one point Faith nearly collapsed and had to sit down, still without a word, and Lark sat beside her and rubbed her legs until she could stand once more. Walker stayed with them, crouched on the ground and alert for movement, his bow drawn and an arrow ready to fly. Matthew\u0027s own legs were killing him; the muscles in his calves felt as if they were about to rip through the skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took more than half-an-hour to reach the top. There was no sign of Slaughter, except for the bootmarks that Walker easily found. It appeared to Walker that Slaughter had clambered up onto the rocks, laid flat and from there aimed the spyglass down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand not far from where Walker deduced that Slaughter had done so, Matthew\u0027s black tricorn lay on a smooth gray boulder amid the pines. Likely left behind, Matthew thought, in Slaughter\u0027s haste to put distance between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew approached his hat. He reached out to pick it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalker\u0027s bow stopped the arm from its intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Walker told him. \"Step back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back,\" Walker repeated, and this time Matthew obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Indian stretched his own arm out and used the bow\u0027s narrow end to tilt the tricorn up. as Walker lifted it, the snake that was coiled underneath began to give its warning rattle. Fangs struck at the bow. Walker swept the rattler off the boulder onto the ground where it slithered away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bite you,\" said Faith, in her dazed and dreamlike voice. \"Ol\u0027 Scratch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLark stood beside Matthew, and Matthew suddenly realized she had grasped his hand because his fingers were about to be broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would say,\" Walker remarked, \"that Slaughter has seen us. Do you agree with that, Matthewi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s probably not a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Matthew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s left clear tracks. Still moving slowly. The hill wore him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027re all worn out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalker nodded. \"I think you may be right.\" He regarded the sun again, which was turning red in a cloudless sky as it dropped toward the west. \"We need to make camp before dark. Find someplace as safe as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not here!\" Lark objected. \"Not in rattlesnake country!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss,\" said Walker, with weary authority, \"it\u0027s all rattlesnake country.\" He looked at Matthew, who had been kneading the blood back into his fingers since Lark had released him. \"You can get your hat now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went on about two hundred more yards before Walker said the place would do for the night. It was a grassy clearing atop a small hillock, surrounded by huge oaks. They found as much comfort as was possible on the ground. Walker gave Matthew a portion of the dried meat and some for himself. Faith sat staring at nothing when Lark offered her a piece of ham and some cornbread; she reacted by clamping her hand over her mouth when Lark tried to push a bit of the ham between her lips. Then Faith curled herself up into a ball at the base of an oak and refused to respond to Lark\u0027s entreaties to eat. His meal done, Walker promptly climbed up into a tree and sat amid the branches while the sun went down, painting the western sky vivid red edged with purple. \"No need to waste this.\" Lark offered Matthew what her mother had rejected. \"Do you want iti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take the cornbread, thank you.\" He was delighted to get something that reminded him of happier suppers at home. \"You ought to eat the ham yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not very hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That may be so, but hungry or not you ought to eat it anyway.\" He chewed on the cornbread, which was absolutely delicious, and watched as she looked at the ham in her palm as if it had been cut from the haunch of a gigantic rat. Then, overcoming her revulsion for what the last family meal had been, she followed his suggestion, after which she promptly got up, rushed away into the thicket and vomited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew stood up, retrieved the waterflask from her canvas bag and took it to her. She was sitting on her knees, having crawled a distance away from her stomach\u0027s refusal. Without looking at him she accepted the flask, uncorked it, took a drink, swished the water around in her mouth and spat it out. She took a longer drink, corked the flask again and handed it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon me,\" Lark said, pushing the hair out of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew said nothing, but sat down a few feet away. He took off his tricorn, which he doubted he would be wearing much anyway, since his scalp prickled underneath it. Lark was a pretty girl, he thought. Very young, and fresh-faced. Or had been. He wished he had seen her yesterday. He wished so many things. But wishing seemed a waste of time, out here. He looked up and saw in the darkening sky the first few stars in the east. He wondered who might be looking at them in New York. Berryi Effrem Owlesi Zedi Even Lord Cornbury, on his evening walki\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered if he would ever get back there. He wondered if Greathouse was still alive, and at that point he had to stop wondering for that, too, was folly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you responsiblei\" Lark asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew knew what she meant. He knew his statement had been working at her, ever since he\u0027d spoken it. \"If it weren\u0027t for me-my actions-Slaughter would now be in the gaol at New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You let him goi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not so directly. But I remained silent about something when I should have spoken. I forgot my job, and I in essence betrayed a friend. That silence when you know you should speak up, but you don\u0027t that\u0027s the killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying you made a mistakei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea mistake. It sounded so small when she said it. So inconsequential. \"I did,\" he answered. \"a mistake that I shall be turning over and over in my head for the rest of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifted her position, sitting down and pulling her knees up toward her chin, her hands hooked together. \"That could be a very long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope,\" Matthew replied, and found that he could still smile, if only briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLark was quiet for awhile. a flock of birds flew across Matthew\u0027s line of sight, winging home before full darkness fell. \"My mother,\" Lark said. She couldn\u0027t continue, and had to wait. \"My mother,\" she tried again, \"was a very good woman. a well-educated woman, and very kind, to everyone.\" She drew in a long breath and slowly, almost painfully, released it. \"I don\u0027t think she\u0027s coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know that. She may be better in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean when her head clearsi If it clearsi I mean, she can never go back to what she used to be. Neither one of us can. Ever. and I guess you can\u0027t, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Matthew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father always said there were only two directions in life. Up or down. He was always talking about how good the land was, and how good God was to us. He said no matter how hard things got, all you had to do to touch God in this country was to reach up. Just try to meet God as much as you can, I guess is what he meant. Just try. I suppose that\u0027s the best anyone can do, is try.\" Now Lark managed a tight smile, but it quickly slipped away. \"I used to sit on his knee and listen to him, and I believed everything he said. Reach up, reach up, he said. Just try, is what he was telling me. and don\u0027t give up, because then you never meet God. But I suppose I stopped listening to all that, when I was too old to sit on his knee anymore. I thought it was just something you told a child, when the harvest went bad and the going got rough. But it was for him, and my mother, as much as it was for me. He never quit trying. Neither did she. Trying to reach up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last of the light Matthew saw the glint of her tears, and then how they slowly coursed down her cheeks one after the other. But her face remained tragically serene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get him,\" Matthew promised. \"Tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Howi I\u0027ve seen what he can do. What he will do. How are you going to get himi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One arrow,\" said Walker In Two Worlds, who was standing only a few feet away; he had come upon them in total silence. \"That\u0027s all I need to put him down. If I can get close enough, and get a clear shot, it\u0027s done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew said, \"I don\u0027t want him dead. I want him taken back, to stand trial in England.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Englandi\" Walker frowned. \"Trial or not, I\u0027d say he\u0027s earned the hangman\u0027s noose here first. Then they can take him over and hang him again, as they please. But don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be sure to spare him for the rope, if you think he\u0027s worth the knot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew was about to reply that he himself thought Slaughter wasn\u0027t worth a cupful of drool, but that higher powers across the ocean wanted him before the docket; he was interrupted in the formation of this reply when there came a shrill cry from Faith Lindsay. at once Lark was up and tearing through the thicket toward her mother, with Walker and Matthew close behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith was sitting up, clinging to the trunk of the tree beside her; she cried out again, a sound of utter, mindless terror, before Lark could kneel down and comfort her. Matthew turned his back, wishing to give them at least a little privacy, and walked a distance away. Now that the sun was just a purple blush to the west, the air was chill but not uncomfortably cold; the cloaks would do for the mother and daughter. He looked up at a sky filled with stars. On any other night he would have thought this an absolutely beautiful view, and he might have wandered out along the harbor-possibly with Berry at his side, if she\u0027d liked to go-and taken it all in, but tonight the darkness was not his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to sleep.\" Walker was standing behind him. Matthew immediately heard the edge of tension in the Indian\u0027s voice. \"While you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew gave words to his suspicion:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think he\u0027s coming tonighti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I told you I did, would it help you sleep any betteri\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fact is, he\u0027s not far away. He knows we\u0027ll catch up with him tomorrow. It\u0027s likely his spyglass has already shown him that his gift did not make the proper impression. So if I were of a mind to murder someone, I would strike before dawn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d best both stand guard then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need sleep,\" Walker repeated. \"He\u0027s sleeping too, you can count on it. If he\u0027s coming, it will be when he\u0027s rested and ready. But make sure, before you sleep, that your pistol is loaded, and that it\u0027s near at hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I ask you somethingi\" Lark had left her mother, and was approaching. Her question had been directed to Walker. \"Can you make us a firei She\u0027s afraid of the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid of the light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"a small fire,\" Lark persisted. \"Please. It doesn\u0027t have to last very long, just so I can get her to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalker pondered the request. He looked at the woman sitting against the tree with the dark brown cloak wrapped around her, her eyes swollen and vacant, her mouth slack. He drew his knife from its sheath. \"a small fire,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalker was true to his word. With the knife he dug a shallow hole next to Faith, filled it with a fistful of tinder, and struck a spark. a few broken-up sticks were added. The fire that resulted was little more than a warming glow, but it served its purpose. Lark sat beside her mother and smoothed her hair as Faith stared into the flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew found his own place to sleep, under the stars. Walker had disappeared; whether into the tree branches again or out into the woods, Matthew didn\u0027t know. He prepared his pistol, first by pouring gunpowder down the muzzle. Next he took a lead ball from his shooter\u0027s bag, placed it against one of the cloth patches Dovehart had sold him and, using the small ramrod that was actually secured in the pistol just underneath the barrel, rammed the patch and ball home. He returned the ramrod to its place. The final step would be to prime the flashpan, but that would be done in advance of actually using the weapon. He stretched out, hearing his backbone crack, and put the gun at his right side, just under his fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Lark speaking to her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe in Godi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say it for me, Faith. Come on, as we say every night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence stretched. Then, in a hoarse and ragged voice, Faith the little girl asked, \"Will we get to Mrs. Janepenny\u0027s tomorrowi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the way we have to go. Now, try to relax. Close your eyes. That\u0027s right, very good. We need to speak it, the same here as we do at home. all righti Do you believe in Godi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly silence. and then, faintly: \"Yes, Momma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe that we need fear no darkness, for He lights our wayi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Momma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe in the promise of Heaveni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Momma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I. Now go to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew was having his own problems. How to bid sleep come on, knowing that when Slaughter crept to their camp it would be with intent to murder, and his victim of choice would be a certain problem-solver from New York who, having escaped one rattler, was the prime target for another. Matthew remembered asking Slaughter at their first meeting why he\u0027d decided to try to kill Mariah at the red barn behind the hospital instead of running for freedom, and Slaughter had answered I was compelled by my Christian charity to release Mariah from her world of pain, before I fled. It seemed to Matthew that perhaps the hatred of people and desire for murder in Slaughter even overwhelmed his common sense. Just as some men were willing slaves to any number of vices, against all possible reason, so Slaughter was devoted to the extinction of human life. Or, more likely, he simply saw the opportunity to kill and took it, no matter what. Matthew closed his eyes. and opened them again. He was tired enough, but his nerves were jangling. He put his fingers against the pistol\u0027s handle. Suddenly being a magistrate\u0027s clerk seemed not such a bad occupation. He recalled Nathaniel Powers saying to him, at City Hall in midsummer after the magistrate had released Matthew from his duties in order to enter the employ of the Herrald agency, I think your education is just beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod help me survive the next test, Matthew thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I sit here with youi Just for a minutei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was aware that Lark had joined him. He sat up, glad to have some company. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Please do.\" He reached over to brush some sticks and rocks away from where she was going to sit. \"I apologize for the furnishings,\" he told her, \"but at least the place has a nice view.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doubted if his attempt at humor had made her smile, as he couldn\u0027t see her face in the dark. Behind her, the small fire was dying. Under her cloak, Faith appeared to have at last drifted to sleep, which in itself was a blessed event. Lark sat down and offered him the flask of water. He took it, drank some and returned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of them spoke. Overhead the night had revealed an awesome river of stars, and within that gigantic river were swirls of light like celestial currents. Some stars appeared to burn red, or blue. Some seemed to pulse with unknown energy. Far off above the horizon, a spark of fire leapt, gold against black, turned orange and winked out just as suddenly. It was the way of all things, Matthew thought. Beginnings and endings, even for stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matthew,\" Lark said. \"I wanted to tell you I don\u0027t blame you for anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t respond, but he was listening very carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t blame yourself,\" she went on, and whether she was looking at him as she spoke or not, he couldn\u0027t tell. \"You had your own reasons for what you did, and I\u0027m sure you thought they were important. They must have been important. But if you weren\u0027t if you weren\u0027t a good man, Matthew, you wouldn\u0027t be out here right now. You wouldn\u0027t care what happened to us. and you wouldn\u0027t be trying to make things right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I can ever-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped speaking, because Lark had placed a finger against his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can,\" she said. \"By taking him where he needs to be. By not giving up. Everything that\u0027s happened is in the past now. It\u0027s done. Do you heari\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. Her finger moved away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let yesterday go,\" Lark said, \"so it will not betray tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he feel something leave himi a heavinessi a sadness that had leeched deepi a sense of guilt, like a self-built gallowsi He wasn\u0027t sure. If he did, it was not dramatic; it did not have the power and majesty of a river of stars, or a celestial current. But he thought that by the grace of this young girl-older and wiser than her years would suggest-there was the lighting of a small spark of hope within him, there in his darkness, and by it he might find his way home from this wilderness his soul wandered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you hold mei\" she asked, in barely a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did. She put her head against his shoulder, and pressing her face in tightly she began to cry with muffled sobs, so her mother-her child-might not hear and awaken. He stroked her hair, and rubbed warmth into her neck, and still she clung to him and wept like any heartbroken girl of sixteen years might, on a night when the stars burned with fierce beauty high above the ugly realm of rattlesnake country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew didn\u0027t know how long he held her, or how long she cried. Time had indeed stopped for the Englishman. But at last her sobbing quietened, her crying ceased, and she lifted her face from his damp shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she told him, and she got up and returned to her mother\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew lay back down, the pistol under his fingers. His legs were hurting and his back ached, but for the first time in a long while-maybe since he\u0027d decided to break open the red octopus-his mind knew a calming touch of peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slept soundly, and at least for a short while he feared not. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mister-slaughter-matthew-corbett-3/page-22.html","bookId":2252,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:17 PM"}
