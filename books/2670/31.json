A twitch, a pull and a tug later, she had pinned combs bejeweled with topazes and emeralds into Judith’s hair. “There,” she said. “Now you look lovely. And your rash is all but gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin took Judith’s arm and before she knew it, he was leading her down the short, narrow aisle to the altar. She recognized many of the faces who lined the route—Hugh de Rigonier and Castendown, Lord Rittendon, Alynne and Ursula…even Salisbury and Peter of Blois.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith nearly gasped aloud when she saw Father Anselm and the Archbishop of Canterbury standing at the small altar. Her eyes widened and she glanced at Gavin, who murmured, “Warwick takes no chance that the wedding will not be recognized.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that, Judith had the courage to look at Malcolm for the first time. He stood towering over everyone in the chapel, helped by his great height and broad shoulders as well as the small dais. She noted at once that his sable-brown hair had been trimmed and was shorter than she’d ever seen it, just past his chin. It was shiny and combed neatly, and his jaw clean-shaven and smooth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike Judith, he wore fine clothing: a tunic in the colors of Warwick—gray and blue—with detailed embroidery that must have taken many hours of work. Beneath the tunic was a sherte of dark blue, embroidered at the end of the long, tight sleeves in gold, red and white. He wore a heavy, ornate sapphire and emerald brooch at his throat, anchoring a shimmering gray cloak lined with dark red fabric. His boots were well-tooled dark brown leather, more costly than a good mare. On his right hand was a heavy signet ring with a square stone of onyx.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this imposing sight, Judith swallowed hard—for she’d never seen him dressed befitting his station as a great and wealthy baron. He was both breathtakingly handsome and intimidating all at once. She managed to raise her gaze to his, mortified that she should be presented to her future husband dressed as she was whilst he was garbed in all finery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she met his hazel eyes, she saw only anticipation and blatant approval. Judith held her chin high and when Gavin transferred her hand to Malcolm’s, she gave a brief curtsy to her soon-to-be husband, then pressed a kiss to her cousin’s cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm’s large hand covered hers easily, his fingers warm and steadying around hers as they turned to face the priest and the archbishop, kneeling on the prie-dieu in front of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ceremony was too brief and yet interminable. Judith, who’d attended mass countless times in her life, and nearly as many weddings, struggled between nervousness and pleasure as the clergymen led them through the familiar rites. Throughout, Malcolm’s fingers remained curled around hers, offering stability and comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen at last Canterbury released them to the room at large, she and her new husband faced each other. He bent to press a brief, soft kiss to her lips, then turned to present the new Lady of Warwick to their friends and peers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then all at once, the chapel went dead silent. Everyone was turning toward the rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is happening here?” demanded a familiar peremptory voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith went instantly cold, her insides puddling into fear and her knees weakening as she looked up to see King Henry standing on the chapel’s threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good evening, your majesty,” said Malcolm in a smooth, calm voice. ’Twas Judith’s good fortune that he had a strong hold around her waist, else she might have sagged to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your majesty,” said Gavin, interrupting when Malcolm might have continued. “You have arrived just in time to congratulate Warwick on his new bride.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith swore the chamber held its collective breath as the news sunk in. Even from across the small way, she saw an array of emotions pass over Henry’s face: shock, disbelief, fury. She noticed Dirick of Ludingdon and Hugh de Rigonier shifting their position so as to be visible to the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Canterbury?” the king demanded, looking about. “What have you to say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Congratulate Warwick, Henry. He’s made a fine choice in wife,” said Thomas à Becket—who may or may not have been aware of the undercurrents now seething in the holy place. “I have just finished officiating the ceremony—and now I wish to eat and drink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Indeed.” The king’s voice was frosty and his expression like granite. He looked at Judith, meeting her eyes from the other end of the aisle, and she shivered at the expression therein. She clutched Malcolm’s arm more tightly, and he gave her a little squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well then,” said Henry in a falsely jovial voice, “’tis off to the hall we go, for much celebration!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry Plantagenet, King of England, Duke of Anjou, had never been foiled so neatly and truly as he had been today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe simmered during the loud, raucous evening meal, wherein he was required to pretend to happily endorse the marriage of the woman with whom he was obsessed to a wealthy baron who had powerful friends. Even dressed as she was—in a simple, loose gown, with her brilliant fire-gold hair in a variety of braids—Judith of Kentworth was magnificent. He could still taste the sweetness of her skin and feel the perfect heft and weight of her breasts. The image of her hair spread over the white coverings of his bed, and her ivory body splayed on dark, sable fur were burned into his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not yet finished with her, and though she’d been snatched from beneath his nose by Malcolm of Warwick, Henry was not about to stand down. Nay. He was King. It had been more than a se’ennight since he’d had his fill of her, and he would wait no longer. He would not be denied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so as the evening progressed and his court drank itself merry and stuffed itself with the extravagant meal he provided, Henry waited. He imbibed little, ate less, and watched. Eleanor, who sat next to him at the high table, coldly ignored him. Yet she was no happier with the events of the day than her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when Judith of Kentworth—now Lady of Warwick—stood at last to go to her chamber to prepare for her wedding night, Henry noticed. And when he saw that Malcolm of Warwick seemed not to notice or care—for he appeared well into his cups and wholly entertained by Hugh de Rigonier and a raucous game of dice—Henry rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall had begun to empty out, for it was late. Men-at-arms snored, their heads resting on the tables. Most of the ladies had sought their beds. But the bridegroom seemed in no hurry to do so. Canterbury was gone as well, Henry noted with relief. He and Becket had been close once upon a time, but since being named archbishop, Becket had become holier-than-thou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry left the hall, eluding a trio of pages and one of his men-at-arms who meant to accompany him abovestairs. He was not bound for his own chamber this night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corridor that led to Judith’s chamber was silent and empty. Henry’s heart began to pound and his cock shifted in anticipation as he approached her door. Once inside, he could bolt them in and take his pleasure all the night. Warwick would have no choice but to allow it…and mayhap after this night, he would no longer want the woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAye. That would be it. Henry would give her lands to Warwick and keep her for himself. He smiled, adjusting the weight of his cock inside the vee of his hose, knocked on the door, then shoved it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis anticipatory step across the threshold was halted by the sight which greeted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA well-lit chamber it was. And crowded. Henry’s eyes bounced around like coins in a pouch as he saw Ludingdon, Mal Verne, Salisbury, Castendown…Canterbury. Mayhap a dozen or more men, all of whom he knew, stood in the chamber. He could not speak and all feeling drained from his face and body, surely seeping into the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good evening, my lord,” said Ludingdon, stepping out from the crowd. His excessive height always annoyed Henry—and even more so in this instance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this?” the king blustered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“’Tis obvious why you are here,” Ludingdon—one of his most trusted barons, a long-term friend and confidante—replied. His voice was firm, his eyes dark and serious. “And methinks ’tis just as obvious why we have chosen to greet you thus. There is not one of us who wishes to believe our king and liege would help himself to our wives or daughters at his whim. Thus, we are certain the purpose of your visit this night is to extend your felicitations to Lady Judith. And for no other reason…despite any past…arrangement…you may have had. Is that not so, my lord?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry looked around the chamber, meeting the cold, steady eyes of every man there. Every one of them were important, powerful men. Vital to him and to the stability of his kingdom. They swore fealty and brought armies and fought his wars and paid his rents. And in this, he recognized, they were united against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf, in this small matter they could unite against him…what more could they do on a grander scale if they were angered and betrayed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry was no fool. He was not the most powerful landowner and ruler in all of Christendom for no reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Indeed,” he said then, making a grand gesture that encompassed the chamber. “If the lady is within, I would be delighted to extend my congratulations to her on her new marital status.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith those words, it was as if a signal had been made. The crowd of barons parted, revealing the bed on which Judith sat. She looked at Henry, her expression remote and cool, and bowed her head regally. Just like a queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, my lord,” she told him. “I am honored.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment then, when Henry nearly allowed his fury and desires to overcome his rational mind, but he quickly subdued it. “Blessings to you and Warwick, and many children to you,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, with one last cold scan around the chamber to look at each one of his audacious barons, Henry turned and left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew when the battle—and the war—had been lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith had been nervous while awaiting the king’s expected arrival, but after her champions quit the chamber, her apprehension grew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a firm knock came once more on the door, she felt her belly drop alarmingly. My wedding night. My husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved slowly to the door, opening it with cold fingers, and was relieved to find Maris there. Behind her was Tabby, and behind her was a lineup of pages and serfs with a bath. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-lily-on-the-heath-medieval-herb-garden-4/page-31.html","bookId":2670,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:22 AM"}
