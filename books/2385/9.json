Courtney had pulled her blouse over her head and was standing in the middle of the aisle in her pleated skirt and a lacy pink bra. It wasn’t like she was showing off…but she wasn’t hiding, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily couldn’t help but peek. Courtney’s boobs were bigger than Ali’s had been, but she had the same tiny waist. A million memories of Ali flashed through Emily’s mind. Ali sitting in a bikini by the pool, Prada aviators perched on the tip of her nose. Ali lounging on Spencer’s couch in gray terry-cloth boy shorts, her long, tanned legs crossed at the ankles. The feel of Ali’s soft lips when Emily kissed her in the tree house. The excitement Emily felt in those heady seconds before Ali pushed her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourtney turned, noticing that Emily was watching. One eyebrow arched slyly. A smile spread across Courtney’s lips. Emily tried to smile back, but her lips felt like they were made of Gummi worms. Could Courtney know about the kiss? Had Ali told her? And was Courtney…flirting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main door to the locker room slammed again and Emily shot around the corner, finger-combing her reddish-blond hair in the full-length mirror. Courtney shut her locker, letting out a loud yawn. As Emily hustled for the door to the gym, Courtney caught her eye once more. She slowly closed one eye in a long, seductive wink, as if she knew exactly what she was doing…and exactly how it made Emily feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSECRETS, SECRETS EVERYWHERE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome to the Ruff House Grooming Salon!” a chipper woman in a red smock said to Spencer and Melissa as they guided the family’s two labradoodles into the luxurious doggie spa. Grooming duty was usually Mrs. Hastings’s job, but Mrs. Hastings couldn’t even groom herself right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the dogs stopped to sniff a large potted fern in the corner—and then lift their legs on it—Melissa let out a dramatic sigh and shot a resentful glance in Spencer’s direction. Spencer grimaced. Okay, so Melissa still hated her for turning their mother into a catatonic agoraphobe. Duly noted. Did she have to ram it down Spencer’s throat every chance she got?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pigtailed groomer, who didn’t look much older than Spencer, said she’d be with them in a few minutes. Spencer flopped down on a leather chair, and Beatrice slumped at her feet, chewing on one of the toes of Spencer’s Kate Spade ballet flats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone cleared her throat across the room. Spencer looked up. A wild-haired old woman holding a teacup Chihuahua was giving her the stink eye. “You’re that girl whose dead friend had a secret twin, right?” she said, pointing. When Spencer nodded, the woman made a tsk sound and pulled her dog close, as if Spencer were possessed. “Nothing good can come from that. Nothing good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer’s mouth fell open. “Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mrs. Abernathy?” a voice called from the hall. “We’re ready for you and Mr. Belvedere.” The old woman stood, shoving her dog under her arm. She gave Spencer a final foreboding look and disappeared around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to her, Melissa let out a baffled sniff. Spencer sneaked a tiny peek at her. As usual, her sister’s chin-length hair was smooth and straight, her peachy skin was flawless, and her checkered wool coat was lint-free. All at once, Spencer was so sick of their stupid rift. If crazy old ladies in vintage Chanel had opinions about the bomb Mrs. DiLaurentis dropped yesterday, then certainly Melissa did, too. Ali wasn’t the only one with a secret sister—Courtney was Spencer and Melissa’s half sister, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think we should do about Courtney?” Spencer asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelissa dropped an organic dog biscuit back into a crystal bowl. “Pardon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Courtney said that Ali told her a lot about us. Should I get to know her since…you know, we’re related?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelissa looked away. “I didn’t realize Ali and Courtney were very close. What kind of stuff did she know?” She unscrewed the cap to her purple Nalgene bottle and took a long gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer felt an anxious pull in the pit of her stomach. “What did you say to Jason at the press conference, anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelissa nearly choked on a mouthful of water. “Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer clutched Beatrice’s leash. Somewhere in the spa, a dog let out an unhappy yowl. It was clearly not nothing. “And since when are you friends with Jason? I haven’t seen you two talk since high school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bells at the front door jingled, and a man walked in with an enormous poodle, a bandana around her neck. Both Rufus and Beatrice jumped to their feet, instantly alert. Spencer kept her eyes on her sister, determined not to back down until Melissa told her the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Melissa sighed. “I was telling Jason that he should’ve told me that Courtney was back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe New Age music that had been tinkling through the stereo suddenly went silent. “What do you mean ‘back’? Did you know about Courtney?” Spencer whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelissa kept her eyes on her coat in her lap. “Um, kind of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For how long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since high school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, Jason had this huge crush on me.” Melissa pulled Rufus toward her and stroked his head. “And one day, he blurted out that he had this secret sister who was in the hospital. He begged me not to tell anyone. It was the least I could do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman with two neatly groomed bichons frises passed. “Well, I kind of ditched Jason for Ian,” Melissa said, not meeting Spencer’s gaze. “I broke his heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer tried to picture when it might have happened. Before the barn burned, she’d unearthed an old math notebook from when Melissa was in high school; inside was a note about Melissa and Jason hooking up. Spencer also remembered the Saturday after sixth grade started when she and her old friends had crept into Ali’s yard to steal her piece of the Time Capsule flag. Two people had been fighting inside Ali’s house—Ali screamed “Stop it!” and then someone else had mimicked her in a high-pitched voice. Next there was a crash, a loud thump, and then Jason had stormed out of the house. He stopped midway across the yard to glower at Ian and Melissa, who were on the Hastingses’ deck. Melissa and Ian had started dating a few days before….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Melissa and Jason had had a fling, it must have been before that. Which meant Melissa had known that Ali had a secret twin even before Spencer and Ali became friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice of you to say something,” Spencer said through clenched teeth. The music clicked back on, this time with an old Enya song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I made a promise,” Melissa said, wrapping Rufus’s leash around her hand so tightly it started to cut off her circulation. “It was Ali’s place to tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, she didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelissa rolled her eyes. “Well, Ali was kind of a bitch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe overpowering scent of eucalyptus dog toothpaste turned Spencer’s stomach. She wanted to tell Melissa that she was a bitch, too. Screw protecting Jason—Melissa never protected anybody. No, Melissa had kept the secret because knowledge meant power and control—just like it had for Ali. Spencer’s sisters were more alike than she’d ever realized. But Ali and Melissa weren’t Spencer’s only sisters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust days ago, she’d wished for an opportunity to start over with Ali without manipulation, lies, or competition. She’d never have that chance, but maybe she had the next best thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, Spencer handed Melissa Beatrice’s leash and stormed out of the salon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Spencer pulled up to the DiLaurentises’ new home, she was relieved to find that the news vans, cop cars, and barricades from the press conference yesterday were gone. It looked like a normal house again, identical to all the other houses except for the staircase over the garage, which led to Jason’s studio apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer climbed out of the car and stood very still. A snowblower grumbled in the distance. Three crows sat on a green electrical box across the street. The air smelled like spilled motor oil and snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling her shoulders, she walked up the gray flagstone path and rang the DiLaurentises’ bell. There was a thud from inside. Spencer hopped from foot to foot, wondering if this was a mistake. What if Courtney didn’t know they were related—or didn’t care? Just because Spencer wanted a sister didn’t mean she’d get one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the door flung open, and Courtney appeared. Spencer gasped involuntarily. “What?” Courtney asked sharply. Her eyebrows made a V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” Spencer blurted. “It’s just…you look so…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere was Ali, exactly as she was in Spencer’s memory. Her blond hair was wild and wavy over her shoulders, her skin gleamed, and her blue eyes sparkled under a fringe of thick, long eyelashes. There was such a disconnect in Spencer’s mind—this girl looked just like Ali, and yet she wasn’t her old friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer waved her hands in front of her face, wishing she could shut the door and start this all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, what’s up?” Courtney said, leaning against the doorjamb. There was a hole in her left red-and-white-striped sock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer chewed her lip awkwardly. God, she even sounded like Ali. “There’s something I want to talk to you about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cool.” Courtney ushered Spencer in, then turned and padded down the hall toward the stairs. Framed photos of the DiLaurentis family lined the walls. Spencer recognized many of them from the DiLaurentises’ old house. There was the picture of the family on a double-decker bus in London, a black-and-white one of them on a beach in the Bahamas, and the fish-eye-lens photo of them in front of the giraffe habitat at the Philadelphia Zoo. The familiar images took on new significance as Spencer followed the unpictured DiLaurentis through the house. Why hadn’t Courtney gone on any of the vacations? Had she been too sick?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer stopped in front of a photo she didn’t recognize. It was of the family on the back porch of their old house. Mother, father, son, and daughter grinned broadly, happily, as if they didn’t have a secret in the world. It must have been close to the time Ali went missing—there was a big bulldozer looming in the yard, near where the gazebo was going to be. There was another shape at the edge of the property, too. It looked like a person. Spencer leaned close, squinting, but couldn’t quite make out who it was. Courtney cleared her throat, waiting on one of the upper steps. “Coming?” she asked, and Spencer scuttled away from the photos, like she’d been caught spying. She sprinted up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were lots of moving boxes in the upstairs hallway. Spencer dug her fingers into her palm when she saw one labeled Ali—Field Hockey. Courtney skirted around a purple Dyson vacuum and pushed through a door at the end of the hall. “Here we are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Spencer saw the room, she felt as though she’d stepped back in time. She recognized the hot-pink bedspread immediately—she’d helped Ali pick it out at Saks. There was the big black Rockefeller Center subway station sign that Ali’s parents had bought for her at an antique store in SoHo. And the license-plate mirror over the bureau was the most familiar of all. Spencer had given it to Ali on her thirteenth birthday. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wanted-pretty-little-liars-8/page-9.html","bookId":2385,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:08 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:08 AM"}
