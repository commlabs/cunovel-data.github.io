The harp has real gold molding, and that is an original Mishael painting on the underside of the harpsichord top, or a very good replica. Additionally none of the instruments have been recently played. They haven’t been moved—you can tell by the imprints in the rug—and none of them have been altered or repaired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin eyed Elle. “Considering you do not play you know much about instruments.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t, I just know building materials.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you are observant. I’m not sure I would have picked up on the rug imprints,” Severin said, narrowing his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle kept her face bland. “Or I’m an indentured servant of the crown—a job which keeps one on ones toes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Elle’s relief the explanation seemed to satisfy Severin. “Probably,” he agreed before rising with a growl deep in his throat. He walked to the windows and folded his paws behind his back as he looked out at the snow blanketed land. “I am surprised the snow has not melted yet. Usually our first snow lasts only a few days, leaving a muddy mess to wade through until it freezes again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle joined Severin at the window. “Do you have a sleigh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but it is for the draft horses,” Severin said, studying the bright snowfall. “I’m not certain a single draft horse could take you as far as the capital, and the only sleigh in the chateau that is built for a team is for farm use.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see,” Elle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But…with all the drifting it may be possible to forge through on horseback,” Severin said, tilting his head in a very cat-like gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think Rosemerry could carry me?” Elle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps, if he was following another horse to break the path. But only if the snow is not heavy, wet, and deep,” Severin said. He hesitated. “Maybe we could ride out to the roads tomorrow and inspect their condition. Regardless of the snow depth, if Rosemerry only needs to carry you for less than an hour he will manage, and all the chateau inroads have been cleared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent,” Elle said. “A short ride will allow me to test my leg as well. And if the wind isn’t howling like a wolf and the sun is out I expect the weather would be almost pleasant.” Elle finished her sentence with a satisfied nod\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin bowed his head before turning his back to the window. “That is so,” he agreed. “I will alert the head groom and make the arrangements. You will tell Emele?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Certainly,” Elle said. “Severin, thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For going through this trouble on my behalf.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin shrugged. “I would not do it if I did not want to,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle thoughtfully watched the cursed prince, wondering what he meant by that. Severin didn’t look up again and immersed himself in his work for the remainder of the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Protect\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was barely a breeze and the sun pierced the clouds when Severin and Elle met in the courtyard for their ride the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horses were already saddled, Oliver held Fidele while Severin waited in front of Rosemerry with folded arms and narrowed eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emele, it’s nothing but a short ride. I’m going to be fine, would you stop fussing?” Elle asked as the maid tried to tie a second scarf around Elle’s neck. “What’s wrong?” Elle asked Severin when she reached the prince and pony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin nodded at the chateau entrance. “We have an audience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle turned to see servants oozing out of the front hall like a flock of birds. Those who couldn’t bear the cold were pressed against windows, their black masks stark against the illuminated glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle turned back to Rosemerry. “It’s better to ignore them, else we’ll give them more fodder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agreed. Sit lightly,” was again Severin’s only warning before he picked her up and placed her on the side saddle. He steadied her with his huge, clawed hands around her waist as Elle tried to maneuver her various skirts and cape so she sat properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does Emele fear I plan to lead you into a blizzard?” Severin inquired when Elle finally pushed her legs into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think she fears the cold in general. She has placed so many coverlets on my bed I accused her of trying to suffocate me in my sleep,” Elle said, fumbling to grasp the reins with her thickly gloved fingers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-and-the-beast-timeless-fairy-tales-1/page-49.html","bookId":1808,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:06 PM"}
