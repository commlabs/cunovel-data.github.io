I decided his hair didn\u0027t matter. Right now, neither would an earthquake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had questions, yes. But they weren\u0027t going anywhere and neither was I. I\u0027d save them for after I\u0027d had sex with a perfect stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, not exactly a stranger. I skimmed my palms over his biceps. But damn close to perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t speak, which was fine with me. I wanted sex, not chatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body slid along mine as he went to his knees and lifted my shirt Mouth hot against my damp skin, he traced my rib cage, then swirled his tongue around my belly button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain beat down on us both. I had a sudden urge to feel the droplets everywhere, so I pulled the tank top over my head and tossed it aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me and smiled - the first smile I\u0027d ever seen on his face - and my heart did a funny sort of stutter. Why did he have to be so beautiful?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching up, he tugged the end of my hair. \"Come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cast a confused glance at the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah, cher, right here. I wanna see your red hair against de grass. I wanna be inside you with de rain comin\u0027 down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I wanted that, too. My knees gave way, and I joined him on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I lay back, I expected an unpleasant, damp chill. But I was as wet as the earth and the afternoon as hot as the sun. When he dragged at my jeans, I merely lifted my hips and let them go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow he managed to lose his pants, too. No doubt he\u0027d had a lot of practice. I pushed that thought out of my head. Who he\u0027d done in the past, even what he\u0027d done, had nothing to do with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky swelled above us, heavy with clouds and the rain. The wild vegetation shielded us from anyone who might walk by. As if there were anyone but the two of us this far into the swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought made me bold. I wasn\u0027t Diana Malone; I was merely a woman who wanted a man. This man. And she could have him. No one would ever know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hard, clever hands skimmed over me, both insistent and reverent, arousing even as they soothed. His breath brushed my breast as he licked a drop of water from the curve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so wet,\" he murmured, the rumble of his voice a sensation all its own. \"Are you as wet here,\" a finger traced my hip, my thigh, \"as you are here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy legs fell open, expecting that clever finger to discover the answer. Instead he slid down my body in a movement so fast, it left me gasping, even before his tongue swept into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm-hmm,\" he said. \"Wet both inside and out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to protest. I\u0027d never been much for oral sex, which always seemed so personal - maybe because it was. I barely knew this man. But when I shifted uneasily, he grabbed my hips in his big, hard hands and held me still as he continued what he\u0027d started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds I was beyond protest, tongue-tied. Thank goodness he had no such problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body tightened, quivered, and he entered me in one smooth movement. As I was already convulsing, the press and release, the enticing rhythm of flesh into flesh, skin against skin, caused a desperate moan to escape. Horrified, I bit my lip, choked it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed at me, the clouds swirling behind his head, both the trees and his hair whipping madly in the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t stop, cher. Make all de noise you want. No one\u0027ll hear you way out here. Besides,\" he flexed his hips and stroked me deeper, leaning down to nuzzle my neck, his now-wet hair tickling my cheek, \"I\u0027m not gonna quit until you scream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Th-that might take a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t much of a screamer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A man\u0027s gotta do what a man\u0027s gotta do. I don\u0027t care if it takes all night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to move again, murmuring encouragement, telling me to touch him, take him, fuck him. The latter disconcerted me, but something in his voice, a note of desperation, a tiny quiver of need, made the word less a profanity and more of a plea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did as he asked, clenching around him as the tremor in his voice spread through both his body and my own. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efelt him come as the rain swirled around us, and I got so caught up in the depth of sensation, the scent, the sound, the feel of him and me together in the half-light, that I forgot I\u0027d already had one orgasm and went ahead and had another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forgot a lot of things while I lay there, Adam\u0027s head on my shoulder, his body still buried in mine. He shifted, sprawling half on the ground, half on me, his cheek pressed into my breast, his breath tickling my still-aroused nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe traced a lazy finger across my belly. \"You do that a lot?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened. \"Are you insinuating that I\u0027m loose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loose?\" He raised up on one elbow, using the hand that had been caressing me to shove his hair out of his face. His bracelet caught the light of the moon and turned from bronze to silver and back again. \"You felt pretty tight to me.\" His fingertips skimmed the curls between my thighs, and my skin danced. \"What I meant was, come twice in ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face went hot I wasn\u0027t sure what to say. Was that slutty?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been with one man before today. I\u0027d loved him with all of my heart. We\u0027d had a good sex life. The best. I\u0027d never wanted anyone else. Until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I felt as if I\u0027d betrayed my best friend. I guess I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to get up, reach for my clothes. Adam yanked me back, and when I struggled he rolled his body on top of mine, capturing my legs between his and pinning my wrists above my head with one hand. The other held my hip still as I tried to buck him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keep that up, we\u0027ll go again. I\u0027m game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel that he was. How could he be aroused so fast? What was he, superstud?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDumb question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be embarrassed, cher. You think a man doesn\u0027t want a woman to come every time he touches her? I liked it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had, too, but I wasn\u0027t used to discussing sex in such detail with my body still humming from his. I wasn\u0027t used to discussing sex at all. I\u0027d learned the facts of life in the locker room of my private girls\u0027 school, and to tell the truth... they\u0027d gotten a couple of things wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where you come from that you make love like a wild thing and get all red in de face when you talk about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lover I blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis hadn\u0027t been love, at least not for me. Not for him, either, I was certain. He didn\u0027t seem like the kind of man who fell in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figure of speech,\" he murmured, his voice trilling down my body, leaving goose bumps in its wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find another,\" I snapped, unreasonably annoyed at his cavalier attitude. Though why, I had no idea. I wanted him to be that way. I couldn\u0027t bear anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d rather I say \u0027you fuck like a wild thing\u0027? How about \u0027screw\u0027? \u0027Bang\u0027? \u0027Boink\u0027? None of them seemed de right word at de time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips trembled, and he stared at me, horrified. Then I burst out laughing. I couldn\u0027t help myself. \" \u0027Boink\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, too, then shrugged, the movement making his slick chest rub against mine in new and enticing ways. \"See what I mean? Not de right word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laughter had been good, had made me feel almost closer to him than the sex had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain dotted my cheeks, sparkled in his hair. Suddenly my hands were free, and I drew a finger down his face. \"There\u0027s so much about you I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmusement fled as wariness took its place. \"There are things you don\u0027t wanna know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled off me and to his feet in a quick feline movement. Leaning over, he dug his cigarettes out of his pants, then glanced at the still-dripping sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you kill someone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t meant to ask that, wasn\u0027t sure why I had. Like he was going to tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pack of cigarettes crunched as his hand clenched, then he took a deep breath, and as he let it out, his muscles relaxed, his fingers unfurled, and the shiny crumpled paper thudded to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"Wh-what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why you ask if you don\u0027t want to hear? I was in de army. I did what I had to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t talking about the army.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly he turned, his eyes eerily light in the encroaching night. \"What were you talkin\u0027 about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam might feel comfortable standing in the swamp buck naked, but I didn\u0027t I reached for my shirt, drew it over my head, and started hunting for my underwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A detective came to see me.\" Had it only been this morning? \"There was a man killed in the swamp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another animal attack,\" Adam murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found the white scrap of cotton and shoved my legs inside. My jeans were soaked. I debated trying to put them on and decided against it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not an animal this time.\" I looked up. \"Guy was strangled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam\u0027s face revealed nothing; however, he didn\u0027t seem surprised. \"You think I did that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was this man? Why would I kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know the answer to either question. \"The detective wants to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can want all he likes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t going to talk to him?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I get around to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He seemed pretty determined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll have to be a lot more than determined to find me out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked my head toward the shack. \"This is where you live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his brows. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a perfectly good house, if you\u0027d only take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam\u0027s face became shuttered. \"I hate that place. I wish it would rot, but de damn thing never will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis vehemence surprised and confused me. \"You moved out here because you hate the house, not because you - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth quirked. \"You heard I lost my mind, huh? Why you come here if you think I\u0027m nuts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t come here - actually I had, but not the way he meant; I\u0027d followed him. Or at least I thought I had. \"Why were you watching me at the mansion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been leaning over, reaching for his clothes, giving me an eyeful of his terrific backside. At my question, he stilled for just an instant. If I hadn\u0027t been admiring the view, I wouldn\u0027t have noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watching?\" He straightened, but he didn\u0027t face me. Instead, he seemed to be scanning the swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the cypress trees. When I called out, you left, so I followed you. Didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm,\" he murmured, then scooped up his clothes, my jeans, and grabbed me by the arm. \"I\u0027ve had enough of de rain. Let\u0027s go inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung back, uneasy, uncertain. \"Why did you lead me here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me from behind the tangled curtain of his hair. \"I\u0027m a man. Why you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason the idea that he\u0027d led me into the swamp for sex annoyed me, which was stupid. I hadn\u0027t followed him for a tour of the area. I wasn\u0027t that delusional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were mature adults who were attracted to each other. There was no reason we shouldn\u0027t act on that attraction. Just because Adam gave voice to the truth shouldn\u0027t make me feel slutty and guilty and bad. But I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should go,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me, lips, tongue, teeth, and I forgot again. Where I was, who I was, the other questions I wanted to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head, and his gaze flickered to the swamp, then back to mine. \"Stay with me. At least until de storm ends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself nodding, even though I got the distinct impression he meant something other than the wind, the rain, and the thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-14.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
