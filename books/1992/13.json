Then she\u0027d proceeded to tell them Della was mentally unstable and dangerous. She\u0027d gone as far as to make up shit about Della trying to hurt her. My mother had lost her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace walked into my office after I\u0027d had a long meeting with the two men and lost my argument about Della. They wanted background checks on her. I knew what they would find and I refused to do it. She wouldn\u0027t want that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look ready to murder an entire village with your bare hands, bro. What\u0027s up?\" I stormed past him and to the stairwell. I needed to yell and hit a wall. That was the safest place to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran up two flights of stairs before I stopped and slammed my fist into the wall, cursing everyone responsible. Della didn\u0027t need this right now. She was doing so much better. How was I supposed to tell her about this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Jace asked from behind me. I hadn\u0027t realized he had followed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My fucking mother happened. Her and Angelina. They\u0027re evil and twisted. How is it that my mother is so damn screwed up? What happened to her and my father to make them such fucked-up individuals? To make them think they can control lives? They can\u0027t! This club is mine and if I want to fire every motherfucker on the board that my father set in place, I will! It\u0027s time for a new board anyway,\" I snarled, taking deep breaths to calm myself down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how you\u0027ve dealt with the crazy as long as you have,\" Jace said, sitting down on the steps and watching me pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was what I had to do. I couldn\u0027t just let her be alone. But it\u0027s affecting my work. At least when Angelina was here she helped,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to keep your ass away from her insane shit. You have a corporation to run. Dropping what you need to do to deal with one of her batshit crazy episodes isn\u0027t fair. You need to fix this problem,\" Jace said, as if it were easy. How was I supposed to just turn away from my mother? I was all she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. How the hell do I do that?\" I asked, stopping my pacing and leaning against the wall. If it was a choice between Della and my mother, I would choose Della. If she forced my hand, I was going to have to turn away from her. First, I needed to decide about the board. I needed a lawyer. My own lawyer, not my father\u0027s. I was done using the people he had set in place. Things were different now and I didn\u0027t need a crazy-ass phone call from my mother sending board members to my office questioning my decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time I made sure this place was run by me. My board would be made up of people I trusted and confided in. It was time for a new generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jace,\" I said, turning to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ready to be a board member?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace frowned. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting a lawyer. I\u0027m firing the old board and starting my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin spread across Jace\u0027s face. \"Hell yeah,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time since I\u0027d gotten the call earlier that day, I felt lighter. I wasn\u0027t going to let my mother control me. I was in control. My grandfather had left it all to me. Even her home was now mine. If she wanted to fuck with my life I\u0027d fuck with hers enough to make her stop. She was my mom, but Della was my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour hours had passed since I\u0027d left Della. Dammit. I\u0027d lost track of time. Grabbing my phone, I headed out the door to my truck. My call went straight to her voice mail. Shit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDella\u0027s car was in the driveway. She was there. Maybe she\u0027d been outside when I\u0027d called her. I had promised her dinner tonight in Seaside. I was two hours late. This wasn\u0027t fair to her. I couldn\u0027t keep her here all the time. She was coming back to work with me. I needed her help. She was good at her job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening the door, the smell of roasted garlic and tomatoes met my nose. I closed it and followed the smell to the kitchen. Della was standing at the stove with a black apron on from the club, stirring a pot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said quietly so I didn\u0027t startle her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun around and smiled at me. There was a sadness in her eyes she couldn\u0027t hide. I\u0027d made her sad. My leaving her here had upset her. She had wanted to go to work today. I would have to explain all that tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I decided to cook instead of us going out,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over to stand behind her and wrapped my hands around her waist. \"It smells incredible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I haven\u0027t made lasagna in a long time. This sauce is hard to get right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was off in her voice. I hated that she was upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry about today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t apologize. Please, don\u0027t. You had work to do. I know that and I\u0027m okay with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want my apology. What was upsetting her then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can come back to work tomorrow,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ready for that yet,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t ready for it? Today she\u0027d tried several times to go back to work. What had changed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think you\u0027re not ready? Did you have another episode today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No, I think it\u0027s just too much on me right now. I need to get a better grip on myself first.\" She turned and looked up at me. \"Let\u0027s not talk about it tonight. I want to cook you dinner and enjoy being with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tucked my head in the curve of her neck. \"Okay,\" I replied. We would talk about it tomorrow then. \"How can I help you with dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and kissed my head. \"You can slice the French bread, butter it, then sprinkle it with garlic powder. I need to toast it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can do that,\" I said, stepping back from Della and reaching for the bread. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-13.html","bookId":1992,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
