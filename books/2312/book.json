Keller goes in, does the job, gets out: usually at a few hours’ notice . . . Often Keller’s work takes him out of New York to other cities, to pretty provincial towns that almost tempt him into moving to the woods and the lakeshores. Almost but not quite. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBut then one job goes wrong in a way Keller has never imagined and it leaves him with a big problem. Finding himself with an orphan on his hands, Keller\u0027s job begins to interfere with his carefully guarded life. And once you let someone in to your life, they tend to want to know what you do when you\u0027re away. And killing for a living, lucrative though it is, just doesn\u0027t find favour with some folks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/hit-man-keller-1.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/hit-man-keller-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:32 PM"}
