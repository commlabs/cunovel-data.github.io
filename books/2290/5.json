She had her notebook open, her pen in hand, seated in a large, overstuffed leather recliner while Jacob Peterson, her last patient of the day, sprawled on the sofa in her New Orleans office. She never suggested that anyone lie down; she simply suggested they get comfortable. For Jacob Peterson, being comfortable apparently meant half sitting, scrunched down in the sofa, legs sprawled out and fingers laced as he scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her first session with him, but over the years, she\u0027d worked with many teenagers like Jake, as well as adults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The basics,\" he murmured. \"The basics are that my folks are making me come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they\u0027re worried about you. Tell me, do you believe you\u0027re a vampire?\" She kept her tone serious, nonjudgmental.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have known years ago,\" the boy told her. \"I stay up all night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I understand. And it makes it very difficult for you to get to school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved a hand in the air. \"School is for mortals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Peterson-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake. Just call me Jake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake, let\u0027s say youare a vampire. Even vampires have to make a living.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned, startled. \"Vampires...have to make a living?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned forward. \"Jake, there are diseases that create a physiological desire to drink blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t deserve blood, Ineed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need blood, or you\u0027ve convinced yourself you need blood?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not the only one,\" he said defensively. \"Not the only one who needs blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m the person you should be seeing. I\u0027m a psychologist. If you reallyneed blood, we should be looking at a number of physical tests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"They-I-no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t find anything.\" He scowled again. \"Don\u0027t you understand? I\u0027m a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her head, hiding her sigh. She had had this very conversation so often. Too many people came to this part of the country because they thought they were vampires, or because they wanted to rebel and become part of a cult. Some had even committed murders, so convinced were they of their own supernatural tendencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought back to the horror she had seen in Transylvania. Perpetuated by men, or by pure evil?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iam a vampire,\" Jake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you first realize you were a vampire?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put down her notebook and uncrossed her legs, leaning forward. \"Jake, listen, you\u0027re in a lot of trouble. I just want to help you, but I can only do that if you\u0027ll tell what\u0027s really going on with you. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and leaned back against the sofa, looking tired. Much better than before, when his attitude had reeked of sheer hostility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake started to talk. As she had expected, he started off with esoteric words, trying to make her see a different world, one in which hewanted to exist. But once he started talking, his words flowed with very little encouragement from her. It became clear that Jake\u0027s case was very similar to several she had dealt with before. After all, this was New Orleans, city of voodoo and vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake was a brilliant kid, nice-looking, if a little thin. But he was shy and didn\u0027t speak to girls easily. He was great with a computer. He\u0027d read extensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd everything he had read he had skewed in a certain direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said there are others like you,\" she said softly. \"That you feel the urge for blood most often during nights when there\u0027s a full moon. And that you walk frequently during those nights. So...where do you walk? What do you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flushed a beet red suddenly. \"Um, well, once...I paid for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica frowned. \"Paid for...it? Do you mean sex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, that...and blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was New Orleans, too. Most diversions could be found somewhere-if you had the money to pay for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. You just wound up at a peep show, or...someone solicited you on the street, or...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was startled when she saw that her question had left him seriously perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake?\" she prodded gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I don\u0027t remember.\" He stared at her, still looking lost and confused. \"I mean...I knew that I had drunk blood. But now that you ask...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you alone?\" she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe confusion was gone. There was a hard mask in its place. \"I can\u0027t tell you who I was with. Iwon\u0027t tell you who I was with. You can\u0027t make me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not forcing you to do anything,\" she said with a shrug. \"Tell me what you want, but I hope you\u0027ll learn to speak freely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are others. Many others. And more are coming,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again he appeared confused. Her heartbeat quickened. This was worrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not the only one,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m concerned about you, Jake,\" she told him. \"And since I can\u0027t make you tell me anything, I\u0027ll tell you what I think, and we\u0027ll leave it at that. You have friends who feel as you do, and you were out with one or more of them. I don\u0027t think you had a particular destination in mind, and you wandered into a bad area, where you were accosted. Don\u0027t take offense-you were easy prey. And when you left, you were probably minus every cent you had in your wallets, and maybe a nice watch or some jewelry, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand instantly went to his throat, though he wasn\u0027t wearing any kind of medallion. His lips tightened, and she could tell that she had hit on the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake, I want you to do a couple of things for me. First, we\u0027ll rule nothing out, okay? So I\u0027m going to have you go to your primary-care physician and get a complete physical, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I\u0027m fine. I just-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, because it would be good for you, you\u0027re going to see a nutritionist and start on an exercise program.\" Before he could start complaining, she added, \"Jake, I know you\u0027re extremely intelligent and can slide right through all your schoolwork, and that part of the reason you don\u0027t care if you make it to class is that you\u0027re way ahead of most of the work going on. That may mean you need to skip ahead, or start adding some university classes onto your schedule. We have a long way to go to get to the root of your unhappiness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not unhappy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flushed again, looking down. \"I just don\u0027t belong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll find out where youdo belong. And where you want to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Games,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to design computer games. I think I could do it. I think I\u0027d be good at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet you would be,\" she assured him. \"Next week, same time. And I\u0027ll give your parents a call to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you couldn\u0027t repeat anything I said here,\" he demanded angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to repeat anything. I just want them to get you set up with the right professionals. Now, if you want to say anything else, if you think we haven\u0027t covered anything, we still have a few minutes,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was startled when he stood and took a step that brought him right in front of her chair. His eyes were alight; he was tense, excited. \"I heard you were there,\" he told her. \"In Transylvania. I read about it in the paper. I heard you blew the whistle on the vampires, that you were the one who called the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, this again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t intend to be secretive and feed into his fantasies. She stared at him levelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met some students over there. One of them left me a note, and I passed it on to the police,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was startled again when he set his hands on the arms of the chair. Leaned down and looked deeply into her eyes. \"Aren\u0027t you afraid? Afraid the vampires will come after you-for revenge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared straight back into his eyes and let out a weary sigh. \"From what I heard, Jake, someone freaked out way before the police got there, and the party was already over. Am I afraid the vampires will come after me? No. Feel free to stay if you have something important to discuss, Jake, but if you\u0027re just trying to turn the tables here, forget it. Okay?\" Her voice was calm and steady. Bored. He had expected to get a rise out of her, but she knew better than to let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, pushing away from the chair. \"Sure sounded like a hell of a party,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, great party. A girl is still in the hospital,\" Jessica said, making a mental note to drop by the hospital over the weekend. She had left Romania soon after the students\u0027 parents had arrived, but she knew from the newspaper that Mary had been brought home to a New Orleans hospital. The papers had turned the event into a decadent costume party and little more, but anything that mentioned vampires intrigued the public, and even the national papers had picked up the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jake was gone, she walked to the front desk. Since they were expecting a lodger, she\u0027d sent Stacey home early. Now she pulled out her appointment book, curious to see what her schedule was for the following Monday. When she opened the book, she sat back thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy had made an appointment for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan MacAllistair felt he\u0027d arrived at the perfect time in New Orleans-not just the season, but the time of day, as well-when he first stood in front of the old Montresse place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead heat of the day was gone, and night was just coming on. It came softly, perhaps deceptively, to this area of the French Quarter, just beyond reach of the neon lights, the blare of the music and the laughter of inebriated tourists. Here, only the faint sounds of a distant waltz could be heard, or perhaps they were only imagined as shadows fell over leafy trees. The Montresse house stood back beyond a brick wall and iron gate, gently cradled by the darkness. The night was kind, he thought. There was no aura of decay about the place. The grounds were slightly overgrown, and looked as if the paint were threatening to peel but hadn\u0027t quite reached the point where it was willing to abandon the splendor of the facade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the house for a while. Then he found the hinge on the wrought-iron gate and entered, following the stone path from the sidewalk to the porch. Montresse House was old, built when there was still space to be had in the French Quarter. There was a graceful lawn, dotted with flowers and trees that dripped lazily with moss. The porch was more reminiscent of an old plantation house rather than a city dwelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he walked, he was aware that, above him, from a window on the second floor, a curtain had been pulled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arrival was being watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shrug, he stepped up on the porch and reached for the heavy door knocker, but before he could touch it, the door swung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman standing there appeared to be in her early twenties. She had a pretty face and a cheerful smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" he returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the professor the travel agency booked?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s me. Bryan MacAllistair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool. Come on in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped inside, and the woman shut the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Stacey LeCroix, Ms. Fraser\u0027s assistant. Welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. This place sounded like heaven,\" he said. \"It\u0027s a beautiful house. Is Ms. Fraser from New Orleans? Has she owned the house forever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, Jessica\u0027s from...actually, I\u0027m not sure where she\u0027s from originally, but she was practicing in Jacksonville before she came here. She\u0027d been here for a few years before I started working for her. I know about the house, though-a friend had been keeping an eye open for her and called her when it came up on the market. But, you\u0027re absolutely right. It\u0027s beautiful. Come on. I\u0027ll show you around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sweeping staircase was the central focus of the foyer, and he could well imagine being swept back through the decades to a time when cotton was king and Southern belles had whisked along the hallways in elegant ballgowns. There were broad double doors to both the right and left, closed now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ladies\u0027 parlor was to your left and the men\u0027s smoking room to the right. Of course, we prohibit smoking in the house, though your room has access to the wraparound balcony, just in case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A cigar here and there,\" he told her, shrugging. Her expression clearly displayed what she thought of cigar smoke, but he refused to back down. \"However, I prefer my cigars with good brandy, right time, right place,\" he told her reassuringly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humph,\" she murmured. \"Well, in the morning, the doors to the right are open and it\u0027s a lovely dining room. The original dining room is Ms. Fraser\u0027s office. The bedrooms are upstairs. If you lose your key or have any maintenance problems, there\u0027s a groundskeeper\u0027s cottage just to the rear of the main house-you can reach it through the yard. Ms. Fraser and I both work but Gareth Miller, our handyman, is just about always around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" Bryan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set one foot on the first step of the stairway, and turned, an uncertain look on her face. \"You\u0027re a professor, right?\" she asked. He had the feeling that she was uncertain, and irritated with herself because of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, just as the booking agency promised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, still frowning. \"Of course. Um...sorry. Follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp the stairs and to the left, she opened the first door on the right side of the hallway. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be very comfortable,\" she assured him. \"The bath was added soon after the turn of the last century. Deco fixtures,\" she said proudly. \"We do charge a bit more than most, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worth every cent,\" he assured her, and he meant it. The room was huge, and the bath was really something. The room itself offered a queen-size bed, the usual modern entertainment center, a period dresser with a contemporary coffeemaker and microwave, a nineteenth-century desk with a printer and fax machine, and an ample closet. French doors opened out to the wraparound balcony. He strode out, inhaling the rich scent of new-grown foliage, and noting the attractive garden and small pool below. The backyard wasn\u0027t vast, but it was big enough to offer the swimming pool-blessed relief in the dead heat of summer, he was certain-and a small patio and garden. And from back here, the street might as well have been a million miles away. The house was a treasure and, he surmised, worth a small fortune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned. Stacey LeCroix was waiting just inside the room, watching him, still looking uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s perfect,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Yes, isn\u0027t it? Sorry, I must be a little tired today. I...never mind. Ok, what else? Maid service only if you\u0027re out of the room by twelve. We only have two women who come in, and they both have school-age children. If you don\u0027t find anyone in the dining room in the morning, you\u0027ll find apetit dejeuner set up on the patio. And you\u0027re welcome downstairs anytime, except in the office or our private apartments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s all you have? That backpack?\" she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then...I hope you\u0027ll be comfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled a little awkwardly. \"Oh, your key.\" She dug into her skirt pocket and produced a key. \"It opens both the front door and your room, and please try not to lose it. We\u0027re not set up with computer cards, so it\u0027s the real key thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I seldom lose things,\" he assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to hear it.\" She stared at him for a moment longer, then left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the door behind her and walked to the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes. If he listened, he could hear the faint sounds of the city. To the rear, all was tranquil. And yet, out there, New Orleans teemed with life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight was falling, darkness sweeping down...with a hint of red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica stood in the doorway, staring at her wide-eyed assistant as Stacey caught hold of her arm and pulled her back out to the front porch, closing the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God what?\" Jessica demanded, amused to see Stacey lose her cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gorgeous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" Jessica asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The professor. Wait till you see him. I just...I had to warn you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Warn me? Why? Is he dangerous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. I\u0027d have never opened the door to someone who looked as if he\u0027d...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if he\u0027d what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be dangerous. He just wasn\u0027t what I expected,\" Stacey assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a prerequisite to be ugly to be a professor,\" Jessica said, still amused. And she was glad to be amused, she realized. Nothing had seemed right since she\u0027d returned from Romania. The sky continued to bother her. And even her sessions with kids like Jake seemed disturbing, even though she\u0027d worked with plenty of kids before who had been acting out fantasies, looking for attention. Looking to belong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, laugh at me,\" Stacey said a little indignantly. \"Wait until you see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica stepped past her, entering the house, setting down her purse and briefcase. Stacey followed, hovering near her. Jessica shook her head, laughing. \"This isn\u0027t a big corporation,\" she whispered. \"You\u0027re welcome to have a crush on a guest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey flushed. \"Don\u0027t be silly. I\u0027m seeing Bobby Munro, and I wouldn\u0027t have a crush on a guest, anyway. He\u0027s just...oh, you\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure I will.\" She still felt a smile twitching her lips as she turned and walked back to the entry table to leaf through the mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hey,\" Stacey said, \"Big Jim wants to know if you\u0027re up for a game of Trivial Pursuit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Stacey\u0027s turn to laugh. \"Hey, Friday night, wild excitement, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha, ha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll do you good to have some fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I mean, your trip turned out to be...eventful,\" Stacey said. \"I only know what was in the papers, but it sounded pretty awful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My heart bleeds for those kids, but I\u0027m fine. Don\u0027t go tiptoeing around my feelings. Thank you for your concern, but it\u0027s not necessary. I\u0027m not obsessed with it, so don\u0027t you be, okay?\" What a crock. It was all still there in her mind, no matter whom she was working with or what she was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned. \"Trivial Pursuit will be fine. I want to take a shower and chill out first, though. Will you call Big Jim back for me? Tell him about eight. We\u0027ll play here. Who else is coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I\u0027ll call him. And Bobby and I will be there, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should invite Gareth, as well. And there\u0027s always Barry Larson. You know, the keyboard player.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one with the crush on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s taken care of. He knows I\u0027m not interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Stacey said. \"Strange guy. It\u0027s like he wants so badly to belong. He wants to be invited over here all the time. Maybe he has a crush on the house, not you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. But you know what? I don\u0027t think I will call him. Just Gareth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey shook her head. \"Gareth isn\u0027t just reclusive these days-he doesn\u0027t even seem to want to come in for a cup of coffee. I bet he won\u0027t come\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica frowned. Gareth had always been shy. He had come with her when she bought the house, and she had been surprised he was willing to leave the small town outside Jacksonville where he had taken care of her house. But he was wonderful at keeping the place running, a true jack-of-all-trades, polite, and sincere in his gratitude for not only getting to live in the cottage, but receiving a generous paycheck. He was loyal to a fault, Jessica thought, and she was equally grateful to have him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey grinned and looked up the stairs. \"Maybehe\u0027ll come down and play. He\u0027s a professor-maybe he can beat you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he can. Or maybe he just wants to be left alone. I\u0027m going to run up and shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to call the Italian place and order in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey headed for the office, and Jessica started upstairs. It was getting dark way too early. The time hadn\u0027t changed yet, though it would soon. Still, the last nights had seemed...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark. Dark, and far too...red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet a life, she told herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a soft voice added,A real one .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t head straight into her long, hot shower. She stayed out on the balcony, watching the evening come on with a strange, whispering, red malice. Ever since Romania...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip, glad she would be seeing Jeremy again on Monday, but dreading the day, as well. It seemed to be gathering again....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat \"it?\" she demanded irritably of herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evil that had walked in that distant country, that seemed to come with the night and fill the air, whispering all around her, touching her....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned abruptly, certain someone else was on the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was alone. Had a door just closed? Had their guest been out there, watching her, as she had watched the night? She squared her shoulders. She was no easily intimidated child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could handle whatever came her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t give way to whispers on the breeze that seemed to touch her with fingers of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A life,\" she said softly out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetermined, she walked inside. No shower tonight. A bath. As hot as she could take it, long and sudsy and relaxing. And if she still had that old brandy decanter in her room somewhere, she would sip while she soaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t think about what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, she would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause she was obsessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I want this man on my team all the time!\" Stacey exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I say? I know my European history,\" Bryan said with a shrug. He had been wondering how to get to know both women better when Stacey had surprised him with a knock on his door and an invitation to play Trivial Pursuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe owner of the house, however, had yet to make it downstairs. But they had decided to play a few practice rounds, so he had pinched up with Stacey, while her boyfriend, a cop named Bobby, had teamed up with the massive sax player.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Jim gave a deep, rich laugh. \"You do seem to be something of a walking encyclopedia, MacAllistair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe offered the sax player a rueful smile. \"Occupational hazard,\" he explained. He had liked the other man from the moment he met him. There was a serenity about him that seemed to come from wisdom rather than simply from knowledge. He had the ability to make a stranger feel as if they had been friends for life. Bryan thought he would be good to have around in an emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re no slouch yourself,\" Bryan commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Jim\u0027s smile was vast. \"I do all right.\" He laughed again. \"Maybe, when the nights are too quiet, I just study all the cards and learn all the answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\" Stacey gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Jim\u0027s deep laughter boomed again. \"No, but maybe I should start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He comes from a long line of voodoo priestesses,\" Stacey said, as if that explained something about the man\u0027s abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and I just come from a long line of cops,\" Bobby said with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have all the sports stuff down,\" Stacey said, patting his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027ve got all the answers,\" Bobby said, and rolled his eyes. \"That\u0027s why you ditched me for the professor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and I\u0027m sticking with him,\" Stacey said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re giving up on me?\" a new voice, feminine, rich and melodic, chimed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan turned to see who had spoken, and it was as if he had been struck by lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a beautiful woman, but then again, the world was filled with beautiful women. She was about five six, slender but curved, with golden-blond hair that swept sensually down her back, and deep blue eyes. It wasn\u0027t just her appearance that was arresting; it was the way she moved, her casual ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the fact that she seemed to touch a distant, forgotten chord in his soul, the fact that she was so very much like...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone long gone. Someone who should have been entirely erased from his mind by time gone by. He had met women before who had touched a core of memory in him. Something about them the same, the way they looked, spoke, moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing like this. Never like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, ready to introduce himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you made it down at last,\" Stacey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, sorry, the hot-bath thing was more seductive than I\u0027d imagined,\" Jessica Fraser mumbled, coming into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped. And stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two haven\u0027t met yet,\" Stacey said. She was clearly amused, enjoying her friend\u0027s hastily concealed reaction to him. There was anI told you so smirk on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" Jessica murmured, stepping forward with a welcoming smile and extending a hand. \"Welcome to the Montresse House. I must say, you don\u0027t look like...well, what I had imagined.\" She blushed, then added, \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand. The feeling of being touched by lightning, shot through by a bolt of fire, hit him again. He stared back at her, forcing a casual smile and an apologetic shrug. \"No apology necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica nodded and chose a chair at the other end of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Jim smiled at her. \"We\u0027ve been practicing, getting into the groove while we waited,\" he said. \"We can start for real now. I\u0027ll have you and Bobby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three against two,\" Jessica said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gareth turned us down,\" Stacey commented. \"But that\u0027s okay. I\u0027ve got the professor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feeling confident, aren\u0027t you?\" Jessica asked Stacey, but she was staring at Bryan, and he knew he was staring back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something about her....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and leaned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let the game begin,\" he said softly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kiss-of-darkness-alliance-vampires-7/page-5.html","bookId":2290,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:40 PM"}
