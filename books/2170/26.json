Without god-powers, conscious reasoning cannot explore and make this universe absolutely known; there must remain mysteries beyond what is explained. The only reason in this universe is that which you, in your ungodlike hubris, project onto the universe. In this, you retain kinship with your most primitive ancestors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Raja Thomas, Shiprecords\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAS SHE stood frozen in terror of the foul-breathed stranger, Hali tried to think of a safe response. The terrible differences of this place where Ship had projected her compounded her sense of helplessness. The dust of the throng which followed the beaten man, the malignant odors, the passions in the voices, the milling movements against a single su....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know him?\" The man was insistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHali wanted to say she had never before seen the injured man but something told her this could not be true. There had been something disquietingly familiar about that man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did he speak to me of God and knowing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould that have been another Shipman projected here? Why had the wounded man seemed so familiar? And why had he addressed her directly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell me.\" Foul-breath was slyly persistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came a long way to see him.\" The old voice which Ship had provided her sounded groveling, but the words were true. She felt it in these old bones she had borrowed. Ship would not lie to her and Ship had said this.... a very great distance. Whatever this event signified, Ship had brought her expressly to see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t place your accent,\" Foul-breath said. \"Are you from Sidon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved after the crowd and spoke distractedly to the inquisitor who kept pace with her. \"I come from Ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat were those people doing with the wounded man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ship? I\u0027ve never heard of that place. Is it part of the Roman March?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ship is far away. Far away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat were they doing up on that hill? Some of the soldiers had taken the piece of tree and stretched it on the ground. She glimpsed the activity through the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how can Yaisuah say that you know God\u0027s will?\" Foul-breath demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis caught her attention. Yaisuah? Ship had said that name. It was the name Ship said had become Geezus and then Hesoos. Jesus. She hesitated, stared at her inquisitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You call that one Yaisuah?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know him by some other name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped her arm hard. There was no mistaking the avaricious cunning in his voice and manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShip intruded on her then. This one is a Roman spy, an informer who works for those who torture Yaisuah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know him?\" Foul-breath demanded. He gave her arm a painful shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think thi.... Yaisuah is related to Ship,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Related t.... How can someone be related to a place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t he related to You, Ship?\" She spoke the question aloud without thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ship says that\u0027s true,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFoul-breath dropped her arm and stepped back two paces. An angry scowl twisted his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crazy! You\u0027re nothing but a crazy old woman! You\u0027re just as crazy as that one!\" He gestured up the hill where the armored men had taken Yaisuah. \"See what happens to crazies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked where he had pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men already hanging there were roped to the cross-pieces and she realized they were being left to die. That was going to happen to Yaisuah!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the full realization hit her, Hali began to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShip spoke within her mind: Tears do little to improve acuity. You must observe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiped her eyes on a corner of her robe, observing that Foul-breath had moved up into the crowd. She forced herself to climb up with him, pressing in among the people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must observe!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe armored ones were stripping the robe from Yaisuah. This exposed his wounds - cuts and bruises all over his body. He stood with a stolid watchfulness through all this, not even responding to the gasp which went up when the mob saw his wounds. There was an unguarded vulnerability to this moment, as though everyone here was participating in his own personal death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone off to the left shouted: \"He\u0027s a carpenter! Don\u0027t tie him on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral large, crudely wrought nails were pressed up through that part of the crowd and thrust into the hands of an armored young man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers took up the cry: \"Nail him on! Nail him on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo of the armored men supported Yaisuah on either side now. His head swayed slightly from side to side, then bowed. Things were being thrown at him from the far side of the crowd but he made no attempt to dodge. Hali saw stones strike hi.... an occasional glob of spittle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all s.... so bizarre, played in an orange glow of mute sunlight coming through a high layer of thin clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHali blinked the tears from her eyes. Ship said she had to observe this! Very wel.... She estimated that she stood no more than six meters from Yaisuah\u0027s left shoulder. He appeared to be a wiry man, probably active through most of his adult life, but now he was near the point of exhaustion. Her med-tech training told her that Yaisuah could survive this, given proper care, but she had the impression that he did not want such care, that none of this surprised him. If anything, he seemed anxious to get on with it. Perhaps that was the reaction of a tortured animal, cornered and beyond all will to fight or flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she watched, he lifted his head slowly and turned to face her. She saw then the slight glow about him, an aura such as she had seen around her own body when Ship had projected her away fro....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he also a projection of Ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw that there was a debate going on among the armored men. The nails were being waved in front of one of them by the one who had taken them from the crowd at the far side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYaisuah was looking at her, compelling her attention. She saw recognition in his eyes, the lift of eyebrow.... a suggestion of surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShip intruded: Yaisuah knows where you are from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre You projecting him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat flesh lives here as flesh, Ship said. But there is something more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething mor.... That\u0027s why You brought me here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it, Ekel? What is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no mistaking the eagerness in Ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has another body somewhere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Ekel. No!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cringed before Ship\u0027s disappointment, forcing herself to a peak of alertness which her fears demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething mor.... something mor.... She saw something then, a significance of the aura. Time does not confine him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is very close, Ekel. Ship was pleased and this reassured her, but it did not remove the pressure from the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is something of him which Time cannot hold, she thought. Death will not release him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou please Me, Ekel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy washed through her to be cut off abruptly by Ship\u0027s demanding intrusion: Now! Watch this!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe armored men had settled their argument. Two of them threw Yaisuah to the ground, stretching his arms along the timber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother took the nails and using a rock for a hammer began nailing Yaisuah\u0027s wrists to the wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone shouted from the crowd: \"If you\u0027re the son of God, let\u0027s see you get yourself out of this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHali heard jeering laughter all around her. She had to clasp her hands across her breast, forcing herself not to rush forward. This was barbarous! She trembled with frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are all children of Ship!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to shout this to these fools. It was the lesson of her earliest WorShip classes, the admonition of the Chaplain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo soldiers lifted the length of wood, hoisting the man who was nailed to it by his wrists. He gasped as they moved him. Four soldiers, two on each side of him, lifted the timber on their spear points into a notch on a tall post which stood upright between the other two victims. Another soldier scrambled up a crude ladder behind the post and lashed the crosspiece into the notch. Two more soldiers moved up to Yaisuah\u0027s dangling feet. While one soldier crossed the ankles, the other nailed the feet to the upright. Blood ran down the wood from the wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to open her mouth wide and breathe in gulping gasps to keep from fainting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the brown eyes flash with sudden agony as a soldier shook the upright to test its firmness. Yaisuah slumped forward unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy are they causing him such pain? What do they want him to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHali pressed forward in the suddenly silent throng, elbowing her way through with a strength which she found surprising in this old body. She had to see it close. She had to see. Ship had commanded her to observe. It was difficult moving in the press of people even with the strength of her inner drive. And she suddenly became aware of the breath-held silence in the throng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy were they so silent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as though the answer had been flashed on her eyes. They want Yaisuah to stop this by some secret power in him. They want a miracle! They still want a miracle from him. They want Shi.... God to reach out of the sky and stop this brutal travesty. They do this thing and they want a god to stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed herself past two more people and found that she had achieved the inner ring of the crowd. There were only the three timber constructions now, the three bodie....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could still save him, she thought. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-26.html","bookId":2170,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM"}
