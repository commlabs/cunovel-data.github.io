In the Dark Abyss, wealth was proportional to strength. Only powerful abyssals had the right to be wealthy. Otherwise, even if one came from a great family they still wouldn’t obtain any wealth. To abyssals, they were incredibly indifferent to family kin relationships.

This was because the more beautiful these young girls were, the happier they seemed, the easier it was for them to be bought. And, the fate that awaited them was truly pitiful. For instance, if an abyssal species that only had males were to purchase one, then that woman would end up being a body for those abyssals to reproduce.

The slaves of Black Sand City were clearly priced and there was basically no way of haggling with a counteroffer. The only exception was if one wished to purchase en masse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"\u003eAnd the reason Lin Ming came this time was for such a mass purchase.
