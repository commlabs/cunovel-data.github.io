Is everything okay?\" she asks softly. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take in a giant breath, then sob again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, what\u0027s wrong?\" I hear her ask. \"Do you need any money? Is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep shaking my head, unable to speak. \"Are you in trouble?\" she asks. \"Victor?\" \"No, no, baby, no,\" I say, wiping my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, you\u0027re scaring me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just, it\u0027s just, this is my worst suit,\" I say, trying to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wardrobe dressed me.
