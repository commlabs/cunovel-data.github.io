Mean, aye, as that Letherii army could attest to, oh yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Letherii magic had faded, crashed away as if to nothing in the distance, there had been a cry from Sinn, and Balm had seen with his own eyes Grub dancing about on the foredeck. And then everyone else had seen that blue-white dome of swirling light, rising up from where the Letherii magic had come down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did it mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCord and Shard had gone up to Sinn, but she wasn’t talking which was a shock to them all. And all Grub said was something that nobody afterwards could even agree on, and since Balm hadn’t heard it himself he concluded that Grub probably hadn’t said anything at all, except maybe ‘I got to pee’ which explained all that dancing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Could it be that Letherii magic turned them all into dust?’ Throatslitter wondered now as he walked on the dew-laden field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And left the grasses growing wild?’ Masan Gilani countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Something over here,’ Deadsmell said from ten or so paces on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalm and Throatslitter dismounted and joined Masan Gilani-slightly behind her to either side. And the three of them set off after Deadsmell, who was now fast disappearing in the gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Slow up there, Corporal!’ It’s not like the Universal Lodestone is bouncing up there with you, is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey saw that Deadsmell had finally halted, standing before a grey heap of something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What did you find?’ Balm asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Looks like a shell midden,’ Throatslitter muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hah, always figured you for a fisher’s spawn.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Spawn, ha ha, that’s so funny, Sergeant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yeah? Then why ain’t you laughing? On second thought, don’t-they’ll hear it in the city and get scared. Well, scareder than they already are.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey joined Deadsmell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s a damned barrow,’ said Throatslitter. ‘And look, all kinds of Malazan stuff on it. Gods, Sergeant, you don’t think all that’s left of all those marines is under this mound?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalm shrugged. ‘We don’t even know how many made it this far. Could be six of ‘em. In fact, it’s a damned miracle any of ‘em did in the first place.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No no,’ Deadsmell said. ‘There’s only one in there, but that’s about all I can say, Sergeant. There’s not a whisper of magic left here and probably never will be. It’s all been sucked dry.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘By the Letherii?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corporal shrugged. ‘Could be. That ritual was a bristling pig of a spell. Old magic, rougher than what comes from warrens.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasan Gilani crouched down and touched a badly notched Malazan shortsword. ‘Looks like someone did a lot of hacking with this thing, and if they made it this far doing just that, well, beat-up or not, a soldier doesn’t just toss it away like this.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Unless the dead one inside earned the honour,’ Deadsmell said, nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So,’ Masan concluded, ‘a Malazan. But just one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, just the one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened. ‘So where are the rest of them?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Start looking for a trail or something,’ Balm said to Masan Gilani.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all watched her head off into the gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen smiled at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara Yil walked up to where stood the Adjunct. ‘Most of the squads are back,’ she reported. ‘Pickets are being set now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Has Sergeant Balm returned?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not yet, Adjunct.’ She hesitated, then added, ‘Fist Keneb would have sent a runner.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavore turned slightly to regard her. ‘Would he?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara Yil blinked. ‘Of course. Even at full strength-which we know would be impossible-he doesn’t have the soldiers to take Letheras. Adjunct, having heard nothing, we have to anticipate the worst.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the battle, Lostara Yil had remained close to her commander, although at no point was the Adjunct in any danger from the Letherii. The landing had been quick, professional. As for the battle, classic Malazan, even without the usual contingent of marines to augment the advance from the shoreline. Perfect, and brutal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Letherii were already in poor shape, she saw. Not from any fight, but from a fast march from well inland-probably where the wave of sorcery had erupted. Disordered in their exhaustion, and in some other, unaccountable way, profoundly rattled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr so had been the Adjunct’s assessment, after watching the enemy troops form ranks. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-427.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
