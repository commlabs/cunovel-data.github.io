He had found Amanda’s scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Kane skidded to a stop, sliding a couple of feet, then returning to a closed door. Tucker met his partner there. A tiny window revealed a long washbasin, a wall of sterilized green packs, and packets of cellophane-sealed scrub brushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA surgical prep room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda’s trail led here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat earlier chill spread up his spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding his pistol at the ready, he shouldered through the door and scanned the space for any hostiles. Empty. But a wide window looked into a neighboring surgical suite. A woman lay sprawled and draped atop a stainless-steel table, her upper body locked into some device. A robotic arm vibrated above her shaved head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had studied the photo of the president’s daughter well enough to recognize her from her features alone. Kane pawed at the door into the operating theater. He knew the truth, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker hurried into the surgical room, finding the place otherwise deserted. A whirring buzz drew his attention back to Amanda. He stepped to her side, aghast as he recognized the source of the noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood flowed in a thick rivulet from a drill bit burrowing into her skull. He dashed around the table, unsure what to do. Kane danced at his side, reading his anxiety but not knowing how to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay, buddy,” he assured his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was far from okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker followed the electrical cord from the robotic arm to a workstation. Not knowing what else to do, he yanked out the wall plug. The whining drone died away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker studied Amanda, watching her chest rise and fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least she’s still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied the length of steel still embedded in her head. He had to free her, but how? He dared not yank that drill free or risk more damage to her skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe searched around and saw what looked like a miniature set of bolt cutters—surgical pin cutters. He grabbed them up, positioned them along the shaft of the burr, about an inch from Amanda’s skull, and pinched the cutters closed. A loud snap, and she was free of the robotic arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, Tucker set about detaching her from the cushioned head clamp and unhooking her from the anesthetic machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFocused on the task, he was startled to hear a voice ask, “What’s that sticking out of her head?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung around. Kowalski limped toward him on a bloody foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you find me?” Tucker asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Followed the trail of dead bodies. Then saw him in the hall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane panted at the doorway, guarding Tucker’s back, as usual, making sure no hostiles crept up on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski again pointed to Amanda’s skull. “What is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A drill bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Why—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How the hell do I know? Just help me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got her.” Kowalski stepped over and scooped Amanda into his arms as if she weighed no more than a scarecrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe that’s all she is—a scarecrow with no brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, she needed help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are Gray and Seichan?” Tucker asked, collecting his dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski headed toward the door with Amanda. “Trust me, you’re better off not knowing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:46 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan and Gray retreated farther down the hall, away from the silvery horde as it crashed against the fiery, melted doorway. A brush against the molten metal incinerated several of the automatons. Those that made it past then did a strange thing: they circled and returned to the doorway, ignoring Gray and Seichan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the moment, the horde remained clustered at the doorway, scrabbling over the red-hot metal, attacking it, burning themselves, even melting into the molten remains of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the heat,” Seichan said. “That’s what draws them. They must be programmed to hunt body heat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, it seemed, any hot source would do. Beyond the doorway, Gray watched several of them rushing to the molten patches of steel on the floor, destroying themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as the steel began to cool, the occasional automaton tried to skitter their way. A few well-placed rounds discouraged such trespassing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan glanced back. “Should we start looking—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire world shook with a sonic boom, strong enough to knock Gray to one knee. After that thunderous eruption, a strong vibration persisted, humming strongly enough to make his back molars ache. A change in air pressure made his ears pop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan shared a glance with Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fear in her eyes matched his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few inches of water suddenly flowed into the hallway, as if from a burst pipe. Gray pictured the pylon that hid this base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was really just one monstrous pipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore icy water began surging, swirling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski appeared around a corner of the hall, splashing toward them, holding an unconscious woman in his arms. Her head lolled toward Gray as Kowalski shifted her higher in his arms. Despite the lack of hair, he immediately recognized her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda … she’s alive!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they didn’t have time to celebrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s happening?” Kowalski hollered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker and Kane followed him, both looking equally concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan bent down, dipped a finger, and tasted it. “Salty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat left no doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ve busted their own pipe,” Gray said and pointed to the elevator. “Place is flooding. Out! Now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:55 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe often give our enemies the means to our own destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward remembered that quote from Aesop, learned back in his Eton College days when he was a young boy. Though taken out of context now, it still felt apt as he watched the annihilation from the window of the small evacuation boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air-lock-sealed boats were positioned like blisters along the circumference of the center pylon. Tracks ran up the outside of the column and across the underside of the support platform, traveling out along the five arms of the star—until they were jettisoned free of the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrols already awaited the evacuees’ arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially the precious cargo Edward held in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newborn, swaddled warmly and mewling softly, held so much promise: both for those Edward served and himself. The child was insurance that he would be saved from a watery grave. He had placed a frantic call upon securing the child, reporting the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut word had already reached the source of that cold, computerized voice. MATTERS ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF. ENSURE THE CHILD IS SAFE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe intended to do just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared out the window. The boat could hold ten people, but he and Petra had the vessel to themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the boat, the world was as dark as the deepest cavern. He had watched the flashes of blue lightning along the length of the central pylon as they made their escape, the explosive charges shattering the steel inside the concrete walls, weakening the entire structure. The immense mass of the tower above would continue that destruction, pulverizing and crushing all beneath it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasn’t just this one pylon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the darkness, blue lightning bloomed and burst across the forest of stone out there, corrupting the entire understory of the island. Thunder echoed and shook their boat. For a moment, the world beyond appeared like an electric forest in the night, wondrous to behold, breathtaking in its devastation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered another proverb as he stared, pining for the simpler times of his youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll good things must come to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:56 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Run!” Gray yelled and pointed to the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, the team slogged through calf-deep icy water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski hauled Amanda, high-stepping his way, wary of any straggling steel spiders in the lobby. But the last of the automatons had succumbed to the icy flood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made it to the elevators, which still had power—but for how long? Gray hit the call button to open the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother violent quake shook the facility, accompanied by a muffled boom as something gave way. A surge of water rolled down the hallway, funneling toward them, building power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors opened, too slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wave of water hit them, driving them into the cage. They were waist-deep in seconds. The cold cut to the bone. Already shivering, Seichan hurried and pressed the lobby button. Gray held his breath. They all stared up, silently praying the motors still had power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pictured the turbines he’d seen above—the key word being above. The main power generators should still be high and dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis proved to be the case, as the elevator began to rise. The water level steadily drained as the cage lifted out of the rising flood. They all let out a loud sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft groan rose from Amanda as the effects of the anesthetic began to wear off. A promising sign, despite the piece of surgical drill still lodged in her skull. Once safe, they could attempt—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mighty shake threw them all to one side of the cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Gray’s ears popped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low rumble rose beneath them, growing louder, sounding like a freight train hurling straight at them. He pictured a column of water chasing up the elevator shaft as the pylon’s caisson finally imploded beneath them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re passing the service levels,” Seichan said, reaching a hand to his forearm, squeezing all her hope into that rock-hard grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey should be safe once the elevator climbed above sea level and reached the dry lobby above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the lights went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir ascent came to a shaky stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski swore brightly in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The generators,” Seichan whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe floodwaters must have swamped that level—and continued to rise. The roar of the freight train grew to a howl beneath them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on!” Gray shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA force struck the underside of the carriage, driving the cage up the shaft in a bone-jarring, rattling ascent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least they were headed in the right direction—but for how long?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tucker, help me get the doors open!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray knew they would have only one chance. Once the powerful surge receded, the cage would go crashing back down with it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline-sigma-force-8/page-49.html","bookId":1527,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM"}
