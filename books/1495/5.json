Some were whispering amongst themselves, others were sitting quietly, thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men who were coming to tear down the building had not yet arrived, but Liu Changjie had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKong Lanjun had told him not to act rashly, and not to come to this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he came anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was the type of person who did things his own way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he entered the inn, everyone seemed to be frozen in shock—this was not who they were waiting for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than those people, no one else should have arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie seemed not to notice. He swaggered in and sat at the table the waiters had just set. “Bring me three cold appetizers, four hot dishes, and five bottles of ‘Jia Fan.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jia Fan” was a famous brand of wine in Hangzhou. Experienced drinkers said that the flavor was even more satisfying than “Ku Niang” wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiters stood by, panic-stricken, unsure whether or not to pour wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not an ordinary inn, but Liu Changjie treated it as if it were. With a smile, he beckoned at the seven young women and said, “Come over here, all of you. A man drinking without a woman to accompany him is like a plate of food with no salt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young women looked at him, and he looked at them. They seemed too terrified to even move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not a man-eating tiger,” said Liu Changjie. “What are you afraid of? Come on over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, laughter rang out, delicate, like the sound of silver bells. And then a charming voice could be heard, “I’m here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the laughter started, it appeared to be coming from very far away. But by the time the voice had finished speaking, its owner had already arrived. She flew in like a gust of wind, and sat down next to Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a woman, and a very beautiful woman at that. Not just beautiful, but entrancing, especially her two eyes, which had the ability to charm a person to their bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you looked at this person from all sides, you would say that from head to toe she was a woman, every inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie looked at her and laughed. “I want to drink with women!” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed charmingly. “Cant’ you see that I’m a woman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don\u0027t look like one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could I convince you I’m a woman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take off all your clothes, then we’ll see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression changed and she giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, someone outside spoke. “It looks like our friend here has a lot of experience with women. He can’t be fooled by a fake woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time these two sentences were uttered, there were five more people in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them had a pale white face, and was dressed in expensive garments. Clean shaven, with wrinkles in the corners of his eyes, it was a middle aged man who obviously was “Little Fifth Omniscient” Tang Qing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge, towering monk was clearly Iron Monk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ghost Meteor” Shan Yifei and “Soul Enticing” Lao Zhao were both sickly and old in appearance, looking like thirty percent ghost and seventy percent killers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Liu Changjie could never have anticipated was that Li the Mastiff was actually a refined, gentle-looking young man. Except that his face was covered in scars, and he was missing half an ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er had guessed correctly on all counts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Liu Changjie suddenly thought of something—she had only described six people, not seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right now, there were only six.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was the other person?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy hadn’t Hu Yue’er mentioned him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why wasn\u0027t he here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive of the people wore no smile on their face. Only Tang Qing was smiling, and he was clearly the person who had just spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed. “Your Excellency’s experience with women clearly is not any less than mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know me?” asked Tang Qing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I didn’t know your Excellency, how else could I know that you have a lot of experience with women?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing’s expression changed. With a stern voice, he said, “You came here looking for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I came here to drink,” replied Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You specifically came here to drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are thousands of places to drink in the world, why would you pick this place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I like this place. It’s new, and I’m a fickle person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the Iron Monk spoke out: “It just so happens that I really don’t like fickle people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you like?” asked Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like killing people. And I especially like killing fickle people such as yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Iron Monk had ferocious looking eyebrows and fierce eyes. His face was filled with hatred, and his eyes seethed with murderous intent. They were extremely frightening in appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie just laughed. “So you definitely want to kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guessed correctly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why haven’t you come over here to try?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Iron Monk was already moving forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis whole body appeared to be sculpted from steel, and his carriage as he walked was like that of a gorilla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis footsteps were heavy and stable, and every step he took left footprints behind in the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Iron Monk’s external power was clearly exceptional. As for his Thirteen Heroes Skill, who could say whether or not it had reached the level that his body was impervious to blades?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie had nothing in his hands, not even a kitchen knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing watched him the same way he might look at a corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gorgeously dressed young women were shaking in terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe joints in Iron Monk’s body made cracking sounds as he took four steps forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt appeared as if he was preparing all his kung fu to attack, and that this attack could clearly not be defended against.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before he could attack, the refined and gentle-looking young man suddenly lunged toward Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were blood red, and he opened his mouth to reveal a set of ghastly white teeth. He really did appear to be a wild dog, unable to refrain from ripping out Liu Changjie’s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like Liu Changjie didn’t even notice him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flash, he was looming over Liu Changjie’s body, his two hands grasping toward Liu Changjie’s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then strange snapping sound could be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie was still sitting there motionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi the Mastiff was also motionless. His two hands gripped Liu Changjie’s neck. Except, his own head was twisted at a strange angle, and his eyes bulged from their sockets. A strange expression covered his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, blood exploded from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood didn’t splash onto Liu Changjie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie’s body suddenly slid away like a fish, away from the woman and Li the Mastiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi the Mastiff toppled over onto the woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman didn’t move out of the way. Instead, she fell with him to the ground. She also had a bizarre expression on her face. Her eyes bulged from her face like those of a dead fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo faces looked at each other, two sets of eyes stared at each other. They fell to the ground, motionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo bodies, already growing cold and stiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing’s face was ashen. He knew they were dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, he had never seen Liu Changjie move a finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had seen Liu Changjie move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if he didn’t need to move a muscle to kill people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Iron Monk had stopped walking. Blue veins pulsed in his forehead, and cold sweat dripped down his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe liked to kill people, so he understood killing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd because of that, he was even more frightened than the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie let out a long sigh. “I said I don’t like to kill people. I just want to drink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing said, “But you just did kill people, two of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s because they wanted to kill me. And I didn’t want to die, because dead people can’t drink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soul Enticing” Lao Zhao suddenly said, “Okay! Let’s drink. I’ll drink with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed a pot of wine down onto the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe first poured himself a cup, and then poured one for Liu Changjie. “To you!” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe downed it in one gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two cups had been poured from one pot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie looked at the cup in front of him and laughed. “I didn’t come here to drink just one cup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoul Enticing Lao Zhao responded, “After you drink this cup, you can have another.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I drink this cup, I’ll never have a chance to drink a second.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoul Enticing Lao Zhao laughed coldly. “Don’t tell me you think the wine is poisoned?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Originally there was no poison in the wine. But there was poison on your pinky fingernail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoul Enticing Lao Zhao’s face twisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had poured the cup of wine for Liu Changjie, he had dipped his pinky fingernail in just a bit. His movement was nimble and dexterous, and impossible for others to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet Liu Changjie knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie looked at him and smiled. “The wine you drank originally didn’t have poison in it either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should be able to tell whether or not there’s poison in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoul Enticing Lao Zhao’s face suddenly darkened. He jumped up. “When did you make your move?” he shouted hoarsely. “When did you put the poison in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew you would want to drink from these cups, so when you went to get the wine, I put the poison in the cups. How I did it was very simple, even you could pull it off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoul Enticing Lao Zhao didn’t open his mouth again. It seemed as if an invisible rope was tightening around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breathing stopped, and he fell to the ground, his body convulsing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie sighed. “I don’t like killing people, but I was willing to kill three people just now. And yet the people who do like killing are just standing there motionless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Iron Monk said nothing. He just turned and dashed out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er had been correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople who like killing are the ones who are most afraid of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie had also been correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the monk was afraid to die, he had practiced a type of kung fu that could make his body impervious to blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as soon as he met someone who didn’t need blades to take the lives of others, he fled faster than anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost Meteor fled just as quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, the speed of his retreat really was like that of a meteor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing didn’t leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie looked at him and laughed. “Does your Excellency also want to come have a try?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing laughed. “Like you, I hate killing people. And like you, I came here to drink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like you, I have a lot of experience with women, and like you I am a fickle person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, we’re birds of a feather! Let’s have some drinks and chat. We can be friends.” Smiling, he walked over and sat down. “After all, there are wine and women here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s definitely sufficient wine for us two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing laughed. “And there are sufficient women, as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The women aren’t sufficient,” replied Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not sufficient?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even though there are enough women, they just aren’t pretty enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing laughed loudly. “So, it turns out your Excellency’s way of looking at things is a bit more refined than mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, these women aren’t really ugly, it’s just that they can’t really make you sick with love.” \u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile on Tang Qing’s face suddenly froze. He looked at Liu Changjie in amazement. He appeared even more shocked than when he had just observed Liu Changjie kill the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally understood Liu Changjie’s purpose, but he still could not believe any person would have this amount of guts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie began tapping a cup with a chopstick, and slowly sang: “It’s said that you should never be sick with love, because lovesickness will make you grow old\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But after you consider it over and over again, you realize that lovesickness really is better, lovesickness really is better…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing took in a deep breath, and then forced out a laugh. “So, your Excellency specifically came to this place to look for lovesickness?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie sighed. “What in the world is better than lovesickness?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” replied Tang Qing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing’s eyes turned up in thought, and then he smiled eerily. “Your humble self also knows a song. I’d like to sing it for your Excellency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie let out a breath. “Listening to men sing is boring, unless it’s your own singing. But, if you really want to sing, go ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing began singing, “It’s said that you should never be sick with love, because lovesickness will make you grow old,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you grow old, you will eventually die, and dying is never good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie shook his head firmly. “Not very good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing said, “Maybe my singing voice isn’t very good, but the words are true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie had to agree. “Correct. The truth never sounds good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If your Excellency wants to find lovesickness, you’ll not only grow old, you’ll grow old exceptionally quick. Which means you will die sooner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you afraid of death?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who in the world isn’t afraid of death?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me.” He stared at Tang Qing, and continued coldly, “Because you are afraid of death, and I am not, you will take me there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing continued to play dumb. “Take you where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To find lovesickness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing forced himself to smile. “And what if I can’t find it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you will never grow old,” replied Liu Changjie evenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Qing couldn’t force himself to smile any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe understood Liu Changjie’s meaning—only dead people don’t grow old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie continued to stare at him. “They say that you guard a mountain cave for her. Since you’re here, then she’s definitely guarding the cave herself.
