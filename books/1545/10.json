Oh…bad thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t like the idea of walking to the other side of the cave, especially through that flea market of heavy machinery and cow carcasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did all this stuff get down here?” I felt the need to whisper, but my voice echoed anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabeth scanned the scene. She obviously didn’t like what she saw. “They must’ve lowered the bulldozer in pieces and assembled it down here,” she decided. “I think that’s how they dug the subway system a long time ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the other junk?” I asked. “The cars and, um, meat products?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe furrowed her eyebrows. “Some of it looks like street vendor merchandise. Those purses and coats…the giant must’ve brought them down here for some reason.” She gestured toward the bulldozer. “That thing looks like it’s been through combat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my eyes adjusted to the gloom, I saw what she meant. The machine’s caterpillar treads were busted. The driver’s seat was charred to a crisp. In the front of the rig, the big shovel blade was dented as if it had run into something…or been punched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence was eerie. Looking up at the tiny speck of daylight above us, I got vertigo. How could a cave this big exist under Manhattan without the city block collapsing, or the Hudson River flooding in? We had to be hundreds of feet below sea level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat really disturbed me was that tunnel on the far side of the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not saying I can smell monsters the way my friend Grover the satyr can. But suddenly I understood why he hated being underground. It felt oppressive and dangerous. Demigods didn’t belong here. Something was waiting down that tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Annabeth, hoping she had a great idea—like running away. Instead, she started toward the bulldozer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’d just reached the middle of the cave when a groan echoed from the far tunnel. We ducked behind the bulldozer just as the giant appeared from the darkness, stretching his massive arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Breakfast,” he rumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see him clearly now, and I wished I couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow ugly was he? Let’s put it this way: Secaucus, New Jersey, was a lot nicer-looking than Cacus the giant, and that’s not a compliment to anybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Hermes had said, the giant was about ten feet tall, which made him small compared to some other giants I’d seen. But Cacus made up for it by being bright and gaudy. He had curly orange hair, pale skin, and orange freckles. His face was smeared upward with a permanent pout, upturned nose, wide eyes, and arched eyebrows, so he appeared both startled and unhappy. He wore a red velour housecoat with matching slippers. The housecoat was open, revealing silky Valentine-patterned boxer shorts and luxurious chest hair of a red/pink/orange color not found in nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabeth made a small gagging sound. “It’s the ginger giant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the giant had extremely good hearing. He frowned and scanned the cavern, zeroing in on our hiding place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s there?” he bellowed. “You—behind the bulldozer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabeth and I looked at each other. She mouthed, Oops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on!” the giant said. “I don’t appreciate sneaking about! Show yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sounded like a really terrible idea. Then again, we were pretty much busted anyway. Maybe the giant would listen to reason, despite the fact that he wore Valentine boxer shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took out my ballpoint pen and uncapped it. My bronze sword Riptide sprang to life. Annabeth pulled out her shield and dagger. None of our weapons looked very intimidating against a dude that big, but together we stepped into the open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant grinned. “Well! Demigods, are you? I call for breakfast, and you two appear? That’s quite accommodating.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not breakfast,” Annabeth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No?” The giant stretched lazily. Twin wisps of smoke escaped his nostrils. “I imagine you’d taste wonderful with tortillas, salsa, and eggs. Huevos semidiós. Just thinking about it makes me hungry!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sauntered over to the row of fly-specked cow carcasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach twisted. I muttered, “Oh, he’s not really gonna—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCacus snatched one of the carcasses off a hook. He blew fire over it—a red-hot torrent of flame that cooked the meat in seconds but didn’t seem to hurt the giant’s hands at all. Once the cow was crispy and sizzling, Cacus unhinged his jaw, opening his mouth impossibly wide, and downed the carcass in three massive bites, bones and all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep,” Annabeth said weakly. “He really did it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant belched. He wiped his steaming greasy hands on his robe and grinned at us. “So, if you’re not breakfast, you must be customers. What can I interest you in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded relaxed and friendly, like he was happy to talk with us. Between that and the red velour housecoat, he almost didn’t seem dangerous. Except of course that he was ten feet tall, blew fire, and ate cows in three bites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped forward. Call me old-fashioned, but I wanted to keep his focus on me and not Annabeth. I think it’s polite for a guy to protect his girlfriend from instant incineration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, yeah,” I said. “We might be customers. What do you sell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCacus laughed. “What do I sell? Everything, demigod! At bargain basement prices, and you can’t find a basement lower than this!” He gestured around the cavern. “I’ve got designer handbags, Italian suits, um…some construction equipment, apparently, and if you’re in the market for a Rolex…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his robe. Pinned to the inside was a glittering array of gold and silver watches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabeth snapped her fingers. “Fakes! I knew I’d seen that stuff before. You got all this from street merchants, didn’t you? They’re designer knockoffs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant looked offended. “Not just any knockoffs, young lady. I steal only the best! I’m a son of Hephaestus. I know quality fakes when I see them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. “A son of Hephaestus? Then shouldn’t you be making things rather than stealing them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCacus snorted. “Too much work! Oh, sometimes if I find a high-quality item I’ll make my own copies. But mostly it’s easier to steal things. I started with cattle thieving, you know, back in the old days. Love cattle! That’s why I settled in the Meatpacking District. Then I discovered they have more than meat here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned as if this was an amazing discovery. “Street vendors, high-end boutiques—this is a wonderful city, even better than Ancient Rome! And the workers were very nice to make me this cave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Before you ran them off,” Annabeth said, “and almost killed them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCacus stifled a yawn. “Are you sure you’re not breakfast? Because you’re beginning to bore me. If you don’t want to buy something, I’ll go get the salsa and tortillas—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were looking for something special,” I interrupted. “Something real. And magic. But I guess you don’t have anything like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha!” Cacus clapped his hands. “A high-end shopper. If I haven’t got what you need in stock, I can steal it, for the right price, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hermes’s staff,” I said. “The caduceus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant’s face turned as red as his hair. His eyes narrowed. “I see. I should’ve known Hermes would send someone. Who are you two? Children of the thief god?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabeth raised her knife. “Did he just call me Hermes’s kid? I’m going stab him in the—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon,” I told the giant. I put out my arm to hold Annabeth back. “This is Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena. We help out the gods sometimes with little stuff, like—oh, killing Titans, saving Mount Olympus, things like that. Perhaps you’ve heard stories. So about that caduceus…it would be easier just to hand it over before things get unpleasant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked him in the eyes and hoped my threat would work. I know it seems ridiculous, a sixteen-year-old trying to stare down a fire-breathing giant. But I had battled some pretty serious monsters before. Plus, I’d bathed in the River Styx, which made me immune to most physical attacks. That should be worth a little street cred, right? Maybe Cacus had heard of me. Maybe he would tremble and whimper, Oh, Mr. Jackson. I’m so sorry! I didn’t realize!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead he threw back his head and laughed. “Oh, I see! That was supposed to scare me! But alas, the only demigod who ever defeated me was Hercules himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to Annabeth and shook my head in exasperation. “Always Hercules. What is it with Hercules?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabeth shrugged. “He had a great publicist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant kept boasting. “For centuries, I was the terror of Italy! I stole many cows—more than any other giant. Mothers used to scare their children with my name. They would say, ‘Mind your manners, child, or Cacus will come and steal your cows!’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Horrifying,” Annabeth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant grinned. “I know! Right? So you may as well give up, demigods. You’ll never get the caduceus. I have plans for that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his hand and the staff of Hermes appeared in his grip. I’d seen it many times before, but it still sent a shiver down my back. Godly items just radiate power. The staff was smooth white wood about three feet long, topped with a silver sphere and dove’s wings that fluttered nervously. Intertwined around the staff were two live, very agitated serpents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy! A reptilian voice spoke in my mind. Thank the gods!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother snaky voice, deeper and grumpier, said, Yes, I haven’t been fed in hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Martha, George,” I said. “Are you guys all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter if I got some food, George complained. There are some nice rats down here. Could you catch us some?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge, stop! Martha chided. We have bigger problems. This giant wants to keep us!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCacus looked back and forth from me to the snakes. “Wait…You can speak with the snakes, Percy Jackson? That’s excellent! Tell them they’d better start cooperating. I’m their new master, and they’ll only get fed when they start taking orders.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nerve! Martha shrieked. You tell that ginger jerk—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on,” Annabeth interrupted. “Cacus, the snakes will never obey you. They only work for Hermes. Since you can’t use the staff, it doesn’t do you any good. Just give it back and we’ll pretend this never happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great idea,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant snarled. “Oh, I’ll figure out the staff’s powers, girl. I’ll make the snakes cooperate!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCacus shook the caduceus. George and Martha wriggled and hissed, but they seemed stuck to the staff. I knew the caduceus could turn into all sorts of helpful things—a sword, a cell phone, a price scanner for easy comparison-shopping. And once George had mentioned something disturbing about “laser mode.” I really didn’t want Cacus figuring out that feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the giant growled in frustration. He slammed the staff against the nearest cow carcass and instantly the meat turned to stone. A wave of petrifaction spread from carcass to carcass until the rack became so heavy it collapsed. Half a dozen granite cows broke to pieces. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-demigod-diaries/page-10.html","bookId":1545,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:01 PM"}
