The CR-V and smooth stretch of I-75 hummed around us, the outside revealing little except Midwestern plains and trees. Sonya didn\u0027t seem quite as creepy crazy as she had back at school or even at her house. Mostly, she still just seemed scattered and confused, which was to be expected. I hesitated before answering but finally decided there was no reason to hold back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lissa passed her second monarch test.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course she did,\u0027 said Victor. He was staring out the window away from me. The tone of his voice suggested I\u0027d just wasted his time by saying something that was a given. \"Is she okay?\u0027 asked Dimitri. \"Injured?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, that would have sparked jealousy in me. Now, it was just a sign of our shared concern for Lissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine,\u0027 I said, wondering if that was entirely true. She wasn\u0027t physically injured, but after what she\u0027d seen ... well, that had to leave scars of a different type. The back door had been quite a surprise too. When she\u0027d seen a small crowd by the first door, she\u0027d thought it meant only a few people were up that late to see the candidates. Nope. Turned out everyone was just waiting out back to see the victors. True to her promise, Lissa hadn\u0027t let it faze her. She walked out with her head held high, smiling at her onlookers and fans as though she already owned the crown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was growing sleepy but Lissa\u0027s triumph kept me smiling for a long time. There\u0027s something tiring about an endless, unknown stretch of highway. Victor had closed his eyes and was leaning against the glass. I couldn\u0027t see Sydney when I twisted around to check on her, meaning she also had decided on a nap or was just lying down. I yawned, wondering if I dared risk sleeping. Dimitri had urged me to when we left Sonya\u0027s house, knowing that I could use more than the couple hours Sydney had given me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tipped my head against the seat and closed my eyes, falling instantly asleep. The blackness of that sleep gave way to the feel of a spirit dream, and my heart leapt with both panic and joy. After living through Lissa\u0027s test, spirit dreams suddenly had a sinister feel. At the same time, this might be a chance to see Adrian. And ... it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly we appeared somewhere entirely unexpected: Sonya\u0027s garden. I stared in wonder at the clear blue sky and the brilliant flowers, nearly overlooking Adrian in the process. He wore a dark green cashmere sweater that made him blend in. To me, he was more gorgeous than any of the garden\u0027s other wonders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrian!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran to him, and he lifted me easily, spinning me around. When he placed me back on my feet, he studied the garden and nodded in approval. \"I should let you pick the place more often. You have good taste. Of course, since you\u0027re dating me, we already knew that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, \"pick the place?\u0027\u0027 I asked, lacing my hands behind his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"When I reached out and sensed you were sleeping, I summoned the dream but didn\u0027t feel like thinking up a place. So I left it to your subconscious.\u0027 Irritably, he plucked at the cashmere. \"I\u0027m not dressed for the occasion, though.\u0027 The sweater shimmered, soon replaced by a light gray T-shirt with an abstract design on the front. \"Better?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much.\u0027 He grinned and kissed the top of my forehead. \"I\u0027ve missed you, little dhampir. You can spy on Lissa and us all the time, but the best I get are these dreams, and honestly, I can\u0027t figure out what schedule you\u0027re on.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized that with my \"spying,\u0027 I knew more about what had just happened at Court than he did. \"Lissa took her second test,\u0027 I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYup. His expression verified it. He hadn\u0027t known about the test, probably because he\u0027d been sleeping. \"When?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just now. It was a tough one, but she passed.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much to her delight, no doubt. Still ... that keeps buying us time to clear you and get you home. Not sure I\u0027d want to come home if I were you, though.\u0027 He looked around the garden again. \"West Virginia\u0027s a lot better than I thought.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"It\u0027s not West Virginia--which isn\u0027t that bad, by the way. It\u0027s Sonya Karp\u0027s-- \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze, unable to believe what I\u0027d nearly said. I\u0027d been so happy to see him, so at ease ... I\u0027d let myself screw up. Adrian\u0027s face grew very, very serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you say Sonya Karp?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral options played out in my head. Lying was the easiest. I could claim this was some place I\u0027d been a long time ago, like maybe she\u0027d taken us on a field trip to her house. That was pretty flimsy, though. Plus, I was guessing the look on my face screamed guilt. I\u0027d been caught. A pretty lie wouldn\u0027t fool Adrian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\u0027 I said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose. Sonya Karp\u0027s a Strigoi.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian sighed. \"I knew you staying out of trouble was too good to be true. What happened?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, Robert Doru restored her.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert.\u0027 Adrian\u0027s lip curled in disdain. The two spirit users hadn\u0027t gotten along well. \"And just because I feel like we\u0027re marching into full-fledged Crazy Territory--which means something, coming from me--I\u0027m going to take a guess that Victor Dashkov is also with you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, wishing desperately then that someone would wake me up and get me away from Adrian\u0027s interrogation. Damn it. How could I have slipped up like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian released me and walked around in small circles. \"Okay, so. You, Belikov, the Alchemist, Sonya Karp, Victor Dashkov, and Robert Doru are all hanging out in West Virginia together.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\u0027 I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re, uh, not in West Virginia.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose!\u0027 Adrian halted his pacing and strode back over to me. \"Where the hell are you then? Your old man, Lissa--everyone thinks you\u0027re safe and sound.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am,\u0027 I said haughtily. \"Just not in West Virginia.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then where?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t ... I can\u0027t tell you.\u0027 I hated saying those words to him and seeing the look they elicited. \"Part of it\u0027s for safety. Part of it\u0027s because ... well, um, I don\u0027t actually know.\u0027 He caught hold of my hands. \"You can\u0027t do this. You can\u0027t run off on some crazy whim this time. Don\u0027t you get it? They\u0027ll kill you if they find you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a crazy whim! We\u0027re doing something important. Something that\u0027s going to help all of us.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something you can\u0027t tell me,\u0027 he guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s better if you\u0027re not involved,\u0027 I said, squeezing his hands tightly. \"Better if you don\u0027t know the details.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in the meantime, I can rest easy knowing you\u0027ve got an elite team at your back.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrian, please! Please just trust me. Trust that I\u0027ve got a good reason,\u0027 I begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of my hands. \"I believe you think you\u0027ve got a good reason. I just can\u0027t imagine one that justifies you risking your life.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what I do,\u0027 I said, surprised at how serious I sounded. \"Some things are worth it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePieces of static flickered across my vision, like TV reception going bad. The world started to fade. \"What\u0027s going on?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled. \"Someone or something\u0027s waking me up. Probably my mom checking in for the hundredth time.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached for him, but he was fading away. \"Adrian! Please don\u0027t tell anyone! Anyone.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know if he heard my pleas or not because the dream completely disappeared. I woke up in the car. My immediate reaction was to swear, but I didn\u0027t want to give away the idiotic thing I\u0027d done. Glancing over, I nearly jumped out of my seat when I saw Sonya watching me intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were having a spirit dream,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you know?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your aura.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a face. \"Auras used to be cool, but now they\u0027re just starting to get annoying.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed softly, the first time I\u0027d heard her do so since being restored. \"They\u0027re very informative if you know how to read them. Were you with Vasilisa?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. My boyfriend. He\u0027s a spirit user too.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened in surprise. \"That\u0027s who you were with?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Why? What\u0027s wrong?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned, looking puzzled. A few moments later, she glanced up toward the front seat, where Dimitri and Robert sat, and then studied me in a scrutinizing way that sent chills down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\u0027 she said. \"Nothing\u0027s wrong.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to scoff at that. \"Come on, it sure seemed like--\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There!\u0027 Sonya abruptly turned from me, leaned forward, and pointed. \"Take that exit.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were nearly past \"that exit,\u0027 and Dimitri had to do some fancy maneuvering--kind of like in our escape back in Pennsylvania--to make it. The car jerked and lurched, and I heard Sydney yelp behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little warning next time would be helpful,\u0027 Dimitri noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya wasn\u0027t listening. Her gaze was totally fixated on the road we\u0027d pulled off onto. We came to a red light, where I caught sight of a cheery sign: WELCOME TO ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN. The spark of life I\u0027d seen in her moments ago was gone. Sonya had returned to her tense, almost robotic self. Despite Sydney\u0027s clever negotiating, Sonya still seemed uncomfortable about this trip. She still felt guilty and traitorous. \"Are we here?\u0027 I asked eagerly. \"And how long were we on the road?\u0027 I\u0027d hardly noticed the drive. I\u0027d stayed awake for the first part of it, but the rest had been a blur of Lissa and Adrian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six hours,\u0027 said Dimitri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go left at that second light,\u0027 said Sonya. \"Now right at the corner.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension built in the car. Everyone was awake now, and my heart raced as we pushed deeper and deeper into suburbia. Which house? Were we close? Was one of these it? It was a fast drive but seemed to stretch forever. We all let out a collective breath when Sonya suddenly pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri pulled into the driveway of a cute brick house with a perfectly trimmed lawn. \"Do you know if your relatives still live here?\u0027 I asked Sonya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing, and I realized we were back to promise territory. Lockdown mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for progress. \"I guess there\u0027s only one way to find out,\u0027 I said, unbuckling my seatbelt. \"Same plan?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, Dimitri and I had discussed who would go and who would stay behind if Sonya got us to the right place. Leaving the brothers behind was a no-brainer. The question had been who would guard them, and we\u0027d decided Dimitri would while Sydney and I went with Sonya to meet her relatives--who were undoubtedly in for a shocking visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same plan,\u0027 agreed Dimitri. \"You go to the house. You look less threatening.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"I said \"look.\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his reasoning made sense. Even at ease, there was something powerful and intimidating about Dimitri. Three women going up to the door would freak these people out less--especially if it turned out Sonya\u0027s relatives had moved. Hell, for all I knew, she\u0027d purposely led us to the wrong house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful,\u0027 Dimitri said, as we got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You too,\u0027 I replied. That got me another smile, one a little warmer and deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feelings that stirred in me flitted away as Sonya, Sydney, and I walked up the sidewalk. My chest tightened. This was it. Or was it? Were we about to reach the conclusion of our journey? Had we really found the last Dragomir, against all odds? Or had I been played from the beginning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t the only one who was nervous. I could feel Sydney and Sonya crackling with tension too. We reached the front step. I took a deep breath and rang the doorbell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral seconds later, a man answered--and he was Moroi. A promising sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at each of our faces, no doubt wondering what a Moroi, a dhampir, and a human were doing at his door. It sounded like the start of a bad joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I help you?\u0027 he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was suddenly at a loss. Our plan had covered the big stuff: find Eric\u0027s mistress and love child. What we\u0027d say once we actually got there wasn\u0027t so clear. I waited for one of my companions to speak up now, but there was no need. The Moroi man\u0027s head suddenly whipped to my side as he did a double take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sonya?\u0027 he gasped. \"Is that you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, I heard a young female voice behind him call, \"Hey, who\u0027s here?\u0027 Someone squeezed in beside him, someone tall and slim--someone I knew. My breath caught as I stared at waves of unruly light brown hair and light green eyes--eyes that should have tipped me off a long time ago. I couldn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose,\u0027 exclaimed Jill Mastrano. \"What are you doing here?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/last-sacrifice-vampire-academy-6/page-22.html","bookId":2065,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:14:28 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:14:28 AM"}
