The absolute end of all. Other darkness was frightening because of what it might hide. This darkness was different; if this engulfed you, you would cease completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin stumbled back, though the wind blowing down the tunnel wasn’t strong. Just . . . steady, like a stream running into nowhere. Perrin gripped the dreamspike, then forced himself to turn away from Rand. Someone knelt on the floor nearby, her head bowed, braced as if against some great force coming from the nothingness. Moiraine? Yes, and that was Nynaeve kneeling to her right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe veil between worlds was very thin here. If he could see Nynaeve and Moiraine, perhaps they could see or hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped up to Nynaeve. \"Nynaeve? Can you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, turning her head. Yes, she could hear him! But she could not see him, it seemed. She searched about, confused as she clung to the stone teeth of the floor as if for life itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nynaeve!\" Perrin yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perrin?\" she whispered, looking about. \"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m going to do something, Nynaeve\", he said. \"I will make it impossible to create gateways into this place. If you want to Travel to or from this area, you’ll need to create your gateway out in front of the cavern. All right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, still looking about for him. Apparently, though the real world reflected in the wolf dream, it didn’t work the other way around. Perrin rammed the dreamspike into the ground, then activated it as Lanfear had shown him, creating the bubble of purple just around the cavern itself. He hurried back into the tunnel, emerging through a wall of purple glass to rejoin Gaul and the wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Light\", Gaul said. \"I was about to go search for you. Why did it take so long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So long?\" Perrin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were gone at least two hours\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin shook his head. \"It’s the Bore playing with our sense of time. Well, at least with that dreamspike in place, Slayer will have trouble reaching Rand\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter having Slayer use the dreamspike against him, it was satisfying to turn the ter’angreal against the man. Perrin had made the protective bubble just large enough to fit inside the cavern and shelter Rand, the Bore and those with him. The placement meant all of the borders of the dome save the one here at the front were inside rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer would not be able to jump into the middle of the cavern and strike; he would have to enter through the front. Either that, or find a way to burrow through the rock, which Perrin supposed was possible here in the wolf dream. However, it would slow him, and that was what Rand needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you to protect this place\", Perrin sent to the gathered wolves, many of whom were still licking their wounds. \"Shadowkiller fights inside, hunting the most dangerous prey this world has known. We must not let Slayer reach him\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will guard this place, Young Bull, one sent. Others gather. He will not pass us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you do this?\" Perrin sent an image of wolves spaced through the Borderlands, relaying messages quickly between themselves. There were thousands upon thousands of them roaming the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin was proud of his sending. He didn’t send it as words, or as images, but as a concept mixed with scents, with a hint of instinct. With the wolves positioned as he sent, they could send to him through the network almost instantly if Slayer returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can do it, the wolves sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin nodded, then waved to Gaul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are not staying?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is too much happening\", Perrin said. \"Time moves too slowly here. I don’t want the war to pass us by\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, there was still the matter of whatever Graendal was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsiderations\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t like fighting beside those Seanchan\", Gawyn said softly, coming up beside Egwene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t like it either, and she knew he would be able to sense that from her. What could she say? She couldn’t turn the Seanchan away. The Shadow had brought the Sharans to fight under its banner. Egwene, therefore, would have to use what she had. Anything she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer neck itched as she crossed the field to the meeting place about a mile or so east of the ford in Arafel. Bryne had already arrayed most of her forces at the ford. Aes Sedai could be seen atop the hills just south of the ford, and large squadrons of archers and pikemen were positioned below them on the slopes. The troops were feeling fresher. The days Egwene’s force had spent retreating had relieved some of the pressure of warfare, despite attempts by the enemy to make them commit to combat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene’s chances depended on the Seanchan joining the battle and engaging the Sharan channelers. Her stomach twisted. She had once heard that in Caemlyn, unscrupulous men would throw starving dogs into a pit together and bet on which one would survive the ensuing fight. This felt the same to her. The Seanchan damane were not free women; they could not choose to fight. From what she’d seen of the Sharan male channelers, they were little more than animals themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene should be fighting the Seanchan with every breath, not allying with them. Her instincts rebelled as she approached the gathering of Seanchan. The Seanchan leader demanded this audience with Egwene. The Light send it would be quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene had received reports on this Fortuona, so she knew what to expect. The diminutive Seanchan Empress stood atop a small platform, watching the battle preparations. She wore a glittering dress whose train extended a ridiculous distance behind her, carried by eight da’covale, those servants in the horribly immodest clothing. Various members of the Blood stood in groups, waiting with careful poses. Deathwatch Guards, hulking in their near-black armor, stood like boulders around the Empress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene approached, guarded by her own soldiers and much of the Hall of the Tower. Fortuona had first tried to insist that Egwene come to visit her in her camp. Egwene had, of course, refused. It had taken hours to reach an agreement. Both would come to this location in Arafel, and both would stand rather than sit so that neither could give the impression of being above the other. Still, Egwene was irritated to find the woman waiting. She’d wanted to time this meeting so they both arrived at the same moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortuona turned from the battle preparations and looked at Egwene. It appeared that many of Siuan’s reports were false. True, Fortuona did look something like a child, with that slight build and delicate features. Those similarities were minor. No child had ever had eyes so discerning, so calculating. Egwene revised her expectations. She’d imagined Fortuona as a spoiled adolescent, the produ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-158.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
