IN THE distance a farmer urged a horsedrawn wagon along a dirt road, the rising dust leaving a shimmering haze in the air. Edwin was driving toward Taylorville at a leisurely pace, enjoying the beautiful scenery - scarlet forests, meadows ripe for the scythe. They passed heaps of pumpkins in one field, being loaded into the back of a truck for market in Asheville. For some reason they made Rix think of a picture he\u0027d seen of a Vietnam battlefield: disembodied heads piled up and rotting in the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question was in Rix\u0027s mind again. He\u0027d asked it of Edwin before, and had always gotten the same answer. Asking it meant walking on swampy ground that could pull him down without warning at any second. Still, he had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edwin,\" he said finally, \"when you . . . talked to Sandra that night, are you sure she didn\u0027t. . . you know . . . sound like she was . . .\" He trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Disturbed?\" Edwin asked mercifully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Disturbed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she didn\u0027t. Not at all. She sounded very happy. She told me you\u0027d sold Congregation to Stratford House, that you had just finished Fire Fingers, and that you and she were going out to celebrate the next night. I had no idea that anything was wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was nothing wrong. Oh, maybe a few little things. Money was tight, the dishwasher was broken down, the car\u0027s transmission was slipping, she was under some pressure at the insurance company - but Sandra was a strong woman, Edwin. Strong mentally. We\u0027d gotten through tough times before. Hell, she was the one who kept me going.\" His hands had become fists, and when he opened them, they were stiff with tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes people do things for strange reasons. I never met your wife, of course, but whenever we spoke on the phone, she sounded very happy and very much in love with you.\" His gray brows knitted together. \"You have to let go of it, Rix. It\u0027s the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t let go of it!\" His voice cracked, and he had to wait a minute before continuing. \"I\u0027ve tried. There was nothing wrong, Edwin. She wasn\u0027t crazy. She wasn\u0027t the type of person who just gives up and cuts her wrists in a bathtub!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Edwin said gently. \"I wish I could tell you that she did sound disturbed, if that would help you. But when we spoke on the phone that night, Sandra seemed very happy. I was as shocked as you were when it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRix had telephoned Edwin at Usherland four years ago, when he\u0027d found Sandra lying in the bathtub. All that blood, all that blood! The water was red, and Sandra\u0027s head had slipped down so her hair floated like the petals of a bruised flower. The razor she\u0027d used lay on the tiles, smeared with blood where her veins had jetted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRix was in a state of mindless shock, and Edwin had told him to call the police and not to touch anything until they got there. He had flown down to Atlanta the next morning to be with Rix, and had stayed through the funeral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, Rix\u0027s nightmares of being lost in the Lodge again grew worse, and the attacks descended upon him with a new virulence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night before it happened, she\u0027d told him that Edwin had called while he was out. They\u0027d talked for a while about Rix and his writing, about the new book he was starting, about the possibility that they would come to Usherland for Christmas. She seemed happy about the future, and hopeful that she could continue to help Rix deal with the guilt he felt over his family\u0027s business. He\u0027d always told her that she was his safety valve, that without her he might never be able to channel his feelings into another book. There had been many long nights of talks about his childhood at Usherland and his need to make something of himself apart from the family. She encouraged him in his writing, and had an uplifting optimism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour years after her suicide, Rix still couldn\u0027t make sense of it. He\u0027d loved her very much, and he\u0027d thought she loved him. In his brooding over her death, Rix found only one possibility -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that somehow he had contaminated her, had driven her into a depression that was carefully and tragically masked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d told me before how much you meant to her,\" Edwin offered. \"I believe that whatever drove her to take her own life was in her mind long before you met her. I think it was unavoidable. You\u0027re not to blame, Rix. No one is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin slowed the station wagon and turned off the main highway, following a dirt road that wound through the tobacco fields. On a hill stood a curing barn and a modest white house. Next to the house was a small clapboard shed. A white-haired woman in a gingham dress sat on the house\u0027s front porch, shelling peas into a metal pan. The screen door opened as Edwin stopped the car, and a tall, balding elderly man with a luxuriant white mustache came out. He was wearing overalls and a flannel workshirt, but he carried himself with Bodane dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRix got out of the car with Edwin as Robert Bodane approached. His wife set aside her peas and came down from the porch on plump legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two brothers shook hands. \"Do you remember Rix?\" Edwin asked the other man. \"I think he was about this tall the last time you saw him.\" He motioned with his hand about four feet off the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rix? This is that same little boy? My Lord!\" Robert looked stunned. His face was heavily weathered, and he was missing a couple of lower teeth. When Rix shook his hand, the strength of the man\u0027s grip amazed him. \"I guess you don\u0027t remember meetin\u0027 me, do you? I came out to visit Usherland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRix didn\u0027t, but he smiled anyway and said, \"I think I do. It\u0027s good to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Bodane introduced his wife, Jeanie, and talked to Edwin for a minute or two about the bumper crop he was expecting this year. \"Ought to go into farmin\u0027 yourself,\" Robert said with a sly grin. \"Get some good dirt under those fingernails, makes a man out of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I expect to have Florida sand under my feet in about three months, thank you. Is Logan ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His bags are packed. I s\u0027pose the boy\u0027s wandered off somewhere. Hard to keep track of a rounder like that one. Hey, Logan!\" he shouted toward the forest that edged up behind the house. \"Edwin\u0027s here for you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prob\u0027ly off runnin\u0027 with Mutt,\" the elderly woman said. \"He\u0027s taken a shine to that dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Logan!\" Robert shouted again. Then he shrugged and said, \"Y\u0027all come on up and sit on the porch awhile. He\u0027ll show up directly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young man with curly hair the color of burnished brass peered out the window of the toolshed as his grandparents and the other two men walked to the porch. He knew the tall old dude in the suit was Edwin; the younger one might be somebody else who worked at Usherland. It wasn\u0027t nine-thirty yet. Edwin was here early. Well, the young man thought, he could just fuckin\u0027 wait, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan turned back to the worktable to regard the job he\u0027d been doing. He was wearing the old man\u0027s barbecuing apron, the one that had I Ain\u0027t Pretty, But I Sure Can Cook written on it above the caricature of a chef burning hot dogs on a grill. He had done a very good job, he thought. It was something he\u0027d been meaning to get around to for a long time. He replaced the hammer and hacksaw in their places on the tool rack, then carefully wiped his hands on a rag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the apron off and draped it over the worktable. Then, satisfied, he left the toolshed, closed and latched the door behind him, and ambled slowly up to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRix saw the young man approaching, and instantly he decided he wouldn\u0027t trust Logan Bodane to shine his shoes, much less take over Edwin\u0027s duties at Usherland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan walked with an arrogant swagger, his hands thrust into the pockets of his faded blue jeans. He wore a beat-up leather jacket over a gray workshirt, and he kicked at an errant stone with one of his scuffed boots. His longish hair framed a lean, ruddy face with sharply angled cheekbones, and as he came nearer, Rix saw that his deepset eyes were a chilly shade of blue. His gaze was remote and unconcerned - almost bored. He flicked a glance at all of them as he stepped up onto the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been callin\u0027 you, boy,\" Robert said. \"Where\u0027d you go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toolshed,\" Logan replied; he had a deep, rough voice that grated on Rix\u0027s nerves. \"Just messin\u0027 around in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, don\u0027t just stand there. Shake hands with Edwin and Mr. Usher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man turned his attention to Rix. When he smiled, only one side of his mouth hitched up, so the smile was more like a sneer. \"Yeah?\" he asked. \"Which Usher are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Usher,\" Rix said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you gonna be my new boss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Edwin is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it.\" Logan extended his hand toward Rix, who saw a red crust around the fingernails. Logan\u0027s smile faltered a fraction, and he drew his hand back. \"Been workin\u0027 in the shed,\" he said. \"Got some woodstain on me, I guess. Ought to be more careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ought to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin rose from his chair to shake Logan\u0027s hand. Logan was almost as tall as he was, but much broader; the young man had wide, thick shoulders and the large hands of a laborer. \"We should be getting back to Usherland,\" Edwin told him. \"Are your bags ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just take me a few minutes. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Usher.\u0027\u0027 He smiled - the smile of a cunning animal, Rix thought -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and then went into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin was watching Rix carefully. \"You\u0027re wearing your opinions like a red scarf,\" he said. \"Give him a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Logan\u0027s a fine boy, Mr. Usher,\" the old woman offered, shelling her peas. \"Oh, he\u0027s got his rough edges, but then again, all boys his age do, don\u0027t they? He\u0027s a smart one, though, and he\u0027s got a strong back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a rounder,\" Robert said. \"Reminds me of myself, when I was his age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was long before I straightened him out.\" She winked quickly at Rix, then let out a sharp whistle. \"Mutt! Here, boy! Come on! Where\u0027d that dog get off to? Heard him barkin\u0027 fit to bust before sunup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chasin\u0027 squirrels again, most likely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRix stood up as Logan came out of the house, carrying two suitcases. Edwin took one of them for him. Rix said it had been a pleasure to meet the Bodanes, then walked on to the station wagon and climbed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan and Edwin slid the suitcases into the rear, then the young man took his place in the back seat. He rolled down his window as Edwin started the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You be a good boy!\" Mrs. Bodane called to him. \"Pay attention to what Edwin tells you, now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Gramps,\" Logan said, \"I was doin\u0027 some work in the shed and forgot to clean up. I left kind of a mess, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get it. You listen to Edwin and you make us proud of you, hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make you real proud,\" Logan said, and rolled his window back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin drove away from the house as Logan waved to his grandparents from behind the glass. \"This thing got a radio?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the toolshed door, Robert Bodane stopped to watch the station wagon out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fresh peas for lunch!\" the woman called. \"You want some potatoes to go with \u0027em?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027d be fine,\" he replied. The dust was already settling. He unlatched the door and went into the toolshed. The work his grandson had been doing was covered with an apron atop the workbench. There was a strong smell in the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the apron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him a moment to realize that the mess on the workbench had once been a dog. Mutt had been decapitated and disemboweled, the intestines laid out in pools of thick, congealing blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard his wife calling the dog again, and he started looking for something to scrape the remains into. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-10.html","bookId":2474,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:27 PM"}
