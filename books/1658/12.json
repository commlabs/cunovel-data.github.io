Night was falling outside, and murky blue light seeped through the half-open shutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was my father’s,” he said, picking up where he’d left off. “He was hardly ever here, though. He left before dawn and spent the day in the fields or at the harbor. Sometimes, when he could, he’d go hunting. He liked to keep moving. I guess it’s one way we’re alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At supper, he talked with the tribe. He was careful, always, to give equal time to everyone. I liked that he did that.... It was something Vale never did. Afterward, he’d come home with us, and he wasn’t Jodan the Blood Lord anymore. He was ours. He’d listen to us, and read to us, and we’d wrestle and play around.” His lips pulled up in a crooked smile. “He was huge. Tall as I am, but strong as an ox. Even with the three of us trying, we could never bring him down.” His smile faded. “But then there were other times … the times he’d show up here with a bottle.” He tipped his head. “You know some of this already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria nodded. She could hardly breathe. Perry’s father had blamed him for his mother’s death during childbirth. Perry had only spoken of it once to her, with tears in his eyes. Now she stood in the very house where he’d been beaten for something that wasn’t his fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On those nights, usually he’d be yelling within the first hour. It got worse from there. Vale hid in the loft. Liv crawled under the table. I bore it. And that was how it went. Everyone knew, but no one did anything. When I was broken and blue, they accepted it. I accepted it. I told myself there was no better way. We needed him as Blood Lord. And he was the only parent we had. Without him, we wouldn’t have had anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew too well how that felt. Every day since her mother had died, she’d struggled with the idea that she didn’t have anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry shook his head. “Maybe this won’t make sense, but I feel like the Aether’s the same way. We think we need this … this land. This house. This room.... But it’s not the right way to live. We lost acres last night to fires, and a man I’ve known my entire life almost died. I almost did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed the space between them in a shot and took his hands, holding on as tight as she could. As tight as she would have if she’d been at the jetty. He let out a slow breath, staring into her eyes, his grip just as tight as hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We lose and lose, but we’re still here. Shaking in place, afraid of doing something. I’m tired of settling for this because I don’t know if something better exists. It has to. What point is there otherwise? I can do something about it now. And I will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked, the intensity in his eyes vanishing as he shifted back to the present. He laughed at himself. “That was a lot. Anyway …” He lifted an eyebrow. “You’re pretty quiet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrapped her arms around his waist, hugging him. “Because there isn’t a word for how perfect that was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry tucked her closer, his shoulders molding around her. They clung to each other, his chest solid and warm against hers. After a moment, he bent by her ear and whispered, “Was it champ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a word from her world, and she could tell he was smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very. It was very champ.” She drew back and stared into his eyes. As much as he kept to himself, he cared so deeply for others. He was a force. He was good. “You amaze me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know why. You’re getting Talon back. And you’re helping your people. It’s no different from what I’m doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s different. Hess is—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “You’d be doing all the same things even if he weren’t blackmailing you. Maybe you’re not sure about that, but I am.” His hand brushed past her cheek and slid into her hair. “We’re the same, Aria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the best thing anyone’s ever said to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and leaned down, kissing her softly, tenderly. She knew she should step away. This was a risk, but she didn’t care about anything except him just then. She wove her arms around his neck and parted his lips with hers, stealing a taste of him. Tenderness could wait for another time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry went still for an instant; then he cinched her close, momentum sending them thudding into the door behind him. He sank against it, bringing himself closer to her height, kissing her with a sudden urgency. With a hunger that she matched. His lips moved to her neck and trailed up to her ear, and the world fell away. She gasped and dug her fingers into his shoulders, pulling him closer—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered, and her hands relaxed. “Which shoulder was it, Perry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin spread over his lips. “Right now I have no idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were heavy with desire, but she saw something else. A gleam that made her suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands slid to her hips. “You’re incredible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not what you were thinking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was so. I always think that.” He leaned in, twisting a strand of her hair around his finger as he kissed her bottom lip. “But I was also wondering what you were doing around Butter today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria laughed. That was attractive. She smelled like horse. “Do you ever miss anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry smiled. “You, all the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePEREGRINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry drew the blade across his palm, slicing his skin. Making a fist over the small copper pot on the table, he let a few drops of his blood fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On my blood as Lord of the Tides, I recognize you as an Audile and warrant that you should be Marked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry didn’t recognize the sound of his own voice—sure and formal—or the words he spoke, which had always belonged to Vale or his father. He lifted his gaze and scanned the crowded hall. Against Reef’s advice, he’d ordered all the regular trappings of a Marking Ceremony. Incense at each table put off fragrant cedar smoke to represent Scires. Torches and candles blazed, washing the cookhouse in light to honor the Seers. For the Auds, drummers beat a steady rhythm at the far end. Unlike last night’s cold and wet and fear, now the hall was filled with the comfort of tradition. He’d been right to do this. The Tides needed it as much as he and Aria did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stood just a few paces in front of him. She’d pulled her black hair up, and her neck looked slender and delicate. Her cheeks were flushed pink, whether from nerves or the heat of the hall, Perry wasn’t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she think this ritual was savage? Did she want Markings, or were they just a necessity to get the location of the Still Blue? He hadn’t had the chance to ask earlier, and now it was too late. He couldn’t tell how she felt. With the cedar and smoke and hundreds of people, her scent was lost to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry handed the knife to Roar, who gave the blade a quick, showy twirl before he swore his own oath, recognizing Aria as an Audile. As one of his own. “May sounds guide you home,” he finished, adding his blood to the pot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tattoo ink would be added next. When Aria received her Markings, she’d receive part of him and Roar as well, their blood sealing their promises to shelter and protect her should she ever be in need. The ceremony would end with him and Roar making that oath to her. Perry couldn’t wait. He already felt that way, and he wanted her to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bear will do the Markings now,” he said. For years it had been Mila’s role. His sister-in-law had done the falcon on his back and both of his Markings—Scire and Seer. Molly was his next choice, but her hands were bothering her. The only other person left who’d ever done them was Bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry stood a moment longer, fighting the urge to kiss Aria’s cheek. Much as he wanted to be open about them to the tribe, a show of his feelings seemed wrong now. With a final glance at the flawless skin along her arms, he headed for the head table at the rear of the hall. The Markings would take hours, and he didn’t want to hover. Getting inked wasn’t terrible, but he knew any discomfort she felt would pain him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took Vale’s old seat at the head table on a platform at the end of the hall. With Roar and Cinder at his sides and the Six filling in around them, he felt too much like the Blood Lord his brother had been, one for ceremony and appearances. But tonight was for ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the table, a stringy-haired man smiled, showing more gaps than teeth. “Well, well … what a sight you are, Peregrine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trader, who’d arrived earlier in the afternoon, came around every spring selling trinkets. Coins, spoons, rings, and bangles hung from his necklaces and coat, messy as seaweed. They had to weigh as much as he did. But the goods were just a cover for his real trade—gossip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry nodded. “Shade.” With the Marking underway and time to kill, this was a good opportunity to learn news before he left with Aria tomorrow morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve grown into such a shining young lord,” Shade said. He lingered over the word, drawing the sound from it like he was sucking marrow from a bone. From the corner of his eye, Perry caught the grin that spread across Roar’s face. Perry was already looking forward to hearing his best friend’s imitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much you resemble your brother and your father,” Shade continued. “He was a great man, Jodan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry shook his head. His father, a great man? Maybe to some. Maybe in some ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced toward the hearth. Bear sat at a table with Aria. With a piece of willow charcoal, he drew the Audile’s curving lines on her bicep, preparing to ink them into her skin. Aria stared at the fire, her gaze distant. Perry exhaled through his teeth, not sure why he was worried. He’d seen Markings done a dozen times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On with it, Shade,” he said. “Let’s have your news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems patience is missing from your formidable list of virtues,” Shade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True,” Perry said. “I lack restraint as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile spread over the gossipmonger’s face. One of his front teeth sat sideways, like an open door. “So I understand. You know, I admire you tremendously, and I’m not alone. News of your challenge has spread far and wide. How very difficult it must have been to spill your brother’s blood. Few men have the strength to commit such a merciless—pardon me—such a selfless act. All done for your nephew, I heard. A dear child, Talon. Dear, dear boy. Word says you took down a band of sixty Croven as well. Such a young lord, and yet you’re making quite a mark, Peregrine of the Tides.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry had the urge to cuff him, but Reef moved first, setting his foot on the bench next to Shade with a solid thunk. He leaned over the ratty man. “I could speed this up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShade winced, his gaze traveling to Reef’s scar. “No—no need. Forgive me. I meant no offense. Your time must be so precious, especially with the storm last night. You’re not the only one seeing the Aether this late, you know. The southern territories are suffering. Fires burn everywhere, and the borderlands are crawling with dispersed. The Rose and Night tribes were both forced from their compounds. Word says they’ve joined together and gone in search of a stronghold.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-ever-night-under-the-never-sky-2/page-12.html","bookId":1658,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM"}
