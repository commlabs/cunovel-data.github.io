But my eyes soon adjusted, and the corridor took on a purplish tint. The strength it took to walk through that hall came solely from a rising panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?” I called out into the darkness, my voice vibrating hoarsely. “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept saying this as I moved down the hall toward the door at the end of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sconce flickered and then dimmed as I passed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother one followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I heard something. A shuffling sound. It came from behind the door of the master bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd from where I was standing in the middle of the darkened hallway, I saw, in the gap below the door, the band of light go black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I heard giggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moaned. The giggling continued from behind the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was giggling disconnected from humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sconces had stopped flickering, and the only light in the hallway was the moon flooding through the large window that looked over the backyard. I could see Victor sitting on his haunches, staring intently at the house, as if he was standing watch (But against what?), and behind the dog was the field, which in the moonglow resembled a flat silver sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giggling turned into a high-pitched squeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blindly made my way toward the master bedroom; I couldn’t see anything. I was letting the wall I was leaning against guide me toward it. I was only a couple steps away when I heard the door opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello? Who is it? Hello?” My voice was toneless. I reached under my shirt for the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe squealing had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the darkness the door opened and something rushed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was padding toward me but I couldn’t see anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” I yelled, then it leapt into the air and flew by me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun around, flailing at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the door to Robby’s room slammed shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was now holding the gun by my side and felt my way in the darkness, once again relying on the wall, until I was at Robby’s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Ellis?” I heard Wendy call. “What’s going on? You’re frightening the kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call the police,” I shouted, making sure the thing in Robby’s room could hear me. “Call 911 now, Wendy. Just do it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad?” This was Robby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay, Robby, everything is okay. Just get outside.” I tried to keep my voice from wavering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed in and slowly opened Robby’s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was completely dark except for the screen-saver moon glowing from the computer. The window looking onto Elsinore Lane was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I sensed movement in the room and about four steps inside I heard something breathing raggedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” I shouted. Fear was crawling through me. I had no idea what to do. “I have a f**king gun,” I shouted uselessly. (That you don’t know how to use, I could imagine the thing chuckle, mocking me.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backed up and ran my free hand up and down the wall until I found the light switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was when something bit me on the palm of the hand that was reaching for the light switch. There was a hissing noise, then a stinging sensation in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouted involuntarily and flicked on the lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding the gun in my outstretched hand, I swept it across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing that moved was the Terby, which had landed on the floor and lurched forward before tilting over onto its side, its strange eyes fixed on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was lying next to a small dead mouse that had been gutted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was nothing else in the room. And I almost broke down with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed hard and slowly moved to the open window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I heard the screeching of tires I ran toward it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside on Elsinore Lane, the cream-colored 450 SL disappeared around the corner onto Bedford Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumbled down the staircase and out the front door, where Wendy and Robby and Sarah were now standing, dumbstruck. Wendy reached down and picked Sarah up and held her tightly, a protective gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you see that car?” I was panting and suddenly realized I was going to be sick. I turned away from them and leaned over and vomited onto the lawn. Sarah started crying. I vomited again—this time more violently—in spasms. I wiped my mouth with the back of the hand holding the gun, trying to regain my composure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you see anybody get into that car?” I asked again. I was still panting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby stared at me with disgust and walked back into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re crazy!” he shouted before I heard him furiously burst into tears. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-63.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
