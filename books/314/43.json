Leather cuffs, lined with fluffy sheepskin, are attached to the straps. These cuffs have been fastened around Da5id\u0027s wrists and ankles. He\u0027s wearing a hospital gown that has mostly fallen off.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe worst thing is that his eyes don\u0027t always point in the same direction. He\u0027s hooked up to an EKG that\u0027s charting his heartbeat, and even though Hiro\u0027s not a doctor, he can see it\u0027s not a regular pattern. It beats too fast, then it doesn\u0027t beat at all, then an alarm sounds, then it starts beating again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe has gone completely blank. His eyes are not seeing anything. At first, Hiro thinks that his body is limp and relaxed. Getting closer, he sees that Da5id is taut and shivering, slick with perspiration.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"We put in a temporary pacemaker,\" a woman says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro turns. It\u0027s a nun who also appears to be a surgeon.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How long has he been in convulsions?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"His ex-wife called us in, said she was worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Juanita.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. When the paramedics arrived, he had fallen out of his chair at home and was convulsing on the floor. You can see a bruise, here, where we think his computer fell off the table and hit him in the ribs. So to protect him from further damage, we put him in four-points. But for the last half hour he\u0027s been like this -- like his whole body is in fibrillation. If he stays this way, we\u0027ll take the restraints off.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he wearing goggles?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I can check for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But you think this happened while he was goggled into his computer?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t know, sir. All I know is, he\u0027s got such bad cardiac arrhythmia that we had to implant a temporary pacemaker right there on his office floor. We gave him some seizure medication, which didn\u0027t work. Put him on some downers to calm him, which worked slightly. Put his head into various pieces of imaging machinery to find out what the problem was. The jury is still out on that.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m going to go look at his house,\" Hiro says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor shrugs.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me know when he comes out of it,\" Hiro says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor doesn\u0027t say anything to this. For the first time, Hiro realizes that Da5id\u0027s condition may not be temporary.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs Hiro is stepping out into the hallway, Da5id speaks, \"e ne emmariiagiaginimumamadameneemamankigaagia gi..\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro turns around and looks. Da5id has gone limp in the restraints, seems relaxed, half asleep. He is looking at Hiro through half-closed eyes. \"e ne em dam gal nun na a gi agi e ne em u mu unabzukaagiaagi ... \"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDa5id\u0027s voice is deep and placid, with no trace of stress. The syllables roll off his tongue like drool. As Hiro walks down the hallway he can hear Da5id talking all the way.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"i ge en i ge en nu ge en nu ge en us sa tur ra lu ra ze em men ... \"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/708.html","bookId":314,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM"}
