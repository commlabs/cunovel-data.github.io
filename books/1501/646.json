{"id":50343,"no":646,"title":"Book 20, Chapter 28 - The Mournful Sword","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe golden-robed youth standing before Ji Ning had very gentle eyes.. He looked towards Ning in a very affectionate way, as though he was looking his most beloved lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, Ning felt vaguely threatened as the eighth guardian stared at him. Still, he didn’t say anything. Instead, he turned to look at the enormous sword that was next to him. Sword-arts had already begun to appear on its surface. As he had battled his way past the guardians, the sword-arts he had encountered had become increasingly formidable and had provided more and more insights to Ning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, Ning could sense that all of these sets of sword-arts were guiding him towards the limits of the Heavenly Daos, as if they were teaching him how to reach and surpass those limits. Although there were many types of sword-arts in the Three Realms, aside from the [Five Treasures] which had surpassed the Heavenly Daos, no sword-arts had inspired him and helped him as much as these ones had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The major power who created Undermoon Lake definitely had an extraordinary background. The sword-arts he has left behind have been tremendously beneficial to me, but he’s also done the same for the other Empyrean Gods, some of whom use spears, staves, scimitars, and other weapons. No matter what weapon is used, the Path of Blades will produce a different, matching guardian.” Ning was stunned by the implications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis further reinforced the truth to Ning that the primordial chaos truly was filled with all possibilities. The Three Realms was nothing more than a single little chaosworld within the infinite primordial chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo sit at the bottom of a well and stare at the tiny portion of sky that was visible and believe it to be the entirety of the heavens…that would truly be a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince he was weak, he had to work hard and train hard to make himself become strong. Ning celebrated the fact that he had been able to come to Undermoon Lake and become more powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This sword-art is quite marvelous, quite special…” As Ning watched, a look of veneration appeared in his eyes. “Lingering affection? Longing? The name of this sword-art should be the ‘Longing Sword’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword-arts were displayed on the sword three times, then vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoosh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo swords appeared in the hands of the golden-robed youth. He lowered his head to look at the swords, his gaze very gentle. In a soft voice, he said, “It’s time to fight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.” Ning nodded, a pair of swords appearing in his own hands as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golden-robed youth smiled slightly, a beautiful, intoxicating smile. He then transformed into a gentle breeze, and his sword-light was like a gentle breeze as well. It seemed incomparably soft and harmless, but Ning could sense a tremendous threat emanating from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he hadn’t had the chance to view the complete sword-art three times from start to finish, he probably would’ve been at a huge disadvantage. However, Ning now knew this sword-art, the ‘Longing Sword’, with incomparable clarity, giving him a much better chance of dealing with it. Twin swords in his hands, he sent his own sword-light howling forth at the speed of light, using the ghostly and unpredictable ‘Shadowless’ stance to launch a frenetic series of attacks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, his swords would be tremendously ferocious that they would actually move a bit slower. The fact that his swords alternated being fast and slow made them even more unpredictable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, Ning’s sword-arts were far deadlier than they had been when he had first embarked upon the Path of Blades. And indeed, Ning had reaped much from his battles against the seven previous guardians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blood Drop stance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sword-art suddenly transformed into the fastest attack of all, the Blood Drop stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the enemy’s sword-art was like an endless, bottomless web that completely trapped and tied down Ning’s two swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Longing…” Ning was gaining more and more insights into this set of sword-arts. At the beginning, he had only been able to rely on what he had seen on the giant sword. Now, upon actually fighting against a person identical to himself in all respects who used this sword-art, his insights were different. Ning gained an even better understanding of how some of the killer blows of this sword-art truly worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Compared to it, my [Brightmoon] sword-art isn’t fluid enough.” Ning’s sword-art began to change as well, becoming even more unpredictable and ephemeral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadowless stance, Blood Drop stance. The two joined together into a more perfect whole, and fewer and fewer flaws appeared when he attacked and withdrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh?” The golden-robed youth frowned. Instantly, his body blurred for a moment before he manifested three heads and six arms, beginning to assault Ning with six swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing immediately used [Three Heads, Six Arms] to engage as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlash!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA streak of sword-light landed upon the golden-robed youth’s neck, knocking his sword aside and forcing him back five steps before he was able to stabilize himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golden-robed youth stared at Ning, then said in a low voice, “Your sword is faster than mine, but the intrinsic essence of your sword-art…it’s a bit inferior to mine. You have passed my challenge, but the ninth guardian’s sword has also reached the limits of the Heavenly Daos, while the essence of his sword-art is also superior to yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? Being stronger than me is a good thing.” Ning grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be careful.” The golden-robed youth disappeared into thin air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing let out a sigh of relief. He had finally succeeded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot hesitating at all, Ning continued to advance. A short while later, he saw the ninth guardian. Upon seeing him, Ning could sense the essence of utter despair surging towards him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That invisible essence and aura is only growing more and more powerful.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh to himself. “I hear that at the fifth stage of swordforce, ‘Sword God’, one doesn’t even have to attack; the invisible sword-intent radiating out from you will be more than enough to force enemies to feel utter despair. The Path of Blades…not only is it guiding me towards a path that surpasses the Heavenly Daos, it’s also guiding me towards the fifth stage of swordforce.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eight guardian’s ‘Longing Sword’ already had a hint of that quality to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ninth guardian, just by standing there, was already radiating a strong aura of despair. Clearly, he was even more formidable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, compared to someone who had truly reached the fifth stage of swordforce, ‘Sword God’, the ninth guardian was still far, far inferior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was nothing more than a guidepost! His mission was to plant a seed in Ning’s heart, a seed which perhaps would eventually take root and grow in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at the sword-art.” The ninth guardian said these words very calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing smiled, then looked at the sword-arts on display upon the giant sword nearby. As he watched, his face slowly began to change. Every single stance, every single stroke…it all caught Ning’s full attention, tugging on the deepest, innermost thoughts in his heart. The more he analyzed this sword-art, the more powerfully Ning was affected by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his past life, Ning was tormented by illness. His heart had been filled with resentment. In this life, after being reborn, his father Ji Yichuan and his mother Yuchi Snow had filled Ning’s heart with love, warming it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Father. Mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerpentwingn Lake. Ning was lying atop that wooden boat, floating atop the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat instant when Yu Wei had died. He had felt such despair that he himself had nearly died as well. His parents were gone. Even Yu Wei was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was thanks to his experiences that this sword-art resonated so deeply with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sword-art caused Ning’s heart to be filled with a dark, dreary feeling. Deep in his heart, he was filled with the utmost of despair!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior apprentice-sister isn’t dead yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once I leave this place, I’ll be able to save her. Our family can be reunited.” Ning mumbled these words to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword-arts had already finished their display on the sword. As for the ninth guardian, he stared at Ning in astonishment, because he could sense the intent radiating from Ning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is the name of this sword-art?” Ning asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the ninth guardian he had encountered, but this was the first time that Ning had asked for the proper name of a sword-art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mourning,” the ninth guardian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mourning…mourning…” Ning suddenly let out a laugh. “How appropriate. I’ve mourned in the past…but here and now, I’m filled with hope.” After finishing his words, Ning turned and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You aren’t going to fight?” The ninth guardian called out after him in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not a match for you right now. Next time I come, I’ll defeat you.” Ning’s figure quickly disappeared into the distant wooden bridge, causing the ninth guardian to gawk in amazement. Still, he didn’t chase after Ning, because the two of them had identical bodies and abilities; if Ning was intent on leaving, there was no way he could even catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He actually didn’t even fight.” The ninth guardian was completely puzzled. “And just by viewing the sword-art, he felt certain that he was no match for me. For him to make that claim means that he should’ve mastered more than half of that sword-art and discovered the truly formidable aspects to it. But despite all that, he shouldn’t have chosen to completely avoid fighting me…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unless…there’s only one possibility! After viewing the sword-art, his heart was inspired and so he wanted to go back to calm himself down and meditate on his insights.” This was the ninth guardian’s guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew very well that given how formidable Ning’s protective divine ability was, even if Ning lost the fight he wouldn’t have been in danger of dying. This meant that the only reason Ning would refuse to fight would be if he simply didn’t want to! Why wouldn’t he want to fight? The only explanation was that he was worried that a battle would disrupt his insights!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guardian’s guess was correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis set of sword-arts, the [Mourning] sword-art, had indeed resonated with Ning. In fact, after viewing it three times, Ning had learned most of it! His own heart had been filled with many new insights, and Ning was worried that if the battle became too frenzied, he would lose some of those insights. Thus, he instead decided to give up the fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile flying back, Ning continuously reflected on that sword-art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first set of sword-arts on the Path of Blades that had truly resonated with him. This was because the feelings and emotions the sword-art embodied were feelings that he himself had experienced. He knew those feelings very well, and so he almost instantly understood the nature and the truth of this sword-art! This was a set of sword-arts that was even more perfect than his own [Brightmoon] sword-art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilostar Island. The end of the wooden bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than two hundred Empyrean Gods were standing there, craning their necks to stare at the bridge while waiting nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder how many guardians Darknorth made it past.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he’s able to go through nine of them in one try, or even all ten, that would be wonderful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please don’t let him be so impatient as to beat all ten. As soon as he beats nine, he needs to come back and take us all with him as he challenges the tenth. That’s the ideal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the Empyrean Gods waited eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmpyrean God Sin and Empyrean God Sealthroat’s chances of succeeding were too low. Right now, their only hope was Ji Ning. All of them chatted amongst themselves about how formidable Ji Ning was and how certain he was to succeed. Right now, their greatest fear was that Ji Ning would only be able to defeat five or six guardians. If that happened, it would be a long, long time before he would be able to successfully challenge the Path of Blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look!” Suddenly, Empyrean God Roughpeak pointed towards the distance. He had been seated by himself the entire time, quietly staring off into the distance. He had been alone on the snowy island for so long that he had gotten used to being by himself. He still, however, deeply desired to leave this place and so he had been staring unblinkingly towards the bridge. As soon as Ning’s figure had appeared off in the distance, he had been the first to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Ji Ning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ji Ning’s coming back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of them grew excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the distant white-robed youth flew across the wooden bridge, all of the Empyrean Gods rose to their feet to welcome him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing landed. Upon seeing the eager looks on the faces of the many Empyrean Gods, he felt an enormous, invisible pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did it go?” Empyrean God Sin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I beat eight of the guardians. For now, I’m not a match for the ninth guardian,” Ning said. He knew very well that every single guardian was capable of perfectly executing their respective sword-arts. Since the ninth guardian was able to perfectly control [Mourning], at present Ning truly wasn’t a match for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You beat eight of them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two more remain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the Empyrean Gods present were dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo tell the truth, deep in their hearts, the Empyrean Gods all felt at least slightly disappointed. Beating eight meant that there were still two more to go! Those final two guardians were like a pair of tigers that blocked the road; Ji Ning would probably need quite a bit of time in order to overcome them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough they were slightly disappointed, they were still fairly calm. In fact, they all secretly let out sighs of relief. Thank goodness that Ning was more powerful than Greatdream and Ninedawn, at least. Ning’s utter domination of the twenty-plus Empyrean Gods of the Sealmess Gate had stirred all of their imaginations, causing them to fantasize a bit too much about his strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You beat eight of them? Not bad, not bad. Greatdream and Ninedawn only defeated seven of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only two left. Soon, you’ll be able to make it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the Empyrean Gods said words of encouragement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing naturally knew what all of the Empyrean Gods were hoping for. He immediately explained, “I need some time to meditate and train for a period of time. I’m going to head off now.” After speaking, he immediately transformed into a streak of light and flew away at high speed. He returned to his living region, set down his Immortal estate, then entered it and began to meditate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed time. Time to meditate and go over his insights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large number of ideas began to swell like a mental tidalwave. The insights he had gained on the Path had truly excited him. He didn’t have any time at all to waste on chatting with those other Empyrean Gods; what he needed was to meditate and absorb all of these new ideas, nonstop!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-20-chapter-27\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-20-chapter-29\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/desolate-era/de-book-20-chapter-28","bookId":1501,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:13 AM"}
