Right now the pumpers are overdosed and I have to bring them down before they all have heart attacks.\" She dashed off in the direction of the handcar, her perfect balance a tribute to long experience on the rocking flatcars. Train legs instead of sea legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill flopped into one of the theater seats. \"I\u0027m out of shells for the rifle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill nodded. \"Guy jumped me before I could get the pistols out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay here. I\u0027ll see if she needs any help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer climbed forward after Tyler. He noticed the train had slowed again to the pace of a fast walk. He reached the handcar and found most of the musclemen slumped on the deck, eyes closed, massive chests rising and falling with shallow breaths. Greasy piles of meat. Only two of the big brutes remained to work the hand pump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer watched Tyler put two fingers to a man\u0027s throat, shake her head and roll him off the train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His heart exploded,\" Tyler said. \"I couldn\u0027t dose him in time. The two pumping are on a half-dose of downer juice. When they get tired, I\u0027ll wake up two more to take over. Best we can do for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t we just stop for a while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, squinted up at the sun. \"At this pace, we won\u0027t reach our destination in daylight. It\u0027s dangerous to run at night, but worse if we stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer remembered she\u0027d said something about cannibals. He gulped. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need your help now,\" she said. \"Get to the back end of the train and keep watch. We don\u0027t want anything crawling up our tailpipe while we\u0027re going this slow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flicked her a two-finger salute and headed back the way he\u0027d come. He picked up the Uzi along the way and paused to tell Bill he\u0027d be guarding the back of the train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep my eyes peeled here,\" Bill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer went into the gear and found a box of 9 mm ammunition, winked at Bill and headed back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat with his feet dangling over the back of the last flatcar. The track dwindled behind. Forest had cropped up on either side, although he occasionally glimpsed a stretch of road or power lines, a small abandoned house. A barn. He thumbed new shells into the Uzi\u0027s magazine, reloaded the police special. He wished he had cigarettes. Mortimer had never smoked, but lighting up a Lucky seemed like something soldiers on guard duty did in the movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiles and hours crept away, never to be seen again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of the cold wind on his neck and ears, Mortimer started to drift, the rocking train easing his eyelids down. He slumped, the Uzi heavy in his lap. With the adrenaline rush from the attack fading, the aches and nausea of his hangover seeped back into his body. He\u0027d pay a hundred Armageddon dollars for three hours back in the hotel bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoey Armageddon\u0027s, the hotel, the food, the drink, the lights. It had all fooled Mortimer, lulled him into forgetting the world was now a wild and broken place. Could Anne survive out here? This savage country where women were bought and sold like cattle. She seemed far away, and here was Mortimer inching along on a train powered by sweaty men. Mortimer had read those Conan the Barbarian novels as a teenager. It took a barbarian to live in such a world, someone brutal and ruthless with the survival instincts of an animal. Mortimer wasn\u0027t a barbarian. He was an insurance salesman. He felt suddenly small and fragile. He needed Starbucks and Krispy Kreme and Jiffy Lube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer dreamed of Anne in a metal bikini like the one Carrie Fisher wore in Return of the Jedi. But she wasn\u0027t chained to Jabba the Hutt. She was chained to Arnold Schwarzenegger, but not the Conan Schwarzenegger. It was Arnold from The Terminator, the flesh peeled away from half his skull, revealing the metal underneath. One eye glowing red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is my woman now, said the Terminator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! That\u0027s my wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake him away, barked the Terminator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen grabbed him, took him to the Thunderdome, where Mad Max tried to kill him. No, not Mad Max. Mel Gibson handing him a big wooden cross. Carry this. He stuck a crown of thorns on Mortimer\u0027s head. The thorns tore flesh, blood running into his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer looked at the blood in the palm of his hand. The blob of blood became a glowing light, blinking red. Michael York grabbed his arm. Run! Run!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer ran. He was in a bright city. They were chasing him. He ran and ran until the world was a blur, a forest, then a desert, then the ruined buildings of a deserted town. Anne! Anne! Where was she? And even if he found her, then what? How would they live? Where would they go? Mortimer thought he was rescuing her. He couldn\u0027t even save himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt somebody grab him, looked up at Kurt Russell with long hair and an eye patch. Come on. We\u0027ve got to escape from here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeave me alone. I\u0027m too tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said wake up.\" The voice had become feminine but with a hard edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer started, blinked. Kurt Russell\u0027s face morphed into somebody else. Only the eye patch remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better not be falling asleep,\" Tyler warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer dug the sleep out of his eyes with a thumb. \"No, of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" Tyler looked doubtful. \"It\u0027s going to be dark soon, and I need you on your toes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate to even ask this, but when you say cannibals, are you being figurative? I mean, is it a gang that calls themselves the Cannibals or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler leaned down, pinched the flesh of his cheek. \"They\u0027d fry you up and serve you with little red potatoes, man. Now stay awake.\" She went forward again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027d find me very chewy,\" he shouted after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. I\u0027m going to be an entr¨¦e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train crawled along like an anemic box turtle. The sun sank, and in the final orange fuzz of daylight, Bill came back to the end flatcar, sat next to Mortimer. He cradled the lever-action rifle, the last rays of the sun making his complexion ruddy and outdoorsy. He looked like the cover of a Louis L\u0027Amour novel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wants you up front,\" Bill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clapped the cowboy on the shoulder. \"Stay awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made his way forward, moving more easily this time, getting used to the sway of the train. He found most of the sleeping meat snoring on the deck of the handcar, except for the two at the hand pump. Tyler waved him over, handed him a big, heavy flashlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get up to the front of the train. It\u0027ll be full dark soon. I don\u0027t usually like to run at night, but it can\u0027t be helped. I need you to watch for obstructions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" He started for the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed his arm tight, looked down at the flashlight. \"I\u0027m not even going to tell you what a flashlight and rechargeable batteries cost. You drop it over the side and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know. You\u0027ll toss me over and feed me to the cannibals and blah blah blah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just so you understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his position up front. The sun finished its escape, and the night went dark and cold quickly. Mortimer flipped on the flashlight, and the beam stabbed out far and strong, lighting up the track a good fifty feet in front of the train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer kept his eyes on the track but allowed himself a glance at the sky. The stars hung bright and vivid in the deep black of space. With the wind in his hair, the light out front, Mortimer almost felt like he was flying, the train gliding along smooth and straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forest widened, the trees falling away on both sides. They were on a long bridge. Mortimer fished around with the flashlight. They were crossing over a river. It must have been one of the dozens of middling-sized rivers that fed the Chickamauga. It would be deep and cold with mountain runoff. Mortimer leaned over the edge, looked down, the flashlight beam playing over the running water. He estimated it maybe twenty-five feet down. His gaze came back up, away from the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA face, slack jawed, haunted eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt startled him. Mortimer gasped. It had only been a second, a glimpse. But Mortimer was sure he\u0027d seen a pale figure, greasy haired, standing on the bridge at the edge of the track. He leaned over the side, shined the light back the way they\u0027d come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing. Had he imagined it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung the light back forward again. A gap in the track, twenty feet away, the metal rails twisted and scorched as if from a blast. Mortimer\u0027s eyes shot wide. He drew breath to scream a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handcar dove into the gap, jammed and jerked to a halt, the flatcars piling up behind. The crash was a shattering mix of splintering wood and groaning, clanging metal. He heard a number of screams, the loudest his own as he flew headlong onto the railroad track ahead of the train. He landed hard, the wind knocking out of him. He rolled and tumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was flying, wind flapping his clothes. Stars flashed over him, then his breath was taken away by the freezing sting of impact. The river closed over him like a cold tomb. He bounced against a rock, kicked, paddled, surfaced. He had time for one ragged breath before the river took him down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer spun and tumbled in the dark water, the current sweeping him an unknown distance in time and space, the cold searing him to the bone with white-hot pain. His lungs burned. He broke the surface again, gasped and gulped breath, taking in water too. He coughed and picked a direction in the implacable night, kicked and stroked for the bank. The icy water had sapped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to give up when he touched bottom, dragged himself onto the land and flopped on his back in the patchy snow and mud. He lay a moment, chest heaving as he sucked air. Every limb screamed murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ripple of orange along the water made him sit up. He\u0027d come down the river farther than he\u0027d thought, the current so swift. In the distance, hellish light bathed the bridge. The Muscle Express burned, the flames reaching into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must have been visible for miles and miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXV\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShivering, aching and cramped from the cold, his wet clothes clinging to him, it took Mortimer nearly an hour to pick his way along the steep bank until he stood almost directly below the blazing train. He stood in its heat, let the warmth spread through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Tyler been aboard? Bill? He shuddered to think of them burning alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there had been no fuel. The train had been powered by muscle. What had caused the fire? Or who? The same people who\u0027d sabotaged the track. An ambush. He jerked his head around, scanning the tree line. Nobody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to get ankle-deep in the water again to make his way to the other side of the bridge. He found crates busted open. The train had been looted. His eyes raked the water and the far bank. No bodies. Where were the muscle guys? Had Mortimer been the only one thrown clear? The bodies had been taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCannibals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver crawled up Mortimer\u0027s spine that had nothing to do with the cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurn around and walk the other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t. At the very least he owed Bill. He had to know, had to see. He started walking upriver, keeping close to the bank, clueless where else to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon he\u0027d have to stop and build a fire and damn if anyone saw. Hypothermia was fast becoming a bigger worry than cannibals. But Mortimer had no matches, and if he did, they\u0027d be soaked. He could rub sticks together until doomsday and never get a fire. Everything near the river was snow-soaked and muddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy had he come down from the mountain? There was no point in continuing. He\u0027d lost the Uzi. The police special was at the bottom of the river. He couldn\u0027t rescue Bill even if he was still alive. All of Mortimer\u0027s possessions were lost, even the Armageddon dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d have traded every last Armageddon dollar he had for dry clothes and matches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cup of hot coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe marched on. Lie down and sleep. Go ahead, his body said. Slip into that final dream without thought or pain. The idea was so seductive. That he could give up, curl into a ball and simply drift off forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hamburger would have been nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the dense trees up the bank, Mortimer glimpsed a flicker of orange. He jogged toward it, wove a crooked path among the trees. The fire was farther than it had seemed at first, and Mortimer soon slowed to a ragged walk, stumbling in the dark, tree branches scraping his face, roots catching his toe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tripped, fell face-first flat into cold leaves and mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer sighed, heaved himself up on his elbows and summoned the energy to get to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the scream and went flat again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second scream was worse than the first, a panicked, terrified, agonized howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer could not make himself move forward. Petrified. The screams came again, a series of hopeless cries mixed with indistinguishable pleading and sobbing, each wail turning his spine into jelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven worse than the screams was the chanting, low and guttural. Mortimer couldn\u0027t quite make it out, but it seemed to be the same word over and over again. He had to know, had to find out. Even as he told himself Run, he found himself slinking forward, crawling on his belly like a lizard, slithering through the dead leaves and the sparse undergrowth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to go on for hours, the hideous screaming and chanting, Mortimer\u0027s edging closer an inch at a time. It must have only been twenty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lifetime of pain and evil could be packed into twenty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer was close enough now to hear the many voices chanting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meat. Meat. Meat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurn around. Run, you dumb son of a bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meat. Meat. MEAT!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother scream punctuated the chant. The crowd paused to raise an ugly, jeering cheer before resuming. \"Meat. Meat. Meat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer flattened himself against a fallen tree. Raise your head and look. You wanted to see this. Look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his head but suddenly squeezed his eyes shut tight. He could feel the heat from the bonfire on his face. Open your eyes. Do it. Look now. Do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him a long moment to completely realize the scope of the horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked into a large compound, a group of Appalachian savages swaying and pumping fists around a big bonfire. Meat meat meat. They all wore ragged denim, many in overalls. Beat-up hats pulled tight on greasy heads. Some macabre version of the Hat-fields and McCoys. Some held rifles, but many others clutched crude spears with heads of jagged metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust to the left of the fire, several figures had been tied to poles stuck in the ground. Like a captured safari party in a bad Tarzan movie. He saw two of the musclemen and Tyler. Bill was there too. Even at this distance, Mortimer recognized their terror-stricken expressions. They waited to be eaten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch closer to the fire, a table made out of a large wooden door had been propped up at a forty-five-degree angle. One of the muscle guys had been tied spread-eagle on the table. A splash of red gore stained the table where his left leg used to be. He stared vacantly into the night sky. Catatonic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer realized he was watching the whole scene through some sort of makeshift fence only three feet away. A closer examination turned his stomach. The fence had been constructed of old, bleached bones. Toothy skulls capped the posts. How many gruesome meals did those bones represent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud voice snapped Mortimer\u0027s attention back to the bonfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall figure, gaunt, hands raised like some savage priest\u0027s. Dark paint around his eyes, making him look like a raccoon. \"We have conquered the train that dares invade the clan\u0027s territory!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cheer from the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer propped himself up on the fallen tree, craned his neck for a closer look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest wore a large necklace of finger bones. A wide black belt from which hung a rusting cavalry saber. High black boots. A black cape, probably looted from some costume shop. He\u0027d have looked almost comic if not for the glint of fire reflecting in his demon eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest\u0027s voice carried over all. \"We are the clan, and we absorb the strength of our enemies through blood. Nothing is forbidden us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother cheer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring forth the butcher! Take the other leg!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWild cheering, followed by the chant. Meat meat meat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hairy brute emerged from the crowd. A short man but wide, a bulging fireplug. He wore a stained leather apron, various knives and cleavers dangling from his belt. An orange Tennessee Volunteers cap. He clutched a gleaming hacksaw in his thick hand and approached the muscle guy strapped to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God...But Mortimer couldn\u0027t turn away. He watched, transfixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butcher bent over the muscle guy\u0027s leg, prodded it with thick, stubby fingers, nodding to himself, egged on by the chanting crowd. The muscle guy still stared ahead at nothing, deep in his horror-induced trance. The butcher set the saw\u0027s teeth against flesh, high up the thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeat meat meat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe saw blade bit deep, the butcher leaning all of his weight into it. Bright blood fountained. The muscle guy was yanked back to reality, screamed and thrashed against his bonds, eyes bulging. The butcher was relentless, sawing back and forth with long, hard strokes. Blood sprayed his apron and face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer turned away and vomited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, the screams stopped. Perhaps the muscle guy had passed out, or maybe he\u0027d simply died from shock and blood loss. Mortimer poked his head up again, fearing what he might see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe legless muscleman twitched and drooled, eyes hollow, seeing nothing. The butcher carried the leg to a small group of cannibals who already had the other leg lashed to a spit attached to two long poles. Once they\u0027d attached the other leg, the cannibals held the legs over the fire. The smell of roasting human almost made Mortimer throw up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Break out the fermented blood,\" the priest shouted. \"Tonight we party!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most enthusiastic cheer yet. A group of cannibals produced instruments: mandolin, guitar, harmonica and bongo drum. They played-something between bluegrass and adult contemporary. Some danced around the fire. When the meat had cooked, portions of leg were sliced off and passed around. Lips smacked. The butcher brought the arms and torso to be cooked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer went flat on his belly again. He couldn\u0027t watch any longer. He crawled around the camp trying to edge closer to the prisoners. The thought he could free his friends was laughable. But he had to see, had to be able to tell himself in the deep dark of future restless nights that he\u0027d tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music, the hellish orange of the bonfire, the chanting and dancing and occasional scream all mixed to form a portrait of hell that would have made Dante piss his pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer belly-crawled until the cold and wet and the long night sapped all that was left of him.
