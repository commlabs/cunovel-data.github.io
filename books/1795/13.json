She’s remarried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe settled deeper into his chair. “I didn’t do any better with marriage myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m surprised you even gave it a whirl. You always said you wouldn’t be any good at it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turned out I was right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One thing you should know,” Jed said quietly after a while. “Dell Sadler still thinks you pushed his sister over that cliff. You might want to stay out of his way while you’re here in town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks for the tip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. What are friends for?” Jed looked down the length of the broad front porch that encircled the mansion. “What are you going to do with this place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Open an inn and a restaurant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whew!” Jed was clearly impressed. “Talk about big plans! Gonna cost a bundle, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a problem,” Rafe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah stood on the rocky beach below the Harte cottage and watched Winston chase seagulls in Dead Hand Cove. The tide was still out this morning. The five tall, finger-shaped stones that had given the cove its name thrust upward from the wet sand in a pattern that was eerily reminiscent of the outflung hand of a corpse. Or so she and Nick and Lillian had concluded years ago. When the tide came in a few hours from now, all but the very tip of the forefinger would be submerged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cove had been a favorite playground for all three Hartes in their youth. In addition to the macabre rock formation, it boasted an intricate network of small caves in the cliffs that framed the tiny beach. Together with Nick and Lillian, Hannah had spent hours exploring the rocky passages. The caves weren’t dangerously deep or convoluted, and they had made excellent hiding places for adventurous children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the cove, Winston dashed off after another seagull. He was certainly enjoying the stay in Eclipse Bay, Hannah thought. What surprised her was that she was strangely content also, in spite of the looming problem of Rafe Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Winston had been here for the better part of a week, but she was no closer to resolving the sticky situation involving Dreamscape than she had been that first afternoon. Rafe refused even to discuss the possibility of selling his share of the mansion. A war of nerves was taking shape. They couldn’t go on like this indefinitely, she told herself. Sooner or later one of them would have to make a move toward ending the impasse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut on the sand, Winston found a piece of driftwood, seized it in his jaws, and pranced triumphantly back toward Hannah. Halfway across the cove he came to a sudden halt and looked up toward the cliff path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimultaneously a whisper of awareness tingled through Hannah. She sensed Rafe’s presence just before he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice to see that Winston doesn’t stand on formality all the time,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah braced herself for the little shock of excitement she always got when she first encountered him. She turned and saw that he had reached the bottom of the path. He came toward her with that supple masculine grace that was so much a part of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime had not refined Rafe. The cool, savvy intelligence in his green eyes was more intense and more dangerous—the result of hard experience, no doubt. The bold, sharp planes and angles of his lean face had always had a strict cast, but the years had added an aura of brooding asceticism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had left behind the few traces of young manhood that had still clung to him that night on the beach. Nevertheless, for some reason he actually looked better than ever in a pair of jeans. Beneath the tautly stretched fabric of the black, long-sleeved T-shirt he wore, his shoulders seemed broader and stronger. His stomach was still very flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the matter with her? she wondered. For eight years she had excused herself for her small, youthful, short-lived crush on Rafe Madison. After all, he had been the bad boy of Eclipse Bay, and he had once walked her home after midnight. That was enough to induce a few lusty imaginings in any healthy young woman. But she was far too mature for that sort of romantic nonsense now. Wasn’t she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never admitted the crush to anyone, of course—not even Lillian, although she suspected that her sister had guessed the truth. She had a right to her private little fantasies, she told herself. And it wasn’t as if she had spent the past few years wondering what she had missed. In fact, she had all but forgotten Rafe Madison until Isabel’s lawyer had called to give her the news about the will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning, Rafe. Fancy meeting you here. Come to talk about Dreamscape?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I make it a policy not to talk business before noon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you talk about it much after noon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only if I feel real energetic.” He leaned down to greet Winston. “I’m on my way into town to check the mail. Thought I’d see if you and the mutt wanted to go along.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer first reaction was surprise. This was the first overture of any kind that he had made since the initial confrontation at Dreamscape. Maybe he was going to blink first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe she ought to be very, very careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, sooner or later they had to start communicating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do need to do some grocery shopping,” she said warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Might as well go into town together.” He gave her an unreadable smile. “Give the good folk of Eclipse Bay a thrill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her blowing hair out of her eyes and peered at him closely. She could not tell if he was joking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” she said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe startled her with a fleeting grin. “That’s one of the things I always admired about you. You were never afraid of the Big Bad Wolf.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved a hand toward Winston. “These days I’ve got my own wolf.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe eyed Winston with an assessing expression. “Five will get you ten that I can take the dog with one hand tied behind my back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t count on it, tough guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later Hannah emerged from Fulton’s Supermarket with a sack in each arm. She looked down the rows of pickups and SUVs parked in the small lot and saw the silver Porsche. Rafe had collected the mail and was waiting for her. He lounged against a gleaming fender, arms folded. A pair of mirrored sunglasses added to the gangster look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinston stood on his hind legs in the driver’s seat, front paws braced against the edge of the door, nose thrust through the open window. It warmed Hannah’s heart to see that he was watching for her return. You could always count on your dog. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-1/page-13.html","bookId":1795,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:58 PM"}
