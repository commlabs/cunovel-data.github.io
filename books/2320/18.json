She hadn\u0027t entered it alone. Someone had seen her walk in arm in arm with the person who subsequently killed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the kind of thing a cop could have run down. The police department had two things that made that sort of investigation work for them- the manpower and the authority. And you needed both to bring it off. One man working alone was not going to get anywhere. One man, with not even a junior G-man badge to convince people they ought to talk to him, would not even begin to accomplish anything that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially when the police would not even cooperate with him in the first place. Especially when they were opposed to any investigation that might get Broadfield out of the hot seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my approach had to be a very different one, and one that no policeman could be expected to approve. I had to find out who had killed her, and then I had to find the facts that might back up what I\u0027d already doped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut first I had to find somebody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small person, Kenny had said. Short, slender. Hollow cheeks. A great deal of forehead and an appalling absence of chin. A tentative beard. No mustache. Heavy horn-rimmed glassesâ€¦\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped by Armstrong\u0027s first to check. He wasn\u0027t there and hadn\u0027t been in yet that morning. I thought about having a drink but decided I could tackle Douglas Fuhrmann without one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that I didn\u0027t get the chance. I went to his rooming house and rang the bell, and the same slatternly woman answered it. She may have been wearing the same robe and slippers. Once again she told me she was full up and suggested I try three doors down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doug Fuhrmann,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes took the trouble to focus on my face. \"Fourth floor front,\" she said. She frowned a little. \"You were here before. Looking for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I thought I seen you before.\" She rubbed her forefinger across her nose, wiped it on her robe. \"I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s in or not. You want to knock on his door, go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t mess with his door, though. He\u0027s got this burglar alarm set up, makes all kinds of noise. I can\u0027t even go in there to clean for him. He does his own cleaning, imagine that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s probably been with you longer than most.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, he\u0027s been here longer than me. I been working here what? A year? Two years?\" If she didn\u0027t know, I couldn\u0027t help her out. \"He\u0027s been here years and years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you know him pretty well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know him at all. Don\u0027t know any of \u0027em. I got no time to get to know people, mister. I got problems of my own, you can believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believed it, but that didn\u0027t make me want to know what they were. She evidently wasn\u0027t going to be able to tell me anything about Fuhrmann, and I wasn\u0027t interested in whatever else she might tell me. I moved past her and climbed the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t in. I tried the knob, and the door was locked. It probably would have been easy enough to slip the bolt, but I didn\u0027t want to set the alarm off. I wonder if I would have remembered it if the old woman hadn\u0027t reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote a note to the effect that it was important he get in touch with me immediately. I signed my name, added my telephone number, slipped the piece of paper under his door. Then I went downstairs and let myself out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE was a Leon Manch listed in the Brooklyn book. The address was on Pierrepont Street, which would put him in Brooklyn Heights. I decided that was as good a place as any for a toilet slave to live. I dialed his number, and the phone rang a dozen times before I gave up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried Prejanian\u0027s office. No one answered. Even crusaders only work a five-day week. I tried City Hall, wondering if Manch might have gone to the office. At least there was someone around there to answer the phone, even if there wasn\u0027t anyone present named Leon Manch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone book had Abner Prejanian listed at 444 Central Park West. I had his number half-dialed when it struck me as pointless. He didn\u0027t know me from Adam and would hardly be inclined to cooperate with a total stranger over the telephone. I broke the connection, retrieved my dime, and looked up Claude Lorbeer. There was only one Lorbeer in Manhattan, a J. Lorbeer on West End Avenue. I tried the number, and when a woman answered I asked for Claude. When he came to the phone I asked him if he had had any contact with a man named Douglas Fuhrmann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve heard the name. In what context?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s an associate of Broadfield\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A policeman? I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve heard the name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe your boss did. I was going to call him, but he doesn\u0027t know me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m glad you called me instead. I could call Mr. Prejanian and ask him for you, and then I could get back to you. Anything else you\u0027d want me to ask him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find out if the name Leon Manch rings any kind of a bell with him. In connection with Broadfield, that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. And I\u0027ll get right back to you, Mr. Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rang back within five minutes. \"I just spoke to Mr. Prejanian. Neither of the names you mentioned were familiar to him. Uh, Mr. Scudder? I\u0027d avoid any direct confrontation with Mr. Prejanian if I were you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t precisely thrilled that I was cooperating with you. He didn\u0027t say so right out, but I think you understand what I\u0027m getting at. He\u0027d prefer that his staff pursue a policy of benign neglect, if I can revive that phrase. Of course you\u0027ll keep it between us that I said as much, won\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still remain convinced that Broadfield is innocent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More now than ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this man Fuhrmann holds the key?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He might. Things are starting to come together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds fascinating,\" he said. \"Well, I won\u0027t keep you. If there\u0027s anything I can do, just give me a ring, but do let\u0027s keep it confidential, shall we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little later I called Diana. We arranged to meet at eight-thirty at a French restaurant on Ninth Avenue, the Brittany du Soir. It is a quiet and private place where we would have a chance to be quiet and private people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you at eight-thirty then,\" she said. \"Have you been making any headway? Oh, you can tell me when you see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve done so much thinking, Matthew. I wonder if you know what it\u0027s like. I\u0027ve spent so much time not thinking, almost willing myself not to think, and it\u0027s as though something has been unleashed. I shouldn\u0027t say all this. I\u0027ll just frighten you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what\u0027s strange. I\u0027m not worried. Wouldn\u0027t you say that was strange?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eON my way back to the hotel I stopped at Fuhrmann\u0027s building. The manager didn\u0027t answer my ring. I guess she was busy with some of the problems she\u0027d alluded to. I let myself in and climbed the stairs. He wasn\u0027t in and evidently hadn\u0027t been in- I could see the note I\u0027d left him under his door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished I\u0027d taken down his phone number. Assuming he had a phone- I hadn\u0027t seen one on my visit, but his desk had been cluttered. He could have had a phone under one of those piles of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went home again, showered, shaved, straightened up the room. The maid had given it a cursory cleaning, and there wasn\u0027t much more I could do. It would always look like what it was, a small room in an unprepossessing hotel. Fuhrmann had chosen to transform his furnished room into an extension of himself. I had left mine as I found it. Initially I had found its stark simplicity somehow fitting. Now I had long since ceased to notice it, and only the prospect of entertaining a guest within it made me aware of its appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked the liquor supply. There looked to be enough for me, and I didn\u0027t know what she preferred to drink. The store across the street would deliver until eleven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePut on my best suit. Dabbed on a little cologne. The boys had given it to me for a Christmas present. I wasn\u0027t even sure which Christmas and couldn\u0027t remember when I\u0027d used it last. Dabbed some on and felt ridiculous, but in a way that was not unpleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStopped at Armstrong\u0027s. Fuhrmann had been in and out an hour or so earlier. I left him a note. Called Manch, and this time he answered the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Mr. Manch, my name is Matthew Scudder. I\u0027m a friend of Portia Carr\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, a long enough one to make his reply unconvincing. \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know anyone by that name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you do. You don\u0027t want to try that stance, Mr. Manch. It\u0027s not going to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to see you. Sometime tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you when I see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand. What did you say your name was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t understand, Mr. Scudder. I don\u0027t know what you want from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be at your place tomorrow afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow afternoon,\" I said. \"Around three. It would be a very good idea for you to be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to say something, but I didn\u0027t stay on the line long enough to hear it. It was a few minutes past eight. I went outside and walked down Ninth toward the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat in a booth. She wore a simple black sheath and no jewelry. Her perfume was a floral scent with an undertone of spice. I ordered dry vermouth on the rocks for her and bourbon for myself. The conversation stayed light and airy through the first round of drinks. When we ordered a second round we also gave the waitress the dinner order- sweetbreads for her, a steak for me. The drinks came, and we touched glasses again, and our eyes met and led us into a silence that was just the slightest bit awkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke it. She extended her hand and I took it, and she lowered her eyes and said, \"I\u0027m not terribly good at this. Out of practice, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve had a few years to get used to being a bachelor. I\u0027ve had one little affair, and it wasn\u0027t really very much of anything. He was married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know that. He was married, it was very casual and purely physical, and to be honest it wasn\u0027t even that wonderful physically. And it didn\u0027t last very long.\" She hesitated. She may have been waiting for me to say something, but I remained silent. Then she said, \"You may want this to be, oh, casual, and that\u0027s all right, Matthew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think we can be casual with each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t suppose we can. I wish- I don\u0027t know what I wish.\" She lifted her glass and sipped. \"I\u0027m probably going to get a little bit drunk tonight. Is that a bad idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might be a good idea. Shall we have wine with the meal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that. I suppose it\u0027s a bad sign, having to get a little drunk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m the last person to tell you it\u0027s a bad idea. I get a little bit drunk every day of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that something I should be worried about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s damned well something you should be aware of, Diana. You ought to know who you\u0027re getting involved with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you an aloholic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what\u0027s an alcoholic? I suppose I drink enough alcohol to qualify. It doesn\u0027t keep me from functioning. Yet. I suppose it will eventually.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/in-the-midst-of-death-matthew-scudder-3/page-18.html","bookId":2320,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:30 PM"}
