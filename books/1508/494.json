However, the Demon Emperor’s letter hadn’t contained any records of the Eight Dragon Jade Light Array that surrounded the Cosmic Melting Furnace. Xuan Wuji’s only choice was to suppress the rising greed in his heart. Originally, he had thought of using this Cosmic Melting Furnace to pit everyone against each other, but now that he wasn’t even able to break through the barrier that guarded the Nirvana Dragon Root, he had to give up on that line of thinking.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, as he saw Abbot Whitebrow move towards the Cosmic Melting Furnace, Xuan Wuji began to stand alert.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf no one could obtain the Cosmic Melting Furnace, then there was nothing else to say. But if Abbot Whitebrow had a method to open the Cosmic Melting Furnace and a treasure appeared, he would snatch it there and then.

After every step, he would take a full ten breaths of time before taking the next one. At the same time, he revolved his true essence to the limit. A blazing halo of golden light surrounded him, filled with faint Buddhist seals that circled around. This was a secret Buddhist technique – Diamond Vajra Body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Buddhist martial arts focused on tenacity and extreme defense. But, they were relatively weak in attacks. This time, Abbot Whitebrow was displaying the mighty defensive techniques of the Buddhist martial arts to the limit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut could such a defense even have the possibility of resisting that piercing red light?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis question filled everyone’s mind. In the past, the Elders of the Demon God Imperial Palace were Emperor level powerhouses. So, this Eight Dragon Jade Light Array should be able to injure Emperor level powerhouses too.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, tens of thousands of years had passed. The Eight Dragon Jade Light Array’s power must have weakened by a considerably great amount. Because of this, this sort of reddish dawn light shouldn’t be as terrifying.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAbbot Whitebrow arrived just a small distance away from the platform that contained the coiling dragon columns.

This was a top ability of the Great Zen Temple’s highest holy technique, ‘Great Zen Mantra’. It was difficult to learn and difficult to control, but those who did would wield a great power.

Obviously, Abbot Whitebrow had discovered that he wouldn’t activate the array formation as long as he didn’t step on the platform with the coiling jade platforms. Then, as long as he didn’t step foot on the platform and instead used his secret Buddhist technique to grab the object from a distance, there wouldn’t be a problem!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘If this old bald monkey has cultivated the Bright Buddha Palm Seal to Perfection, then he really might be able to move the Cosmic Melting Furnace!’\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXuan Wuji’s complexion changed.

If there was a falling out in the alliance here, then that was equal to giving up on the Nirvana Dragon Root. But if Whitebrow obtained the treasure, then that also wasn’t good. It was unknown whether or not he could obtain the Nirvana Dragon Root, but this treasure would alrea\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003edy be in han\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf it was a heavenly material, then there was no need to mention its value.

In the near future, it would give Whitebrow an enormous advantage in competing for the Nirvana Dragon Root.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough Xuan Wuji was a meticulously careful and prudent person, he couldn’t think of a foolproof countermeasure in such a complex situation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, that giant golden Buddha palm phantom had already hit the Cosmic Melting Furnace. Although Abbot Whitebrow hadn’t cultivated the Bright Buddha Palm Seal to Perfection, he could still easily crush a mountain peak from 10,000 feet away!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd Abbot Whitebrow was only 40 to 50 feet away from the Cosmic Melting Furnace. The power of using the Bright Buddha Palm Seal at such a close distance could be imagined! If it wasn’t the Cosmic Melting Furnace but rather a normal earth-step pill furnace, then this attack from Abbot Whitebrow could twist it into bits!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe great golden palm wrapped around the Cosmic Melting Furnace, trying to raise it up.

Did he really think the Cosmic Melting Furnace was something that was his for the taking? He even wanted to grab the entire thing.

The lid was round and also engraved with a Golden Crow image. As Abbot Whitebrow grabbed it, there was a loud smashing sound like a morning bell being struck.

But, they weren’t able to make even a tiny bit of progress. This had caused an idea to be planted in everyone’s hearts that nothing in the Demon God Imperial Palace could be touched!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, Abbot Whitebrow had actually caused the lid of the Cosmic Melting Furnace to move; it filled everyone with hope.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Abbot Whitebrow saw this, a light flashed in his eyes.

The golden Buddha palm seemed to manifest into reality at that moment, firmly grasping the lid of the Cosmic Melting Furnace and pulling up!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAngg!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the moment that the lid shook, the Cosmic Melting Furnace suddenly issued a sound like a dragon roaring. It was a resonant cry that pierced into the heavens, a rumbling thunder that echoing throughout the world. A massive wave of pressure fell down on everyone. All of the Life Destruction Supreme Elders were forced back by this pressure, their hearts filling with fear and horror!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that split second, they were able to feel a vast, primal, wild energy rush out from the Cosmic Melting Furnace.

This energy of from tens of thousands of years past was 80 to 90% similar to the Nirvana Dragon Root!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWas it possible that this blue pill was a medicine refined with a Nirvana Dragon Root!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Nirvana Dragon Root was already a heaven-defying treasure.
