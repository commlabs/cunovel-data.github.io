He seemed at home, a creature of the Underdark, moving with typically quiet grace and cautious posture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt did not feel at home, though. Already he was deeper than the lowest tunnels of Mithril Hall, and the stagnant air pressed in on him. He had spent nearly two decades on the surface, learning and living by the rules that governed the outer world. Those rules were as different to Underdark precepts as a forest wildflower was to a deep cavern fungus. A human, a goblin, even an alert surface elf, would have taken no note of Drizzt\u0027s silent passage, though he might cross just a few feet away, but Drizzt felt clumsy and loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow ranger cringed with every step, fearing that echoes were resounding along the blank stone walls hundreds of yards away. This was the Underdark, a place negotiated less by sight than by hearing and the sense of smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt had spent nearly two thirds of his life in the Underdark,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and a good portion of the last twenty years underground in the cav\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;erns of Clan Battlehammer. He no longer considered himself a crea\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ture of the Underdark, though. He had left his heart behind on a mountainside, watching the stars and the moon, the sunrise and the sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the land of starless nights, no, not nights, just a single, unending starless night, Drizzt decided, of stagnant air, and leering stalactites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnel\u0027s width varied greatly, sometimes as narrow as the breadth of Drizzt\u0027s shoulders, sometimes wide enough for a dozen men to walk abreast. The floor sloped slightly, taking Drizzt even deeper, but the ceiling paralleled it well, remaining fairly consistent at about twice the height of the five and a half foot drow. For a long time, Drizzt detected no side caverns or corridors, and he was glad of that, for he didn\u0027t want to be forced into any direction decisions yet, and in this simple setup, any potential enemies would have to come at him from straight ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt honestly believed that he was not prepared for any sur\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;prises, not yet. Even his infravision pained him. His head throbbed as he tried to sort out and interpret the varying heat patterns. In his younger years, Drizzt had gone for weeks, even months, with his eyes tuned exclusively to the infrared spectrum, looking for heat instead of reflected light. But now, with his eyes so used to the sun above and the torches lining the corridors of Mithril Hall, he found the infravision jarring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he drew out Twinkle, and the enchanted scimitar glowed with a soft bluish light. Drizzt rested back against the wall and let his eyes revert to the regular spectrum, then used the sword as a guiding light. Soon after, he came to a six way intersection, two crossing horizontal corridors intersected by a vertical shaft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt tucked Twinkle away and looked above, up the shaft. He saw no heat sources, but was little comforted. Many of the Under\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dark\u0027s predators could mask their body temperatures, like a surface tiger used its stripes to crawl through thick strands of high grass. Dreaded hook horrors, for example, had developed an exoskeleton; the bony plates shielded the creature\u0027s body heat so that they appeared as unremarkable rocks to heat sensing eyes. And many of the Underdark\u0027s monsters were reptilian, cold blooded, and hard to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt sniffed the stagnant air several times, then he stood still and closed his eyes, letting his ears provide all the external input. He heard nothing, save the beating of his own heart, so he checked his gear to ensure that all was secure and started to climb down the shaft, taking care amid the dangerously loose rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nearly made it silently down the sixty feet to the lower corri\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dor, but a single stone skidded down before him, striking the corri\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dor\u0027s floor with a sharp crack at almost the same instant that Drizzt\u0027s soft boots quietly came down from the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt froze in place, listening to the sound as it echoed from wall to wall. As a drow patrol leader, Drizzt had once been able to follow echoes perfectly, almost instinctively discerning which walls were rebounding the sound, and from which direction. Now,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;though, he had difficulty sorting through the echo\u0027s individual sounds. Again he felt out of place, overmatched by the brooding darkness. And again he felt vulnerable, for many denizens of the dark ways could indeed follow an echo trail, and this particular one led directly to Drizzt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swiftly traversed a virtual maze of crisscrossing corridors,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;some veering sharply and descending to pass beneath others, or climbing along natural stairs to new levels of winding ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt sorely missed Guenhwyvar. The panther could sort through any maze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of the cat again a short time later, when he came around a bend and stumbled upon a fresh kill. It was some type of subterranean lizard, too mutilated for Drizzt to figure out exactly what. Its tail was gone, as was its lower jaw, and its belly had been gashed open, its innards devoured. Drizzt found long tears in the skin, as though it had been raked by claws, and long and thin bruises, like those made by a whip. Beyond a pooi of blood a few feet from the corpse, the drow found a single track, a paw print, in a shape and size very similar to one Guenhwyvar might make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Drizzt\u0027s cat was hundreds of miles away, and this kill, by the ranger\u0027s estimation, was barely an hour old. Creatures of the Underdark did not roam as did creatures of the surface; the danger\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ous predator was likely not far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor Battlehammer stormed along the passageway, his grief stolen, for the moment, by undeniably mounting rage. Thibbledorf Pwent bounced along beside the king, his mouth flapping one ques\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tion after another and his armor squealing annoyingly with every movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor skidded to a stop and turned on the battlerager, put his angry scar and angry scowl in line with Pwent\u0027s bushy bearded face. Why don\u0027t ye get yerself a bath!\" Bruenor roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePwent fell back and began to choke on the command. By his estimation, a dwarf king ordering a subject to go take a bath was roughly the equivalent of a human king telling his knights to go out and kill babies. There were some lines that a ruler simply did not cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah!\" Bruenor snorted. \"Good enough for ye, then. But go and grease that damned armor! How\u0027s a king to think with yer squeakin\u0027 and squealin\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePwent\u0027s head bobbed his agreement with the compromise, and he bounded away, almost afraid to stay, afraid that the tyrant King Bruenor would again demand the bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor just wanted the battlerager away from him, he didn\u0027t really care how he accomplished that task. It had been a difficult afternoon. The dwarf had just met with Berkthgar the Bold, an emis\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;sary from Settlestone, and had learned that Catti-brie had never arrived in the barbarian settlement, even though she had been out of Mithril Hall for nearly a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor \u0027s mind raced over the events of his last meeting with his daughter. He recalled images of the young woman, tried to scrutinize them and remember every word she had said for some clue as to what might be happening. But Bruenor had been too absorbed on that occasion. If Catti-brie had hinted at anything other than her intentions to go to Settlestone, the dwarf had simply missed ut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first thoughts, when talking with Berkthgar, were that his daughter had met some trouble on the mountainside. He had almost called out a dwarven contingent to scour the area, but, on an impulse, had paused long enough to ask the emissary about the cairn being erected for Wulfgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What cairn?\" Berkthgar had replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor knew then that he had been deceived, and if Catti-brie had not been alone in that deception, then Bruenor could easily guess the identity of her coconspirator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nearly took the wooden, iron bound door of Buster Bracer, a highly regarded armorer, off its hinges as he burst in, catching the blue bearded dwarf and his halfling subject by surprise. Regis stood atop a small platform, being measured so that his armor could be let out to fit his widening girth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor bounded up beside the pedestal (and Buster was wise enough to fall back from it), grabbed the halfling by the front of his tunic, and hoisted him into the air with one arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s me girl?\" the dwarf roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Settle.. .\" Regis started to lie, but Bruenor began shaking him violently, whipping him back and forth through the air like some rag doll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s me girl?\" the dwarf said again, more quietly, his words a threatening snarl. \"And don\u0027t ye play games with me,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Rumblebelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis was getting more than a little tired of being assaulted by his supposed friends. The quick thinking halfling immediately con\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;cocted a ruse about Catti-brie having run off to Silverymoon in search of Drizzt. It wouldn\u0027t be a complete lie, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at Bruenor \u0027s scarred face, twisted in rage, but so obvi\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ously filled with pain, the halfling could not bring himself to fib.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put me down, \" he said quietly, and apparently Bruenor under\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;stood the halfling\u0027s empathy, for the dwarf gently lowered Regis to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis brushed his tunic straight, then waggled a fist before the dwarf king. \"How dare you?\" he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor went back on his heels at the unexpected and unchar\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;acteristic outburst, but the halfling did.not relent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First Drizzt comes to me and forces me to hold a secret, \" Regis expounded, \"then Catti-brie comes in and pushes me around until I tell her. Now you... . What fine friends I have surrounded myself with!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stinging words calmed the volatile dwarf, but only a little. What secret might Regis be hinting at?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThibbledorf Pwent bounded into the room then, his armor squeaking no less, though his face, beard, and hands were certainly smeared with grease. He stopped beside Bruenor, surveying the unexpected situation for just a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePwent rubbed his hands eagerly in front of him, then ran them down the front of his cruelly ridged armor. \"Should I hug him?\" he asked his king hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor slapped a hand out to hold the eager battlerager at bay. \"Where\u0027s me girl?\" the dwarf king asked a third time, this time quietly and calmly, as though he was asking a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis firmed his jaw, then nodded and began. He told Bruenor everything, even his role in aiding Catti-brie, in handing her the assassin\u0027s dagger and the magical mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor \u0027s face began to twist in rage again, but Regis stood tall (relatively speaking) and dispelled the rising ire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I to trust in Catti-brie any less than you would?\" Regis asked simply, reminding the dwarf that his human daughter was no child, and no novice to the perils of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor didn\u0027t know how to take it all. A small part of him wanted to throttle Regis, but he understood that he would simply be playing out his frustration, and that the halfling was really not to blame. Where else could he turn, though? Both Drizzt and Catti-brie were long gone, well on their way, and Bruenor had no idea of how he could get to them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither did the scarred dwarf, at that moment, have any strength to try. He dropped his gaze to the stone floor, his anger played out and his grief returned, and, without another word, he walked from the room. He had to think, and for the sake of his dearest friend and his beloved daughter, he had to think fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePwent looked to Regis and Buster for answers, but they simply shook their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight shuffle, the padded footsteps of a hunting cat, perhaps,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;was all that Drizzt could discern. The drow ranger stood perfectly still, all his senses attuned to his surroundings. If it was the cat,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Drizzt knew that it was close enough to have caught his scent, that it undoubtedly knew that something had wandered into its territory~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt spent a moment scrutinizing the area. The tunnel contin\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ued haphazardly, sometimes wide, sometimes narrow, and this entire section was broken and uneven, the floor full of bumps and holes and the walls lined by natural alcoves and deep nooks. The ceiling, too, was no longer constant, sometimes low and sometimes high. Drizzt could see the varied gradations of heat on the high walls ahead and knew that those walls were lined by ledges in many places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA great cat could jump up there, watching its intended prey from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought was not a settling one, but Drizzt had to press on. To backtrack, he would have to go all the way to the chute and climb to a higher level, then wander about in the hopes that he would find another way down. Drizzt didn\u0027t have time to spare; neither did his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his back against the wall as he continued, stalking in a crouch, one scimitar drawn and the other, Twinkle, ready in its sheath. Drizzt did not want the magical blade\u0027s glow to further reveal his position, though he knew that hunting cats in the Under\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dark needed no light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lightly stepped across the mouth of one wide and shallow alcove, then came to the edge of a second, narrower and deeper. When he was satisfied that this one, too, was unoccupied, he turned back for a general scan of the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShining green eyes, cat eyes, stared back at him from the ledge on the opposite wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut came Twinkle, flaring an angry blue, bathing the area in light. Drizzt, his eyes shifting back from the infrared spectrum, saw the great, dark silhouette as the monster leaped, and he deftly dove out of harm\u0027s way. The cat touched down lightly, with all six legs!,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and it pivoted about, showing white teeth and sinister eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was pantherlike, its fur so black as to shimmer a deep blue,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and it was nearly as large as Guenhwyvar. Drizzt didn\u0027t know what to think. If this had been a normal panther, he would have tried to calm it, tried to show it that he was no enemy and that he would go right past its lair. But this cat, this monster, had six legs! And from its shoulders protruded long, whiplike appendages, waving menacingly and tipped with bony ridges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnarling, the beast padded in, ears tight against its head, formi\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dable fangs bared. Drizzt crouched low, scimitars straight out in front, feet perfectly balanced so that he could dodge aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast stopped its stalk. Drizzt watched carefully as its middle set of legs and its hind legs tamped down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came fast; Drizzt started left, but the beast skidded to a stop,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and Drizzt did likewise, lurching ahead to cut with one blade in a straight thrust. Right between the panther\u0027s eyes went the scimitar,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;perfectly aligned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hit nothing but air, and Drizzt stumbled forward. He instinc\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tively dove to the stone and rolled right as one tentacle whipped just above his head and the other scored a slight hit on his hip. Huge paws raked and swatted all about him, but he worked his scimitars wildly, somehow keeping them at bay. He came up running, quickly putting a few feet between himself and the dangerous cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow settled back into his defensive crouch, less confident now. The beast was smart, Drizzt would never have expected such a feint from an animal. Worse, the drow could not understand how he had missed. His blade\u0027s thrust had been true. Even the incredible agility of a cat could not have gotten the beast out of the way so quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tentacle came at him from the right, and he threw a scimitar out that way not just to parry, but hoping to sever the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe missed, then barely managed, past his surprise, to twirl to the left, taking another hit on the hip, this one painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast rushed forward, one paw flying out in front to hook the spinning drow. Drizzt braced, Twinkle ready to block, but the paw caught him fully a foot below the scimitar\u0027s blocking angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Drizzt\u0027s ability to react saved him, for instead of fighting the angle of the in turned paw (which would have ripped large lines in his body), he dove with it, down to the stone, scrambling and kicking his way past the panther\u0027s snapping maw. He felt like a mouse run~ring back under a house cat, and, worse, this cat had two sets of legs left to cross!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt elbowed and batted, jabbed up, and scored a solid hit. He couldn\u0027t see in the sudden, wild flurry, and only when he came out the panther\u0027s back side did he realize that his blindness was his sav\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ing grace. He came up into a running step, then leaped into a head\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;long roll just ahead of twin snapping tentacles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t been able to see, and he had scored his only hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe panther came around again, snarling in rage, its green eyes boring like lamplights into the drow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt spat at those eyes, a calculated move, for though his aim seemed true and the beast made no move to dodge, the spittle hit only the stone floor. The cat was not where it appeared to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt tried to remember his training in Menzoberranzan\u0027s Academy He had heard of such beasts once, but they were very rare and hadn\u0027t been a source of any major lessons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn came the cat. Drizzt leaped forward, inside the snapping reach of those painful tentacles. He guessed, aiming his attack a couple of feet to the right of where he perceived the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the cat was left, and as his scimitar swished harmlessly through the air, Drizzt knew he was in trouble. He leaped straight up, felt a claw slash at his foot, the same foot that had been wounded in his fight with Artemis Entreri on the ledge outside Mithril Hall. Down sliced Twinkle, the magnificent blade gashing the front claw, forcing the cat to retreat. Drizzt landed half entwined with the beast, felt the hot breath of its drooling maw about his fore\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;arm and punched out, twisting his wrist so that his weapon\u0027s cross\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;piece prevented the monster from tearing his hand off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, they would only confuse him, and bashed down with Twinkle\u0027s hilt, clubbing the monster\u0027s head. Then he jerked free and ran off. The bony end of a tentacle flew out behind him, caught up to his back, and he threw himself into a headlong roll, absorbing some of the sting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp again, Drizzt ran on in full flight. He came to the wide and shallow alcove and spun in, the monster right behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt reached within himself, into his innate magical abilities,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and brought forth a globe of impenetrable darkness. Twinkle\u0027s light disappeared, as did the monster\u0027s shining eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt circled two steps and came forward, not wanting the beast to escape the darkened area. He felt the swish of a tentacle, a near hit, then sensed it coming back again the other way The drow smiled in satisfaction as his scimitar slashed out to meet it, cutting right through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast\u0027s pained roar guided Drizzt back in. He couldn\u0027t get caught in too tight, he knew, but, with his scimitars, he had an advantage of reach. With Twinkle up to fend against the remaining tentacle, he jabbed the other blade repeatedly, scoring a few minor hits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enraged cat leaped, but Drizzt sensed it and fell flat to the floor, rolling to his back and thrusting both his blades straight up,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;scoring a serious double hit on the monster\u0027s belly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cat came down hard, skidding heavily into the wall, and,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;before it could recover, Drizzt was upon it. A scimitar bashed against its skull, creasing its head. The cat whipped about and sprang forward, paws extended, maw opened wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwinkle was waiting. The scimitar\u0027s tip caught the beast on the chin and slid down under the maw to dig at its rushing neck. A paw batted the blade, nearly tearing it free from the drow\u0027s extended hand, but Drizzt knew that he had to hang on, for all his life. There came a savage flurry, but the drow, backpedaling, managed to keep the beast at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the darkness the two came, the beast pressing on. Drizzt closed his eyes. He sensed that the remaining tentacle would snap at him, and he reversed direction, suddenly throwing all his weight behind Twinkle. The tentacle wrapped his back; he got his opposite elbow up just in time to prevent its end from coming right around and slamming his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwinkle was in the monster halfway to the hilt. A wheezing and gurgling sound came from the beast\u0027s throat, but heavy paws bat\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tered at Drizzt\u0027s sides, shredding pieces of his cloak and scratching the fine mithril armor. The cat tried to turn its impaled neck to the side to bite Drizzt\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt free hand went to work, furiously pumping up and down, bashing his scimitar repeatedly against the cat\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the claws grasp and hold him, biting maw just an inch from his belly One claw slipped through a chain link in the metal coat, slightly puncturing the drow\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scimitar bashed again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown they tumbled in a heap. Drizzt, on his side and staring into wicked eyes, thought he was doomed and tried to squirm free. But the cat\u0027s grip loosened, and Drizzt realized that the beast was dead. He finally wriggled from the hold and looked down at the slain creature, its green eyes shining even in death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ye go in there, \" one of the two guards outside Bruenor\u0027s throne room said to Regis as he boldly approached the door. The halfling considered them carefully, he never remembered seeing a dwarf so pale!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door banged open, and a contingent of dwarves, fully armed and armored, burst out, falling all over each other as they ran off down the stone corridor. Behind them came a verbal tirade, a stream of curses from their king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the guards started to close the door, but Regis hopped up and pushed his way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor paced about his throne, punching the great chair when\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ever he passed close enough. General Dagna, Mithril Hall\u0027s military leader, sat in his appointed chair, looking rather glum, and Thibble\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dorf Pwent hopped about gleefully in Bruenor \u0027s shadow, cautiously dodging aside whenever Bruenor spun about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid priests!\" Bruenor growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With Cobble dead, there are none powerful enough, \" Dagna tried to intervene, but Bruenor wasn\u0027t listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid priests!\" the dwarf king said more forcefully\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah!\" Pwent readily agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me king, ye\u0027ve set two patrols off to Silverymoon, and another north o\u0027 the city, \" Dagna tried to reason. \"And ye\u0027ve got half me sol\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;diers walking the tunnels below.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll be sending the other half if them that\u0027s there don\u0027t show me the way!\" Bruenor roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis, still standing unnoticed by the door, was beginning to catch on, and he wasn\u0027t displeased by what he was seeing. Brue\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;nor, and it seemed like the old Bruenor once more!, was moving heaven and earth to find Drizzt and Catti-brie. The old dwarf had stoked his inner fires!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there are a thousand separate tunnels down there, \" Dagna argued. \"And some may take a week to explore before we learn that they\u0027re dead ends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then send down a thousand dwarves!\" Bruenor growled at him. He stalked past the chair again, then skidded to a stop, and Pwent bounced into his back, as he regarded the halfling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re ye looking at?\" Bruenor demanded when he noticed Regis\u0027s wide eyed stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis would have liked to say, \"At my oldest friend, \" but he merely shrugged instead. For an instant, he caught a flash of anger in the dwarf\u0027s one blue gray eye, and he thought that Bruenor was leaning toward him, perhaps fighting an inner urge to rush over and throttle him. But the dwarf calmed and slid into his throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis cautiously approached, studying Bruenor and taking little heed of pragmatic Dagna\u0027s claims that there was no way to catch up with the two wayfaring friends. Regis heard enough to figure that Dagna wasn\u0027t too worried for Drizzt and Catti-brie, and that didn\u0027t surprise him much, since the crusty dwarf wasn\u0027t overly fond of anyone who wasn\u0027t a dwarf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we had the damned cat, \" Bruenor began, and again came that flash of anger as he regarded the halfling. Regis put his hands behind his back and bowed his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or me damned locket!\" Bruenor roared. \"Where in the Nine Hells did I put me damned locket?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis winced at every roaring outburst, but Bruenor \u0027s anger did not change his feelings that he had done the right thing in assisting Catti-brie, and in sending Guenhwyvar along with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, though he half expected Bruenor to punch him in the face at any moment, it did not change the halfling\u0027s feelings that he was glad to see Bruenor full of life again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/starless-night-legacy-of-the-drow-2/page-9.html","bookId":2128,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:02 PM"}
