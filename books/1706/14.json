Is that still going ahead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely,\" Morton said. \"I wouldn\u0027t miss it for the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got in the car, and Harry closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good day, sir,\" Harry said to Evans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the car drove off into the morning sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called from his car: \"Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t tell me.

These included two rock stars, the wife of a comedian, an actor who played the president on a television series, a writer who had recently run for governor, and two environmental lawyers from other firms. Over white wine and smoked salmon canap–πs, the discussion became quite lively, focusing on what the United States, as the world\u0027s leading economy, should be doing to promote environmental sanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncharacteristically, Morton did not join in. Instead, he slumped in the back of the plane, looking irritable and gloomy. Evans sat beside him, keeping him company. Morton was drinking straight vodka. He was already on his second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought the papers cancelling your grant,\" Evans said, taking them out of his briefcase. \"If you still want to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\" Morton scribbled his signature, hardly looking at the documents. He said, \"Keep those safe until tomorrow.\" He looked back at his guests, who were now trading statistics on species loss as the rain forests of the world were cut down. Off to one side, Ted Bradley, the actor who played the president, was talking about how he preferred his electric carwhich, he pointed out, he had owned for many years nowto the new hybrids that were so popular. \"There\u0027s no comparison,\" he was saying. \"The hybrids are nice, but they\u0027re not the real thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the center table, Ann Garner, who sat on the boards of environmental organizations, was arguing that Los Angeles needed to build more public transportation so that people could get out of their cars. Americans, she said, belched out more carbon dioxide than any other people on the planet, and it was disgraceful. Ann was the beautiful wife of a famous attorney, and always intense, especially on environmental issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorton sighed. He turned to Evans. \"Do you know how much pollution we\u0027re creating right this minute? We\u0027ll burn four hundred fifty gallons of aviation fuel to take twelve people to San Francisco. Just by making this trip, they\u0027re generating more pollution per capita than most people on the planet will generate in a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished his vodka, and rattled the ice in the glass irritably. He handed the glass to Evans, who dutifully signaled for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there\u0027s anything worse than a limousine liberal,\" Morton said, \"it\u0027s a Gulfstream environmentalist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But George,\" Evans said. \"You\u0027re a Gulfstream environmentalist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it,\" Morton said. \"And I wish it bothered me more. But you know what? It doesn\u0027t. I like flying around in my own airplane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans said, \"I heard you were in North Dakota and Chicago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d you do there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I spent money. A lot of money. A lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans said, \"You bought some art?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I bought something far more expensive than art. I bought integrity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve always had integrity,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, not my integrity,\" Morton said. \"I bought somebody else\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans didn\u0027t know what to say to that. For a minute he thought Morton was joking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to tell you about it,\" Morton continued. \"I got a list of numbers, kid, and I want you to get it to Kenner. It is very muchfor later. Hello, Ann!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn Garner was coming toward them. \"So, George, are you back for a while? Because we need you here now. The Vanutu lawsuit, which thank God you are backing, and the climate change conference that Nick has scheduled, and it\u0027s so importantmy God, George. This is crunch time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans started to stand to let Ann take his seat, but Morton pushed him back down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ann,\" he said, \"I must say you look more lovely than ever, but Peter and I are having a small business discussion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the papers, and Evans\u0027s open briefcase. \"Oh. I didn\u0027t know I was interrupting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, if you\u0027d just give us a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I\u0027m sorry.\" But she lingered. \"This is so unlike you, George, doing business on the plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Morton said, \"but, if you must know, I am feeling quite unlike myself these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made her blink. She didn\u0027t know how to take it, so she smiled, nodded, and moved away. Morton said, \"She looks wonderful. I wonder who did her work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s had more, in the last few months. I think eyes. Maybe chin. Anyway,\" he said, waving his hand, \"about the list of numbers. You are to tell this to no one, Peter. No one. Not anyone in the law firm. And especially not anyone at\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"George, damn it, why are you hiding back there?\" Evans looked over his shoulder and saw Ted Bradley coming toward them. Ted was already drinking heavily, though it was only noon. \"It hasn\u0027t been the same without you, George. My God, the world without Bradley is a boring world. Oops! I mean, without George Morton, is a boring world. Come on, George. Get up out of there. That man is a lawyer. Come and have a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorton allowed himself to be led away. He glanced over his shoulder at Evans. \"Later,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSAN FRANCISCO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMONDAY, OCTOBER 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:02 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grand Ballroom of the Mark Hopkins Hotel was darkened for the after-dinner speeches. The audience was elegant, the men in tuxedos, the women in ball gowns. Beneath the ornate chandeliers, the voice of Nicholas Drake boomed from the podium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies and gentlemen, it is no exaggeration to say that we face an environmental crisis of unprecedented proportions. Our forests are disappearing. Our lakes and rivers are polluted. The plants and animals that make up our biosphere are vanishing at unprecedented rates. Forty thousand species become extinct every year. That\u0027s fifty species every single day. At present rates, we will lose half of all species on our planet in the next few decades. It is the greatest extinction in the history of earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what is the texture of our own lives? Our food is contaminated with lethal pesticides. Our crops are failing from global warming. Our weather is growing worse, and more severe. Flooding, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes. All around the globe. Our sea levels are risingtwenty-five feet in the next century, and possibly more. And most fearsome of all, new scientific evidence points to the specter of abrupt climate change, as a result of our destructive behavior. In short, ladies and gentlemen, we are confronted by a genuine global catastrophe for our planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting at the center table, Peter Evans looked around at the audience. They were staring down at their plates, yawning, leaning over and talking to one another. Drake wasn\u0027t getting a lot of attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve heard it before,\" Morton growled. He shifted his heavy frame and gave a soft belch. He had been drinking steadily through the evening, and was now quite drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" amp;Loss of biodiversity, shrinking of habitat, destruction of the ozone layer amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas Drake appeared tall and ungainly, his tuxedo ill-fitting. The collar of his shirt was bunched up around his scrawny neck. As always, he gave the impression of an impoverished but dedicated academic, a latter-day Ichabod Crane. Evans thought no one would ever guess that Drake was paid a third of a million dollars a year to head the Fund, plus another hundred thousand in expenses. Or that he had no science background at all. Nick Drake was a trial attorney, one of five who had started NERF many years before. And like all trial attorneys, he knew the importance of not dressing too well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" amp;the erosion of bio-reservoirs, the rise of ever more exotic and lethal diseases amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish he\u0027d hurry up,\" Morton said. He drummed his fingers on the table. Evans said nothing. He had attended enough of these functions to know that Morton was always tense if he had to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the podium, Drake was saying \" amp;glimmers of hope, faint rays of positive energy, and none more positive and hopeful than the man whose lifelong dedication we are here to honor tonight amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get another drink?\" Morton said, finishing the last of his martini. It was his sixth. He set the glass on the table with a thud. Evans turned to look for the waiter, raising his hand. He was hoping the waiter wouldn\u0027t come over in time. George had had enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" amp;for three decades has dedicated his considerable resources and energy to making our world a better, healthier, saner place. Ladies and gentlemen, the National Environmental Resource Fund is proud amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah screw, never mind,\" Morton said. He tensed his body, ready to push back from the table. \"I hate making a fool of myself, even for a good cause.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should you make a fool of\" Evans began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" amp;my good friend and colleague and this year\u0027s concerned citizen amp;Mr. George Morton!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room filled with applause, and a spotlight hit Morton as he stood and headed toward the podium, a hunched bear of a man, physically powerful, solemn, head down. Evans was alarmed when Morton stumbled on the first step, and for a moment he feared his boss would fall backward, but Morton regained his balance, and as he stepped to the stage he seemed all right. He shook hands with Drake and moved to the podium, gripping it on both sides with his large hands. Morton looked out at the room, turning his head from side to side, surveying the audience. He did not speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just stood there, and said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn Garner, sitting beside Evans, gave him a nudge. \"Is he all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes. Absolutely,\" Evans said, nodding. But in truth, he wasn\u0027t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally George Morton began to speak. \"I\u0027d like to thank Nicholas Drake and the National Environmental Resource Fund for this award, but I don\u0027t feel I deserve it. Not with all the work that remains to be done. Do you know, my friends, that we know more about the moon than we do about the Earth\u0027s oceans? That\u0027s a real environmental problem. We don\u0027t know enough about the planet we depend on for our very lives. But as Montaigne said three hundred years ago, Nothing is so firmly believed as that which is least known.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans thought: Montaigne? George Morton quoting Montaigne?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the glare of the spotlight, Morton was distinctly weaving back and forth. He was gripping the podium for balance. The room was absolutely silent. People were not moving at all. Even the waiters had stopped moving between the tables. Evans held his breath. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-14.html","bookId":1706,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM"}
