I have come to realize that many Romans are not so well-treated here in this city, and often for excellent reason. That you have been willing to speak with me, to invite me into this house fills me with gratitude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My husband has said that you have donated your villa to his use while he and his men are in Roma, and that merits my hospitality.\" She nodded toward the ikonostasis on the far side of the room. \"We know the obligations of our faith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belisarius spoke glowingly of you, august lady,\" said Olivia, sensing a faint anxiety in Antonina. \"He and his officers were always most respectful in what they said of you while they were at my villa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugenia\u0027s smile was sharpened with malice. \"Now the officers speak of you, Antonina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only because I asked them,\" said Olivia, realizing her blunder almost as soon as it was spoken. \"I know so little about this city and its ways, I wanted to learn how best to comport myself, and I thought that you were likely to be the best example I could have. Your husband was so proud of all you\u0027ve done, and so sincere in his praises, I asked questions and had answers that truly amazed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was not correct to ask such questions,\" said Antonina, but her condemnation was modified by the tone of her voice. \"In Byzantium we women are not eager to have our names and reputations bandied about. In Roma it might be otherwise, but here we all assume that it is not proper for a Christian woman to seek after notoriety or approbation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a man placed as General Belisarius is often is seen in the guise of his wife when he is not here to be evaluated,\" added Eugenia. \"As some husbands are judged by their widows\u0027 conduct after the husbands are dead.\" She did not smirk, but it was more of an effort not to than it appeared to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I can see why Belisarius reposes such great trust in you, Antonina.\" It was blatant flattery, but Olivia spoke with such skill—and Antonina was so eager to hear such praises—that if Antonina was aware of the intent, she was willing to ignore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Eugenia did not leave the issue unanswered. \"It is only right for a man of Belisarius\u0027 position to rely on the good offices of his wife, and for him to know and acknowledge all that she does for him. A husband who must depend on his wife to put forth his position cannot be indifferent to her activities.\" From the tone of her voice, Olivia suspected that just such lapses had occurred with her and her late husband, who was the bastard of Elezaros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the helpmeet of Belisarius and his devoted servant,\" said Antonina in her most forceful accents. Then she regarded Olivia again. \"You say he was well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well but tired,\" Olivia reassured her. \"The campaign was hard, and the worst had not yet begun. He had been trying to find enough men to stop the raids that Totila\u0027s men had been making all around the city. It was wearing down the resistance of the peasants and farmers. Many of them wished to leave, and one of the tasks that Belisarius had set his men was convincing the farmers, as he tried to convince the citizens of Roma, not to leave, no matter how desperate their plight might seem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tired. Not ill?\" Her concern was without artifice; whatever else Antonina might be, she was truly concerned for the safety and welfare of her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not while I was there, august lady. He complained of headaches from time to time, but nothing more than that. One of his officers had dislocated his shoulder and was carrying his arm in a sling while the ligaments mended, but that was the worst injury I saw, and if there was illness among them, I was not aware of it.\" Olivia saw the worry fade from Antonina\u0027s jet-black eyes. \"Believe me, your husband is not in danger, at least he was not when I last saw him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May God watch over him and give him protection and guidance,\" said Antonina, her imperious manner returning. \"I would like to know what plans he revealed, if any, for his homecoming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said nothing about it while I was with him. I do not think he has made plans that are not in accord with the orders of the Emperor.\" This time Olivia sought to find a diplomatic way to deliver what she knew would be a disappointing message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the great honor of my husband to be high in the esteem of the Emperor and to be given the privilege of carrying out his orders.\" Antonina could not entirely disguise the sigh that accompanied this patriotic sentiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a discreet tap at the door and Arius opened it to admit three slaves bearing cups and plates. \"As you have ordered, august lady,\" he said with a reverence to Antonina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good. Present the sweetmeats.\" She signaled the slaves with a wave of her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia had experienced many awkward moments of this nature and she used her abilities with the ease of long habit. \"Oh, I am most upset; I did not realize there would be refreshments offered, and…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" asked Eugenia when Olivia did not go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have the misfortune to suffer from an antipathy to many fruits and some spices. They do not agree with me at all, and if I should eat them, I become horridly sick. I hope you will pardon me for refusing your gracious hospitality, but I am certain that I would prove to be a most reprehensible guest if I let myself succumb to your kindness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An antipathy?\" repeated Antonina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Doubtless you know others who have similar conditions; I recall that one of Belisarius\u0027 officers becomes short of breath and flushed if he eats shellfish.\" She was hoping that Belisarius had taken the time to outline the failings as well as the virtues of his men to his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be Gregorios, I assume,\" said Antonina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one who you introduced to me last year?\" inquired Eugenia. \"With the dark curly hair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that is Drosos,\" said Antonina with a knowing inclination of her head. She was watching her friend and so she did not see the faint smile that flickered over Olivia\u0027s face. \"Yes, Gregorios has such an antipathy, I am certain of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whichever man it was,\" said Olivia, \"I felt for him most sincerely, for I know of my own experience how unendurable such episodes can be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slaves who had waited as still as monuments now moved at a signal from Antonina and placed their offerings on the low table beside their mistress\u0027 couch. They then made deep reverences and left, Arius in their wake like a whale following fishing vessels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take what pleases you, and if you feel it best, touch nothing,\" said Antonina, making it clear that her remarks were intended for both women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am hungry, and fortunately I have no antipathies that might interfere with my pleasures,\" said Eugenia, managing to infuse a world of meaning into her statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you may thank God for His kindness,\" Antonina said as she reached for one of the wine cups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I do,\" said Eugenia, full of mischief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia leaned back on the couch and wished that this stilted, unendurable, endless afternoon would be over before either of the others had finished her wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have said,\" Antonina said, addressing Olivia once she had tasted some of the food set out, \"that you are not interested in finding a husband, and if that is the case, I do not know what more I will be able to do for you. My area of influence is limited, as it must be for all women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing that Antonina was a close friend of the Empress Theodora, Olivia decided that this last assertion could be interpreted very loosely. \"Your civility in my welcome is more than enough. If, from time to time, you are willing to permit me to call upon you and to invite you to my house—once it is fit to be lived in—then I will think myself favored beyond my deserts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonina nodded, but said, \"Should you eventually change your mind, you must tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" said Olivia, retreating into silence while the other two women nibbled at sweetmeats and speculated on the success of the most illustrious chariot team in the Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eText of a letter front Belisarius to the Emperor Justinian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the most august and favored ruler, the elevated and esteemed Emperor Justinian, his most devoted General Belisarius cries \"hail\" on this Feast of Saint Servius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it is not my place to offer any criticism to you, most magnificent and knowledgeable of Emperors, I am constrained to inform you that those entrusted with carrying out your orders would appear to have been lax in their execution, for although two months have passed since our last request for additional troops, money, and supplies, little more than two or three measures of gold have been sent. Of troops and supplies we have seen nothing. I pray that this indicates that your activities are such that they require more time in order to make adequate preparation. Send me word of how many men I am to expect, and with what provisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not a request intended to impose upon your goodwill or upon your other obligations; you have entrusted me with the task of saving Roma from the forces of Totila, and it is my intention to do so, but without the aid I have already indicated, the loss of men and equipment currently available would place our risks much higher than you have indicated before was acceptable to you and to the Empire. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-8.html","bookId":2509,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:25 PM"}
