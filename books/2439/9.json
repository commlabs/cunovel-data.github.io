Their names were Jesse and Donna - they wouldn\u0027t let me call them Mr. and Mrs. Hemlock - and they made me feel welcome as soon as I walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello!\" Jesse said, seeing me first as we entered the living room. \"Who\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, Dad, this is Darren,\" Debbie said. \"He\u0027s a friend of Anne\u0027s. I ran into him at the movies and invited him back. Is that okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Jesse said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Donna agreed. \"We were about to have supper. Would you like some, Darren?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s no trouble,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No trouble at all,\" she beamed. \"Do you like meatloaf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my favorite,\" I told her. It wasn\u0027t really, but I guessed it would pay to be polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Jesse and Donna a little about myself as we ate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about school?\" Jesse asked, like Debbie had before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad used to be a teacher,\" I lied, having given some thought to the matter since yesterday. \"He teaches Evra and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More meatloaf, Darren?\" Donna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, please,\" I said. \"It\u0027s great.\" It was, too. Much better than any meatloaf I\u0027d had before. \"What\u0027s in it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few extra spices,\" Donna said, smiling proudly. \"I used to be a chef.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish they had someone like you in the hotel.\" I sighed. \"Their food isn\u0027t very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offered to wash the dishes when we were finished, but Jesse said he\u0027d do them. \"It\u0027s my way of unwinding at the end of a hard day,\" he explained. \"Nothing I like better than scrubbing a few dirty dishes, polishing the banister and vacuuming the carpets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he kidding?\" I asked Debbie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, no,\" she said. \"Okay if we go up to my room?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead,\" Donna told her. \"But don\u0027t chat for too long. We\u0027ve got a couple of chapters of The Three Musketeers to finish, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie made a face. \"All for one and one for all,\" she groaned. \"How exciting - I don\u0027t think!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t likeThe Three Musketeers?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I\u0027ve seen the movie at least eight times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But did you ever read the book?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I read a comic book about them once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie shared a scornful glance with her mother, and the two burst out laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to read a little of a so-called classic every night,\" Debbie grumbled. \"I hope you never learn just how boring those books can be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be down soon,\" she told her mother, then showed me the way upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer room was on the third floor. A big, pretty-empty room, with large closets and hardly any posters or decorations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like feeling cluttered,\" Debbie explained when she saw me looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a bare artificial Christmas tree in one corner of the room. There had been one in the living room, too, and I noticed a couple more in other rooms on my way up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why all the trees?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad\u0027s idea,\" Debbie said. \"He loves Christmas trees, so we get one for every room in the house. The ornaments are in little boxes underneath\" - she pointed to a box under the tree - \"and we open them on Christmas Eve and decorate the trees. It\u0027s a nice way to pass the night, and it tires you out, so you fall asleep almost as soon as your head hits the pillows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds like fun,\" I agreed wistfully, remembering what it had been like to decorate the Christmas tree at home with my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie studied me silently. \"You could come over on Christmas Eve,\" she said. \"You and Evra. Your dad, too. You could help us with the trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her. \"You mean that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I\u0027d have to check with Mom and Dad first, but I doubt if they\u0027d mind. We\u0027ve had friends over to help before. It\u0027s nicer with more people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was happy that she\u0027d asked me, but I hesitated before accepting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I ask them?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ll still be here at Christmas. Mr. Cre - Dad is unpredictable. He goes wherever the job takes him, whenever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the offer\u0027s there,\" she said. \"If you\u0027re here, great. If not,\" - she shrugged - \"we\u0027ll manage by ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got talking about Christmas presents. \"Are you going to get the CD player for Evra?\" Debbie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. And a few CDs, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That just leaves your dad,\" she said. \"What are you getting him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Mr. Crepsley and what he might like. I wasn\u0027t going to buy him anything - he\u0027d only turn up his nose at presents - but it was interesting to consider what I could buy him. What was there that a vampire could possibly be interested in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to smile. \"I know,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll get him a sun lamp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sun lamp?\" Debbie frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he can work up a tan.\" I began to laugh. \"He\u0027s pretty pale. He doesn\u0027t get much sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie couldn\u0027t understand why I was laughing so hard. I would have liked to let her in on the joke - it would be worth buying the sun lamp just to see the disgusted expression on the vampire\u0027s face - but didn\u0027t dare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a weird sense of humor,\" she muttered, bewildered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me,\" I said, \"if you knew my dad, you\u0027d know why I was laughing.\" I was going to tell Evra about my idea when I got home: he\u0027d be able to appreciate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe chatted for another hour or so. Then it was time for me to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Debbie said, as I stood up. \"Don\u0027t I get a good-night kiss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I was going to collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... um... I mean... that is...\" I became a stuttering wreck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you want to kiss me?\" Debbie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" I gasped quickly. \"It\u0027s just... I... um...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, forget it,\" Debbie said, shrugging. \"I don\u0027t care one way or the other.\" She got up. \"I\u0027ll show you out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked quickly down the stairs. I wanted to say goodbye to Jesse and Donna, but Debbie didn\u0027t give me the chance. She went straight to the front door and opened it. I was still trying to get back into my coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I come over tomorrow?\" I asked, struggling to find the left arm of the coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, if you want to,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Debbie,\" I said, \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t kiss you. I\u0027m just -?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scared?\" she asked, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Okay,\" she said. \"You can come over tomorrow. I want you to. Only, next time be a little braver, okay?\" And she closed the door behind me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-9.html","bookId":2439,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:06 PM"}
