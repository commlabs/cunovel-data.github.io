I can sense it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027re supposed to connect the dots,\" Kowalski said with no less sarcasm. \"Maybe it\u0027ll form a big flashing arrow spelling out go the fuck here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiechan frowned. \"And maybe it\u0027s time for you to shut the hell up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray did not need their bickering. Not now. Kowalski was fine as a getaway driver, good in a firefight, but Gray needed sage advice, not kindergarten suggestions, like connect the dots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God!\" Gray sat up, fumbled his pencil, and grasped it more firmly. \"Kowalski is right!\" I am?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is . .. ?\" Seichan responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray turned to Vigor, clutching his forearm. \"The first clue! In the Tower of Winds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor frowned—then his eyes widened. \"Which holds the Vatican\u0027s astronomical observatory. . . where Galileo proved the earth moved around the sun!\" Vigor tapped the sheet. \"These are stars!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray took his pencil. He had been staring hard at the sheet and recognized a familiar pattern. \"This is a constellation.\" He drew it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor recognized it, too. \"That\u0027s the constellation for Draco, the dragon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan cocked her head as she stared down. \"Are you saying it\u0027s a navigational star map?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks that way.\" Gray scratched his head with his pencil\u0027s eraser. \"But how does one constellation tell us where to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can\u0027t,\" he finally conceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray\u0027s heart pounded in his throat. They were running out of time. Had he just taken them down the wrong path?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor sat back. \"Wait,\" he mumbled. \"Remember Marco\u0027s story. The last stanza. Marco said he drew a map of the city, not a map to the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" Gray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor took the paper, spun it around. \"This can\u0027t be stars. It has to be the layout of the City of the Dead. That\u0027s what Marco\u0027s text stated. Possibly the Vatican made the same mistake we just did. They misinterpreted Marco\u0027s map in the same manner. They also thought it was navigational star map.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray shook his head. \"That\u0027s a rather strange coincidence that a city should be laid out in the exact pattern of the Draco constellation. If I\u0027m not mistaken, even the stars outside the dragon line mark the placement of real stars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor nodded. \"But remember, from my study of ancient civilizations . . . from the Egyptians through Mesoamerica, many civilizations built their monuments and cities patterned after the stars, made to mimic them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray remembered a similar lesson. \"Like the three Egyptian pyramids are supposed to represent the stars of Orion\u0027s belt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly! Somewhere in Southeast Asia is a city patterned after the Draco constellation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan suddenly swung around. \"Choi mai!\" she swore under her breath. \"1 remember something . . . something I heard about. . . some ruins in Cambodia. My family has roots in the region. Vietnam and Cambodia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan rushed to her pack, pawed through it, and pulled out her laptop. \"There\u0027s an encyclopedia program on here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan squatted down between the knees of Vigor and Gray. She called up the program and typed rapidly. She double-clicked on an icon and a digital map filled the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the temple complex of Angkor, built by the Khmer people of Cambodia in the ninth century.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Notice the layout of the temples,\" Seichan said, \"where each one lies. 1 had heard stories of how these ruins were supposedly laid out in a starlike grid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his finger Gray drew a line connecting the temples in a pattern and tapped the remaining temples. He held up the first star map and placed it next to the open laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re an exact match,\" Vigor said, awed. \"Marco\u0027s City of the Dead. It\u0027s the ancient city of Angkor Wat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray leaned down and hugged Seichan\u0027s shoulders. She tensed, but didn\u0027t pull away. Gray owed everyone a debt of gratitude, even Kowalski, whose simplistic overview had broken the way to the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray checked his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a minute to spare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out his hand toward Vigor. \"Your phone. It\u0027s time to make a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor passed him the cell phone and battery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray snapped the battery in place, praying for some measure of good fortune. He dialed Nasser\u0027s number, supplied by Seichan. Vigor reached over and gripped Gray\u0027s hand, offering support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang once and was picked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander Pierce,\" a cold and furious voice answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray took a steadying breath, struggling not to lash out. He needed to be deliberate and firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My plane is about to land,\" Nasser continued, not even waiting for acknowledgment. \"For your treachery, 1 will allow you to decide which of your parents will die first, your mother or your father. I will make you listen to their screams. And that parent, I promise, will be the luckier of the two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the threat Gray took some solace. If Nasser wasn\u0027t lying, both of his parents were still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking comfort in that, Gray kept his voice even, his jaw muscles aching with the restraint. \"I will offer you a trade for their lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is nothing you can offer,\" Nasser barked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if 1 told you that I\u0027d solved the obelisk\u0027s angelic code?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead air answered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray continued, \"Nasser, I know where Marco\u0027s City of the Dead lies.\" Fearing even this might not be enough to sway the bastard, Gray spoke the next words slowly, so there was no misunderstanding. \"And I know how to cure the Judas Strain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor turned to him, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence continued on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray waited. He stared at the digital map of Angkor Wat on the laptop. He sensed that the two arms of the Guild operation—the one following the scientific trail, the other following the historical—were about to slam together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut who would be crushed between them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser finally answered, his voice a trembling rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13 Witch Queen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 7, Midnight Island of Pusat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drums pounded louder than the rumbles of thunder overhead. Lightning spattered, flashing the jungle into stark greens and blacks, limned in silver by the reflection off the wet leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBare-chested, Monk pulled Susan by the hand up a steep turn in the jungle path. They\u0027d been following the trail for the past two hours in the dark, sometimes waiting for lightning to show them where to step next. Rain continued to pour through the canopy. The switchbacked trail had become a running stream. But the remainder of the jungle was a dense tangle of grappling vines, heavy leaves, thorny bushes, root-choked trunks, and sopping mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they kept to the trail, heading up, always up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder climbed behind them. He had their group\u0027s one pistol. A 9mm Sig Sauer P228 with a Teflon finish. Unfortunately he had no spare magazines. Only the thirteen rounds already in the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk knew that once the storm broke, the jungle would be scoured by Rakao\u0027s men. This island was their base of operation, giving them the home-field advantage. Monk did not delude himself into thinking he could escape being tracked and captured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced back through a break in the jungle. They were about three hundred feet up. The giant cruise ship sat in the center of the lake, a quarter mile out. Somewhere on board was his partner, pulled alive from the black waters, out of the grip of some nasty calamari.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut was she still alive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil he knew for sure, Monk would not give up hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot for Lisa, not for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo that end, Monk needed allies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrums continued their perpetual beating, louder and more urgent, as if striving to drive the typhoon away. They had climbed high enough that each pound of leather drum now reverberated against his rib cage, down to the bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk pushed through a drape of branches, waterlogged and drooping low. He spotted a glow ahead, flickering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took another two steps and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly now did he realize they weren\u0027t alone. To either side of the path, sentinels stood, half hidden by the dense foliage, but plainly in the open, wanting to be noted. Men stood, bare-chested, wearing wide grass hats tied to their heads. Their faces had been painted with oil and ash, turning their countenances pitch-black. Polished white boar tusks and yellowed rib bones pierced noses. Brilliant feathers and snail shells were threaded around upper arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shout, Ryder lunged forward, his pistol raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sentinels were unimpressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk shoved down Ryder\u0027s arm and stepped forward, holding up his hands, palms forward. \"Don\u0027t spook the natives,\" he whispered to Ryder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne tribesman shifted onto the trail. He wore a breastplate of bone braided together by leather. His waist was circled by a kilt of long feathers. His legs and feet were bare, painted with grease and ash, too. He carried a sharpened shoulder blade of some animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least Monk hoped it was an animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk heard a rustle behind him, knowing their back trail was already being closed off. Drums pounded ahead. The firelight spat momentarily brighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man on the path turned and led the way toward the glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like we\u0027re invited to the party,\" Monk said, putting his arm around Susan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder followed, pistol in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf things went awry, they might need the billionaire\u0027s remaining thirteen rounds to blast their way to freedom. But for now, Monk knew their best bet was to cooperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe path ended at a cliff face in the volcanic rock. A natural coved amphitheater had been carved out of the reddish-black rock, roofed over with thick palm thatching. The downpour drained in a sheet of rain off the roof\u0027s front edge, creating a watery curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the flow, lit by a massive bonfire within, Monk spotted lines of drummers along both walls, working hard, pounding away. Two massive drums, as wide as his outstretched arms, hung from the rock walls and were struck with bone hammers. Each stroke shook the thin waterfall that cascaded from the thatched roof to the rock floor. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-53.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
