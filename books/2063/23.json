The last time I\u0027d done it around Dimitri, his arms had immediately encircled me. This time, all I got was a look of coldness and anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is your fault!\" he yelled, fists clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed backward, eyes wide. \"But he... he attacked me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And Inna. A human! You let a human attack you.\" He couldn\u0027t keep the sneer from his voice. \"You are weak. You are incapable of defending yourself-all because you refuse to be awakened!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was terrifying, and the look he gave me... well, it scared me almost more than Nathan had. Reaching forward, he jerked me up to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you had just been killed, it would have been your own fault,\" he said. His fingers dug into my wrist as he shook me. \"You have the chance for immortality, for incredible strength! And you\u0027re too blind and stubborn to see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed back more tears and rubbed my eyes with the back of my free hand. No doubt I was ruining the makeup I\u0027d so painstakingly put on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart was ready to explode out of my chest, I was so afraid. I expected rage and threats from Nathan-but not Dimitri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve forgotten he\u0027s a Strigoi, something whispered in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d gone long enough without a bite and had enough adrenaline kicking me to alertness that my nagging voice was speaking more loudly than it had in a very long time. Dimitri said I was weak because I wasn\u0027t Strigoi, but there was more to it than that. I was weak and had been subdued by Nathan and Inna because I was an addict, because I was living a life of blissful ignorance that was taking a toll on my body and my mind. The thought was startling, and I could barely hold onto it. My yearning for vampire endorphins flared up, and the two factions warred in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had enough sense not to voice any of those thoughts. I tried for something that would pacify Dimitri instead. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027d be stronger than Nathan, even if I was turn-awakened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran a hand over my hair, his cold voice thoughtful. He seemed to be calming down, but his eyes were still angry and impatient. \"Perhaps not initially, but your strength of body and will carries over with the change. He\u0027s not that much older than either of us-not enough to make a noticeable difference, which is why he keeps backing down when we fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you keep backing down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt his body go rigid, and I realized my question might be read as a slam against his prowess. I swallowed, my fear returning. He hadn\u0027t let go of my wrist, and it was starting to hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he\u0027s right about one thing,\" Dimitri said stiffly. \"Killing him would bring Galina\u0027s wrath down on us. And that\u0027s not something I can afford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said before that you... that we... had to kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and once we do, it\u0027ll be easy to seize control of her assets and organization.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is her organization exactly?\" If I kept distracting him, the anger might go away. The monster might go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"All sorts of things. This wealth isn\u0027t bought without effort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Effort that\u0027s illegal and hurts humans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t bother with an answer. \"But Galina used to be your teacher. Can you really kill her? And I don\u0027t mean physically... I mean, doesn\u0027t it bother you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered. \"I told you before. It\u0027s all about strength and weakness. Prey and predator. If we can bring her down-and I have no doubts we can -then she\u0027s prey. End of story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shivered. It was so harsh, such a stark and scary way of viewing the world. Dimitri released my wrist just then, and a wave of relief ran through me. On shaky legs, I backed up and sat on the couch. For a moment, I feared he\u0027d grab me again, but instead he sat down beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did Inna attack me? Why did she defend Nathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she loves him.\" Dimitri didn\u0027t bother hiding his disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows? Part of it is that he\u0027s promised to awaken her once she\u0027s put in time here.\" Sydney\u0027s warnings came back to me, about why the Alchemists feared that humans would learn about vampires-because humans might want to turn too. \"That\u0027s what most of the human servants are told.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Told?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most are unworthy. Or, more often than not, someone gets hungry and finishes the human off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting sick to my stomach, independent of Dimitri\u0027s proximity. \"This is all a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t have to be.\" I didn\u0027t think he would shake me again, but there was a dangerous glint in his eyes. The monster was only a heartbeat away. \"Time\u0027s running out. I\u0027ve been lenient, Roza. Far more lenient than I would be with anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Why have you done it?\" I wanted-needed-then to hear him say it was because he loved me and that because of that love, he could never force me into anything I didn\u0027t want. I needed to hear it so that I could blot out that terrifying, furious creature I\u0027d seen a few minutes ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I know how you think. And I know awakening you of your own free will would make you a more important ally. You\u0027re independent and strong-minded-that\u0027s what makes you valuable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An ally, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the woman he loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted so that his face hovered over mine. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you once I\u0027d always be there for you? I\u0027m here. I\u0027ll protect you. We\u0027re going to be together. We\u0027re meant to be together. You know this.\" There was more fierceness in his voice than affection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed my lips, drawing me close. The usual heat flooded me, my body instantly responding to his. But even as my body did one thing, other thoughts were spinning through my mind. I had always thought we were meant to be together. And he had once told me he\u0027d always be there for me. I\u0027d always wanted that too-but I had wanted to be there for him in return. I wanted us to be equals, always watching each other\u0027s backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday hadn\u0027t been like that. I\u0027d been defenseless. Weak. Never, never in my life had I been like that. Even in horrible, outmatched moments, I\u0027d put up a decent fight. At the very least, I\u0027d had the will to fight. Not now. I\u0027d been terrified. I\u0027d been ineffectual. I hadn\u0027t been able to do anything except sit there pathetically and wait for someone to rescue me. I\u0027d let a human get the best of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri said me becoming Strigoi was the solution. For the last week, he\u0027d said that over and over, and while I hadn\u0027t agreed to it, I hadn\u0027t been as repulsed as I once had been. Lately, it had become a thought floating around out there, a far-off way for us to be together. And I did want to be together, especially in moments like this, when we kissed and desire crackled around both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this time... the desire wasn\u0027t quite as intense as usual. It was still there, but I couldn\u0027t shake the image of how he\u0027d just been. It occurred to me with startling clarity that I was making out with a Strigoi. And that was... weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing heavy, Dimitri pulled away from my lips for a moment and stared at me. Even with that composed Strigoi expression, I could see that he wanted me-in a lot of ways. It was confusing. He was Dimitri and not Dimitri. Leaning back down, he kissed my cheek, then my chin, and then my neck. His mouth opened wider, and I started to feel the points of his fangs...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe froze. \"What did you say?\" My heart started thumping again, as I braced myself for more rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... no. Not this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled back and looked at me, seeming both shocked and annoyed. When he didn\u0027t respond, I began to ramble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t feel good... I\u0027m hurt. I\u0027m afraid to lose the blood, even though I want...\" Dimitri always said I couldn\u0027t lie to him, but I had to try. I put on my best, most passionate and innocent face. \"I want it... I want to feel the bite... but I want to rest first, get stronger...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me awaken you, and you\u0027ll be strong again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said, still keeping my voice slightly frantic. I looked away, hoping to increase the facade of confusion. Okay, with my life lately, faking confusion wasn\u0027t that hard. \"And I\u0027m starting to think...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a sharp intake of breath. \"Starting to think what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned back to him, hoping I could convince him I was seriously considering turning. \"I\u0027m starting to think that I don\u0027t ever want to be weak again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see it in his face. He believed me. But then, that last part hadn\u0027t been a lie. I didn\u0027t want to be weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please... I just want to rest. I need to think about it a little more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was, the moment this all weighed on. The truth was, I wasn\u0027t just lying to him. I was lying to myself. Because seriously? I wanted that bite. Badly. I\u0027d already gone a long time without one, and my body was screaming for it. I needed the endorphins, needed them more than air or food. And yet, in only one day without them, I\u0027d gained a tiny shard of clarity. The part of me that wanted nothing more than the joy of ignorant ecstasy didn\u0027t care about my mind growing clearer, yet I knew, deep inside, that I had to try for a little bit more, even if it meant depriving myself of what I most wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a lot of thought, Dimitri nodded and stood up. He\u0027d read my words like I\u0027d reached a turning point and was on the verge of accepting. \"Rest, then,\" he said. \"And we\u0027ll talk later. But Rose... we only have two days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until Galina\u0027s deadline. That\u0027s how long she gave us. Then I make the decision for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll awaken me?\" I wasn\u0027t entirely sure if death was on the table anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027ll be better for all of us if we don\u0027t reach that point.\" He got off the bed and stood up. He paused a moment and reached into his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. I brought you this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed me a bracelet encrusted with opals and tiny diamonds, almost like it was no big deal. The bracelet was dazzling, and each opal shone with a thousand colors. \"Wow. It\u0027s... it\u0027s gorgeous.\" I slipped it on my wrist, yet somehow, gifts like this didn\u0027t mean as much anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a satisfied look, he leaned down and kissed me on the forehead. He headed for the door then and left me lying back against the couch, trying desperately to think of anything else except how I wished he would turn around and bite me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the day was agonizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d always read about addicts, about how hard a time people had breaking away from alcohol or illegal drugs. I\u0027d even once witnessed a feeder go kind of crazy when he was removed from service. He\u0027d grown too old, and it was considered hazardous to his health to keep on giving blood to Moroi. I\u0027d watched in amazement as he begged and pleaded to be allowed to stay, how he\u0027d sworn he didn\u0027t mind the risk. Even though I\u0027d known he had an addiction, I just couldn\u0027t understand why it would be so worth it for him to risk his life like that. Now I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn those hours that passed, I would have risked my life to be bitten again. That was actually kind of funny because if I did allow another bite, I would be risking my life. I had no doubt more of that cloudy thinking would lead to an acceptance of Dimitri\u0027s offer. But with each miserable, bite deprived second that passed, my thoughts grew incrementally sharper. Oh, I was still a long way away from being free of the dreamy haze of vampire endorphins. When we\u0027d been captured in Spokane, Eddie had been used as a Strigoi blood source, and it had taken him days to recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach bit of clarity now made me realize how important it was for me to stay bite free. Not that that knowledge made it any easier on my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had some serious problems here. It seemed like either way, I was destined to become a Strigoi. Dimitri wanted to turn me so that we could reign together as the vampiric equivalent of Bonnie and Clyde. Nathan wanted to turn me in the hopes of hunting down Lissa-and then kill me. Clearly, Dimitri\u0027s option was more appealing, but not by much. Not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday, I would have said becoming a Strigoi was something I wasn\u0027t going to worry about too much. Now, the harsh reality of what it truly meant hit me, and my old feelings returned. Suicide versus existence as a creature of evil. Of course, being a creature of evil meant I could be with Dimitri...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept it wasn\u0027t Dimitri. Was it? It was all so confusing. I again tried to remind myself of what he\u0027d said long ago-that no matter how much a Strigoi seemed like the person I used to know, they weren\u0027t. Yet this Dimitri said he\u0027d been wrong about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the endorphins, Rose. They\u0027re like drugs...\" I groaned and buried my face in my hands as I sat on the couch, the TV droning in the background. Lovely. I was talking to myself now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupposing I could break this hold Dimitri had over me and this addled state that kept making me think I\u0027d misunderstood Strigoi... well, then what? I was back to the original dilemma. No weapons to fight Strigoi with. No weapons with which to kill myself. I was back at their mercy, but at least now I was closer to putting up a good fight. Sure, it would be a losing fight, but I felt that if I stayed off the endorphins a little longer, I\u0027d at least be able to take down Inna. That had to count for something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there it was. Off the endorphins. Each time my mind ran through my options and hit a wall, I would spiral back to the physical reality in front of me. I wanted that high back. I wanted that haze of joy back. I needed it back, or surely, I would die. That would be what killed me and freed me from being a Strigoi...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up and began pacing around, hoping to distract myself. TV wasn\u0027t doing it; that was for sure. If I could just hold out a little longer, I could shake the drug from my system, I could figure out how to save myself and Lissa, and Lissa!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any debate, I dove into her. If I was in her body and mind, then maybe I wouldn\u0027t have to deal with mine for a while. My withdrawal would pass more quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa and her group had returned from the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyal Court\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea bit more grimly than they arrived. The cold light of morning had made Lissa feel incredibly idiotic about the party\u0027s events. Dancing on a table wasn\u0027t the worst thing in the world, but looking back over other parties she\u0027d been to that weekend and her social life with Avery made her wonder what had gotten into her. Sometimes, she didn\u0027t even feel like herself. And the kiss with Aaron... well, that was an entirely different guilt-inducing matter altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" Avery told her on the plane. \"We all do stupid stuff when we\u0027re drunk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me,\" groaned Lissa. \"This isn\u0027t like me.\" Despite this claim, Lissa had nonetheless agreed to drink mimosas-champagne mixed with orange juice-on the ride back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery smiled. \"I don\u0027t have anything to compare it to. You seem okay to me. But then, you aren\u0027t trying to run off with a human or some non-royal guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa smiled back, and her eyes went to Jill, sitting a little ahead of them on the plane. Adrian had spoken to the younger girl earlier, but she was busy with a book now, her biggest concern seeming to be to stay away from Reed. He sat with Simon again, and Lissa was a little surprised to see the guardian eyeing Jill suspiciously. Maybe Reed had told Simon that the younger girl was some kind of threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re worried about her?\" asked Avery, following Lissa\u0027s gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that... I just can\u0027t shake the way she looked at me last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s young. I think she\u0027s easily shocked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa supposed that was true. Yet young or not, there had been something refreshingly clear and honest in the way Jill had called Lissa out. It reminded Lissa of something I might do. And Lissa couldn\u0027t rest easy knowing someone like that thought badly of her. Lissa stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right back,\" she told Avery. \"I\u0027m going to talk to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill was obviously astonished when Lissa sat beside her. The younger girl put a bookmark in what she was reading, and whatever she might be feeling, her smile for Lissa was genuine. \"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" said Lissa. She hadn\u0027t had much of the mimosa yet and still controlled enough spirit to see Jill\u0027s aura. It was a rich teal blue, interspersed with purple and darker blue. Good, strong colors. \"Look, I wanted to apologize for what happened last night... what I said...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" said Jill flushing. \"It\u0027s okay, really. I mean, things were kind of crazy, and I know you weren\u0027t thinking straight. At least, I don\u0027t think you were. I don\u0027t really know. I\u0027ve never actually had a drink, so I can\u0027t say.\" Jill\u0027s nervousness always seemed to make her oscillate between rambling and silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, I should have been thinking straight before I got in that situation. And I\u0027m really sorry for what happened with Reed.\" Lissa lowered her voice. \"No clue what happened there... but that wasn\u0027t right, what he did and said to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth girls found themselves studying him. He was deep in a book, but suddenly, as though he could sense them watching, his gaze turned toward Jill and Lissa. He glared, and they immediately looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That definitely wasn\u0027t your fault,\" said Jill. \"And, you know, Adrian was there and everything. So it turned out okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa worked to keep a straight face. Adrian was sitting out of their view, but if he hadn\u0027t been, Lissa had a feeling Jill would have been gazing at him dreamily. Adrian was doing a good deal of gazing of his own at Avery lately, and Lissa could see Jill was never going to leave that little-sister role for him. Yet it seemed clear that Jill was developing a little bit of a crush. It was cute, and even though Lissa knew it was stupid on her part, she couldn\u0027t help feeling a bit of relief that Adrian was the object of Jill\u0027s affections and not Christian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, here\u0027s hoping for better choices,\" said Lissa. \"And hoping no one thinks too badly of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t,\" said Jill. \"And I\u0027m sure Christian won\u0027t either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa frowned, confused for a moment. \"Well... there\u0027s no point in stressing him out over it. It was my stupid mistake; I\u0027ll deal with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Jill frowned. She hesitated before speaking, that old nervousness returning. \"But you have to. You have to tell him the truth, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no big deal,\" said Lissa, surprised at how defensive she suddenly felt. That unpredictable anger started to raise its head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... you guys are in a serious relationship... You have to always be honest, don\u0027t you? I mean, you can\u0027t lie to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa rolled her eyes. \"Jill, you haven\u0027t been in a serious relationship either, have you? Have you even gone on one date? I\u0027m not lying to him. I\u0027m just not telling him stuff that\u0027s going to freak him out for no reason. It\u0027s not the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" argued Jill. I could tell how much it killed her to talk back to Lissa, but I admired her boldness. \"He has a right to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa sighed irritably and stood up. \"Forget it. I thought we could have an adult conversation, but apparently not.\" The withering look she gave Jill made the girl flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, back at the Academy, guilt plagued Lissa. Christian greeted her return happily, showering her with kisses and hugs. She firmly believed Jill had overreacted, yet each time Lissa looked at Christian, she kept thinking about that kiss with Aaron. Was it as wrong as Jill had implied? It had been casual and under the influence of alcohol. Lissa knew telling Christian would upset him, though, and she hated to bring that on. Avery, listening as Lissa deliberated, agreed that there was no need to worry about it. Yet, as I looked at her through Lissa\u0027s eyes, my impression was that Avery was more worried about what Lissa\u0027s emotional reaction would be if she and Christian had a blowout. The morals seemed beside the point; Avery wanted to protect Lissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like it was all going to blow over... until later in the day, when Lissa met up with Christian to walk to dinner. His face was a storm cloud as he approached Lissa in her dorm\u0027s lobby, his pale blue eyes looking like they could shoot lightning bolts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When were you going to tell me?\" he demanded. His voice was loud, and several passing people turned in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa hurried him to a corner, pitching her voice low. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I\u0027m talking about. You using your weekend getaway as a chance to hook up with other guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him for several heavy seconds. Then the truth hit. \"Jill told you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I had to drag it out of her. She showed up to practice with me and was on the verge of tears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncharacteristic anger suddenly burned through Lissa. \"She had no right!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had no right. Do you honestly think you could do something like that-without ever letting me know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christian, it was a stupid drunk kiss, for God\u0027s sake. A joke because he saved me from falling off a table. It meant nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian\u0027s face grew pensive, and Lissa thought for sure he was about to agree with her. \"It would have been nothing,\" he said at last, \"if you\u0027d told me yourself. I shouldn\u0027t have had to hear it from someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jill-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-isn\u0027t the problem. You are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock stunned Lissa for a moment. \"What are you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...\" Christian suddenly looked weary. He rubbed his eyes. \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s just... things have been rough lately. I just... I\u0027m just not sure if I can deal with all this. You were picking fights with me before you left, and now this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why won\u0027t you listen? It was nothing! Even Avery agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" said Christian sarcastically, \"if Avery agreed, then it must be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa\u0027s temper raised its ugly head. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean? I thought you liked her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. But I don\u0027t like how you\u0027re confiding in her more than me lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t have a problem with me confiding in Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avery\u0027s not Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christian...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Look, I don\u0027t really want to go to dinner anymore. I just need to think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When am I going to see you again?\" she asked frantically. Her anger had been supplanted by fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left without another word. Lissa stared after him, aghast as he walked out of the lobby. She wanted to go throw herself at him, beg him to come back and forgive her. There were too many people around, however, and she refused to make a scene-or intrude on his space. Instead, she took off to the only resource she had left: Avery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t expect to see you again,\" Avery said, opening the door to her room. \"What are you-Jesus Christ. What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ushered Lissa in and demanded the story. With a lot of tears and near-hysteric rambling, Lissa related what had happened with Christian. \"And I don\u0027t know what he meant. Does he want to break up? Will he come talk to me later? Should I go to him?\" Lissa buried her face in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh God. You don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything going on with him and Jill, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jailbait? No,\" exclaimed Avery. \"Of course not. Look, you need to calm down. You\u0027re freaking me out. This is going to be okay.\" Anxiety lined Avery\u0027s face, and she went to get Lissa a glass of water. Then, reconsidering, she poured a glass of wine instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting alone, Lissa felt her wild emotions torment her. She hated what she\u0027d done. She felt like there was something wrong with her. First she\u0027d alienated me, and now Christian. Why couldn\u0027t she keep her friends? What did it take? Was she really going crazy? She felt out of control and desperate. And she Bam!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, and without warning, I was shoved out of Lissa\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thoughts disappeared completely. I\u0027d neither left of my own choice, nor had I been snapped back because of something in my own body. I stood in the room alone, having come to a standstill while pacing and thinking. Never, never had anything like that happened to me. This had been like... well, like a physical force. Like a glass wall or force field slamming down in front of me and pushing me back. It had been an outside power. It hadn\u0027t come from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what was it? Had it been Lissa? To my knowledge, she\u0027d never been able to feel me in her head. Had that changed? Had she kicked me out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad her spinning feelings grown so strong that there was no room for me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know, and I didn\u0027t like any of it. When it had happened, aside from the sensation of being pushed, I\u0027d experienced another strange feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like a fluttering, as if someone had reached in and tickled my mind. I\u0027d had brief warm and cold flashes, and then it had all stopped once I was out of her head. It had felt invasive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it had also felt... familiar. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4/page-23.html","bookId":2063,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:08:04 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:08:04 AM"}
