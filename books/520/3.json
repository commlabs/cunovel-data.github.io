{"id":44669,"no":3,"title":"10th October","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Did you ever hear of Michael Angelo?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was a famous artist who lived in Italy in the Middle Ages. \n\u003cbr\u003e Everybody in English Literature seemed to know about him, and the\n\u003cbr\u003e whole class laughed because I thought he was an archangel. He sounds\n\u003cbr\u003e like an archangel, doesn\u0027t he? The trouble with college is that you\n\u003cbr\u003e are expected to know such a lot of things you\u0027ve never learned. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s very embarrassing at times. But now, when the girls talk about\n\u003cbr\u003e things that I never heard of, I just keep still and look them up\n\u003cbr\u003e in the encyclopedia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I made an awful mistake the first day. Somebody mentioned\n\u003cbr\u003e Maurice Maeterlinck, and I asked if she was a Freshman. \n\u003cbr\u003e That joke has gone all over college. But anyway, I\u0027m just\n\u003cbr\u003e as bright in class as any of the others--and brighter than some of them!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do you care to know how I\u0027ve furnished my room? It\u0027s a symphony\n\u003cbr\u003e in brown and yellow. The wall was tinted buff, and I\u0027ve bought\n\u003cbr\u003e yellow denim curtains and cushions and a mahogany desk (second hand\n\u003cbr\u003e for three dollars) and a rattan chair and a brown rug with an ink\n\u003cbr\u003e spot in the middle. I stand the chair over the spot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The windows are up high; you can\u0027t look out from an ordinary seat. \n\u003cbr\u003e But I unscrewed the looking-glass from the back of the bureau,\n\u003cbr\u003e upholstered the top and moved it up against the window. It\u0027s just\n\u003cbr\u003e the right height for a window seat. You pull out the drawers like\n\u003cbr\u003e steps and walk up. Very comfortable!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie McBride helped me choose the things at the Senior auction. \n\u003cbr\u003e She has lived in a house all her life and knows about furnishing. \n\u003cbr\u003e You can\u0027t imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real\n\u003cbr\u003e five-dollar bill and get some change--when you\u0027ve never had more than\n\u003cbr\u003e a few cents in your life. I assure you, Daddy dear, I do appreciate\n\u003cbr\u003e that allowance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie is the most entertaining person in the world--and Julia\n\u003cbr\u003e Rutledge Pendleton the least so. It\u0027s queer what a mixture\n\u003cbr\u003e the registrar can make in the matter of room-mates. Sallie thinks\n\u003cbr\u003e everything is funny--even flunking--and Julia is bored at everything. \n\u003cbr\u003e She never makes the slightest effort to be amiable. She believes\n\u003cbr\u003e that if you are a Pendleton, that fact alone admits you to heaven\n\u003cbr\u003e without any further examination. Julia and I were born to be enemies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now I suppose you\u0027ve been waiting very impatiently to hear\n\u003cbr\u003e what I am learning?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I. Latin: Second Punic war. Hannibal and his forces pitched camp\n\u003cbr\u003e at Lake Trasimenus last night. They prepared an ambuscade for\n\u003cbr\u003e the Romans, and a battle took place at the fourth watch this morning. \n\u003cbr\u003e Romans in retreat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e II.

It does dreadful\n\u003cbr\u003e things to your liver.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59725.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
