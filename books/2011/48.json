Vlad still held me tight. From the emerald blazing in his gaze and that hard, thick flesh pressed against my belly, he was close to telling Maximus to go away or die bloody. But then he let out a harsh sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisappointment mixed with the lust that had my loins throbbing. Vlad smoothed my hair back, his mouth swooping down to give my neck a final, lingering lick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must be important or he wouldn\u0027t dare disturb me now,\" he murmured. Then he drew away to look at me. \"If it\u0027s not, I\u0027ll kill him and return to you directly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have laughed, except I wasn\u0027t sure if he was kidding. \"I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body didn\u0027t. It ached with denied need while my neck continued to pulse with icy hot vibrations. I touched it, feeling the twin holes. Vlad\u0027s eyes followed the movement and emerald took over his gaze again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love seeing my marks in your flesh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he\u0027d looked smug while saying it, I would have been piqued, but his expression showed unadulterated possessiveness instead. Must be a vampire thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin bared his teeth. \"It\u0027s very much a vampire thing.\" He gave me a hard kiss that took away the breath I\u0027d just started to get back under control. I blamed blood loss on the fact that I had to sit down when he finally let me go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be back as soon as I can,\" he said. Then he flung open the door. \"Maximus,\" he greeted the stony-faced blond vampire on the other side. \"This had better be good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door shut behind them and I closed my eyes, taking several deep breaths. Less than a minute later, the door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leila.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad\u0027s foreboding tone made my remaining desire vanish, and I stood so fast that I nearly stumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came over and took my arm. \"You need to come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 32\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked between Vlad and Maximus down the narrow stone staircase. Every fifty feet or so, we came to a landing where we passed through a metal, guarded doorway that led to another set of descending steps. This part of the house didn\u0027t have heat, so my breath came in white plumes. Despite Vlad giving me his coat, I couldn\u0027t stop shivering. It also didn\u0027t have electricity, so if not for the torches he flamed into light, I would have been blind in the stygian darkness. I knew it was my imagination, but the walls of the tunnel seemed to shimmer with despairing essences, adding to my sense of dread. The dungeon was the last place I wanted to go to, but it was where we were headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last guarded door opened into a cavernous area that was pitch black until Vlad lit more torches with his power. The first thing I saw was several sets of manacles embedded in a huge stone pillar in the center of the area. When we approached it, I saw that these manacles were unusually thick, with silver spikes lining them that faced inward. From their varying heights and sizes, I calculated their purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide ones were for the wrists. Bar between them, the neck. Lower, wide bar for the waist, the two below that, the thighs, and the ones closest to the floor, ankles. The pillar faced the thankfully empty cells cut into the rock across from us. Knowing Vlad, their positioning was so that any prisoners could see whatever was done to the unlucky person restrained here. Between the pillar and the cells were three deep holes, and from the dark stains lining them, I guessed that they were normally occupied by thick wooden poles. The outdoor area must not be the only place Vlad where got his impalement on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I regret that this is necessary,\" Vlad stated, grasping the wrist manacles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words echoed in the subterranean surroundings, ominous and eerie as they bounced back. I wished this wasn\u0027t necessary, too, but I said nothing as I took my gloves off, tucking them into his coat. Then I walked over, leaned back against that looming rock wall, and felt the weight of icy, unforgiving metal as Vlad set the clamps against my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea how long I screamed, but my throat was burning by the time I regained control enough to distinguish reality from other people\u0027s memories. My face was also wet from tears, and shudders wracked me so violently that the ache in my limbs wasn\u0027t due to phantom pains, but from being so lost in the horrific memories that I\u0027d managed to hurt myself with my reaction-something that had never happened before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, in all the recollections I\u0027d relived, I had never experienced anything like this. When I realized that I was sagged in Vlad\u0027s arms, my first reaction was revulsion so deep that a roar tore from my wounded throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getawaydonttouchme!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released me so abruptly that I fell onto the floor. Instinct made me curl my right hand to my side instead of using it to break my fall. I sprawled into a heap, but the action meant I didn\u0027t pick up any new memories from stained stone ground, which was the most important thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I help?\" Maximus asked in a carefully neutral tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI doubted the question was directed at me, but I answered anyway. \"No. Give me a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice was still raw. I sat on the floor, trying to paste together my fractured emotions while hugging myself for warmth. That was a mistake I wouldn\u0027t have made had I been thinking clearly. As soon as my right hand came in contact with Vlad\u0027s coat, another memory assailed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood naked in front of a closet on the far side of my bedroom. With the press of a button, row upon row of clothes whirled by, some casual, some formal, and a few so ornate they were meant only for ceremonial events. I stroked my jaw as I considered my choices. I couldn\u0027t meet her family wearing just anything. She deserved better than that. Finally, I selected a long coat inlaid with black sapphires at the collars and cuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would do. Perhaps the gloves would also help to soothe her ire. Their completion came not a moment too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat image faded, replaced by Vlad looming over me in this oppressive dungeon instead of gloriously naked in his bedroom. I stared up at him, the memory of his actions shocking me for a different reason this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dressed up to meet my family?\" The unexpectedly thoughtful gesture made me choke on a laugh. \"How can you be the same person that did all those other things? You\u0027re not just versatile and complex-it\u0027s like you\u0027re a schizophrenic!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad knelt next to me, an emerald sheen encompassing his eyes like a cat\u0027s when light shone upon them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-48.html","bookId":2011,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM"}
