Mila gasps, horrified at Gabriel’s purple handprint on my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” she breathes. I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wasn’t even awake. He didn’t mean to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila stares at me doubtfully. “Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I’m sure,” I snap. “I’m not an idiot. He was asleep. His night terrors are so real that he can’t even tell what’s real and what’s not. He thought I was someone else. He was completely wrecked by it, Mi. And now he’s gone. He wanted to protect me, so he left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m crying now and Mila reaches over to wrap her skinny arms around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s OK,” she soothes me. “Shhhh. Go ahead and cry. It’s OK. It’s all going to be OK.” She pats my back and I cry and cry and cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I’m done she hands me a Kleenex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t mean to do it,” I repeat for good measure, staring her in the eye. She nods slowly, her face expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t doubt that,” she says slowly. “I can see that about him. But that doesn’t change the fact that he did do it, Maddy. He needs some help. And if he wasn’t going to get that help, then maybe it’s best that he left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes burn, but I don’t cry again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t understand,” I mumble. “He thinks he’s un-helpable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods again, solemnly. “I’m sure he does. I remember that Pax was the same way. And what did you tell me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my face, refusing to answer even though I remember very well what I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you tell me?” Mila repeats firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you that he had to get help on his own, that you couldn’t fix him.” My voice is sullen because it seemed so very different when I was dishing out that advice rather than receiving it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you were right,” she tells me gently. “And I’m right now when I tell you the same thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he didn’t leave to get help,” I tell her limply. “He left for good, to protect me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila looks pained, her hand fluttering around to pat my back again. “I know. But maybe it will all work out and maybe he’ll be back. Someday. And everything will be fine. Trust me, when Pax left, I didn’t think he’d ever come back. But he did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, changing the subject. I just can’t talk about it anymore. Not if I don’t want to break down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Mila,” I tell her tiredly. “I don’t mean to bring you down. You’ve got enough on your plate being stuck in bed. I really just came out here to help with the baby’s room. It needs to be organized and I doubt Pax will know what to do with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila nods, eyeing me carefully. “Well, that part’s right. Pax has no clue what to do with the baby things. But don’t think you can’t talk to me, Mad. Trust me, I know how you’re feeling right now. If you need to talk again, I’m here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” I tell her softly, as I bend and kiss her cheek before I head out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t give up, Maddy,” she calls after me. “I mean it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t answer. I just walk down the hall to the baby’s room and open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flood of sunshiny yellow greets me as light from the windows hits the yellow walls. Pax hired a painter to come in and paint it yellow, per Mila’s request. Since they don’t want to know the sex of the baby, they had to be gender-neutral. And Mila loves the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck the sun. I hate the sun today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around at the unopened boxes, at the baby monitors, the stacks of clothing with the tags still on, the stroller still in the box. Pax has ordered all the right supplies, he just has no idea what to do with it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is why I’m here. Hopefully it will keep my mind off my own pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get to work. I put together the changing table in a logical place in the room, next to the mahogany crib. I line up all the little baby care things on the shelf next to it: the powder, the lotion, the nail clippers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hang the mobile over the bed, adjusting the colorful kites so that they’re the right height. I put sheets on the crib mattress. I set up the baby monitor. I fluff the pillows on the rocking chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I sit in it and fold the tiny baby clothes so I can put them away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stare at the tiny little undershirt in my hands, at the way it’s hardly bigger than my hand, my vision blurs as tears fill my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won’t have this… not for a long time. Maybe not ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe left me and I don’t want anyone else. I can’t imagine ever wanting anyone else… so a family, a baby, a husband… a happy life… it’s out of my grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and just let myself cry again, quietly in the sun… the sun that refuses to leave me alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know how long I cry. All I know is that finally I don’t have any tears left. I’m totally spent. My throat feels scratchy and hoarse and my eyes are hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t cry anymore. It’s all gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my eyes to find Pax sitting across the room on the delicate white love seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the…” I’m startled. “How long have you been here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares at me, his hazel eyes troubled. “Long enough. Tell me where he is. I’m going to beat his ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, staring at my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not you too. Mila already threatened that. Not that she’s actually a threat. He didn’t mean to hurt me, Pax. He was asleep. Like I explained to Mila, he has PTSD. He honestly didn’t know what he was doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax shakes his head. “That’s not what I’m beating his ass for. I believe that he didn’t mean to hurt you. He’s not that kind of guy. I can tell. What I’m going to beat his ass for is leaving you like this. It’s a dick thing to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes well up again, even though I thought my tears were all gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne drips down my nose and onto my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish I’d never met him at all,” I confess painfully. “I wish he had never come here. Then I wouldn’t feel like this right now. I wouldn’t feel like someone yanked my guts out and put them back in all the wrong places.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax stares at me, then crosses the room, kneeling next to me with his hand on my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t mean that,” he says gently. “You were closed off before. I don’t know shit about women, but even I could see that. This is horrible, I know. But at least you’re feeling something. You know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him incredulously. “Seriously, Pax? I would rather feel nothing at all than like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. “I know. I’m sorry that I’m not good with this stuff. All I can tell you is that you should just concentrate on yourself right now. I’m pulling the funding for DefenseTech, so you won’t even have to hear his name. Just focus on yourself. Gabe’s got shit to take care of and it’s not your fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” I tell him. “I know it’s not my fault. And you know what? You’re right. Instead of focusing on him, I’m going to concentrate on working on myself. Lord knows there’s a lot of work to be done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax smiles slowly. “Well, there’s not that much to do. You’re pretty great, Mad. He has no idea what he gave up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes tear up again. “I don’t want to think about him anymore,” I whisper. “It’s too hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax nods. “I know. I’m so sorry, Maddy. I honestly can’t imagine what happened. Gabe’s a stand-up guy. Trust me, I know assholes and he’s not one. I hope that he can get his shit straightened out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod silently. “That’s not really my problem now,” I finally answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever you say,” Pax replies as he stands up. “I just want to see you happy, Madison. You really do deserve it. You’ve taken care of Mila for so long and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate that. But that’s my job now and you need to take care of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Pax. Really. I mean it. I do love you, you know. I know you don’t like talking about mushy shit like this, so thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins. “Anytime. My advice isn’t always good, but it’s free.” At my quick look he adds, “But in this case it’s good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes as I stand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I’ll run to the restaurant while Mila naps. I’ll be back with dinner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax holds out a fist for me to bump. “Awesome. Mila will thank you. She’s getting pretty damn tired of scrambled eggs, which is the only thing I can cook.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bump his fist limply and shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a good thing you’re pretty,” I tell him on my way out the door. I can hear him chuckling as I leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t feel like joking. I honestly don’t. But maybe if I pretend that everything is normal, that everything is OK… maybe it will be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck you, Gabe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at my phone, at the last words from Maddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gut clenches with every word, more and more, over and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck you, Gabe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the fuck did I do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor two days I’ve been asking myself that question. And for two days I haven’t had a good answer. The only thing I know is that I can’t hurt Madison again and this was the only way I knew to protect her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut God. God, it fucking sucks. All I want to do is pick up the phone and call her, to check on her… to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re a fucking pussy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I can’t. If I do, if I hear her voice, I might be tempted to forget all my misgivings and fears about hurting her and rush back to her. Not that she’d likely take me back at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck you, Gabe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow I got myself into this situation, into a place where I love someone even though I know I can’t have her… it’s all my fault. I knew going in that I can’t ever be with anyone. That I’m not whole. That I’m not normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I’m a monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I’m the bad thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew all of this. And I chased her anyway… because I had to fuck her, I had to harness the storm that I knew she would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I love her and everything is fucked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no one to blame but myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh I return my attention to this fucking interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrand set up some second interviews for an assistant, one who would be based here in Denver since this is where the factory will be. He did the first interviews, so I have to do the second ones. It’s only fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I overslept this morning and so I had to meet this morning’s candidate in my hotel room, rather than the café on the main floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she talks to me, her words run together, her voice fades to the background, and I don’t really give a flying fuck what she’s talking about. My thoughts are in Angel Bay with a gorgeous blonde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, that’s about it,” the girl, Alex, finishes up, smiling at me. “And I’m available to start immediately.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-leave-beautifully-broken-2/page-35.html","bookId":2759,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM"}
