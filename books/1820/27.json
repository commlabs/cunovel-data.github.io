Let’s get something to eat; I’m starving,” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed out of bed and put on my jeans. I followed Ellery out of the bedroom. I walked in the kitchen to grab a bottle of water and stopped when I saw several brown containers lined up against the back of the counter. I quickly counted them; there was fifteen total. I got nervous and a fear crept up inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Care to explain what these are?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m in a clinical trial study, that’s why I came out here.” I started to interrupt her, but she put her finger over my mouth, “Let me finish.” I smiled as I took her finger in my mouth and sucked on it. She giggled and continued, “I have to take these pills every day. Once a month, I go to the hospital and get a set of three injections. It’s called some type of ‘Immunotherapy’. I have to do this for a period of three months. Once I complete the three months, the doctor will test my blood to see if the cancer is gone; if not, then I will continue for another three months. I don’t even know if it’s going to work,” she said as she looked down. I saw the anguish on her face and heard the sorrow in her voice. I lifted her chin so she was looking at me, “It will work; It has to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s only a trial, Connor; it’s the first time it’s been done on humans, so right now, I don’t know what to think,” she said distressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re strong, Elle. You’re the strongest and most stubborn person I’ve ever met in my life, and if anybody can pull through this, it’s you, but you have to stop running away from me,” I told her as I stroked her cheek. She told me she was scared. I took her hands, turned them over, and lightly kissed both her tattoos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be scared. I’m here, and I’m going to help you through this. Even if this trial doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter because I will fly you around the world and find you the treatment that will work because…” I took in a deep breath, “I love you, Ellery Lane, and I will protect you.” The feeling that crept inside me as I spoke those three words was amazing. Tears streamed down her face as she hugged me tight and whispered, “I love you too.” I closed my eyes and nuzzled my face in her hair. I kissed her head and held her face in my hands. I brought my lips to hers and kissed her passionately. I curled my fingers under her shirt and slowly brought it up over her head, taking it off and tossing it on the floor. We smiled at each other as she led me to the couch where we made love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a beautiful, sunny day in Los Angeles. The first half of the day was spent in bed, and the second half was spent at the beach. After a picnic lunch, great sex in the lighthouse, and long talks, we headed for home. As we entered the apartment, I walked over to the easel that held a beautiful painting. I stood there and stared at the Cape Cod style house with an archway, a boat, and a lighthouse. The painting was stunning, and it made me smile to see such talent, especially from the woman I love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to say, Ellery, you are a very talented artist; this painting is stunning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked over to me, slipped her hands in my back pockets, and put her chin on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. This is a glimpse of my future; it looks so peaceful there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s very beautiful. I suggest you keep this, and don’t sell it,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed me on the cheek. “Maybe I will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was going to tell you, you know,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached for her hands and brought her arms around my waist. “Tell me what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took in a sharp breath, “About coming here and seeing Dr. Murphy. I wanted to talk to you about it that day, but you were so angry; I heard you on the phone, in your office, with Ashlyn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down, “I’m sorry, Ellery. I never should have said those things to you; I was…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to tell me about her, Connor. We can never move forward if you don’t, and I think I have a right to know,” she pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around and pressed my forehead against hers, “I know, and I will; just not tonight.” I just found her, and we shared a perfect day. There was no way I going to ruin it by discussing Ashlyn. I could see the disappointment in her eyes when I told her not tonight. I hated doing this to her, and I know it’s wrong not to come clean about Ashlyn, but I don’t know if there will ever be a right time to tell her. I picked her up and smiled as I kissed her soft beautiful lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we need to go to bed,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’m not tired,” she devilishly smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sleeping isn’t what I had in mind. We won’t be doing that for at least another three hours,” I smiled as I carried her to the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up early to get things ready for Ellery’s birthday. I was going to make sure this birthday is the best one she’s ever had. I carefully moved her arm from me and slid out of bed. I was pretty sure she wouldn’t wake up, because after last night, I knew she was exhausted. I threw on a pair of jeans and a navy blue t-shirt. I walked into the living room and over at the easel, looking at Ellery’s painting once more. She mentioned last night how she’d envisioned this painting as her future, and I am going to make sure she gets it. I just need to make sure she doesn’t sell this painting before my plans are complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carefully opened the door and quietly shut it behind me. As I was walking down the stairs, I saw Mason coming out of his apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning, Mason,” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re up awful early. Where are you sneaking off to?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just heading down the street to that café to pick up some breakfast for Elle. Today’s her birthday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, and it’s so exciting! Did she mention going to the club tonight?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, she told me last night; it sounds like fun,” I said as we both walked out the side door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have a good day with Miss Elle. Please tell her happy birthday from us and to get her dancing shoes on, because tonight, we’re going to bring down the house!” he excitedly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed when we parted ways on the sidewalk. I reached the café and placed a takeout order. It didn’t take too long, but I was nervous Ellery was going to be up before I got back and wonder where I was. When I arrived back at the apartment, I quietly opened the door and set the bag on the counter. I walked into the bedroom, and she was sleeping peacefully. I took off my jeans and shirt and put on my grey pajama bottoms. I walked back to the kitchen and searched her cupboards for a tray. She didn’t have one, so I ran downstairs to Mason’s apartment and borrowed one. I came back and arranged Ellery’s breakfast on the tray. On the way back from the café, I bought her a single red rose from a vendor selling flowers on the street. I searched the cabinets for a vase and found a small one that would hold one flower. I filled the vase with water and set the rose inside. Everything was perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed into bed and pushed her hair back as I lightly kissed her neck. She rolled over and smiled. “Happy Birthday, baby,” I whispered as I kissed her lips. She took my hand and interlaced our fingers as she nestled her head into my chest. “Thank you,” she replied. I held her for a few minutes before I told her not to move, and that I’d be right back. She looked at me and smiled while biting her bottom lip. Damn that smile. I went to the kitchen, grabbed the tray and walked back to the bedroom. She looked at me with a hunger in her eyes, and I knew she wasn’t thinking about food. I smiled as I walked over and set the tray on her lap. I could tell she was excited from the grin she was displaying from ear to ear. She asked me how, when, and where. I laughed as I told her it came from the café down the street. I opened my hand and handed her the pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to take these first,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes at me. “I know,” she sighed as she took them with her orange juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the fork and fed her some eggs. She smiled as she ate them. I couldn’t help but stare into her beautiful eyes, because when I did, I saw my entire future in them. She took the fork out of my hand and fed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s time to open your presents,” I smiled as I reached under the bed and pulled out three boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile widened. “I love presents!” she squealed. I removed the tray from her lap and set it on the floor. I was grinning from ear to ear as I handed her the first box that contained her new iPhone. She gracefully opened it, and I watched as her mouth dropped in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your phone number is the same as your old phone; you know the one you threw away?” I smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who just throws away their phone?” I shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m crazy, remember?” she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you are crazy, but you’re my crazy, and don’t ever forget that,” I said as I kissed her on the tip of her nose. I handed her the next box that contained the bracelet. She gasped when she opened the box and, covered her mouth with her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Connor, I…I love it! This is the most beautiful gift that anyone has ever given me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the box from her hand and took out the bracelet. I unclasped it and put it on her delicate wrist. “I love you, Ellery. Not only for whom you are, but for the person I’ve become because of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is my forever to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t too long before tears started to fall down her face. “Oh no, you don’t! There will be no tears on your birthday, whether they’re good tears or not; I forbid it. Do you understand, Miss Lane?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked as she started to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrapped her arms around me as tight as she could and met her mouth with mine. I responded, but quickly broke the kiss. I was excited for her to open the last present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You still have one more present to open,” I said as I handed her the last box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You spoil me,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took her hand, brought it up to my lips, and softly kissed it. “You deserve to be spoiled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the box and looked at the tickets. She didn’t say a word; she only looked at me with tears in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t do it; no tears,” I commanded. But it was too late; they had already started to fall. I took my thumb and gently wiped her tears from her eyes. “I know your dream is to go to Paris; I saw it on the list that you hid in your desk, and as soon as the doctor says that it’s ok to go, we’ll be on the first flight there for however long you want to stay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe climbed on my lap and straddled me as she cupped my face in her hands and stared into my eyes. “Thank you for all that you’ve done for me. You’ve made me the happiest person in the world, and I’m never letting you go.” I smiled as I ran my finger along her face. I took her wrist and brought it up to my lips as I softly kissed the infinity symbol on her bracelet. “It will always be forever you,” I whispered. She leaned in and brushed her lips against mine. We stayed in bed until the afternoon, and Ellery showed me how grateful she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that night, I arranged for a limo to pick us up and drive us to the swank bar that Mason and Landon had planned for Ellery’s birthday. It was an eventful night of talking, laughing, and drinking. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-27.html","bookId":1820,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:14 PM"}
