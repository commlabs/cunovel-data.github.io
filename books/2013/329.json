For honour.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘True: the only thing they care about is winning. Leaving them free to talk about honour and glory afterwards. The chief spoil of the victors, that privilege.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You speak like one of them, Mezla. That is why I do not, trust you, and so I will remain at your side during the battle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My heart goes out to you-I am tasked with guarding the children, after all. We’ll be nowhere close to the fighting.’ Until the fighting comes to us, which it will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I shall find my glory in slitting your miserable throat, Mezla, the moment you turn to run. 1 see the weakness in your soul; I have seen it all along. You are broken. You should have died with your soldiers.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Probably. At least then I’d be spared the judgements of someone with barely a whisker on his spotty chin. Have you even lain with a woman yet, Torrent?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young warrior glowered for a moment, then slowly nodded. ‘It is said you are quick with your barbed arrows, Mezla.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A metaphor, Torrent? I’m surprised at this turn to the poetic’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have not listened to our songs, have you? You have made yourself deaf to the beauty of the Awl, and in your deafness you have blinded that last eye left to you. We are an ancient people, Mezla.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Deaf, blind, too bad I’m not yet mute.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You will be when I slit your throat.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Toc conceded, he had a point there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask had waited for this a long time. And no old man of the Renfayar with his damned secrets would stand poised to shatter everything. No, with his own hands Redmask had taken care of that, and he could still see in his mind that elder’s face, the bulging eyes, vessels bursting, the jutting tongue as the lined face turned blue, then a deathly shade of grey above his squeezing hands. That throat had been as nothing, thin as a reed, the cartilage crumpling like a papyrus scroll in his grip. And he had found himself unable to let go, long after the fool was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo many memories of his childhood had slithered into his hands, transforming his fingers into coiling serpents that seemed not satisfied with lifeless flesh in their grip, but sought that touch of cold that came long after the soul’s flight. Of course, there had been more to it than that. The elder had imagined himself Redmask’s master, his overseer to use the Letherii word, standing at the war leader’s shoulder, ever ready to draw breath and loose words that held terrible truths, truths that would destroy Redmask, would destroy any chance he had of leading the Awl to victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet now the time drew near. He would see Bivatt’s head on a spear. He would see mud and Letherii and Tiste Edur corpses in their thousands. Crows wheeling overhead, voicing delighted cries. And he would stand on the wooden platform, witness to it all. To his scaled Guardians, who had found him, had chosen him, rending mages limb from limb, scything through enemy lines-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the face of the elder rose once more in his mind. He had revelled in that vision, at first, but now it had begun to haunt him. A face to greet his dreams; a face hinted at in every smear of stormcloud, the bruised grey and blue hues cold as iron filling the sky. He had thought himself rid of that fool and his cruel secrets, in that weighing look-like a father’s regard on a wayward son, as if nothing the child did could be good enough, could be Awl in the ways of the people as they had been and would always be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the work continued on all sides, Redmask mounted the platform. Cadaran whip at his belt. Rygtha axe slung from its leather straps. The weapons we were once born to, long ago. Is that not Awl enough? Am I not more Awl than any other among the Renfayar? Among the warriors gathered here? Do not look so at me, old man. You have not the right. You were never the man I have become-look at my Guardians!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShall I tell you the tale, Father?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no. You are dead. And I feel still your feeble neck in my hands-ah, an error. That detail belongs to the old man. Who died mysteriously in his tent. Last of the Renfayar elders, who knew, yes, knew well my father and all his kin, and the children they called their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFool, why did you not let the years blur your memories? Why did you not become like any other doddering, hopeless ancient? What kept your eyes honed so sharp? But no longer, yes. Now you stare at stone and darkness. Now that sharp mind rots in its skull, and that is that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeave me be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first spatters of rain struck him and he looked up at the sky. Hard drops, bursting against his mask, this scaled armour hiding dread truth. I am immune. I cannot be touched. Tomorrow, we shall destroy the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Guardians will see to that. They chose me, did they not? Theirs is the gift of glory, and none but me has earned such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-329.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
