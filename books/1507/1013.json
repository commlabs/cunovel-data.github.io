He didn\u0027t mind this. As soon as he had been appointed to the Echelon by that white-robed woman, he had known that the matter would eventually come to be known by others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was a cautious person, but now that the matter of the Echelon had been discovered by the The Three Great Daoist Societies, trying to conceal the truth would have been pointless. As of now, it made sense for the clan to be made aware of it too; at least then he would have a foundation of protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang Shoudao didn\u0027t respond at first. After some thought, he finally said, “This is a weighty matter, something I cannot make a decision on by myself. How about this: Fellow Daoists, please return to the hall for now. I’ll discuss the situation with Hao’er privately, and then we’ll give you an answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe representatives from the Three Great Daoist Societies exchanged glances and then nodded. In the blink of an eye, they left the private chamber and reappeared out in the main hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they were gone, Meng Hao glared at Fang Shoudao, who looked back at him, cleared his throat, and then smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Meng Hao’s perspective, that smile looked far too treacherous, causing him give a loud harrumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang Shoudao cleared his throat, then eyed Meng Hao and said, “I’ll give you one percent!” He was well aware that he hadn’t brought up the matter of splitting the profits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Impossible! I demand fifty percent!” Meng Hao responded immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang Shoudao frowned and then said, “All of these gifts are very important to the clan! At the very most, I can give you two percent!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know what I\u0027ve done for the clan? I\u0027ve–” Meng Hao was just about to launch into a long explanation when Fang Shoudao interrupted with a loud sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hao’er, you\u0027re the Crown Prince of the clan!” he said, looking very disappointed. He sounded pained as he continued, “Don’t you know that as the Crown Prince, you receive special protection from the clan? That shows how much the clan approves of you! How does a piddling profit the likes of which we\u0027re discussing now compare to that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is your home!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And right now, your home is in a very tight spot! The first generation Patriarch is sleeping, and the planet is weak. Other than the resources spent on the fundamental cultivation needs of the clan, everything else is used on the planet itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Plus, we have to be on guard against the Ji Clan! In addition to all that, we have to keep some resources in reserve in case we need to awaken the first generation Patriarch again. Meng Hao... do you understand what I\u0027m saying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Considering all of those things, how could the clan possibly agree to send our magnificent Crown Prince to the Three Great Daoist Societies to practice cultivation?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Fang Clan is your home, and you are one of our family members! You\u0027re even a young lord of the clan! Now is the time for you to forgo a bit of profit to ensure that the clan can have some breathing room. Can you agree to that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the future, everything in the clan will belong to you, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you think this isn\u0027t fair, then go ahead and just take all the gifts! I don’t want any of it!” With that, Fang Shoudao closed his eyes and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stood there silently. All of a sudden he felt like he really was putting too much emphasis on wealth, and felt a bit bad. Finally, he nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I\u0027m fine,” he said. “Forget about it....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang Shoudao opened his eyes, and the kindness in them was apparent as he patted Meng Hao on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good boy....” he said. Then he waved his sleeve, causing both of them to vanish and reappear in the main hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe banquet continued, and eventually, it was with much anticipation that the Three Great Daoist Societies listened as Meng Hao announced that he would join their ranks. However, Fang Shoudao, citing Meng Hao’s cultivation base as the reason, said that they would have to return in three months to accept him officially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was crestfallen. Although he understood that the clan was in a very difficult situation, when he thought about the vast amount of spirit stones pouring in, not a single one of which were going to him, it filled his heart with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, it doesn’t matter. The Patriarch was right. I\u0027m a member of the clan, and should act as such.” Consoling himself all the way, Meng Hao said his goodbyes and then stepped out of the hall. Just when he was about to fly away, two bright beams of light whistled through the air toward the main hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMembers of the Fang Clan flew nearby in escort, and as the beams of light neared, it turned out to be people from the Li Clan. One was Li Ling’er, whose face was grim and unsightly. Next to her was a middle-aged man who had the bearing of a transcendent being. His features were handsome, and his aura was extremely strong with the power of Essence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Li Ling’er saw Meng Hao, she gritted her teeth, and her eyes blazed with fury. In contrast, the middle-aged man’s eyes shone brightly, and he laughed heartily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, handsome as expected,” he said. “Before, I could only observe with divine sense, but now that I can look upon you in person, kid, I have to say, excellent. Truly excellent!” The man laughed as he walked into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi Ling’er walked past Meng Hao, glaring daggers at him. She looked extremely disgruntled, as if her life was so unfair that she were on the verge of completely losing her temper. Meng Hao stared in shock; something definitely seemed off. Instead of leaving, he stopped and looked back. The first thing he noticed was Fang Shoudao rising to his feet, and then... he heard the middle-aged man from the Li Clan laugh and begin to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elder Brother Shoudao, after I got your jade slip, I immediately called a clan meeting to discuss the matter. Hao’er is a wonderful kid, and I’ve really taken a liking to him. In fact, the entire Li Clan agrees! We all support Hao’er, and once he becomes the Clan Chief of the Fang Clan in the future, our two clans will have a powerful alliance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have come here today prepared to give a Dao Realm treasure, 100 precious Ancient Realm treasures, 1,000 Immortal treasures, 100,000,000 Immortal jades, 10,000,000,000 spirit stones, as well as numerous other items, as the wedding gift for Hao’er and Ling\u0027er!” Laughing heartily, the man from the Li Clan clasped hands and bowed toward Fang Shoudao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he listed out all the gifts he was enough to cause even the Dao Realm experts to stare in shock. Such extravagant gift-giving was something rarely seen. However, as soon as they heard the word “wedding,” everyone reached an epiphany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was no longer an ordinary clan member. He was the number one Chosen of the Fang Clan, a famous blazing sun in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, and even a Crown Prince. With a status like that, any organization would offer up lavish gifts to form an alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA broad smile could be seen on Fang Shoudao’s face as he walked forward, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elder Brother Li, you’re far too polite!” he said. “Hao’er and this lass Ling\u0027er have been engaged since childhood! I just decided to speed up the matter a bit, that’s all.” Fang Shoudao looked over kindly at Li Ling’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stood just outside the door to the main temple, gaping in shock. His jaw hung open and his eyes were wide. He almost couldn’t believe what was happening, and he felt his mind spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He sold me off?” he murmured. He suddenly began to tremble, and rage began to burn inside of him. Generally speaking, it would be the woman who received betrothal gifts. But considering that this was the Fang Clan, they were the ones to receive the gifts. What Meng Hao was even more incapable of accepting was that... everything that Fang Shoudao had said moments ago... had clearly been a huge con that he had fallen right into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, he could accept all of that, for the clan. He could part with all the extravagant gifts, despite the pain it caused him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, what was happening now had nothing to do with money!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao\u0027s mind suddenly filled with the image of a Red Wedding, of endless slaughter. That wedding had been one of the most painful moments of his life!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw himself holding Xu Qing in his arms until she gradually closed her eyes and faded away. Unforgettable stabs of pain once again filled his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust barely, he felt as if he could see into the cycle of reincarnation, and all of a sudden, he heard a voice which echoed eternally in his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m in the cycle of reincarnation... waiting for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Meng Hao often seemed to treat other women flirtatiously, in truth, there was a place deep in his heart where only one woman could enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChu Yuyan could not enter that place, so therefore... how could Li Ling’er possibly do so!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was... a place for only one person. It was... a place that belonged only to Xu Qing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao took a deep breath. His eyes shone with coldness, and even as everyone chatted and laughed, he suddenly spoke out, his voice icy, “Patriarch. I am already married!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as his voice rang out, the entire hall went completely silent. The middle-aged man from the Li Clan turned to glance at Meng Hao, then looked back at Fang Shoudao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi Ling’er’s eyes brightened with anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang Shoudao coughed dryly and transmitted his voice to Meng Hao: “I’ll give you twenty percent of the Li Clan’s betrothal gift!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s face was extremely calm, and his eyes were icy as he stared back wordlessly at Fang Shoudao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You little hoodlum. Fine. Fifty percent, no more. You know that the clan is in a difficult place right now, and I–”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patriarch,” Meng Hao interrupted, his voice calm. “I, Meng Hao, love money. However, not everything in the world can be negotiated in terms of money and profit. I said. I’M ALREADY MARRIED!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a wife, and her name is Xu Qing.” He spoke the words earnestly and very clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes in the main hall shifted to look at Meng Hao. With the exception of the Dao Realm Patriarchs, the other members of the Senior generation, as well as all the Chosen Meng Hao had fought with, had strange looks in their eyes. They stared at Meng Hao, their gazes shining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi Ling’er was very pretty, and would be the type of beloved partner that any clan would view as favorable. Furthermore, the backing of the Li Clan would enable Meng Hao to achieve future accomplishments with much greater ease, and he could definitely reach greater heights of glory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody could understand why Meng Hao would flat-out reject such an opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi Ling’er had originally looked forward to seeing Meng Hao reject the offer. But for some reason, when she heard his explanation and saw how serious he was, she suddenly realized that he seemed very different from the scoundrel she remembered. In fact, he seemed to be hiding some great pain deep within him, a fact that caused her to tremble slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is she?” asked Fang Shoudao, sounding very stern. “On Planet South Heaven?” He looked at Meng Hao a bit more seriously than he had before, and his tone was very grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s not on Planet South Heaven,” Meng Hao replied softly. “She’s in the cycle of reincarnation, waiting for me to go find her.” He could no longer prevent the grief from showing on his face. All of a sudden, he saw the vague image of a simple young woman standing in front of him, wearing a plain robe. She was the one who had taken him into the world of cultivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t shockingly beautiful, but somehow, she had worked her way into his heart. He had given her a Cosmetic Cultivation Pill, and in the end, they had experienced a Red Wedding together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was Xu Qing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis Qing’er....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had sacrificed her longevity for him. She had entered reincarnation for him. As she died, she had forced a smile onto her face... for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Meng Hao’s arms, she had turned from being beautiful and young into a white-haired old woman. She had withered up and closed her eyes. She had attempted to lift her hand up, as if to wipe the tears off of his face, but then that hand had slumped down lifelessly. That was... the image he saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her name is Xu Qing,” he continued softly. “She\u0027s waiting for me in reincarnation, and we made a promise that I would go find her. She... is my wife. My... one and ONLY wife!” With that, he bowed to Fang Shoudao, then turned and flew off, his expression one of pain, grief, and bleakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the main hall, everyone was shaken. They could sense the grief in Meng Hao, and could tell that although he usually seemed happy and frivolous on the outside, he was actually filled with a sea of sorrow and longing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLi Ling’er shivered as she watched Meng Hao leave. As of this moment, the detestation she felt toward him was not so profound, and in fact, deep in her heart, pity took root.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote from Er Gen:\u003c/strong\u003e I miss Xu Qing....\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1008\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1010\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1009","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
