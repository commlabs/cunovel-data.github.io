I’m a master. In only hours, it’s all but forgotten and, as long as no one brings it up, it will stay that way. I walk over to Storm, who’s mixing batter in a big glass bowl. “Pancakes?” She holds up a ladle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, patting my stomach. “Did you see Livie this morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStorm nods. “She left for school not long ago.” She drops a spoonful of pancake mix onto the griddle and the kitchen fills with the sizzling sound. She fixes me with the same worried look that Dan just gave me. “How are you feeling, really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m … good. I’m better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sure? Dan knows a guy you can talk to if it’ll help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “I’m good. Seeing you here, alive and well, and serving me pancakes is all I need.” I rub her back with one hand as I grab a plate of food with the other. Yup, this is exactly what I need. Storm and Mia, and Livie and Trent. Even Dan. This all I need right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I have the night off. You coming over?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait and wait but I get no text response from Trent. Impatient, I walk over to his apartment and knock. No answer. His place is pitch black. Then I wander out to the commons on a fake mission to inspect the hibachi. Really, I want to see if Trent’s bike is there. It is. I go and knock on his door again and wait. Still no response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCain won’t let either of us work that night. In fact, he’s forced Storm to take an entire week with danger pay. I’ll bet Dan is happy about that. By the light bounce in Storm’s step, I think she’s okay with it too. I would be happy too. If Trent was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t hear from Trent the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo text. No call. It’s like he’s dropped off the face of the Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go back to Penny’s on the third night with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. The music’s dull, the lights are blinding, the customers’ annoying. It’s not the same without Trent and Storm there and I’m miserable. I can’t even force a smile while concentrating. I know Storm will be back in a few days. Trent though, I feel his absence like a knife in the center of my back. It’s painful, I can’t reach it to pull it out, and I’m sure it will be my demise if it stays as is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent being gone eats at me all week. It makes me grouchy and snappy and generally unpleasant to be around. I’m well aware of it, and I don’t care. It makes me start fights with Livie on my one night off over what to watch on television. It makes her start to cry and call me a bitch. Livie never does that. It makes me lurk through the commons every night, casting furtive glances at 1D. The end result is the same. Darkness. Where ever he went, Trent’s not back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if he’s never coming back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay Five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scream in horror as I watch my parents’ Audi sink into the river, my eyes locked on the person trapped behind the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a sweaty tangled mess in my sheets when I come to, gasping. It was just a dream! Oh, Thank God! It takes me a good fifteen minutes to shake the image scalding my mind. Only now I can’t shake the idea. What if Trent did get into an accident? No one would call me. I’m nobody. I haven’t had a chance to be anybody yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI harass Storm to give me Dan’s number. Then I harass him to check the police reports of a ‘Trent Emerson’ in an accident. He tells me he can’t abuse his position like that. I snap and slam my phone against the counter. Then I call him back and apologize, and he concedes to bring his laptop so I can search the news, the obits. Anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s well into the night before I accept that Trent is probably alive and well. He’s just not with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay Nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWandering past Trent’s apartment door on my way to the gym, I freeze. I’m sure I just caught a whiff of something funky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOhmigod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent’s dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run to Tanner’s door and hammer on it until it flies open. Tanner’s standing there with his standard Batman pajama pants and deer-caught-in-the-headlight eyes. “Come on!” I grab his arm and yank him out. “You need to open 1D right now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner uses his weight to resist me. “Wait a minute. I can’t just open—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think Trent’s dead!” I shriek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gets him moving. I wait behind him with itchy feet as he fumbles with his giant key ring, his hands shaking. He’s bothered by this. Of course he is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he opens the door, I shove past him, not even considering what I’m rushing in to see. It’s dim and tidy inside. Sparse, even. I wouldn’t know someone lived there had it not been for a laptop sitting on the desk, Trent’s navy sweater hanging over the back of the couch, and the smell of his cologne lingering in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner moves past me, and does a quick sweep of the bedrooms and bathroom. He even opens the closet door. When he comes back to face me, it’s with a glower. “Why exactly did you tell me Trent was dead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow, averting my gaze. “Oops.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, get out of here.” He ushers me toward the door none to gently with a hand on my shoulder. I hear him as he lumbers away, grumbling something about drugs and hormones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay Thirteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKick. Punch. Spin. Kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bag takes my punishment without complaint. I slam and pound against it, all my anger and anxiety coming to a head. Trent has another life. That has to be it. A tanned, blonde, unbroken woman. They probably have two perfect little kids together who say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ and haven’t learned to swear like sailors because of their mother’s incessant profanity. He must have run away to Miami and had a quarter-life crisis affair. I am nothing but someone’s quarter-life crisis and I fell for it like a mindless sap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKick Pivot. Spin. Kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis feels good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I’m gaining control again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, at Storm’s house, I sit on the couch and watch an episode of Sponge Bob with Mia. Lying next to me on the cushion is a dark-haired Ken doll. It kind of reminds me of Trent. I give serious consideration to stealing it, painting ‘Trent’ over its chest, and taking a lighter to where its man parts should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay Seventeen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was he real?” I mumble, staring at the phone in my hand. I didn’t buy this for myself, did I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Livie asks, looking up at me in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trent, was he real? I mean, I could understand if he wasn’t real. Who could be that beautiful and sweet and perfect and want someone as f**ked up as me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a long pause and when I look over at Livie, she’s staring at me like I swallowed a bag of broken glass. I can tell she’s worried about me. Storm’s worried about me too. I think even Nate is worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay Twenty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKick. Punch. Punch. Kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m raging against the bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent used me. To what sick end, I can’t decide. He obviously has a twisted fetish. He found a damaged woman and targeted her weakness with his dimples and his charm. He broke through my shell, wormed his way in to melt the ice over my heart. Then he abandoned me after uncovering just how f**ked up I really am. But not before getting laid, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I let him in. It’s my fault! I’m the idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pound away on the twenty pound bag of sand. I love the sand. It absorbs all my emotions without disapproval and lets me use it without expectation. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ten-tiny-breaths-ten-tiny-breaths-1/page-44.html","bookId":1854,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:39 PM"}
