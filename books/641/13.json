{"id":9358,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. THE REFORMATION OF TEXAS.","content":"\"Well?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were five of them—Indian, the Parson, Dewey, Chauncey and Sleepy. They sat in a tent in Company A and at that moment were gazing anxiously at a figure who stood in the doorway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is hope,\" said Mark. \"Hope for poor Texas.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then he came in and sat down to tell the story of his interview with the colonel. The plebes listened anxiously; and when he finished they set to work to compose themselves as best they could to wait.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The answer will come to-night,\" Mark said, \"when they read off the reports. And until then—nothing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Which just expressed the situation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The day passed somehow; between police duties and drills, the six were kept busy enough to relieve the suspense of waiting. And after supper the battalion lined up, the roll was called, and the orders of the following day were read, while Mark and his friends fretted and gasped with impatience. There were reports, and finally miscellaneous notices, among them the sick list!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 111]\"Fourth class,\" read the officer, then halted a moment. \"Powers\"—every man in the line was straining eyes and ears, half dead with curiosity—then, \"excused indefinitely—temporary mental aberration, caused by heat.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Safe!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And a moment later the line broke ranks, the cadets discussing with added interest the case of that extraordinary plebe. But the six had danced off in joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s safe! He\u0027s safe!\" they cried. \"Hooray!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And now,\" said Mark, \"there\u0027s only one thing more. We\u0027ve got to reform him, make sure he don\u0027t do it again!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We will,\" said the others.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was two days after that, one evening after supper, that the door of the hospital building was opened and Texas came forth, spruce and handsome in a brand new uniform, looking none the worse for his \"sunstroke\" treatment—i. e., plenty of cold water, inside and out. Texas felt moderately contented, too. He had held up the corps as he had promised—not a man in the crowd had dared to fire a shot at him. He had a vague recollection of having done something heroic, besides. He saw that every one was staring at him in \"admiration;\" in short, our friend Powers was prepared for a rousing and hearty reception from the rest of the Seven.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He strode up the company street, not failing to notice[Pg 112] meanwhile that plebes, and old cadets, too, made way for him in awe and respect. He stopped at Mark\u0027s place, pushed the flap aside, and entered with a rush.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh!\" he cried. \"Whar be you? How\u0027s everybody?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The first person he saw was Master Dewey, and to him Texas rushed and held out his hand. To his indescribable amazement that young gentleman calmly stared at him, and put both his hands behind his back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"W—w—why!\" gasped Texas.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whereupon Dewey turned upon his heel and walked out of the tent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Texas was dumfounded. He stared at the others; they were all there except Mark, and they gazed at the intruder in cold indifference. None of them apparently had ever seen him before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look a yere!\" demanded Texas at last. \"Ain\u0027t you fellows a-goin\u0027 to speak to me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Evidently they were not, for they didn\u0027t even answer his question. Texas stood and stared at them for a few moments more, wondering whether he ought not to sail in and do up the crowd. Finally, as the silence grew even more embarrassing, he decided to go out and find Mark to learn what on earth was the matter. With this intention he turned and hurriedly left the tent, while the five inmates looked at one another and smiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 113]Mark was walking up the street; Texas espied him and made a dash for him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hi, Mark!\" he roared. \"What\u0027s the matter with them——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Texas stopped in alarm; a feather might have laid him flat. Mark, his chum, his tent mate, was staring at him without a sign of recognition! And a moment later Mark turned on his heel and strode away in silence, while Texas gasped, \"Great Scott!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That evening, seated on one of the guns up by Trophy Point, was visible a solitary figure, looking about as lonely and wretched as a human being can. It was \"the Texas madman.\" Everybody kept a safe distance away from him, and so no one had a chance to notice that the madman\u0027s eyes were filled with tears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Poor Texas,\" Mark was thinking. \"He\u0027ll come to terms pretty soon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did, for a fact. That same evening, just before tattoo, Mark felt a grip upon his arm that made him wince. He turned and found it was his friend, a look of misery upon his face that went to the other\u0027s heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look a-yere, old man,\" he pleaded. \"Won\u0027t you—oh, for Heaven\u0027s sake, tell me what\u0027s the matter?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t mind telling you,\" responded Mark, slowly. \"You have behaved yourself as no gentleman should, and as no friend of mine shall!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 114]\"I!\" cried Texas, in amazement. \"I! What on earth have I done?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Done!\" echoed Mark. \"Didn\u0027t you go off and get drunk? For shame, Texas!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Texas was too dumfounded to say a word. He could only stare and gasp. Here was a state of affairs indeed!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes!\" chimed in Dewey, approaching at this moment. \"And you nearly killed dozens of people, too. Mark was within an ace of being dismissed; and as for you! why, you\u0027d have been fired long ago if Mark hadn\u0027t pleaded for hours with the superintendent!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Texas turned his wondering eyes upon Dewey then. He was fairly choking with amazement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you mean to say,\" he gasped at last, \"that you fellows are mad with me because I got drunk?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Exactly,\" responded Mark.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And do you mean to tell me that you call that disgraceful conduct?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I do. And I mean to tell you, moreover, that you can\u0027t be a friend of ours while you do it. I don\u0027t know how people feel about such things where you come from, Texas, but I do know that if people up here knew you had been in that condition not a soul would speak to you. There\u0027s very little room among decent people for the fellow who thinks it smart to make a fool of himself, and he usually finds it out, too, after it is too late. I never[Pg 115] spent my time hanging around saloons, and I don\u0027t think much of fellows that do, either.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark could scarcely repress a smile as he watched the effect this brief sermon produced on the astounded Texan.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder what dad would say if he heard that!\" was the thought in the latter\u0027s mind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Texas was brought back from this thought rather suddenly to his own situation. For Mark and Dewey both turned away to leave him again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look a-yere, Mark,\" he cried, seizing him by the arm again. \"Look a-yere, ole man, won\u0027t you forgive me jest this once. Oh, please!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And there were tears in the Texan\u0027s big gray eyes as he said it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you\u0027ll do it again,\" Mark objected.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Deed I won\u0027t, man! \u0027Deed I won\u0027t. I\u0027ll swear I\u0027ll never do it again s\u0027long as I live.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But will you keep your promise?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I never broke one yit as I know,\" responded Texas with an injured look.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Mark, rejoicing inwardly at his success, but outwardly very grave and solemn, said that he\u0027d go in and ask the other six about it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Texas sat with his feet against the tent pole and a pen[Pg 116] in one hand. He held a letter to his father in the other; he was just through writing it, and he was going to read it for the edification of the Banded Seven.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Dear Scrap,\u0027\" he began. \"You see,\" added Texas, in an explanatory note, \"I call him Scrap sometimes just to make him feel comfortable. All the boys call him that. \u0027Dear Scrap. This yere is the first letter I\u0027ve written you since I hit this place. I ain\u0027t heard from you, so I don\u0027t know whether you got \u0027lected fo\u0027 Congress or not. I been havin\u0027 piles o\u0027 sport up yere. Took in three quarts \u0027tother day, an\u0027 I held up the hull corps on the strength of it. Busted two horses\u0027 legs, though, an\u0027 I reckon you\u0027ll have to send on the price. Don\u0027t think they\u0027ll mount to over a thousan\u0027 or two. I\u0027ve still got my guns——\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Guns is spelt with one \u0027n,\u0027 ain\u0027t it?\" Texas inquired, interrupting himself. \"I put two—makes it seem bigger and more important, sorter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027They\u0027re the queerest folks up this way! They gave me thunder fer gittin\u0027 drunk, said twarn\u0027t gentlemanly. Reckon after you licked a few they\u0027d call you a gentleman all right \u0027nough! They made me swear off, else they wouldn\u0027t let me stay. What do you reckon the boys\u0027ll say to that? Had to do it, though—you needn\u0027t git mad over it—I\u0027m havin\u0027 so much fun a-doin\u0027 of the yearlings that I wanted to stay. They kain\u0027t one of \u0027em lick me.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I didn\u0027t mention you, Mark,\" Texas added, laughing.[Pg 117] \"Cause if I\u0027d told dad that you did lick me, he\u0027d probably want to come up an\u0027 try a whack himself, jes\u0027 to see ef you really could hit hard. Dad won\u0027t ever acknowledge that I kin do him, though I almost licked him twice, when he got riled. Reckon I\u0027ll end this yere letter now. I jest wanted to tell him to send \u0027long some money.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now let\u0027s go out and hunt up some o\u0027 them old yearlin\u0027s.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And that was the beginning of Texas\u0027 reformation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3246/88967.html","bookId":641,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:11:51 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:11:51 AM"}
