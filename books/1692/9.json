It stopped at a huge mining station, deep underground. Hundreds of boys chained together, working like slaves. I looked everywhere for him. Everywhere. But I couldn\u0027t find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I snuck up to one of the boys and asked him. I hid in the shadows as he asked around. I described him perfectly. Finally, word got back to me. They said he was dead. They were positive. They saw one of the slaverunners get mad at him for not moving fast enough, and they said they beat him with a chain. They saw him die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a long silence, and then a muffled cry, and I see Ben wiping away his tears. I hardly know what to say. I can\u0027t comprehend the guilt he must feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never should have left him alone,\" Ben says. \"Back in the mountains. I left him alone, just for an hour. I didn\u0027t think they\u0027d come. I hadn\u0027t seen them in years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I say. \"I never thought they would, either. But it\u0027s not your fault. They are to blame, not you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The worst part of all of this is not seeing it for myself,\" Ben says. \"Not seeing him dead. Not knowing for sure. I can\u0027t explain it, but I don\u0027t believe he\u0027s dead. A part of me still thinks those boys might have mixed him up with somebody else. I know him. He wouldn\u0027t die. Not like that. He\u0027s strong. Smart. Smarter than me, stronger than me. And tougher than me. I think he escaped. I really do. I think he worked his way back up the river. I think he\u0027s going to come back to our house, and wait for me there. Back in the mountains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Ben and see a frenzied look in his eyes, and realize that he has taught himself to believe this fantasy. I don\u0027t want to ruin his fantasy. I don\u0027t want to tell him that that is nearly impossible. Because in this day and age, we all need our dreams, as much as we need food or water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think?\" he asks, looking right at me. \"Do you think he\u0027s still alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t have the heart to say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo instead, I look back at him, and say, \"Anything is possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause a part of me knows that it\u0027s not helpful to live in fantasy - but another part of me has learned that, sometimes, fantasy is all you have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my eyes, disoriented. I don\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening. The floor of the cave is lined with thousands of brightly colored flowers, purple and whites and pinks. I look down and see I am lying on a bed of flowers, see sunlight pouring into the cave. Outside, it is warm, balmy, a beautiful spring day, with gentle breezes coming off the river. Beyond the entrance to the cave I see lush trees, flowers everywhere, birds chirping. The sun is so bright and strong, it is like a light shining in from heaven. As I look all around me, I notice there is a soft white glow in the air; a great sense of peace has come over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit up and see, standing before me, Rose, light radiating behind her. To my shock, she looks perfectly healthy and happy now, a big smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe steps forward and wraps her arms around me in a huge hug. She kisses my cheek and whispers: \"I love you, Brooke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull her back and look at her and kiss her on the forehead, so happy to see her healthy again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, too,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel the warmth and love radiating off of her. She slowly pulls away. I tried to hold onto her, but she releases my hands, and I feel her slipping away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore my eyes she starts to float away. She drifts up into the air, smiling down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" she says. \"I\u0027m happy now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe becomes more and more translucent, until she blends into the light. She floats up out of the cave, outside, into the sky, higher and higher, all the while, her face looking down at me, smiling. I can feel the intense love from her, and I feel just as much love for her. I want to hold her, I don\u0027t want her to go. But I feel her leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wake, looking all around in the cave. I wonder if I\u0027m dreaming this time, and it takes me a minute to realize that this time, I\u0027m truly awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight floods the cave, and it is much warmer than yesterday. The snow is piled high but already melting, and light bounces off of it. I remember being up all night with Rose; she was shaking, trembling, burning up from fever all night long. But I didn\u0027t let her go. I rocked her and whispered in her ear that everything would be okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I look over, and see that Rose is still in my arms. I slowly lean back, look at her - and my heart freezes to see that her eyes are open. Frozen open. I watch for several seconds, before I realize that she is dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around and see everyone sleeping, and realize I\u0027m the first one to wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold Rose tight, rocking her, my eyes flooding with tears. Penelope, in her lap, whines and whines, and begins to bark. She licks Rose\u0027s hand, and barks again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers in the cave wake. Bree wakes and hurries over, and I brace myself. She leans over and looks down at Rose\u0027s face. And then suddenly, her face crumples into tears. She starts hysterically crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ROSE!\" she wails. She wraps her arms around her, holding her tight. She sobs and sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen and Logan sit up and look over, grave expressions on their faces. I see Logan wipe away a tear then turn, not wanting me to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen, though, lets the tears fall freely from his face. I feel the wet on my cheeks, and realize I\u0027m still crying, too. But, strangely, I also feel a sense of peace. My dream had been so real, so vivid - I feel like it really happened, that Rose was actually with me. I feel that she really said goodbye, and that she\u0027s in a peaceful place now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dreamt of her,\" I say to Bree, trying to console her. \"I saw her. She was happy. And smiling. She\u0027s in a good place now. She\u0027s happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\" Bree asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She told me. She\u0027s happy. She loves you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis seems to make Bree feel better. Her crying slows, and she gently pulls back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look outside, and realize we\u0027ll never be able to bury Rose in this weather. Even with this warmer day, the ground, I\u0027m sure, will be frozen solid. It will have to be a river burial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figure that the sooner we do it the better. We have to move on. We need to move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to help carry her?\" I ask Bree, wanting to involve her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand, grab Rose\u0027s arms, and let Bree take her legs. Together, we walk her out of the cave. Ben and Logan and Penelope follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk out into the soft snow, up to my calves, into the shining light, and I am momentarily blinded. It is like a summer day. Birds are chirping, it is probably twenty degrees warmer, and much of the snow has melted. The storm has passed. It is as if it never was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope gets lost in the thick snow, and Logan reaches down and lifts her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we bringing her?\" Bree asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t bury her,\" I say. \"The ground is frozen, and we don\u0027t have any shovels. We\u0027ll have to bury her in the river. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t want to put her in the water,\" Bree says, her face crumpling up as she begins to cry again. \"I don\u0027t want her to be eaten by fish. I want to bury her here, on this island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan, Ben and I all exchange a worried look. I don\u0027t know what to say. I understand how she feels. And I don\u0027t want to make things even worse for her. Then again, it\u0027s just not practical. But knowing Bree, she won\u0027t give in. I need to find an alternate solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look out at the river, and am struck with an idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the ice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBree turns and looks out at the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See those huge floating chunks of ice? What if we place Rose on one of those? Let it carry her downriver? She will float away, carried on the ice. Like an angel, floating away. Eventually the ice will melt, and the river will take her. But not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brace myself, hoping Bree will agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my great relief, slowly, she nods back in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all walk down to the water\u0027s edge, and as we get close, I watch and wait for one of the occasional large blocks of ice to float down river. They are far and few between, but occasionally, they do come. One floats by, but it is a good fifteen feet out in the water - there\u0027s no way I can reach it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe wait and wait, and finally, one huge block of ice, about six feet long, breaks off from the others and drifts our way, as if being led by a magical current. It is a couple of feet out in the water, and just as I\u0027m trying to figure out how I\u0027m going to wade out and get it while holding Rose, suddenly Ben and Logan take action. They hurry past me, wading out into the water, each grabbing one end of it. Their boots get soaked and I\u0027m sure the river is freezing, but they bear it stoically. It is nice to see them working together for a change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pull the ice close to shore, and together, we all set Rose down on it. She looks like an angel lying on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we hold the ice, Bree stands over her, looking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Rose,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope barks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, after several minutes of silence, Bree steps back. The four of us gently push the huge block out into the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all stand on shore and watch as the block of ice catches in the current and begins to float away, down river, Rose\u0027s tiny body spread out on it. I was right: she does look like an angel, floating there amidst all that white. I hope that wherever she\u0027s going, she\u0027s going to a place of peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan is already eyeing our boat. He goes over to it, and starts scooping the snow out, preparing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should go now,\" he says, getting the snow out with both hands, wasting no time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to leave, too,\" Bree says. \"I hate this place. I never want to come back here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go where exactly?\" Ben asks. I\u0027m surprised. It\u0027s the first time he\u0027s asked about any of our plans, or shown any concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you care?\" Logan snaps. \"You haven\u0027t said anything before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m saying something now,\" Ben says. I can feel the tension between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re heading north,\" Logan answers. \"Like we always have. To Canada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are four of us here,\" Ben says. \"And I don\u0027t want to go to Canada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan looks at him, dumbfounded. I am shocked, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you said, there are four of us,\" Logan says. \"That means majority rules. I want to leave, and so does Bree. That\u0027s two of us. Brooke?\" he asks, looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, now that he asks me, I\u0027m not so sure. A part of me feels that we have a good thing going on this little island. It\u0027s hard to get to, hard to be ambushed. We have a cave, shelter from the wind and elements. A part of me wonders if we can live here. It would be boring, but safe, protected. When we run out of food, we could take the boat to shore and hunt. Capture food, bring it back here. And maybe we could farm something here in the summer. And fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath, not wanting to cause a rift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s out there,\" I say. \"It might be safer to continue north. But it might be more dangerous. Personally, I think it might be safest to just stay here. I don\u0027t see why we should be in such a rush to leave. I don\u0027t see how the slaverunners can find us here. If you\u0027re worried about their spotting the boat, we can drag it ashore, hide it in the trees. I think it can get a lot worse for us out there. I vote we stay put.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan looks blindsided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous,\" he says. \"We\u0027ll be out of food in days. Maybe we can find more, maybe survive here a few weeks. Then what? The slaverunners are still after us. And this is just a measly strip of land. What if there\u0027s a city out there? A real city, that has everything we need to live forever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have everything we need right here,\" I say. \"Food. Shelter. Safety. What more do we need?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan shakes his head. \"Like I said, majority rules. I vote to leave. So does Bree. You vote to stay. Ben?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I vote to leave, too,\" Ben says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m surprised by this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan smiles. \"There you have it,\" Logan says. \"We\u0027re leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I vote to head south,\" Ben adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"South?\" Logan asks. \"You crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go back to my old house,\" Ben says. \"In the mountains. I want to wait there for my little brother. He might come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart falls to hear this. Poor Ben, clinging to his fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no way we\u0027re going back there,\" Logan says. \"You had your chance. You should\u0027ve said something before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what you want,\" Ben says. \"I\u0027m going back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four us stand there, at a standstill. There is no majority vote here. All of us are torn, all wanting something else, none giving an inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a cracking noise pierces the air. A tree branch falls right near us, and it takes me a moment to figure it out. The noise comes again, and another branch falls, and that\u0027s when I realize: it was a gunshot. We are being fired upon. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/arena-two/page-9.html","bookId":1692,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:56 AM"}
