A couple of days later, I was almost back to full physical fitness, except for my headaches and growing pains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was doing press-ups on the floor of my bedroom, working off some of my excess energy, when I heard Debbie squeal downstairs. I stopped instantly and shared a worried look with Harkat, who was standing guard by the door. I hurried to his side and removed one of the earplugs I was wearing to block out the worst of the street noises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should we go down?\" Harkat asked, opening the door a crack. We could hear Debbie babbling excitedly, and as we listened, Alice joined her and also began to talk very quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think anything\u0027s wrong,\" I said, frowning. \"They seem happy, as if an old friend has?\" I stopped and slapped my forehead. Harkat laughed, then both of us said at exactly the same time, \"Vancha!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrowing the door wide open, we barged down the stairs and found Debbie and Alice chatting with a burly, red-skinned, green-haired man, dressed in purple animal hides and no shoes, with belts of sharp throwing stars - shurikens - looped around his torso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vancha!\" I shouted happily, clutching his arms and squeezing tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is good to see you again, Sire,\" Vancha said with surprising politeness. Then he burst into a grin and hugged me tight. \"Darren!\" he boomed. \"I\u0027ve missed you!\" Turning to Harkat, he laughed. \"I missed you too, ugly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look who\u0027s talking!\" Harkat grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s great to see you both, but of course I\u0027m most pleased to see the ladies,\" Vancha said, releasing me and winking at Debbie and Alice. \"Female beauty\u0027s what we hot-blooded men live for, aye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a born flatterer,\" Alice sniffed. \"I bet he says that to every woman he meets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally,\" Vancha murmured, \"because all women are beautiful, in one way or another. But you\u0027re more beautiful than most, my dear - an angel of the night!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice snorted with contempt, but there was a strange little smile playing at the corners of her lips. Vancha looped his arms around Debbie and Alice and guided us into the living room, as though this was his house and we were the guests. Sitting down, making himself comfortable, he told Debbie to go fetch some food. She told him - in no uncertain terms - that he could do his own fetching while he was here, and he laughed with delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was refreshing to see that the War of the Scars hadn\u0027t changed Vancha March. He was as loud and lively as ever. He filled us in on his recent movements, the countries he\u0027d explored, the vampaneze and vampets he\u0027d killed, making it sound like a big, exciting adventure, free from all consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I heard that Leonard was here, I came as quickly as I could,\" Vancha concluded. \"I flitted without rest. I haven\u0027t missed him, have I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"We haven\u0027t heard from him since the night he almost killed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what does your heart tell you?\" Vancha asked, his large eyes weighing heavy upon me, his small mouth closed in a tight, expectant line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s here,\" I said softly. \"He\u0027s waiting for me - forus . I think this is where Mr Tiny\u0027s prophecy will be tested. We\u0027ll face him on these streets - or beneath - and we\u0027ll kill him or he\u0027ll kill us. And that will be the end of the War of the Scars. Except?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Vancha asked when I didn\u0027t continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was supposed to be one final encounter. Four times our path was due to cross with his. When he had me at his mercy recently, that was the fourth time, but we\u0027re both still alive. Maybe Mr Tiny got it wrong. Maybe his prophecy doesn\u0027t hold true any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha mulled that one over. \"Perhaps you have a point,\" he said uncertainly. \"But as much as I despise Des Tiny, I have to admit he doesn\u0027t make many mistakes when it comes to prophecies - in fact none that I\u0027ve heard of. He told youwe would have four chances to kill Leonard, aye?\" I nodded. \"Then maybe we both have to be there. Perhaps your solo encounter doesn\u0027t count.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would have counted if he\u0027d killed me,\" I grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he didn\u0027t,\" Vancha said. \"Maybe he couldn\u0027t. Perhaps it simply wasn\u0027t his destiny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re right, that means we\u0027re going to run into him again,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Vancha said. \"A fight to the death. Except if he wins, he won\u0027t kill both of us. Evanna said one of us would survive if we lost.\" Evanna was a witch, the daughter of Mr Tiny. I\u0027d almost forgotten that part of the prophecy. If Steve won, he\u0027d leave one of us alive, to witness the downfall of the clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long, troubled silence as we thought about the prophecy and the dangers we faced. Vancha broke it by clapping loudly. \"Enough of the doom and gloom! What about you two?\" He nodded at Harkat and me. \"How did your quest go? Do we know who Harkat used to be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Harkat said. He glanced at Debbie and Alice. \"I don\u0027t wish to be rude, but could you? leave us alone for a while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is thismen\u0027s talk?\" Alice asked mockingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Harkat chuckled. \"It\u0027sPrince\u0027s talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be upstairs,\" Debbie said. \"Call us when you\u0027re ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha stood and bowed as the ladies were leaving. When he sat again, his expression was curious. \"Why the secrecy?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about who I was,\" Harkat said, \"and where? we learnt the truth. We don\u0027t think we should discuss it? in front of anybody except a Prince.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Intriguing,\" Vancha said, leaning forward eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe gave Vancha a quick rundown of our quest through the wastelands, the creatures we\u0027d battled, meeting Evanna, the mad sailor - Spits Abrams - and the dragons. He said nothing, but listened enthralled. When we told him about pulling Kurda Smahlt out of the Lake of Souls, Vancha\u0027s jaw dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it can\u0027t be!\" he protested. \"Harkat was alive before Kurda died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr Tiny can move through time,\" I said. \"He created Harkat from Kurda\u0027s remains, then took him into the past, so that he could serve as my protector.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha blinked slowly. Then his features clouded over with rage - and fear. \"Damn that Desmond Tiny! I always knew he was powerful, but to be able to meddle with time itself? What manner of diabolical beast is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a rhetorical question, so we didn\u0027t attempt to answer it. Instead we finished by telling him how Kurda had chosen to sacrifice himself - he and Harkat shared a soul, so only one of them could live at any given time - leaving us free to return to the present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thepresent ?\" Vancha snapped. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarkat told him about our theory - that the wasteworld was the future. When he heard that, Vancha trembled as though a cold wind had sliced through him. \"I never thought the War of the Scars could be that crucial,\" he said softly. \"I knew our future was at stake, but I never dreamt we could drag humanity down with us.\" He shook his head and turned away, muttering, \"I need to think about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarkat and I said nothing while Vancha deliberated. Minutes passed. A quarter of an hour. Half an hour. Finally he heaved a large sigh and turned to face us. \"These are grim tidings,\" he said. \"But perhaps not as grim as they seem. From what you\u0027ve told me, I believe that Tiny did take you into the future - but I also believe he wouldn\u0027t have done so without good reason. He might have been simply mocking you, but it might also have been a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That damned future must be what we face if we lose the War of the Scars. Steve Leonard is the sort who\u0027d level the world and bring it to ruin. But if we win, we can prevent that. When Tiny came to Vampire Mountain, he told us there were two possible futures, didn\u0027t he? One where the vampaneze win the war, and one where the vampires win. I think Tiny gave you a glimpse of the former future to drive home the point that wehave to win this war. It\u0027s not just ourselves we\u0027re fighting for - it\u0027s the entire world. The wasteworld is one future - I\u0027m sure the world where we\u0027ve won is completely different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes sense,\" Harkat agreed. \"If both futures currently exist? he might have been able to choose which? to take us to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I sighed, unconvinced. I was thinking again about the vision I\u0027d had shortly after we\u0027d first met Evanna, when Harkat had been plagued by nightmares. Evanna helped me put a stop to them, by sending me into his dreams. In the dream, I\u0027d faced a being of immense power - the Lord of the Shadows. Evanna told me this master of evil was part of the future, and the road there was paved with dead souls. She\u0027d also told me that could be one of two people - Steve Leopard orme .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe uncertainties came rushing back. I was unable to share Vancha and Harkat\u0027s view that one future was bright and cheery where the other was dark and miserable. I felt we were heading for big-scale trouble, whichever way the War of the Scars swung. But I kept my opinions to myself - I didn\u0027t want to come across as a prophetof doom. \"So!\" Vancha laughed, startling me out of my dark thoughts. \"We just have to make sure we kill Steve Leonard, aye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" I said, grinning sickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about me?\" Harkat asked. \"Does it alter your opinion of me? now that you know I was once a vampire traitor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Vancha said. \"I never liked you much anyway.\" He spat into his right palm, ran the spit through his hair, then winked to show he was joking. \"Seriously, you were right not to broadcast the news. We\u0027ll keep it to ourselves. I always believed that although Kurda acted stupidly, he acted with the best interests of the clan at heart. But there are many who don\u0027t share that view. If they knew the truth about you, it might divide them. Internal argument is the last thing we need. That\u0027d be playing straight into the hands of the vampaneze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for who Harkat is now?\" Vancha studied the Little Person. \"I know you and trust you. I believe you\u0027ve learnt from Kurda\u0027s faults. You won\u0027t betray us again, will you, Harkat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Harkat said softly. \"But I\u0027m still in favour of a treaty? between the two clans. If I can help bring that about through peaceful? means, by talking, I will. This War of the Scars is destroying? both families of the night, and it threatens to destroy? even more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you recognize the need to fight?\" Vancha said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I recognize the need to kill Steve? Leonard,\" Harkat said. \"After that, I\u0027ll push for peace? if I can. But openly - no plotting or intrigue? this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha considered that in silence, then shrugged. \"So be it. I\u0027ve nothing personal against the vampaneze. If we kill Leonard and they agree to a truce, I\u0027m all for it. Now,\" he continued, scratching his chin, \"where do you think Leonard\u0027s holed up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably somewhere deep underground,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think he\u0027s preparing a grand-scale trap, like before?\" Vancha asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Harkat said. \"Vampaneze have been active here. That\u0027s why Debbie and Alice came. But if there were dozens of them, like? the last time, the death count would be higher. I don\u0027t think Steve has as many? vampaneze with him as when we faced him? in the Cavern of Retribution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you\u0027re right,\" Vancha said. He glanced at me sideways. \"How did my brother look?\" Vancha and Gannen Harst were estranged brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tired,\" I said. \"Strained. Unhappy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not hard to imagine why,\" Vancha grunted. \"I\u0027ll never understand why Gannen and the others follow a maniac like Leonard. The vampaneze were content the way they were. They didn\u0027t seek to crush the vampires or provoke a war. It makes no sense for them to flock to that demon and pledge themselves to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s part of Mr Tiny\u0027s prophecy,\" Harkat said. \"As Kurda, I spent much time with? the vampaneze, researching their ways. You know about their Coffin of Fire. When a person lies within, it fills? with flames. All normal people die in it. Only the Lord of the Vampaneze? can survive. Mr Tiny told the vampaneze that if they didn\u0027t? obey that person and do all that he commanded, they\u0027d? be wiped from the face of the earth. Most of the vampaneze fight to preserve themselves? not to destroy the vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha nodded slowly. \"Then they\u0027re motivated by fear for their lives, not hatred of us. I understand now. . After all, isn\u0027t that why we\u0027re fighting too - to save ourselves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both fighting for the same reason,\" Harkat chuckled humourlessly. \"Both terrified of the? same thing. Of course, if neither side fought? both would be safe. Mr Tiny is playing the creatures of the night? for fools, and we\u0027re helping him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Vancha grunted disgustedly. \"But there\u0027s no use moaning about how we got ourselves into this sorry state. The fact is, we fight because we must.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha stood and stretched. There were dark rims around his eyes. He looked like a man who hadn\u0027t slept properly for a very long time. The last two years must have been tough for him. Although he hadn\u0027t mentioned Mr Crepsley, I was sure the dead vampire was never far from his thoughts. Vancha, like I, probably felt a certain amount of guilt - the two of us had given Mr Crepsley the go-ahead to face the Vampaneze Lord. If either of us had taken his place, he\u0027d be alive now. It looked to me like Vancha had been pushing himself to his limits in his hunt to find the Lord of the Vampaneze - and was rapidly nearing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should rest, Sire,\" I said. \"If you flitted all the way here, you must be exhausted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll rest when Leonard is dead,\" Vancha grunted. \"Or myself,\" he added softly, under his breath. I don\u0027t think he realized he\u0027d spoken aloud. \"Now!\" Vancha said, raising his voice. \"Enough self-pity and misery. We\u0027re here and Leonard\u0027s here - it doesn\u0027t take a genius to see that an old-fashioned scrap to the death\u0027s on the agenda. The question is, do we wait for him to come to us, or do we seize the initiative and go looking for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wouldn\u0027t know where? to look,\" Harkat said. \"He could be anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we look everywhere,\" Vancha grinned. \"But where do we start? Darren?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His son,\" I said immediately. \"Darius is an unusual name. There can\u0027t be too many of them. We ask around, find out where he lives, track Steve through him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use the son to get to the father,\" Vancha hummed. \"Ignoble, but probably the best way.\" He paused. \"The boy worries me. Leonard\u0027s a nasty piece of work, a formidable foe. But if his son has the same evil blood, and has been trained in Leonard\u0027s wicked ways since birth, he could be even worse!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree,\" I said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you kill a child, Darren?\" Vancha asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said, unable to meet his eyes. \"I don\u0027t think so. Hopefully it won\u0027t come to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no good hoping,\" Harkat objected. \"Going after the boy is wrong. Just because Steve has no morals doesn\u0027t? mean we should act like savages too. Children should be kept out? of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s your suggestion?\" Vancha asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should return to the? Cirque Du Freak,\" Harkat said. \"Hibernius might be able to tell us more? about what we should do. Even if he\u0027s unable to help, Steve knows? where the Cirque is camped. He\u0027ll find us there. We can wait for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the idea of being a sitting target,\" Vancha growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d rather chase children?\" Harkat countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha stiffened, then relaxed. \"Perhaps no-ears has a point,\" he said. \"It can certainly do no harm to ask Hibernius for his opinion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" I said. \"But we\u0027ll wait for night - my eyes can\u0027t take the sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s why your ears and nose are stuffed!\" Vancha laughed. \"The purge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It struck a couple of days ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you be able to pull your weight,\" Vancha asked directly, \"or should we wait for it to pass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do my best,\" I said. \"I can\u0027t make any guarantees, but I think I\u0027ll be OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well.\" Vancha nodded at the ceiling. \"What about the ladies? Do we tell them what we\u0027re up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all of it,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll take them to the Cirque Du Freak and tell them we\u0027re hunting Steve. But let\u0027s not mention Darius - Debbie wouldn\u0027t think much of our plan to use a child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarkat snorted but said nothing. After that we called Debbie and Alice down and spent a peaceful afternoon eating, drinking and talking, swapping tales, laughing, relaxing. I noticed Vancha glancing around during quiet moments, as though looking for somebody. I dismissed it at the time, but I now know who he was looking for ?death. Of us all, only Vancha sensed death in the room that day, its eternal gaze passing from one of us to the other, watching? waiting? choosing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-of-the-shadows-the-saga-of-darren-shan-11/page-16.html","bookId":2447,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:20:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:20:12 PM"}
