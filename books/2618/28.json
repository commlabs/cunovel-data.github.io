So this was what lawyer vampires did while they were up at night. It was tough going, but I had faith in myself. I’d translated badly written doctor’s notes involving medication names that sounded like porn stars involved in Nigerian e-mail scams. I could manage this. I read through to the very end, and when I reached it, he was asleep, his chin bowed to touch his chest, as though he was a run-down toy. I shook the pages lightly for his attention and he started back awake. “How will you help me, though?” I asked. “Right now, you’re counting on her to keep her word—if she doesn’t, I die. If she does, I’m indebted to you. What do I get from you out of all this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I, and my assistant, will make inquiries after your friend through vampire channels.” He waved two fingers in the air, and the woman nodded, sending a long lock of red hair spilling into her lap. “Sike speaks for me during the day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked from him to her and back again. “So I’m supposed to trust that you’ll be doing … something? Asking … questions?” I folded the papers together in my lap. “Really? That’s your plan? I’m signing my life away for this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. “I do have connections, Miss Spence. Connections that you lack. It is possible that I will find her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Possible,” I repeated. The sheaf of papers that I held felt suddenly very heavy, like the low pan of a weighing scale. Which was worse? Being indebted to a vampire for eternity, or death by execution?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re worth slightly more alive to me as a legal blood cow than you are dead,” he followed up. “Worth making an effort for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t trust him further than I could throw the polished marble paperweight at the end of his desk. But what was losing some blood? I’d make more. I liked living. I wasn’t very good at it so far, but that didn’t mean I wanted to stop any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slammed the papers on top of his desk, and signed them with my charting pen before I could change my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A woman of action. I can appreciate that.” Geoffrey Weatherton, Esquire, waited patiently for me to finish the triplicate forms, then took them politely away. He scanned over them, nodding to himself, before looking again at me. “Now, Miss Spence, we are legally bonded.” He rocked back into his chair. “Tell me everything, again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt already appeared as though Geoffrey’s attentions were periodically fading, drowsing only for him to shake himself awake again. But I inhaled and retold the story from the beginning, from my first moments meeting and caring for Mr. November—Yuri, Yuri—and what had then followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It does sound dire for you,” Geoffrey said when I’d finished my sad tale. He was braced against his elbows on the desk, his hands sympathetically interwoven out in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d included the parts of my story up until Anna’s kidnapping. “Where did they take her? And why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Zverskiye’s motivations are ever unknown to us. One of the reasons they and we disagree so often.” He leaned back thoughtfully in his chair. “An ancient blood feud? A well-organized pornography ring? You said you saw the vampire who witnessed the murder there again—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind blanked a bit at this. Murder? I was … a murderer? It was hard to hear it phrased like that, when the deathee in question had exploded into dust and flame. But—I looked down at my hands, and remembered Lady Macbeth. Sure I’d washed my hands a hundred times with hand sanitizer since that night, but the facts remained the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happens if I give myself up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you’ll be drawn and blooded. And when they’re done with your flesh, they’ll continue to keep your soul. At that time, according to the papers you just signed, I will merely inherit your couch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My soul?” I blinked. I’d gone to church plenty of times in my youth, under parental duress, but I’d never gone willingly on my own. “You’re kidding, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They did send a Husker after you, did they not? What did you think he was there for?” Geoffrey eyed me sorrowfully, and his gaze looked old. I felt distant, like not only was I looking across his desk at him, but across a gulf of time between us too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But … really? My soul?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Energy is currency, Miss Spence, and entropy rules the day. It’s called psychophagy, and it is, quite literally, a fate worse than death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoul … eating? No way. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Souls are even more potent than blood, Miss Spence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why aren’t they out killing people all the time for them?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can get blood from killing people, yes. But souls? Souls have to be earned.” Geoffrey hunched forward, as if pulling the strength to stay awake from somewhere deep inside himself. “A soul has power only in its transition states, much like you might remember from electrons in chemistry. A good soul that stays good, or a bad soul that stays bad—those maintain their levels, dead or alive. They are predestined, if you will, and neither change the balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But for a good soul to become bad—such a change lets off a quick release of energy.” He snapped his fingers. “Like a photon in motion releases light. There are many eager to harvest these rare events. How often does a human manage to kill a vampire, and thus legally indebt their energy that way? Much less a human who was good to begin with? Not very often at all, Miss Spence. If you weren’t up to die,” he said, smiling at me grimly, “you should be very proud of yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmall consolation. “So my soul is really what is up for trial?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Geoffrey’s eyes closed for a long second, then fluttered open again. “I imagine you’ve made some plans to do a little investigating of your own? You don’t seem like the type to wait patiently at home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flushed. “I did make some plans. I have a friend who’ll help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I must advise you to be careful—technically you’re already on trial, and vampire courts don’t believe in innocent until proven guilty. Dying now could leave you in a difficult state.” His lips pursed in disapproval. “You shouldn’t be dragging other mortals into this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a zombie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response, I watched the ropy tendons of Geoffrey’s hands knot and bunch. His face gave nothing away, but it took a moment for his hands to still. “Miss Spence, I tell you this as your legal representative. I am a wolf who is a wolf. Not a wolf who wears sheep’s clothing. Trust that he has his own reasons for helping you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shoulders sank two inches. “I have to do something,” I protested. I wanted to think that Ti had only my best interests at heart. If zombies even had hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand.” He reached into his breast pocket and pulled out a business card. “Call if you find out anything before I do. Sike will answer if I cannot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if you don’t call me?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I will see you at the trial.” He nodded curtly, stood, and walked to the gloom at the back of his office. Momentarily, I heard a closing door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSike stood. She walked around a file cabinet, and I heard pouring water before she reemerged with a paper cup in hand. “Water?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took it from her. “You’re his daytimer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I prefer dayspeaker, but yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t look like a daytimer.” Her top showed her neck, and I couldn’t see even one scar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrowed at my purposeful use of the wrong name. “I do have my career to think of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Won’t it be hard to score that Sports Illustrated cover once you’re a vampire?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll just have to earn it before then, I suppose.” She smiled pleasantly at me, but it was all lip—her cheeks didn’t move, and her eyes didn’t twinkle. Because we both knew the truth. She’d never get to go to Europe or New York to make it big—unless for some reason that was what the Rose Throne wanted her to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like I’d never get to leave Y4. I set my water down without touching it. “I’m sorry—I’ve gotta get some sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep in touch,” she said, with a tone of voice that let me know she wished for nothing less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove straight home and didn’t check my messages till I was crawling into bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Edie—my friend’ll help. Meet me at the Westpark Shopping Center, off of the 85, near the north entrance, at three. Bring that shirt, okay? Sleep tight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saved Ti’s number on my phone, then set it on my nightstand. Asher’s phone number had migrated to be beside it. I crumpled his number up and threw it across the room for Minnie to use as a cat toy. The outpatient clinic hadn’t called back with the results of my tests yet; things were probably fine. Everything was probably fine. Anna was probably fine wherever she was being tortured now. Mr. Galeman was probably fine, post multiple blood transfusions. Sike was probably fine with my pathetic attempts to piss her off out of jealousy, and Geoffrey was probably fine with the fact that I had a zombie on my side, who was himself probably fine as long as eventually we went on a date, where I would again probably be fine as long as he didn’t want to eat my brains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a good thing I was exhausted, or I never would have gotten to sleep with so much uncertainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hardly ever saw anyone from inside the hospital outside of it, not even in the parking lot. I wanted to be on time for this meeting at least, and since no Shadows had risen up to delay me when I’d gone through the tunnel, apparently I’d beaten everyone else there. I sat in my parked car, feeling naked and exposed, my Chevy idling to keep the heater running, just us chickens sitting around in the middle of the gray asphalt and dirty snow. My badge was still on, like I’d promised the Shadows it would be, underneath all my clothes, its plastic edges poking against my breasts. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nightshifted-edie-spence-1/page-28.html","bookId":2618,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:34 PM"}
