The medicine man of his tribe had never seen a gun shot before. So he and all the other Indians believed I was a god of some sort and freed the young lady when I commanded it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Excuse me?’ I interrupted. ‘Medicine man? Tribe? I thought you were talking about Indians that live in India, not the kind that live in America. Only those have medicine men, or tribes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, really?’ The lieutenant shrugged. ‘Well, maybe he was on holiday in India. These savages are strange people, you know?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I can think of some that are even stranger,’ I muttered, but he either didn’t hear it or wasn’t very well-versed in sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, he didn’t start telling any adventure stories again. Well, he had talked for the last half hour pretty much non-stop. Maybe it was time I contributed something to the conversation. But what could I say apart from, ‘You may have a square jaw and a whitewashed smile, but you are the most odious man I ever met. Get the hell away from me right now, because I never ever wish to see you again. And by the way, I don\u0027t like you, and you smell funny.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face of doom, otherwise known as the face of my aunt, appeared in front of my inner eye, staring at me ferociously. Oh well, I guess I could at least make a tiny effort to be civil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Err… you seem to have led a very exciting life so far. Rescuing ladies… shooting Indians… must be fun. I mean the rescuing of ladies, not the other part.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed like a wise, worldly man talking to a silly student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Actually, the shooting is the part that is more fun. The ladies get tiresome over time. They are always so overwhelmed by thankfulness. So many ladies have shown interest in me that I have really grown tired of what is called the fair sex.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh well, if that is so, you’re probably very tired of my society,’ I jumped at the opportunity. ‘I should leave you immediately.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘On the contrary.’ Shaking his head, he turned to me with an arrogant grin on his face. ‘It is that fact that made me come to you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re so unlike the other ladies,’ he continued. ‘Other ladies sigh and whimper to get a man’s attention. You on the other hand - you are feisty! You insult me and push me back - but I’ve figured you out! It’s your way of saying you’re attracted to a man.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the…!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s no great surprise, I suppose.’ He took a step closer to me, his eyes gleaming with some dark emotion that made me shiver all over. I remembered my earlier thoughts about what could possibly happen on a walk in the park, and the unwelcome idea occurred to me that I might be about to find out first hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t like the expression on his face, not at all. He no longer looked like the pleasant, if slightly arrogant, young man of a few minutes ago. He now looked like a very, very nasty arrogant young man. And his eyes were fixed on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperately I looked around for anybody, but we were standing hidden behind a clump of trees. No help was in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’ve had no proper upbringing, aren’t even a proper lady,’ he was saying. ‘But that actually could make you quite fun, you know? Ladies are very restrained, but I’m sure you would be more open to… amusement.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking another step forward, he leaned towards me. I didn’t even know where it came from. My hand just to seem to appear out of thin air and make contact with his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlap!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t you dare touch me!’ I snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought maybe he would be angry. Or he would back off. Instead, he laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s what I’m talking about,’ he chuckled, his eyes dancing. ‘It’s really been getting annoying, so many girls throwing themselves at me because of my good looks and my position as an officer. You’re different. A challenge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’ll give you a challenge if you don\u0027t back off!’ I threatened, raising my hand again. Taking a leisurely step backwards, he cocked his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Plus, you’re from a good family. Most of those stuck-up mothers at Sir Philip’s ball wouldn’t have let a poor soldier like myself near one of their daughters. But your aunt… I think she’d be happy if she could convince a beggar to take you. If I made you mine, she’d be delighted - and so would I. Granted, you don\u0027t have money, and neither does your family, so the dowry won’t be worth marrying for, but in the military a good name is more often of greater worth. You have that, so you’ll suit me admirably. The only thing that remains is for me to make it official.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Official? What are you talking about?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why, marrying you of course.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyeballs almost dropped out of my head. ‘Marriage? I’m not getting married to anybody! And most certainly not to you!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sneered. ‘What? You’d prefer a covert thing between us? I wondered whether that might be more your style.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovert thing? What kind of covert thing? The glint in his eyes told he was talking about something dark, something far less innocent than my little sister’s secret meetings in the back garden. I had no idea what exactly and, honestly, I didn’t want to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But I’m afraid I can’t help you there,’ he continued. ‘I’m a gentleman and unfortunately have to behave as such. I shall have to wait until we are married before I can start taming you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Go now,’ I said, making my voice icy in my best imitation of Rikkard Ambrose. ‘Right now! Or I will scream until the entire city of London comes running!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated - then shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Very well, just as you like.’ The bastard had the audacity to wink at me! ‘But I will get you, make no mistake. And you know you’ll enjoy it when I do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered whether there were smaller, feminine versions of that handy cane-sword that Mr Ambrose had used the other day. If so, I was going to buy myself one with my very first pay cheque. Occasions like this required a weapon more effective than a parasol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who do you think you are?’ I hissed at him. ‘You can’t just say such things to me! Who the hell do you think you are?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I?’ He raised an arrogant eyebrow. ‘I am your suitor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your suitor. I want you, and I’m going to get you one way or another.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-66.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:33 PM"}
