His kindness touched her, as did his warm smile. She smiled back at him, and once more, he seemed stunned by her expression. He did grin back though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll go get us a room,” he said, and leaped out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slammed shut just as she spoke. He jogged off toward the front office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking, she sat back in the bucket seat and furrowed her brow. “Oh, shit.” Reflecting back on their conversation, she realized he had misunderstood her. She had inadvertently picked up Pete. Covering her face with her hands, she let out a little laugh. “Oh, God.” Giggling, she ran a hand through her hair and looked out toward the office. Pete\u0027s jolly little walk and wave made her laugh once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering how gawdawful this night had started and kept going, she was surprised to feel any levity at all. He made her feel real again. The nightmare at the college seemed like a dim memory. The showdown with her father was a fading bad taste in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePropping her feet up on the dashboard, she leaned back in the chair and forced herself to relax. Okay, she was a vampire. A strong one at that. She could do things she never dreamed. But she was still Amaliya Vezorak, from the city of Spooner deep in the wilds of East Texas. Despite it all, she was still wearing her shitkickers, her beat-up jeans, and she was still wanting her Daddy to love her and her Momma to be alive. Whatever had changed inside of her had not taken that away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing her eyes, she silently considered whether or not to sleep with Pete. She would have to toss him out before the sun came up. She wasn\u0027t sure how that was all going to work yet. But she felt good and alive in this moment despite everything and she didn\u0027t want it to fade. A little sex might do her good. Make her feel alive and wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealizing she wasn\u0027t breathing again, she put her hand against her chest to feel a very slow thud. Frowning a little, she waited for the next beat and her brow furrowed even more as it seemed to take far too long to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, I got the room, but its Mr. Rusk in the office. So, I\u0027ll drive up as close as I can to the room and you sneak in super fast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya laughed. “You\u0027re still afraid of our Sunday School teacher?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Pete answered and grinned. “Aren\u0027t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, yeah. He was a scary old coot! But won\u0027t he think its weird you\u0027re staying here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told him that I\u0027m tired of sleeping on an air mattress at my sister\u0027s house while the house is being built,” Pete said with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re good at this,” she said with playfully-narrowed eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no idea,” he answered, kissing her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled against the kiss, pushing him back. “Let\u0027s go for it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith glee, they jumped out of the car and ran toward the rooms at the far end of the motel. Amaliya almost overshot the room, but Pete grabbed her wrist and yanked her against him. He swiped the card and shoved the door open with so much gusto he almost fell in. Tripping over his feet, Amaliya stumbled into the hotel room and managed to land on the edge of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re such a dork,” she chided with a wicked smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, yeah, I am,” he answered, and shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, she could have no idea of how alluring she was with her luminous blue-gray eyes, flushed cheeks, and red lips. Her change had altered her in ways she could not know. Her skin was very smooth and almost translucent. Her black hair looked silky against the rough fabric of her tank top and it glistened like raven\u0027s feathers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, wow,” Pete whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no idea how long I\u0027ve been waiting for this,” he breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” She narrowed her eyes at him. “What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve had such a crush on you since we were kids.” Trembling a little, he drew near her. Gentle, roughened fingers caressed her cheek. She leaned into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you didn\u0027t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I did. A terrible crush.” Sitting next to her, he traced the lines of her face with quivering fingertips. His soft expression and strong body caused a little shiver in her own. Deep inside of her, a great need was born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you still?” she asked, kissing his lips ever so gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he breathed, kissing her deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, yes,” she whispered into his hair, moaning as he pushed harder into her. She moved her hips against his, grabbing his dark, curly hair, pulling his face against her neck. He was big and heavy and wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of their lovemaking filled her ears. She loved the sound of his gasps, his moans, was enthralled by his gentle touch and brutal thrusts. She gasped and moaned with each delightful thrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were on their third bout of lovemaking on the torn-apart queen-size bed. They had fallen onto the floor at one point and managed to keep going. She now believed him when he said he had wanted her all those years. He was like a man possessed and not able to get enough of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God,” he murmured against her collarbone, then dragged his mouth down to her right breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a wild little laugh, she arched up to him and gasped when he bit her hard, pierced nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragging her off the bed, he pulled her close to him, her legs around his waist as he kissed her hungrily. She teased him by pulling back from him and licking his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m building the house for you,” he whispered, and managed to grab her hair and pull her close to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” She shivered as he licked up her neck, his tongue playing with one of her silver earrings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am building the house for you, waiting for you to come back,” Pete whispered. He turned and pushed her against the wall, sliding his cock deeper into her. “Waiting for you to come back and see if ain’t all bad out here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting her bottom lip, she dug her nails into his shoulders as she came closer to climax. Lost in the moment, she urged him to shove harder, rocking him with her legs, and gasping as he lightly bit her throat. Lost in the frenzy of the moment, she couldn\u0027t fully fathom his words as he murmured them against her cheek. It wasn\u0027t until he collapsed against her, coming hard inside of her cool body, that she realized he had been whispering that he loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay here,” he\u0027s voice said, his voice a husky purr in her ear. “Something went bad at the school. I know it. But stay here. I\u0027ll buy you a big ol\u0027 pink canopy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands slid over his cheeks and stroked the softness of his goatee. Gazing into his eyes through the darkness, she could see his need for her to say yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a good job. The house will be done soon. We\u0027ll not deal with your family bullshit and have a good life. Amal, I waited for a whole year for you to come back here and see that I can give you a good life. I should have spoke up before you left, but I could see that if you didn\u0027t go, you\u0027d hate me forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is so unexpected,” she said. “I never knew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone, but you knew,” he laughed, and stroked her skin. “I almost drove down to see if you would consider it when you got out of school. I don\u0027t care if you got piercings on your nipples or the one down there. Your tattoos are pretty. I just want you here, Amal. And when I saw you tonight, I knew I had to say something now or lose you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCupping his face in her hands, she stared into his lovely eyes and wondered how she had never seen it before. A hard and terrible pang of regret sliced through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensing that something was changing between them quickly, Pete kissed her lips, then her forehead. Holding her tight, he whispered, “Say yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can\u0027t.” Her voice was agony, tears sprang to her eyes. If only this had happened last weekend, before the date from hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t!” She tried to push him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Amal! You can stay. Look at us! We\u0027re good together. Damn, that was the best sex I\u0027ve ever had. And you feel so good even if your skin is so cold and your body...your face...your eyes...Amal, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling hard, she pushed at him again, but he held her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that people are rough on you, but I think you\u0027re amazing,” he said firmly. “Look at you! Look at us! We\u0027re perfect together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she realized what he was doing, he flipped the light on and pointed to the mirror over the small vanity and sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe literally felt his heart stop as he gazed into the mirror where only his naked reflection stared back. His gaze shot from the mirror to her face. Terrified, he pushed back from her, pulling his flaccid cock from her body with a disheartening tug. Immediately, she felt empty and alone. In silence, she watched his eyes flick back and forth between her and the mirror. He bolted toward his clothes and the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pete!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost fell over trying to get his jeans on while trying to fumble for his keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pete, please,” she whispered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-dies-pretty-when-she-dies-1/page-9.html","bookId":2616,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM"}
