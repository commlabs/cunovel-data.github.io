Her face was still flushed from Jack\u0027s kisses, her cheeks and lips a rosy deep red. Like everything in New York, Schuyler was blooming. A kiss for a kiss for a kiss, she thought, still hazy from their night in Vienna. They had just returned and repaired to the hideaway to shower and change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack had left first - slipping out the side door - and she had waited the requisite half hour before attempting an exit herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was smiling softly to herself, trying to calm her wild hair in a sudden wind, when she saw someone she did not expect to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was standing across the street, staring at her with a look of shock and dismay. One look in Oliver\u0027s eyes and she knew he knew. But how? How could he have known? They\u0027d been so careful to keep their love a secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grief etched all over in his face was too much to bear. Schuyler felt the words catch in her throat as she crossed the street to stand in front of him. \"Ollie...it\u0027s not...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver shot her a look of pure hatred, turned on his heel, and began to walk, then run away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oliver, please, let me explain...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flash, she was standing right in front of him. He could run, but he could not outrun her. \"Don\u0027t do this. Talk to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to say. I saw him leave, and then, just as she\u0027d said, I waited a half hour, and then you left too. You were with him. You lied to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t - it\u0027s nothing like that - Oh God, Oliver.\" The sobs forming now, Schuyler felt his sadness and anger wash over her. If only he would hit her, if only he would strike her - do something other than stand there looking so devastated that she could only feel more devastated in turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt began to rain. Thunderclouds opened up overhead, and the first raindrops pelted, then drummed on them. They were going to get drenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to choose,\" Oliver said, as the rain mixed with tears that fell from his cheeks. \"I\u0027m tired of being your best friend. I\u0027m tired of being second best. I won\u0027t settle for that anymore. It\u0027s all or nothing, Schuyler. You have to decide. Him or me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer best friend and Conduit, or the boy she loved. Schuyler knew one day it would come to this. That she would have to lose one to have the other. That this game would have consequences. That she could not carry on just as she\u0027d had - with a vampire lover and a human familiar, with none the wiser. She had lied to Oliver, lied to Jack, lied to everyone, including herself. But her lies had finally caught up with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are selfish, Schuyler. You should never have made me your familiar,\" Oliver said impassively. \"But I let it happen because I cared about you. I was worried at what would happen to you if I didn\u0027t. But you - if you ever cared about me at all, if you were thinking about me at all, you should have had the decency to restrain yourself. You knew exactly how I felt about you, and you used me anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. Schuyler nodded dumbly as the rain ran in rivers over her hair and her clothes, her garments becoming a soggy mess. Oliver had always been the more sensible of the two of them. He\u0027d had a crush on his best friend, loved her since they\u0027d first met, carried a torch for her for years, but if she hadn\u0027t brought the Caerimonia into it, hadn\u0027t drunk his blood, hadn\u0027t imprinted herself on his soul, maybe someday he would have stopped feeling that way about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she had found another familiar, if she had chosen another human boy, Oliver\u0027s crush might have faded into a soft, nonbinding affection. Oliver would be able to grow up, love a Red Blood girl, have his own family one day. But she had made him her own. She had sealed his affection with that first tantalizing bite. The Sacred Kiss had marked him as hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had acted selfishly, needlessly, recklessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no choice but to love her. Even if he left her now, he would never love another; he would always be alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was damned, and she had cursed both of them with her weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am sorry.\" Schuyler\u0027s eyes filled with tears. There would be no way to make this right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you are sorry, you will leave him. Jack will never be yours, Schuyler. Not like I am yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, crying bitterly, wiping her tears and runny nose with a wet sleeve. She knew she looked as wretched as she felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver softened. \"Come on, let\u0027s get out of the rain. We\u0027re both going to catch a cold.\" He led Schuyler gently into the shelter of a store awning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re too kind to me,\" Schuyler whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver nodded. He knew what it was like to love one who did not - or could not - love you back. But he\u0027d had no choice. None of them did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAUDIO RECORDINGS ARCHIVE:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepository of History\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCLASSIFIED DOCUMENT:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAltithronus Clearance Only\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTranscript of Venator report filed 3/3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenator Martin: They have called for the blood trial.
