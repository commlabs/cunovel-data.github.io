His heart began to bang and he thought he might faint, this felt so good. He didn’t know what to do with his hands, couldn’t catch his breath, wasn’t really thinking anymore. They came up for air at the same moment, and he said, “T-Tori—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they stopped talking for a while, and that was fine. That was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, there were a couple moments where Greg didn’t have to think about what a terrible person he was, heading out to kill some grandma’s poor old cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e41\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go rest,” Tori whispered, laying a light hand on Sarah’s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll sit with Caleb.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. It’s all right.” Sarah tried a smile, but her muscles felt frozen,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea feeling that reminded her of when her dad repaired their driveway\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand she’d tested just how long you could stick your sneaker into wet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecement. A million years from now, an archaeologist would discover a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elittle pink sneaker and wonder where the rest of the body was. “What’s so funny?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” Sarah actually had to put a hand to her face. Her lips\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere so stiff they would’ve been at home on a corpse. “Nothing. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas just remembering something.” By her feet, she felt Jet whimper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally calm, Jet had been restless ever since Greg and Pru left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry about earlier, with Greg. It wasn’t fair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it wasn’t.” Tori draped a moist cloth over the little boy’s forehead. “You’ve got to stop this self-pity crap. We all miss Peter. I keep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexpecting Chris to walk in any second.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To rescue us?” She marveled at how easily the bitterness oozed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback. When had she gotten so mean? All this moaning and woe-is-me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . Still whining, Jet had clambered to his feet. She ruffled his ears to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equiet the animal—and herself—down. “I’m sorry. That was nasty. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust can’t seem to find a balance, like I’m on this emotional teetertotter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not the only person having a hard time. Greg is trying,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand he’s got feelings to hurt. You think I’m always so cheerful and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstanding? Most of the time, I’m faking it. Otherwise I’d spend\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehalf the day crying and the other half daydreaming about food I can’t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave. I’m going to be eighteen in two months. I should be thinking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout college and driving my mom crazy and if I’ll be a blimp in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprom dress.” Tori squeezed out a small, bleak laugh. “Wish my mom\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould see me. She was always on me about my weight.” “So were you faking it before? Talking about getting away, I mean.” “No. We better do it soon. Pru’s right. You can feel it in the air,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow angry everyone is. The food went so fast, and so did the rest of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe supplies. We’ve got plenty of guns but no bullets and no game\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleft to hunt anyway. We’ll be lucky the Council doesn’t get lynched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings are starting to get out of control.” Tori paused. “Remember I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ementioned unlocking the choir door? What I didn’t say was . . . Cutter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas waiting, right outside, hours before he was scheduled to show.” “What?” Of their two night guards, she most disliked the shaggy,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethickset old man who’d wandered into Rule with Lang and Weller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther oldsters darted a quick glance, but Cutter actually stared. “Why\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn’t you say anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he didn’t exactly do anything. He pretended he needed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto check the door. You know how small that landing is?” She did. The stairs were narrow, meant for the choir to access the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echancel. The landing between the basement and sanctuary was a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esquare no larger than a couple doormats placed side by side. “Did he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . you know . . .” She didn’t want to say touch you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty much. He was inside so fast he copped a pretty good feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was . . . dangerous. Like I’d better not scream or fight.” “You really think he would’ve hurt you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I honestly didn’t want to find out. But there are the littler kids,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand I thought, all of a sudden, well . . . better me than one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow sick is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not sick. You were protecting the kids.” Sarah took Tori’s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echilled hands in hers. “Something else happened, though. I can tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said that if I didn’t want Pru or Greg to end up in trouble,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might want to be nice. So I . . . I let him get in a good, long, dirty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elittle grope.” When Sarah pulled in a breath, Tori said, “Don’t, okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already feel like I’ve crawled through a sewer. But you know those\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeans Pru gave him? Cutter offered the can to me, like payment. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid he didn’t expect something for nothing. That . . . that the kids\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emight like more food if I would, you know, do more. And what’s horrible?” Tori’s eyes dropped to her lap. “For a second, I thought . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eokay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tori.” Sara could taste the acid boil from her empty stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t mean that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” Tori gave a hopeless shrug. “Maybe I do. The kids\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eare hungry, and what if Cutter threatens to hurt Greg? Or Pru? None\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof us are safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, let’s just take a step back, okay? Nothing’s happened yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll talk to Greg and Pru. We’ll think of something. Know what? I’d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike some tea. Want tea?” Sarah stood up so quickly her heart couldn’t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekeep up, and a sweep of vertigo blacked her vision. She gulped back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea shaky breath, then another. “You want chamomile or chamomile?” “Chamomile’d be great.” Tori managed a wobbly smile. “Look, I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealready put Daisy and Ghost with the girls. Would you drop off Jet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith the boys? That dog goes crazy when you’re not around.” Not as crazy as I feel right now. “Sure.” She turned to go, Jet on her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheels. “It’ll be okay, Tori.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s nice,” Tori said, “that you think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, the thought of Cutter hitting on Tori . . . Sarah shuddered as she walked the breezeway connecting the school to the church. The idea made her want to take a cup of bleach to her brain and hit rinse. The thought of his creepy old hands on her, or his mouth . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gag me with a fork.” Frosty air palmed her face as she pushed through double doors and into the west vestibule. Directly ahead were two sets of stairs. Bear left and you had a choice: either up three steps to a cloakroom or down twelve to the basement. Choose the right set of steps, however, and you accessed a circular stone stair coiling up to the bell tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flicked on a flashlight and took the left stairs. The church was not her favorite place. The place creeped her out, day or night. Constructed entirely of off-white, native limestone, the church was a soundproofed ice cube that held onto a deep gloom and a stone-cold chill. Following her light, she descended into the midnight gloaming of the windowless basement. Grit crackled like cap guns under her shoes. The gelid air was fiery on her skin. The basement was dominated by the inky cave of a common room that seemed only blacker with the cold. Shivering, she hung a left for the kitchen, a long, narrow throat of a room designed on the cheap. The cupboards were puke-yellow, vintage plywood. The floor and counters were stained Formica. The industrial-sized stainless-steel sink sported two spigots, not that she’d ever known water to run from either. All their water came from snowmelt, and they always kept an aluminum camp pot, with a plug of ice, at the ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was when she fumbled out a match that she heard it: a very small but crisp crunch like sand under a heavy boot. What? Her heart cramped. She went completely still, unlit match in hand, then eased right to peer down the long throat of the kitchen’s one aisle and toward a closed storage room where they kept their meager rations under lock and key. As her weight shifted, she caught the snap and crackle again: grit under her feet. You heard yourself, silly. Touching off the Coleman, she squared the pot of ice over the burner. Just freaking yourself out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking out her keys, she walked to the storage room, socked in a key, turned it, and heard the thunk as the lock didn’t release . . . but engaged. Huh? She frowned. The door was open? That wasn’t right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she recalled what Tori said: When I went to sweep out the basement . . . Tori had used the chore as an excuse to open the side door, so Greg and Pru could slip inside. But now there’s sand. She thought about how much colder the vestibule seemed, and her pulse ramped just a little higher. Always icy, the church had been frigid because the side door was open? Would she know? No, not if she didn’t stop to check or feel a draft. And the basement’s freezing, which follows because if the door is open, the air has two ways to go, up into the sanctuary . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr down here, into the basement, with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut hold on, hold on. Tori had gone after Greg. Had she mentioned locking up once the boys left? Sarah hadn’t asked. It wasn’t something she’d have checked anyway, because Tori had enough common sense to realize that you always locked doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if she did lock it, something could have come in earlier, and be here now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that was silly. Why hang out in a frigid basement? What was here that was nowhere else? Well, food. Duh. And that made her think of something else Tori said: when she opened the side door, Cutter had been there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. What if Tori had jumped to the wrong conclusion? Cutter had keys. So maybe he was really there to steal food. A spoonful of peanut butter here, a few crackers there—who’s to know? It wasn’t like they counted every bean. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/monsters-ashes-trilogy-3/page-34.html","bookId":2566,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:03 PM"}
