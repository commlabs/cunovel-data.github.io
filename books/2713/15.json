You want to win the championship, so I figure it’s best for me to use my extraterrestrial powers to help you beat Pennsville if I get the chance. I used telepathy to check with my dad up in outer space and he says it’s okay if I expose myself a little bit, because he’s coming soon to get me anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m tired of Boy21’s outer-space fantasies. I’m tired of Coach pressuring me. I’m worried about my inability to hit a jump shot. And so I don’t say anything in response. Silence has always been my default mode—my best defense against the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Boy21’s grandfather pulls up, I’m grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See you tomorrow,” Russ says as he climbs back into my bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, but I don’t leave the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear Boy21 say good-bye to Pop and Dad, and then I watch him get into Mr. Allen’s Cadillac below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the taillights get smaller and smaller, I try to visualize myself hitting shot after shot, but I keep missing open jumpers, even in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE GIRLS’ GAME IS BEFORE OURS and the stands are packed. Because the girls are usually away when we are home and vice versa, this is one of the few times I’ll get to watch Erin play this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit with my teammates in the designated spot in the bleachers and when Erin comes out I see that she’s changed her jersey number to 18—my new number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get a little emotional as the girls warm up. I start to feel exactly what I try to avoid feeling during basketball season—in love—and I’m equal parts happy and annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWes and Boy21 are reading the next Harry Potter book. Wes fiddles with the zipper of his hoodie. Boy21 wrinkles his brow and nods every so often like he agrees with whatever he’s reading. The rest of my teammates are listening to iPods or joking around. Coach Watts chaperones us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a small section of Irish who’ve come to root for Erin. They’re sitting with Pop and our parents and they’re all wearing green. One man has painted his face green, white, and orange like Ireland’s flag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut most of the people in the gym tonight are black because Pennsville is pretty much an all-black high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin opens the game by hitting a deep three pointer, which makes the crowd erupt. She looks gorgeous out there on the court and every time she does something good my teammates punch my arm or rub my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin hits shot after shot, pulls rebounds, get steals, and carries her team to a twenty-point lead by halftime. Just before she walks into the locker room, she looks up into the stands, finds me, and smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s so happy being out there on the basketball court doing what she was born to do—and I start to envy her, because I feel as though I might throw up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m thinking about the triangle-and-two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the second half Erin blocks three shots, intercepts two passes, drives the lane several times for layups, comes off endless screens, sinks shot after shot, and secures the win easily. I’m happy for her, and I even smile back when she looks for me at the end of the game, but I still feel as though I might puke. Big-game jitters. This one could be for the conference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we stretch in the locker room, Boy21 seems calm. I think about how he’d be the perfect secret weapon tonight, and I want to tell him that it’s okay to play to the best of his ability if he gets in the game—not to worry about me—but for some reason, I don’t. Maybe I think he’s not ready, or maybe I think he is and I just don’t want to lose my starting position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shoot your way out of the triangle-and-two early,” Terrell says to me. “We both know the team’s better when I’m the number one option on offense. Right, White Rabbit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI completely agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they announce our squad, Terrell gets the biggest cheer by far, although I get a hearty roar from the Irish section. I see Pop parked in the handicap zone. He’s wearing a green, white, and orange scarf. Dad’s sitting next to him and a sweaty Erin is next to Dad even though she should be sitting with her teammates. I know that this is her way of being my girlfriend when I don’t allow her to be my girlfriend, which makes me feel good, but I remind myself not to think about Erin tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re not dating during basketball season, remember?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasketball is your girlfriend now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gym’s rocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe students are chanting, “Bell-mont! Bell-mont!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the pregame huddle, Coach says, “I don’t think I have to remind you that this is a play-off game. We only play this team twice, and we need to win both times if we want to take the division and set ourselves up nicely for the postseason. Good man defense. Call out switches. Quick transitions, and shoot the ball, Finley. We need you to shoot your way out of the triangle-and-two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On three, team. One, two, three—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“TEAM!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I’m on the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWes wins the jump easily, and—just like Coach had predicted—Pennsville leaves me unmarked, double-teams Terrell, and sets up a triangle zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I’m supposed to shoot the ball, but I try to force it into Wes, which results in a turnover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shoot the ball, Finley!” Coach yells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next time down on offense, when they leave me wide open, Coach yells, “Shoot!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a three pointer; it hits the front of the rim, and Pennsville gets the rebound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss the next three shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re down eight to nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t hit a shot to save my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep shooting,” Coach says. “Keep shooting, Finley!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to get the ball to Hakim next, but I make another bad pass and suddenly I have two turnovers and four missed shots in a row.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance over at Pop and Dad and their eyes look small, their faces sheepish, like they’re embarrassed for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep shooting!” Erin yells. “Keep shooting!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next time down Pennsville leaves me wide open, and I call time-out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I jog off the court, Coach says, “Who told you to call time-out, Finley? Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach looks me in the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sees I’m rattled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sees I’m scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says, “Russ, report in for Finley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuss doesn’t make a move. Coach Watts grabs his elbow and sort of gives him a push in the right direction. Boy21 looks at me, but I look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Russ reports in at the scorer’s table, I become invisible—everyone is avoiding eye contact because they’re embarrassed for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy21 takes my place on the bench with the starters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Same exact game plan,” Coach says. “Russ—you’re the shooter now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Coach,” Terrell says, “he can’t shoot. We’re already down eight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might be surprised,” Coach says. “Now execute the game plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finley,” Boy21 says. Everyone looks at me. Everyone. “Do you want me to use my extraterrestrial powers to win this game?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he just say?” Terrell asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Extra-what?” Sir says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” Hakim says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Russ!” Coach says. “Not now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finley,” Boy21 says a little more slowly. “Do you want me to use my extraterrestrial powers to win this ball game? Your call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell are you talking about?” Terrell says. “We got a game to play!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy21’s staring at me—communicating with his eyes—and I can tell that he doesn’t really want to do what he is about to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me wants to see if he’s the real deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me just wants to beat Pennsville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me knows that I should’ve been encouraging my friend to use his talents all along and that I’ve been selfish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe buzzer sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time-out is over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finley,” Boy21 says, “I need you to say it’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I say, “It’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow I know this means I won’t play again tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, same game plan,” Coach says once more as I sit down on the other end of the bench and the rest of the team takes the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel ashamed being on the bench.
