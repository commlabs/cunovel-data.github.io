{"id":6475,"no":1,"title":"Part 1 The Story of My Life","content":"It is with a kind of fear that I begin to write the history of my life. I have, as it were, a superstitious hesitation in lifting the veil that clings about my childhood like a golden mist. The task of writing an autobiography is a difficult one. When I try to classify my earliest impressions, I find that fact and fancy look alike across the years that link the past with the present. The woman paints the child\u0027s experiences in her own fantasy. A few impressions stand out vividly from the first years of my life; but \"the shadows of the prison-house are on the rest.\" Besides, many of the joys and sorrows of childhood have lost their poignancy; and many incidents of vital importance in my early education have been forgotten in the excitement of great discoveries. In order, therefore, not to be tedious I shall try to present in a series of sketches only the episodes that seem to me to be the most interesting and important.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/89/4755.html","bookId":209,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 6:57:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 6:57:15 AM"}
