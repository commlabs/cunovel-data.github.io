Sour recognition-most humbling-in discovering such bestial weakness within him-and when the summoning arrived in the language of the First Empire, Kuru Qan found himself rising like a demon to roar his domination over all others, then lunging forth from the iron blade, into the world once again, leading a dread host-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the one standing. Thelomen Tartheno Toblakai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the sword impaling his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKuru Qan understood, then, what needed to be done. Understood the path that must be forged, and understood, alas, the sacrifice that must be made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey closed round the Toblakai warrior. They reached for that cursed sword and grasped hold of its blade. They drew with ferocious necessity on the blood streaming down the Toblakai’s leg, causing him to stagger, and, with Kuru Qan in the forefront, the spirits tore open a gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA portal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChaos roared in on all sides, seeking to annihilate them, and the spirits began surrendering their ghostly lives, sacrificing themselves to the rapacious hunger assailing them. Yet, even as they did so, they pushed the Toblakai forward, forging the path, demanding the journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther spirits awakened, from all around the warrior-the Toblakai’s own slain, and they were legion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath roared. The pressure of the chaos stabbed, ripped spirits to pieces-even with all their numbers, the power of their will, they were slowing, they could not get through-Kuru Qan screamed-to draw more of the Toblakai’s power would kill him. They had failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFailed-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a cleared circle in an old Tarthenal burial ground, a decrepit shaman seated cross-legged in its centre stirred awake, eyes blinking open. He glanced up to see Ublala Pung standing just beyond the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now, lad,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeeping, the young Tarthenal rushed forward, a knife in his hands-one of Arbat’s own, the iron black with age, the glyphs on the blade so worn down as to be almost invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArbat nodded as Ublala Pung reached him and drove the weapon deep into the shaman’s chest. Not on the heart side-Old Hunch needed to take a while to die, to bleed out his power, to feed the multitude of ghosts now rising from the burial grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Get away from here!’ Arbat shouted, even as he fell onto his side, blood frothing at his mouth. ‘Get out!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoosing a childlike bawl, Ublala Pung ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghosts gathered, pure-blooded and mixed-bloods, spanning centuries upon centuries and awake after so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Old Hunch Arbat showed them their new god. And then showed them, with the power of his blood, the way through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKuru Qan felt himself lifted on a tide, shoved forward as if by an enormous wave, and all at once there were spirits, an army of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThelomen Tartheno Toblakai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarthenal-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurging forward, the chaos thrust back, recoiling, then attacking once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundreds vanishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThousands voicing wailing cries of agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKuru Qan found himself close to the Toblakai warrior, directly in front of the flailing figure, and he reached back, as if to grab the Toblakai’s throat. Closed his hand, and pulled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater, a crashing surf, coral sand shifting wild underfoot. Blinding heat from a raging sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaggering, onto the shore-and yes, this was as far as Kuru Qan could go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released the warrior, saw him stumble onto the island’s beach, dragging that sword-impaled leg-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the old Ceda, the sea reached out, snatched Kuru Qan back with a rolling, tumbling inhalation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater everywhere, swirling, pulling him ever deeper, ever darker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the sea, my friends, does not dream of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the arena floor, Emperor Rhulad Sengar lay dead. Bled out, his flesh where visible pale as river clay, and as cold. Sand dusted the sweaty coins and all the blood that had poured from him was turning black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the onlookers waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths to rise again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun rose higher, the sounds of fighting in the city drew closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, had anyone been looking, they would have seen a speck above the horizon to the north. Growing ever larger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne street away from the Eternal Domicile, Fiddler led his squad onto the rooftop of some gutted public building. Flecks of ash swirled in the hot morning air and all the city that they could see was veiled behind dust and smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d lost Gesler and his squad, ever since the garrison ambush, but Fiddler was not overly concerned. All opposition was a shambles. He ran in a crouch to the edge facing the Eternal Domicile, looked across, and then down to the street below. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-458.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
