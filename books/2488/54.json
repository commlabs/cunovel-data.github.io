His right foot was twitching. She couldn’t take her eyes off it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver’s-side door yanked open. Amy screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFredo’s corpse was yanked out into the night. She screamed again. She pulled her knees tighter, and twisted her hair in her fingers, and squeezed her eyes shut and tried to make it all go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were tearing and smacking sounds from outside, set to the tune of the open door chime from the RV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBing …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBing …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBing …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed to get out, to run, to hide. Or to get behind the wheel and stomp on the gas. Instead, she balled herself tighter, and clinched her eyelids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInhuman feet crunched through the glass in front of her. Warmth spread across her thighs and she wet herself for the first time since she was five years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe steps came closer, and closer, crackling through the broken glass until she could feel warm breath on her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBing …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBing …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBing …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBook III\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePosted on FreeRepublic.com\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eby user DarylLombard, Nov. 11, 1:31 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey laughed. They laughed when I stocked up on canned goods, they laughed when I stocked up on ammunition, they laughed when I said the storm clouds were gathering. Same as they laughed at Noah. And, as with Noah, they come clawing at my door as the flood rolls in. Sorry. This is why I was building an ark while you were doing drugs and watching reality TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI appreciate all of the prayers and expressions of concern from you over the last week (for those of who you don’t know, I live not three miles outside of Outbreak Ground Zero in [Undisclosed]). But we are safe because we have prepared. We have food to last a year. We have water from our own well. We have fuel to last three years. We have guns, and everyone in our family is trained to use them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the day of outbreak, one of my son’s (the “musician”) druggie friends and his little girlfriend came by. You can picture him even without my description—long hair, covered in tattoos, track marks on his arms, showing early signs of HIV infection. A pro-Atheism bumper sticker on his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to shack up with us, eat our food, drink our water, sleep under our protection while the pestilence and depravity ran rampant outside. I pulled him aside by his scrawny arm and said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What can you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me with that slackjawed look and says, “What do you mean, dude?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean what can you do? Can you shoot a rifle accurately at fifty yards? Do you know how to gut an animal? Or make a fishing net and clean what you catch? Can you fertilize a garden? Or purify water? Can you repair a small engine? Or even gap and change a sparkplug? Can you wire an electrical outlet? Repair a roof when it leaks? Set a broken bone? Can you make your own clothes? Field strip and clean a rifle? Reload ammunition from spent brass? Disinfect and sew shut a wound?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he said he didn’t know how to do any of these things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had spent his life playing video games and doing drugs and had probably fathered five welfare babies, demanding the whole time that I pay for their health care. When a pipe leaks, he calls the landlord (at best) or (more likely) just lets it leak. Let the next tenant find out the floorboards have rotted and that every wall is covered with mold. His little girlfriend would be the type to cry about rights for animals because she thinks meat grows in the grocery store display counter. Smoking pot and spitting on our soldiers when they return home from fighting terrorists because she lives obliviously in a little cocoon built from our sweat and blood and tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said to him, “Imagine there’s a meteor coming to destroy the world. But some rich men have pooled their resources and built a big rocket ship to get people off the planet. They don’t have room for everybody, but you want a seat on that ship. Now, your having a seat means somebody else doesn’t get one. Space is limited. Food is limited. What would you tell the man standing at the door? What case would you make for getting a seat on that rocket ship at the expense of another person? What can you offer that would justify the food you would eat, and the water you would drink, and the medicine you would use?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to me, “I don’t know, dude. I don’t see no spaceship here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I said, “What you didn’t realize was that you were always in that situation. Only the spaceship is planet Earth, and your creator built it for you. And you had your whole life to make your case for why you should be allowed to stay. Instead, you did drugs, and played video games, and collected welfare. Well, this ship is taking off without you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat boy walked away without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I’ll see him and his little girlfriend again, out among the diseased and the starving, running from the riots and the chaos. And I will say, “You had your chance. All your life those ‘crazy’ preachers were trying to tell you that the day of reckoning was coming. You chose to ignore it. Now it is too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the way it should be. There are two kinds of people in the world: producers and parasites. When a society gets too many parasites, we need the disaster, the tsunami, the earthquake, the war, the flood, the disease to wash away the garbage, to rinse the safety nets of the slugs that use them as a hammock. Let them fall into the fire, so that the strong, the faithful and the capable will be left behind to rebuild, and renew humanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat day has come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey laughed at me when I stocked up on food and fuel and ammunition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho’s laughing now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12 Hours Until the Aerial Bombing of Undisclosed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn was rocked out of unconsciousness by the blast of a shotgun and the warm splash of brains in his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands were grabbing him from all over, tugging at the spindly legs of the unholy daddy longlegs creature. When he was free of the monster, John rolled over and saw a cowboy-looking dude in incredibly tight pants holding a smoking double-barrel shotgun. He was wearing earmuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd of people standing around John were surprisingly human-looking for infected, and were pretty well-dressed for zombies. The cowboy said, “You all right, buddy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn couldn’t think of how to answer that. His ribs hurt and it was kind of hard to breathe. The back of his neck was wet with monster blood, and he had gotten all worked up anticipating his own mortality only to find out it was on back order. He needed a drink so badly he was wondering if there was a gas station nearby that pumped ethanol, and if there would be a way to crawl into the underground tank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree burly guys were wrestling the spider monster. The human head at the center was shattered from the shotgun blast, but the parasite inside was still thrashing for life. A massive pickup truck sporting dual wheels and flared rear fenders backed up in the street. There was some kind of machine in the bed, a big red thing with a motor and chutes and wheels. Somebody started it. It sounded like a lawnmower. Only when they started cramming the giant, squirming daddy longlegs into the chute did John realize it was a wood chipper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was that terrible shriek, and red slush went spraying into the neighbor’s yard. When the last of the creature’s eight legs vanished into the jaws of the machine John thought, well, that’s one way to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn tried to get up, but Cowboy pointed the shotgun and said, “Now, just stay seated for a minute, if you don’t mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind John, Falconer barked, “I’m a cop, asshole! See that on my belt? That’s a badge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalconer was marched over and forced to sit next to John. Holy shit, did he look pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCowboy pulled down his earmuffs and said, “Just to be clear, I got nothin’ but respect for law enforcement, officer—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Detective.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Detective, but at this point in time I’m pretty sure that what you see here is all the law that exists in this town at this here moment. When the feds huddled up behind their barricades on the other side of town, it came down to us to walk these here streets. And now that they left town altogether, well, we’re pretty sure that makes this our town. ’Til we hear different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalconer said, “I understand. Now you tell me specifically what needs to occur before you let me continue what I was doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to convince us that you’re not a zombie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, “Do we look like zombies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ain’t you heard? The zombies look just like everybody else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalconer said, “This is all some huge prank, isn’t it? Is somebody filming my reaction, to put it up on the Internet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now,” Cowboy said, “the infection takes root in the mouth, that much we know. Then it spreads to the brain and then the rest of the body. So there’s a real simple test: we have to take somethin’ out of the mouth. If you’re infected, you won’t feel it, because it’s not really part of your body. If you’re clean, it’ll hurt like hell. So I’ll let you pick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his back pocket, Cowboy pulled out a pair of vise-grip pliers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can take a tooth…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his other back pocket, he produced a six-inch-long pair of pruning shears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“… or a piece of tongue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11 Hours, 45 Minutes Until the Aerial Bombing of Undisclosed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was locked in a supply closet while the reds gathered to discuss execution methods. I didn’t care. It’d all gone wrong, the kind of wrong that not even Owen properly understood. Otherwise he’d realize he was about to give me a cleaner end than most people on earth were going to get over the coming weeks and months and years. Including him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy was my only regret. I just wished I knew that she was safe, and if so, that I could get word to her not to come after me. Even if she had made it out of town, Amy wouldn’t just leave the situation alone. She and I had that in common. Can’t stand to be on the other side of a fence from where we want to be. Not a fence somebody else put there, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished there was a way to tell her all that in person. To hug her, feeling her warmth and smelling the fruity shampoo in her hair. If I had that, and if I could hear her laugh one last time, I could carry that with me into eternity and that would be okay. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/this-book-is-full-of-spiders-john-dies-at-the-end-2/page-54.html","bookId":2488,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:47 PM"}
