Meanwhile, I used the remaining materials to successfully activate the third experimental body, and as a result, the ‘Garden of Eden’ Project thus entered the third phase: Apostle. This is the apostle experimental subject number three I was talking about just now.” The assistant said.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Nonsense!” Connor in the air seemed to have gone crazy as he roared, “The amount of energy the three super-chosen need is too great, impossible to activate!

He forcefully struck at the formless screen before him, but the pounding force was only sent back with many times more force. His hands immediately became red and swollen, rupturing, blood flowing out from the injuries, mixing together with the chosen’s bloody paste, impossible to distinguish one from the other.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was impossible for Connor to break through the Void Prison, unless he had eight levels or higher ability.

Bevulas stood up, handed the materials in his hands to the attendant on the side, and then walked up to the assistant before saying, “Let’s go and give your apostle experimental subject number three a look. I hope it is worthy of the six sets of materials used. Oh, one more thing, could you tell me your name?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe middle-aged assistant’s pale and somewhat plump face immediately flushed red from excitement. He straightened his body, and then said, “My name is Martin! Martin Gardner!

Martin immediately walked towards the elevator, Haydn and the attendants following behind. The researchers all put down their work, rushing out to make arrangements based on Martin’s orders. Even though no one knew what exactly happened, all of them knew what to do right now. Researchers were also people, wishing to live a bit better. Apart from science, knowing when and what they should do was also extremely important.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt the center of the presentation hall, the six special chosen who hadn’t obtained any orders still stood there, staring forward lifelessly. Their intelligence had already been substantially damaged, completely ignoring the fact that their companion’s corpse was right in front of them. Meanwhile, inside the Void Prison, Dr. Connor was already sitting paralyzed on the ground, staring at the top of this hall, unknown as to what his mouth was muttering.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAll of them were abandoned people.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTen minutes later, Bevulas stood in a laboratory with rather simple and crude facilities, looking pensively at the naked male in the breeding tank. This was a well-proportioned male who was still asleep in the culture fluid. As his chest rose and fell, a string of fine bubbles was continuously produced. Moreover, what was the most striking was that there was a crystal exposed outside the pit of his stomach. Even though he was in a breeding tank, this male still made the surrounding people feel a formless pressure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBevulas produced a pair of tortoiseshell pince-nez spectacles, and then walked close to the breeding tank. Only after looking at it for three whole minutes did he turn around and ask Haydn, “What do you think?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Eight levels.” This time, Haydn was extremely serious, not revealing a frivolous smile.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBevulas nodded, saying to Martin, “Very good, this one isn’t bad. Then, what kind of pleasant surprise will experimental subject number two bring me?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMartin had an answer long prepared in advance, immediately replying, “I can make two eight level abilities, and I can guarantee that one of the abilities will be in either Magic or Combat Domain. The cultivation time will take around three months, the chance of success around… 45%.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Then, what about the number one?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“In theory, number one will have a ninth level ability, but only after the gene lock is deciphered a step further will this be possible. There is no way to estimate the probability of unraveling the gene lock, but it is definitely extremely low. That is why until this battle ends, it is best if we do not hope for a result.” Martin replied honestly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“The war might end quickly, or it might drag out for some time. Regardless, the war will eventually end.

From now on, this research base will be placed under your responsibility. Then, Mr. Martin, do you need anything else? Do not worry, just speak freely.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMartin thought for a bit, and then said, \"I admit that I do have a small request.
