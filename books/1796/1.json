When it came to giving out common sense, the good Lord obviously overlooked you two. Or maybe he just overlooked men in general.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared across the table at the two men who sat opposite her. One was her lover and one was her father. She loved them both but right now she could cheerfully have strangled them. That she could be so fond of a pair of chauvinistic, bullheaded rogues probably indicated a serious character flaw in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Red, just calm down. I\u0027ve told you there\u0027s absolutely no reason to worry. It\u0027s gonna be a cakewalk. No sweat.\" Her father\u0027s teeth flashed from the depths of his bushy, graying red beard, and his aquamarine eyes sparkled with enthusiasm. Emerson Ames, part-time author and full-time adventurer, was a big man with a huge appetite for life in the dangerous lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity had gotten her flaming hair and curiously striking blue eyes from him. Emerson had raised her single-handedly after her mother\u0027s death, and he\u0027d seen to it that his only child grew up with a thorough, if eclectic, education, and the ability to take care of herself. One of the things Emerson had not managed to instill in her, however, was his unquenchable desire to wander the far corners of the earth. Verity valued home and hearth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t try to reassure me, Dad. I\u0027ve listened to the whole scheme and I still think it\u0027s stupid and risky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamuel Lehigh got himself into this mess. Let him get himself out of it. There\u0027s no need for you and Jonas to get involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lehigh\u0027s in real trouble this time, Verity. He needs help. He needs someone he can trust,\" Jonas said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe extended one arm with unconscious grace and picked up the glass of vodka in front of him. That smooth, masculine grace was an intrinsic part of Jonas Quarrel, a manifestation of the quiet power within him. Verity imagined it was the kind of power one might have seen in a sixteenth-century Renaissance nobleman—a civilized savagery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he had the grace and power of a Medici, Quarrel certainly did not dress like one. Tonight he wore his usual attire—blue denim work shirt, jeans, and scuffed boots. The leather belt around his waist was supple from years of wear. While he might not dress like a Renaissance aristocrat, Quarrel did possess the unique talents of a Medici or a Borgia. He was, in other words, equally capable of quoting poetry or wielding a dagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was definitely overqualified for his present job, Verity thought wryly. Jonas Quarrel was one of the few dishwashers around with the right to put Ph.D. after his name. His field of expertise was Renaissance history; specifically, the weapons and strategies of that era.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not a handsome man, but men of power and grace have never needed to depend on anything as superficial as masculine beauty. Whenever she looked into the depths of his eyes—eyes the color of Florentine gold coins, filled with intelligence and the shadows of ghosts—the last thing on Verity\u0027s mind was how Quarrel rated on a scale of one to ten. He could seduce her with a touch or a look. She was deeply, passionately in love with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now he was getting ready to leave her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lehigh wouldn\u0027t have asked for help if he didn\u0027t need it,\" Jonas continued reasonably in his rich, dark voice. \"He made it clear on the phone that Emerson is the only one he can trust to handle the ransom payoff. Emerson has no choice. He has to go down to Mexico to deal with the kidnappers. Do you really want your father to go alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity had realized hours ago that she had lost the battle, but she struggled on hopelessly. \"The Mexican police can deal with the situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson shook his head. \"Come on, Red, I raised you smarter than that. The last thing Lehigh can afford is to have the cops brought in, even if he could trust \u0027em not to take the ransom and run. And let\u0027s face it, when you\u0027re dealing with the upholders of law and order in Mexico, you\u0027re playing with a stacked deck. No, old Sam knows this has to be handled privately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s absolutely no one old Sam can call on to handle the payoff besides you?\" Verity asked suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson gave a huge shrug. \"No one he can trust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That certainly says a lot about old Sam\u0027s lifestyle and choice of friends, doesn\u0027t it?\" Verity muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Imagine living to the ripe old age of eighty and not having another person on the face of the earth he can call on in an emergency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you think he got to the ripe old age of eighty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson drawled. \"Not by trusting the wrong people, that\u0027s for damn sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity gazed at Jonas for a long moment. He sipped his vodka quietly and looked back at her, his eyes steady and intent. She knew there was no point in arguing any further. She had been trying to talk them out of the venture since Lehigh\u0027s call on the restaurant phone yesterday morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t so difficult to accept her father\u0027s decision. Verity was accustomed to Emerson\u0027s restless, adventuring ways. But when she thought about Jonas going away, she could feel a knife twisting deep inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your writing, Dad?\" she tried, knowing it was a futile attempt. \"You said you had a deadline for that first futuristic western. You\u0027ll miss it if you go chasing off to Mexico.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can probably get an extension,\" Emerson replied easily. \"But if the editor doesn\u0027t want to give me one, he can shove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity winced and turned to Jonas. \"You were just starting to make some real progress in learning how to cook. I had great hopes for your lentil stew. The customers love it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas\u0027s mouth crooked slightly at one corner. \"When I get back you can finish giving me cooking lessons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity put both palms flat on the table. \"So,\" she said, accepting the inevitable with bad grace, \"when will you be leaving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas studied her for a moment. \"Tomorrow morning. Early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity nodded. \"Well, good luck. Tell Sam Lehigh I said hello.\" She pushed herself to her feet abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was dazed at the implications of having lost this battle. If this was not the end, it was surely the beginning of the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it would be better if Jonas made the break a clean one. Then again, maybe it would be infinitely harder. The thought of never seeing him again filled Verity with despair, but the idea of having him drift in and out of her life over the next fifty or sixty years was equally hard to accept. The vision of a lifetime filled with uncertain farewells and greetings almost overwhelmed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDammit, I\u0027m getting maudlin, Verity thought as she swept a couple of glasses off a nearby table. She walked through the empty restaurant and into the kitchen of the No Bull Cafe, angrily blinking back the tears that threatened to spill down her cheeks. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-1.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
