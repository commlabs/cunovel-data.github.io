I draw them closer around myself. “What’s your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gabriel,” he says. And there it is again, that almost smile, hindered by the weight of things. I want to ask him what he’s doing in this awful place with its beautiful gardens and clear blue pools, symmetrical green hedges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to know where he came from, and if he’s planning on going back. I even want to tell him about my plan to escape—if I ever formulate a plan, that is. But these thoughts are dangerous. If my brother were here, he’d tell me to trust nobody. And he’d be right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good night,” the boy, Gabriel, says. “You might want to eat and get some sleep. Tomorrow’s a big day.” His tone implies I’ve just been warned of something awful ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns to leave, and I notice a slight limp in his walk that wasn’t there this afternoon. Beneath the thin white fabric of his uniform, I can see the shadow of bruises beginning to form. Is it because of me? Was he punished for making my escape down the hallway possible? These are more questions that I don’t ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he’s gone. And I hear the click of a lock turning in the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not Gabriel who wakes me in the morning, but a parade of women. They’re first generation, if the gray hair is any indication, though their eyes still sparkle with the vibrancy of youth. They are chattering among themselves as they yank the blankets from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the women looks over my naked body and says, “Well, at least we won’t have to wrestle this one out of her clothes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one. After everything that’s happened, I almost forgot that there are two others. Trapped in this house somewhere, behind other locked doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can react, two of the women have grabbed me by the arms and are dragging me toward the bathroom that connects to my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Best if you don’t struggle,” one of them says cheer-fully. I stagger to keep pace with them. Another woman stays behind to make my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bathroom they make me sit on the toilet lid, which is covered in some sort of pink fur. Everything is pink. The curtains are flimsy and impractical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack home we covered our windows with burlap at night to give the impression of poverty and to keep out the prying eyes of new orphans looking for shelter and handouts. The house I shared with my brother has three bedrooms, but we’d spend our nights on a cot in the basement, sleeping in shifts just in case the locks didn’t hold, using our father’s shotgun to guard us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrilly, pretty things have no place in windows. Not where I come from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colors are endless. One woman draws a bath while the other opens the cabinet to a rainbow of little soaps that are shaped like hearts and stars. She drops a few of them into the bathwater, and they sizzle and dissolve, leaving a frothy layer of pink and blue. Bubbles pop like little fireworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t argue when I’m told to get into the tub. It’s awkward being naked in front of these strangers, but the water looks and smells appealing. It’s so unlike the bleary yellowed water that runs through the rusty pipes in the house I shared with my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShared. Past tense. How could I let myself think this way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie in the sweet-smelling water, and the bubbles pop against my skin, bringing samples of cinnamon and potpourri and what I imagine real roses must smell like. But I will not be hypnotized by the wonder of these small things. Defiantly I think of the house I share with my brother, the house where my mother was born at the threshold of the new century. It has brick walls still imprinted with the silhouette of ivy that has long since died. It has a fire escape with a broken ladder, and on its street all the houses are close enough together that as a child I would hold my arms out my bedroom window to hold the hands of the little girl who lived next door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe would string paper cups across the divide and talk to each other in giggles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat little girl was orphaned young. Her parents were the new generation; she barely knew her mother, her father fell ill, and then one morning I reached for her and she was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was inconsolable, that girl having been my first true friend. I still think of her bright blue eyes sometimes, the way she’d toss peppermints at my bedroom window to wake me for a game of paper-cup telephone. Once she was gone, my mother held the string we had used for our game of telephone, and she told me it was kite string, that when she was a little girl she would spend hours in the park flying kites. I asked her for more stories of her childhood, and on some nights she gave them to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStories of towering toy stores and frozen lakes where she would skate swanlike into figure eights and of all of the people who had passed beneath the very windows of this very house when it was young and covered in ivy, and when the cars were parked in neat, shiny rows along the street, in Manhattan, New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she and my father died, my brother and I covered the windows with burlap potato and coffee bean sacks. We took all our mother’s beautiful things, all our father’s important clothes, and stuffed them into trunks that locked. The rest we buried in the yard, late at night, beneath the ailing lilies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is my story. These things are my past, and I will not allow them to be washed away. I will find a way to have them back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She has such agreeable hair,” one of the women says, scooping warm cupful after cupful of frothy water over my head. “Such a lovely color, too. I wonder if it’s natural.” Of course it’s natural. What else would it be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I bet that’s what the Governor liked about her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me see,” says the other woman, cupping my chin and tilting it. She studies my face and then gasps, letting her hand flutter spasmodically against her heart. “Oh, Helen, look at this girl’s eyes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both stop bathing me long enough to look at me. Really look at me, for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes are usually the first thing people notice, the left eye blue and the right eye brown, just like my brother. Heterochromia; my parents were geneticists, and that was the name they gave my condition. I might have asked them more about it when I grew older, if I’d had the chance. I had always thought the heterochromia was a useless genetic glitch, but if the women are right and my eyes are what the Governor noticed, heterochromia has saved my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suppose those are real?” one woman asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else would they be but real?” This time I speak aloud, and they’re startled, then delighted. Their doll has a voice. And suddenly they’re all questions. Where am I from, do I know where I am, don’t I just love the view, do I like horses—there’s a lovely stable—do I prefer my hair up or down?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI answer none of these. I will share nothing with these strangers—however well intentioned they may be—who are a part of this place. The questions come so fast that I wouldn’t know where to begin anyway, and then there’s a soft knock at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re getting her ready for the Governor,” one of the women says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muffled voice on the other side of the door is soft, gentle, and young. “Lady Rose would like to speak to her right this moment, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re only half done bathing her! And her nails—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me,” the voice on the other side of the door says, patiently, “I have a direct order to bring her now, whatever condition she may be in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Rose is apparently someone who has the final say in things, because suddenly the women are tugging me to my feet, patting me dry with a pink towel, brushing my wet hair, and slipping me into a robe that feels like waves of silk against my skin. Whatever was in that bathwater has heightened my neurons, left me feeling unpeeled and exposed. I still feel as though bubbles are popping against my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door opens, I see that the voice belongs to a little girl, barely half my height. She is dressed like the older women, though, in the feminine version of the white blouse Gabriel wore, with a tiered black skirt, where Gabriel had worn black pants. Her hair is braided into a circle around her head, and her cheeks bloom into apple shapes when she smiles at me. “You’re Rhine?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “I’m Deirdre,” she says, and puts her hand in mine. It is cool and soft. “It’s just this way,” she says, and leads me out of my room and along the hallway down which I made my brief escape yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now,” the girl says, nodding seriously, her eyes focusing ahead. “Just speak if spoken to; she doesn’t like questions, so you’d do best not to ask any; refer to her as Lady Rose; there’s a button above her night table, a white one—press it if she becomes ill. She’s in charge of things. The House Governor will do anything she asks, so be sure to stay on her good side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stop before the door, and Deirdre reties the belt of my robe into a perfect bow. She knocks on the semi-open door and says, “Lady Rose? I brought her like you said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, then, let her in,” Rose snaps. “And go make yourself useful somewhere else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she turns to leave, Deirdre clasps both of her hands around one of mine. Her eyes are round as moons. “And please,” she whispers, “try to avoid the topic of death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she’s gone, I push the door open and step only as far as the threshold. From here I can smell the medications Rose complained of yesterday. I see the assortment of lotions, pills, and bottles on her nightstand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s sitting up today, in a satin-upholstered divan by the window. Her blond hair is tangled in sunlight, and her skin appears to be less sallow. There’s color in her cheeks, and at first I think she’s feeling better, but when she beckons me closer, I can see the unusual almost neon pink of her cheeks, and I know it must be cosmetics. I know the red of her lips must not be real either. What are real are her eyes, incredibly brown things that stare at me with intensity, with youth. I try to imagine a world of natural humans, when twenty was youthful, when it was years from a death sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatural humans used to live for at least eighty years, my mother told me. Sometimes a hundred. I hadn’t believed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I can see what she meant. Rose is the first twenty-year-old I’ve spoken to at length, and though she’s stifling a cough that sprays blood into her fist, her skin is still smooth and soft. Her face is still full of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t look very different from, or very much older than, me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit,” she tells me. I find a chair across from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are wrappers all over the floor around her, and a bowl on her divan filled with candies. When she speaks, I can see that her tongue is bright blue. She fiddles with another candy in her long fingers, bringing it close to her face, almost looking like she’ll kiss it. Instead she lets it fall back into the bowl. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wither-the-chemical-garden-1/page-3.html","bookId":1761,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:41 AM"}
