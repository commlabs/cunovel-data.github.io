McCarthy ushered Lucia inside and closed the door, flicked the interior dead bolt and put his back against it. The manila envelope was clutched tight in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was close quarters in the room, and even though it was well ventilated, the chemical soup of developer burned her nose and throat. Empty developing trays were laid out, and there was a clothesline of drying prints at the far end of the room, above the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in the hell is this about?\" Lucia demanded. Her head was aching from the secrecy. \"Why am I the only one who\u0027s safe? Ben, you have to explain this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t open the envelope. Instead, he said, \"I was approached in prison after I got the beating, the one that put me in the hospital. I knew I was a goner in there, you understand? No way was I going to survive if the Cross Society decided I needed to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made a deal with them to get out of prison. I know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to understand, Lucia. I didn\u0027t know you. I didn\u0027t know anything about you, except that the Cross Society had picked you. You were a name on a piece of paper to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a table at her back. The edge of it dug into her spine, low and cold. \"Ben - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have agreed to anything to get the hell out of there. I\u0027m not proud of that. I\u0027m not proud of much in my life, but that was a low point.\" He tried for a smile, and it came out wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt it coming, the way wild animals seemed to sense earthquakes on the way. \"Ben, are you saying your alibi was a fake? Did you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill them?\" His blue eyes were utterly unreadable in this red light. They didn\u0027t look blue at all, just empty. \"Couple of drug dealers who were responsible for at least half a dozen bodies, and those were just the ones they\u0027d personally whacked? Who\u0027d sold crack to ten-year-old kids and seventy-year-old grandmothers? Who raped when they wanted, stole when they wanted, and ran their block like some kind of prison camp? Or do you mean the girlfriend, who was so high she once sold her own two-year-old daughter to a pedophile to pay off a loan? Who couldn\u0027t even sober up enough to call the cops when her kid fell down the stairs and broke her neck, so she put her out with the garbage instead? God, Lucia. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were tears in his eyes. Tears on his cheeks. She couldn\u0027t tell if they were from fury, pain or regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr loss, the loss of what they\u0027d nearly had, the loss of possibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, he gave her the truth himself. \"No. I didn\u0027t kill them, but God, I should have. The pictures exonerating me were legit. Still, the Cross Society would have let me rot in prison for something I didn\u0027t do. I figure they arranged the whole thing the first time so that I was in cold storage, so they could have me when they needed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiped his cheeks distractedly with the palm of his hand. Now that he\u0027d started looking directly at her, he didn\u0027t seem to be able to stop. As if he was hungry for the sight of her, and knew this was going to be his last chance. \"They wanted me to meet you,\" he said. \"And they wanted me to get you in bed as soon as I possibly could.\" It hit her as funny, because she\u0027d been braced for so I much worse. She laughed out loud, involuntarily, and covered her mouth with her hand. \"That\u0027s it?\" she asked, and swallowed lunatic giggles. \u0027That\u0027s their big master plan? Get us laid? You didn\u0027t even - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped. All of the humor fell away, down a black hole that didn\u0027t seem to have any bottom to it at all. \"I was going to say you didn\u0027t even try,\" she said slowly. \"But that\u0027s not true, is it? That first night. The apartment. You thought about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said hoarsely. \"I wanted it. I needed you. I mean, I would have done it if it had just been sex, but dammit, you were - do you understand? I looked at you and I wanted you. Not a lie. I wanted something real, not just - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered him pulling away and stalking to the window. Drinking his beer in convulsive gulps. Do they call cabs, your guys downstairs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis choice. And again, the second time. She\u0027d asked him back to the apartment. He\u0027d - turned her down. She\u0027d even been surprised by it. Hurt by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought that this one time, at least, I could make a decision for myself. But I couldn\u0027t. They took it away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God. Ben, what\u0027s in the envelope?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Proof that I\u0027m no longer necessary in all this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the envelope. There were pictures inside. She saw him look down at them, and he made a sound, an animal groan of pain, and slid down the door to a crouch. Staring at the photos. Shuffling through them. \"You bastards,\" he whispered. \"They made these for me. Just to show me how little I matter. How they can take everything away.\" She couldn\u0027t stand it. She lunged forward and grabbed for them. He moved, lightning-quick, and took hold of her forearms, pulling her down to her knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photos spilled over the concrete floor between them, glowing in the lurid red light. Black-and-white photos, taken from above. Grainy, as if ripped from a surveillance feed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman lying on a white hospital-style bed, wearing a loose gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnees up. Feet in stirrups. Some kind of medical procedure. Some kind of...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia cried out and buried her face in McCarthy\u0027s shoulder. In his warmth and strength. He kissed the top of her head and rocked her, and she twisted to stare at the photos again, silent now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stroking of his hand on her hair was almost hypnotic. \"It\u0027s all a game to them. Percentages,\" he said. \"Anthrax to get you sick and vulnerable, and keep you running scared. They\u0027d planned to check you into the hospital and get it done there, but Eidolon kept disrupting things, forcing their hand. I didn\u0027t carry through on getting you in bed, but it didn\u0027t matter, they had a backup plan. When you finally did collapse, when you were unguarded - they took you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at the photographs. The details of an invasion of her body, clinically photographed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dreamed,\" she murmured. \"I dreamed of lights... This was it, wasn\u0027t it? It wasn\u0027t all treatments for the anthrax. The feeling of violation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer. There didn\u0027t seem much point, she supposed. It was right there, in the pictures. The doctors with their tools and their completely scientific rape of her body. \"How many times?\" She felt as if there was a huge weight on her lungs, suffocating her. Like the old wives\u0027 tale of waking with the cat on her chest, stealing her breath. This could not be true. Could not be happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. As many as it took to make sure, I suppose.\" His voice sounded raw. Bloody. \"You\u0027re just a tool, Lucia. Just a body and a genetic code and a place in history, standing where they need somebody to stand, for the greater good.\" The weight of sarcasm he gave the last two words made her shiver. \"And our baby\u0027s going to be exactly the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stirred and looked up. Her hair had fallen over her face, and she pulled it back out of the way. \"Our baby?\" He kissed her. Not on the lips, on the forehead. A burning kiss of anguish and apology. \"I can\u0027t be sure without a DNA test, but yeah. They took sperm samples during the tests in the prison hospital, before they told me what I was supposed to do. That was what they wanted from me. Pretty much all they ever wanted. Their backup plan, in case I -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;got difficult about things. I guess just anybody wouldn\u0027t do. Had to be me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat in silence, surrounded by the fallen photographs, wrapped around each other for comfort, until Jazz rapped on the door and asked if everything was okay in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia straightened, wiped her face free of moisture, and forced a smile to her lips. McCarthy, bleached of color by the lights, looked awful. She didn\u0027t expect she looked any better. \"Nobody else needs to know,\" she said. \"You and me. Nobody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jazz - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Nobody. Promise me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise.\" He gave her a wan, empty smile. \"The least I can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"The least you can do is think of yourself. Whatever that is. Leave. Stay. Hate me. Love me. Do what\u0027s in your heart, Ben. Whatever that is, just do it. Quit making decisions based on what you think I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes opened wider, and for a second he didn\u0027t move or speak. She wasn\u0027t sure if he was thinking or just feeling stunned. And then, without saying a word, he kissed her. A hot, damp, desperate kiss, tasting of tears. Wild, distilled passion. His hands rose to cup the back of her head, urging her closer, and his tongue nudged her lips apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur choice, she thought, with what little conscious thought she had in that moment. One pure thing. Just one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke the kiss with a tearing gasp and buried his face in the hollow of her neck. The moan that came out of him moved through her like a holy visitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell was that?\" she asked, shaky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to stay there forever, in the safe red light, suspended in the warmth of this moment, but she reached down and scraped the pictures together, and slid them into the envelope. He straightened up and put his hands on her shoulders, then her face. Thumb tracing her damp, swollen lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make it your choice, Lucia. Let them chew on that.\" She held the proof of her weakness in her hands, and the proof of her strength in her heart. \"We will,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all staring when she and McCarthy returned. Jazz opened her mouth to ask, but Lucia stopped her with a look. \"Our business,\" she said. \"It\u0027s nothing to do with anybody else. Right, Sirnms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head to one side. \"As you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want this over. I want us out of your business, the Cross Society\u0027s business, Eidolon\u0027s business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s never going to happen,\" Simms said, \"as long as the Cross Society and Eidolon are in operation. Especially now.\" He gave her midsection a fast but significant glance. She sat down at the table and put the envelope in front of her. A silent reminder of just how high the stakes were now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we shut them down. All of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t,\" Borden argued. \"The Cross Society does do good, you know that! Look how many people you\u0027ve saved because of the leads they gave you. You can\u0027t just - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy, who hadn\u0027t spoken, turned toward him, fists clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, now you want to beat on me?\" Borden cried. \"Fine. Let\u0027s go. I\u0027m sick of your macho cop bullshit - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"James, don\u0027t,\" Jazz said. For her, the response was mild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, James, don\u0027t,\" McCarthy echoed. \"Be a good little lawyer and shut the hell up about what doesn\u0027t concern you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back off, Ben.\" Jazz was up, suddenly, standing between them. \"You want to take whatever this is out on somebody, hell, bring it on, I\u0027d love to kick somebody\u0027s ass today. Might as well be yours. I\u0027m pissed as hell at you, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need you to fight for me, Jazz!\" Borden spat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Against Ben? You\u0027re kidding, right?\" She held up her hands and backed out of the way. \"Fine. You guys arm wrestle for biggest jerk in the room. Let us know who comes out on top. We\u0027ve got bigger problems than this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was deadly serious. The tension in the room cranked steadily higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now.\" She turned back to Lucia. \"You were saying...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimms, significantly, perhaps, hadn\u0027t said a word. He wasn\u0027t watching the brewing confrontation. His eyes hadn\u0027t left Lucia, but she had a sudden eerie feeling that he was seeing through her, beyond her, into some limitless and terrifying distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did I just change?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a constant,\" Simms said slowly. \"Eidolon would like to kill you, but there\u0027s no time line I can see in which you don\u0027t survive and - \" he caught himself and glanced at the others \"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and carry out the task that the Cross Society intended. In other words, unlike the rest of us, your fate is assured, Ms. Garza.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning that you are a fulcrum upon which we can move the world.\" He looked grim suddenly. Tired, and every moment of his age, \"You can do anything you want to do. And I hope you understand how grave a responsibility that is. I created Eidolon to help me understand what I was seeing, to right some of the wrongs in this world. And I learned that when you act with knowledge, fate reacts against you. The more good we did, the more evil there was, as if it was being bred specifically to counter us, like antibodies. I wanted to stop. I established the Cross Society to work at cross-purposes to Eidolon, to try to undo some of the terrible consequences.\" He sagged further in his seat. \"The world works on balance. I understand that now. There can be no greater good, because once it is greater, it is no longer good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all silent, watching him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is something you can do,\" Simms said. \"Destroy it. Bring it down. You are the only one who can do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden shot up again, eyes wide. \"You can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can. She will. More than that, Mr. Borden, she should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t be part of destroying the Cross Society!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t have to,\" Jazz said. \"Eidolon\u0027s the one who\u0027s got the upper hand. We go after them, right, Simms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Problem solved.\" Jazz stood up. \"L. Ben. Let\u0027s get busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorden moved toward her. Intimately close, trying to hold her eyes. \"What about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put a hand flat on his chest. \"Your decision,\" she said. \"I love you. I want to be with you. But you have to choose now, because I\u0027m not going to be a cog in somebody else\u0027s machine the rest of my life. We\u0027re expendable to them, and personally, I don\u0027t consider you expendable at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, and with a heart-stoppingly tender gesture, covered her fingers with his own. Jazz was not a small woman, but his hand dwarfed hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit,\" she said. \"Quit the damn Society. Please, Borden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent forward and kissed her. A long, thorough, sweet kiss, as if there was nobody else in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to fight for what I believe in,\" Borden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if the guy who founded it doesn\u0027t believe anymore. I can\u0027t change my heart that easily. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz blinked. For a second there were tears in her eyes, and in the next, they were gone, drained away, and something hard and unyielding had replaced them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too,\" she said, and shoved him away with an explosion of force. He staggered back, hit the pillar behind him and rebounded. She sidestepped, added momentum with a straight arm across his shoulder blades, and he sprawled facedown across the table. Jazz stepped in, grabbed his left wrist and twisted it up, then patted her pockets absently. \"Dammit. Anybody got handcuffs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny of them might have - Ben, Jazz, Lucia - but instead, it was Pansy Taylor, looking rumpled and fresh from bed, wrapped in a robe, who walked in on bare feet and tossed a gleaming set of police issue on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I even want to know,\" McCarthy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning.\" Pansy yawned, and watched as Jazz snapped handcuffs on her former boss. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"End of the world,\" McCarthy said. He was still sitting, head propped on his hand, watching as Borden squirmed and struggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Pansy said. \"Just checking. Coffee, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, all around. Better get a straw for Borden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Screw you, McCarthy,\" Borden panted. Jazz grabbed him by the handcuffs and got him upright, then seated. \"Dammit, Jazz, you can\u0027t keep me here like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, I can,\" she stated. \"And later on, we\u0027ll talk about better ways to handle our relationship issues, but for right now? Handcuffs work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy laughed. A flush mounted in Borden\u0027s face, and Lucia thought that if he\u0027d had superpowers, those handcuffs would be breaking like glass right about now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t. You are a fulcrum upon which we can move the world. Lucia had the uncomfortable feeling that only one of them qualified today as a superhero, and she didn\u0027t like the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to make a phone call,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody commented. Jazz was too preoccupied with avoiding Borden\u0027s glares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia stood up and walked to an emptier corner of the vast warehouse space, away from the lights. Out on the perimeter, the feeling of loneliness increased. It was like leaving the orbit of the Earth, launching out into a cold and uncaring darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dialed a number on her cell phone, spoke her name very clearly after the beep and left a callback number. Exactly forty-five seconds after she\u0027d hung up, her cell phone rang, and she flipped it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is an unexpected pleasure, my love,\" Gregory Ivanovich said. He did sound gratified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you take the pictures?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence for a second. She might have actually succeeded in throwing him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I captured them from surveillance, yes.\" No jokes. Gregory knew it wasn\u0027t a joking matter. \"You know who is the father? I deeply regret to inform you it was not me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d surprised him, again. \"Are we so close that you should think I would give another favor, dorogaya? For nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for nothing. Favor for favor. Yours to be named later, no questions asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d put yourself in my debt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered it. \"From anyone else, I would say that you would be lying to me, and that would be most unpleasant for both of us. But from my dear Lushenka I will grant the possibility you will keep your word. Very well. Favor for favor. What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An electromagnetic pulse device.\" If she\u0027d thought she\u0027d surprised him before, she\u0027d been wrong. This was surprise, this long stretch of humming silence. He was on an airplane, she thought. Probably riding first class, luxuriating in leather seats, eating beluga caviar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we are trading big favors, I see. Very, very big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need it fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In terms of trading, we are in the blue chips, yes?
