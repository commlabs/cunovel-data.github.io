A massive pit of flames burned, and even the surrounding stone was melted into magma. A terrifying heat wave flowed outwards, causing the temperature in a radius of dozens of miles to be hotter than a stove.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian had fallen into this pit.

The Heaven Absorbing Demon Art was the transcendent divine might created by Empyrean Demondawn. It was an utterly cruel, evil, and merciless cultivation method. If Empyrean Demondawn were to use this ability, he could instantly suck dry the life force and blood vitality of a hundred million people!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBecause of this cultivation method, Empyrean Demondawn was dreaded and feared by the world. In the past, when he was at the Holy Lord realm, he had already established the elementary form of the Heaven Absorbing Demon Art. At that time, not even World King influences had dared to move against him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Xiao Moxian is going to use the Heaven Absorbing Demon Art.

Although Lin Ming had the upper hand a moment ago, it\u0027s hard to say just who is in a better state right now. If I had to choose, I would say that Xiao Moxian’s background is a bit better!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian had indeed been injured just now, but the body of a God Beast possessed unbelievable endurance.

He wouldn’t be able to continually burn his blood essence. In other words, it was impossible for Lin Ming to maintain the previous state from before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHu – Hu – Hu –\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe black vortex began to spin faster and faster.

However, the number of phoenixes that truly managed to complete nine revolutions of nirvana was extremely small!

Her flesh and blood would burn in a sea of fire, causing her strength to dramatically rise, and she would even obtain the ability to combust her blood essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Xiao Moxian at that time would be ridiculously terrifying.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“My goal is to surpass the boundary of an Empyrean.

If they were determined to become an Empyrean instead, then they would be turned into a joke by others. Even White King didn’t have the courage to say such words.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, Xiao Moxian actually said she wanted to surpass an Empyrean!

The history of the Divine Realm is long beyond all of our imaginations. How can we know if there has ever existed someone that has surpassed the realm of an Empyrean? I heard that in ancient times, 3.6 billion years ago, there was once a peerless powerhouse who was suspected to have surpassed the boundary of an Empyrean. And that Xiao Moxian is definitely the top genius to appear in the last 100 million years. There might be a chance she could surpass the boundary of an Empyrean.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That’s right, if Xiao Moxian says she will surpass the boundary of an Empyrean in this situation, then there really might exist a realm above an Empyrean!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo those in the audience, an Empyrean was a distant and illusory concept.

The Heaven Absorbing Demon Art is a cruel and overbearing cultivation method that absorbs all true essence. Although your Fire Laws are powerful, they cannot restrain the Heaven Absorbing Demon Art.
