What I\u0027m saying, if that case bothers her— if she is down here trying to make some kind of moral amends—her motives are suspect. Her judgment might not be too clear. I\u0027m not sure you should encourage her to represent your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at my cold eggs, then the phone bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lopez, why did Jimmy Doebler call you in April?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"April 16. A short call, about five in the afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez was silent, as if thinking back. \"He wanted information— the files on the death of his mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That didn\u0027t strike you as strange?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jimmy said he\u0027d been gathering information about his mom, wanted to understand her life. What makes a guy do that? I don\u0027t know. Jimmy\u0027s past with his mom ain\u0027t what you should be worried about, Navarre. It\u0027s Jimmy\u0027s past with your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The accident. Your brother blamed Jimmy for what happened to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Tres. I\u0027ve been doing my homework. Jimmy taught your brother how to jump trains. Then Jimmy didn\u0027t show up one night, left Garrett on his own, went up to see his mom. Your brother got maimed, didn\u0027t speak to Jimmy afterward for what—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyears, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a long time ago, Lopez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soured him pretty bad on the Doeblers. Maybe Garrett didn\u0027t take out his hostilities at the time, but there\u0027s no telling how long somebody\u0027s fuse is, or what\u0027ll finally set it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby McBride, for instance. I suppose you know Garrett and she met at UT? they took some upperdivision math courses together. I suppose you know they were an item before Garrett had his accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I lied. \"So what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that was an old wound,\" Lopez continued, \"if Garrett got into business with Ruby and Jimmy after all those years, thinking he was okay, and then Jimmy started to get romantic with Ruby—a lady Garrett used to love . . . You see how it could go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see where you could put it, Lopez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tell Garrett I\u0027d welcome a phone call, okay? Be good if he came to me voluntarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe we could work something out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could respond, Lopez had hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked my watch, found that my hands were trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed my tai chi sword and went down the trail to the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning was as cool as an oven door, just before the knob is turned to preheat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used Jimmy\u0027s concrete slab as my workout surface, started with basic stances, ten minutes each. It was therapeutic, getting the sting in my muscles, until I turned north and found myself staring at the unfinished kiln.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remnants of the barbecue fire were still in the doorway. The little red kiln goddess grinned at me. She didn\u0027t seem to mind her left arm being shot off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter ten years doing tai chi, I still rarely achieve a truly meditative state. This morning was no exception. All the way through the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYang long form, I tried to push thoughts out of my head, but they kept crowding back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Maia Lee, the way she\u0027d looked on Windy Point with the sun in her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Matthew Pena and Victor Lopez, trying to decide who was more dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly I thought about Garrett and Ruby on the deck in the meteor shower—the look of mutual recrimination they\u0027d given each other. If Lopez was right, Garrett and Ruby had known each other as long as Garrett and Jimmy had—since college, at least. And yet, Garrett had never mentioned Ruby\u0027s name to me. There were only two explanations I could think of—that the relationship was not important enough to mention, or that the relationship was too important to mention. I wasn\u0027t betting on the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I went into my sword set, the sun was coming up full force, turning the lake to metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat stirred the air, moving through the branches of the cedars with a sound like a distant nest of rattlers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finished, I\u0027d thoroughly soaked the Coral Reefer Tshirt with sweat. The exertion had brought Jimmy Doebler\u0027s smell out of the fabric—his copal incense and deodorant, smells I associated with trips to the coast as a child. I promised myself I\u0027d work out in my own damn shirt tomorrow morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sheathed the sword and was about to head back up to the dome, but I found myself staring at the kiln.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mortar had dried in the bucket, Garrett\u0027s trowel embedded in it. The stack of bricks sat nearby, the copper binding snapped and sproinging to four sides as if the bricks had landed on and squashed a metal spider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, Jimmy\u0027s wooden pottery rack was draped in plastic tarp. Underneath, the shelves were stacked with unfired pots—some red clay, some white clay, all glazed but unfired. They looked ugly that way, like Easter eggs dipped in too many dye pans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe another day of masonry. Then the gas lines would have to be hooked up. The iron doors would have to be hung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. You\u0027re crazy, Navarre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I started up the path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew something was wrong when I saw Robert Johnson on the porch, the front door cracked open. I never leave a door open and I never let Robert Johnson outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he didn\u0027t quite know what to do with himself. He was sniffing something on the porch—something gray and glistening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got closer I caught the smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped up, moved around the thing, quickly scooped up Robert Johnson. \"That\u0027s not for you,\" I chastened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went inside, did a quick scan of the room, went directly to the kitchen counter and retrieved Erainya\u0027s gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered to look upstairs this time. There was no one in the house. I checked the back—the outhouse, the shed. Nobody there. I walked the circumference of the dome, looked at the driveway for new tire tracks, checked my truck. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing—except for what was on the porch. I went back and stared at the thing, tried to breathe through my mouth to keep the stench out of my nostrils. Robert Johnson kicked his hind claws into my stomach, trying to get down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe catfish was nearly three feet long—as big as the hotdogfed monsters I\u0027d seen at the bottom of Lake Travis. Its whiskers were limp gray whips. Judging by the smell, the fish had been allowed to rot overnight before being dumped here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts belly had only just been gutted, the rancid innards allowed to spill across Jimmy Doebler\u0027s porch. There were undigested pieces of hot dog in the milky fluid. Fish eyes usually strike me as expressionless, but this one\u0027s seemed terrified, amazed, like it still could not get over the fact that its demise had not come by fishhook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing had been impaled—as if speared by a scuba diver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDate: Mon 12 Jun 2000 02:36:40 0000 From:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/* */ To:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/* */ Subject: the private eye Ah, the private eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember a late afternoon in January, not long after my incident in the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d gone home. It would\u0027ve looked bad if I hadn\u0027t. And of course, once home—I found myself alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a foul mood. My night in the country had left a bad taste in my mouth—hollow victory. I hadn\u0027t seen their faces, hadn\u0027t been able to let them know I was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany nights thereafter, I\u0027d found myself in the bathroom, the Old Man\u0027s straight razor pressed against my wrist. Or I would be standing at the medicine cabinet, staring at bottles. Never any shortage of prescription drugs around the old homestead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt cheated. The only thing left worth destroying, I didn\u0027t have the courage for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when I answered the doorbell that afternoon, I pitied whoever it was—a nuisance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA policeman. A family friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I got a small balding man in a threadbare suit, his eyes blinking excessively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held a briefcase in one hand, a business card ready in the other. The line on the card, right under his name, read: Discreet Investigations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t come looking for me, but when he learned who I was, he asked to come in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could I say? He intrigued me with his card and his demeanour. I wondered if he were good at his work, simply because he was so small. So unimposing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe private eye complimented the house, which seemed strange to me. I\u0027d lived there so long I\u0027d never thought of it as nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on the sofa. I sat in a chair across the coffee table. I remember the curtains were drawn, not that it mattered. No one ever looked in those windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little man showed me photos of people I did not recognize, dropped names I did not know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, when he saw that I wasn\u0027t responding, he told me a story that spelled out the connections. He told me who he was looking for, and why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if a magnifying glass had been held up to my eyes. The world expanded twenty times, got fuzzy around the edges, perfectly focused in the centre. I looked at the pictures again, realized what they had to do with me. I realized this small man had done something I could never have done on my own—he had crystallized my hatred into something coherent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must\u0027ve read the change in my face. There was no way I could hide it. He said, very carefully, \"You know the name, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admitted that is was familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s money to be had,\" the private eye suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the wrong thing to say, and I think he realized it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d gotten too excited at the possibility of a lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shabby private eye was an entrepreneur. He had gone beyond what he\u0027d been paid to do. He\u0027d found himself a tawdry secret, and he meant to exploit its market potential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him I had some papers he might be interested in, asked if he would excuse me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see his apprehension lift. He was thinking he\u0027d finally caught a break. He would get home in time for dinner now. It was probably a long drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like a drink?\" I offered.\"Hot chocolate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe declined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat negated my easiest option, but no matter. I smiled, said I would be right back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went into the study. The Old Man\u0027s things were there, his World War II trophies. My eyes fixed on one possibility, and I took the thing down from its display rack. I grabbed a box of papers—I don\u0027t remember what they were. It didn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back into the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anger inside me felt like a steel rod, as stiff and old as the blade in my hand. It was a horrible choice, but I hadn\u0027t had any time to think. I had to improvise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe private eye looked at the sword curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll see the connection,\" I promised.\"It\u0027s a family heirloom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the box of papers on his knees, began flipping through them.\"I don\u0027t—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toward the bottom,\" I apologized.\"! didn\u0027t sort them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drew the sword. It was a Japanese Imperial officer\u0027s weapon— ornamental, but functional. It said much about the Old Man that the metal was brown with age except the point, the blade. The ornamental dragon, the clouds and demons some craftsman had worked so hard to fashion down the spine of the blade—the Old Man had had no use for them. He had only maintained the punishing side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe private eye looked up, uneasy, but still not alarmed. I was, after all, a kid. A kid who had been helpful, offered him hot chocolate. Perhaps, in the back of his mind, he suspected that I might be the one he was looking for. That would be valuable to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Incredible workmanship,\" I told him.\"The family connection is right here. There\u0027s an inscription near the point.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-19.html","bookId":2419,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
