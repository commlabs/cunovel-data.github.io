These valleys were deep and secretive. If one entered in and sealed up the entrances with array formations, it would become a relatively safe place to train.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, Lin Ming had sealed up a valley and was meditating within.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith the dreamland energy he absorbed from Highdragon, Lin Ming nourished the third divine dream mark. This divine dream mark was now glowing with a brilliant light, just a hint away from reaching perfection.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“A human body’s essence, energy, and divine, each one corresponds to a different cultivation system… similarly, the Magic Cube, Demon Bead, and Purple Card each correspond to one aspect of essence, energy and divine. This shouldn’t be a coincidence, but one of the truths that originally existed in this universe. For these countless years, these three cultivation systems had constantly grown and been developed, but because of the current rules of the universe, cultivating the essence gathering system was the most practical.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“If I’m not wrong, the Magic Cube, Demon Bead, and Purple Card are the three highest divine tools that assist in soul cultivation, body transformation, and essence gathering, three different types of cultivation system. With them in hand, one can cultivate the corresponding system with twice the results and half the effort. When Empyrean Primordius fought with Empyrean Thunder Punishment in the past, the reason was 90% because of the Demon Bead. Empyrean Primordius should have also trained in dual body and energy cultivation. And with his Empyrean realm cultivation as well as the support of the Demon Bead, he finally stepped into the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming could feel that his understandings of these ancient secrets were becoming increasingly clear. For the Verdant Feather Holy Lands to be able to obtain the Magic Cube was a complete stroke of luck. Countless hundreds of millions of years ago when the Magic Cube first appeared, it was likely also obtained by some martial artist as a massive lucky chance and likely even set off a bloody catastrophe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“If I can obtain the Magic Cube, Demon Bead, and Purple Card together, and then cultivate essence, energy, and divine, I wonder just what boundary my strength will reach…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was unable to imagine how high such a boundary would be.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEmpyrean Primordius and Empyrean Divine Dream had reasons for being known as the most formidable existences amongst Empyreans. This was because while they trained in the essence gathering system, they also trained in another system and had extremely high attainments in that too. This was something that other Empyreans could not compare with.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I’m focusing on essence gathering and body transformation now, but if I could obtain the Purple Card and Demon Bead then that would be great.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming realized that in truth, the Magic Cube was the least valuable of the three divine tools to him. This was because his achievements in soul cultivation were the lowest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Once I’m strong enough, I definitely have to return to the Eternal Demon Abyss… I’ll look around and see what secrets are within. Perhaps the Demon Bead might really be inside…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming thought this, he suddenly heard a faint and fuzzy voice shouting from the distance. Because these shouts echoed through the forests and valleys and layers of clouds, they had connected together in a stretch of sound that made it hard to distinguish between the syllables.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithin this blurry stretch of sound, Lin Ming heard his own name.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s eyebrows arched up. His figure moved and in the next moment he had left the valley.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter flooding his ears with true essence, Lin Ming was finally able to clearly hear these shouts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, your death has come!

I was originally planning to look for you, but you’re the one who looks for me instead. Moreover, you’re declaring a challenge against me in such an arrogant manner. If I didn’t go, wouldn’t that just be unfair to you?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFighting Wu Finalcloud was one of Lin Ming’s most fervent desires right now. Out of all the disciples of the True Martial Holy Lands, he was the one with the highest number of merit points. If Lin Ming killed him then he would be able to obtain a considerable amount of dreamland energy, enough to bring his fourth divine dream mark to near perfection.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the many disciples of the True Martial Holy Lands shouted in the skies, it wasn’t just Lin Ming who heard them, but also all of the other participants hunting in Demon Sealing Ridge.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Who is Lin Ming? He’s actually someone that Wu Finalcloud deems worthy to challenge? Is he that fellow that has been repeatedly attacking disciples from the True Martial Holy Lands for these past days in Demon Sealing Ridge?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yes, that’s him! I came from Immemorial Imperial City so I know of him. At the Imperial City Auction, Lin Ming is the one who bought the Boundless World Pill with 7 trillion violet sun stones.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What? 7 trillion? Violet sun stones!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs this figure of 7 trillion violet sun stones was spoke, many participants were dumbfounded. Most of them came from ordinary Holy Land level influences, so to them 7 trillion was an astronomical figure.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It was definitely violet sun stones. This Lin Ming is extremely powerful. He killed many masters and he doesn’t keep his profile low either. Now, because he kept bullying those low level disciples of the True Martial Holy Lands… I think that the True Martial Holy Lands are finally mobilizing against him…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The True Martial Holy Lands are used to being the strongest and most domineering force around, and they don’t allow others to challenge their dignity. I don’t know whether or not he’ll accept this challenge, but let’s go to the city gates to have a look anyways.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm, I’m also thinking the same thing.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe many martial artists of Demon Sealing Ridge, after hearing the challenge of the True Martial Holy Lands, rushed towards True Martial City.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this rush of people were also many of Lin Ming’s enemies – Sacred Martial Mansion’s three prodigies as well as Zhong Wenshu.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This Lin Ming, he really brought about his own death.

He had a profound memory of Lin Ming’s great strength. Moreover, there was that unfathomably deep feeling that he felt from Lin Ming. Even if it was Wu Finalcloud, whether he could kill Lin Ming was still an unknown.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Let’s go! We’re going to return to the city and enjoy this play!” Sacred Yueping excitedly said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e…………..\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSoon, many participants were gathered at the majestic True Martial City. The skies above the city were a zone that forbade fighting. Many martial artists gathered in this safety zone so they could watch the fight in peace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, at the gates of True Martial City, seven or eight disciples of the True Martial Holy Lands were standing side by side. These seven or eight people were all core disciples of the True Martial Holy Lands.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd in front of them was a dragon throne cast from metal. The back of this throne was engraved with images of dragons and phoenixes. Wu Finalcloud sat on this dragon throne. He wore white clothes and he reclined imperiously, his chest resting against a raised fist in a languid posture.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Elder Senior-apprentice Brother, this boy might be too scared to show up. If he doesn’t come then we’ll have waited in vain.” Several True Martial Holy Land disciples said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWu Finalcloud faintly smiled.

In that direction, they could make out the vague shadow of someone’s figure. It was a blue-clothed youth and he was racing towards them at an incredible speed. In just a breath of time, he had appeared in front of them from the distant horizon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s really him!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He actually came, he’s quite the brave one!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHo - !\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming steadily fell onto the giant square in front of True Martial City.

They only saw that his true essence was thicker than usual and his eyes were far brighter and keener than expected. But just by depending on these two things it was extremely difficult to judge his strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming?” Wu Finalcloud directly asked, sitting up from his dragon throne.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Wu Finalcloud?” Lin Ming didn’t answer, instead asking another question.

His right hand grasped the spear shaft and he drew an icy cold arc in the air. Then, he pointed it towards Wu Finalcloud, the provocation evident in his eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It seems we are both confident in our strength!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWu Finalcloud sneered.
