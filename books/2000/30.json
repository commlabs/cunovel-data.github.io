Ahh,” Understanding flickers her eyes. “You just slept with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never actually slept with anyone. But … we did have sex, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe steps back, moving away from me, forcing me to let go of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you told me about what you used to do … with women … and it’s fine, I’m not judging you. Not at all. And I know this is only our first date, and I don’t have a lot of experience in the dating field … well, when it comes to men in general, but I do know one thing … when I’m with someone, I’m with just them. And I want them to be the same with me. I understand if that’s different for you, but if you want to be with other women while we date … then I’m sorry, I’m not the right girl for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEh? I’m not entirely sure where this is coming from. I thought I’d been very clear about how I feel about her, but obviously not, so she needs to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mia, I’ve never really been with anyone to define parameters … I’ve never had a relationship. I’ve never dated anyone. You’re the first person I’ve ever had a real date with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t say anything, her face blank, and I get this sudden ache in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I’m losing her before I’ve even gotten her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I told you about me, the way I was, the way I behaved … the guy who you just got a glimpse of through Shawna, that is who I was. Not who I am now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wraps her arms around herself in a protective manner. I hate that she feels she needs to shield herself from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What changed?” Her voice is quiet, wavering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You.” I take the chance and move close to her again, closing my hands around her upper arms. She doesn’t pull away. It gives me hope. “You changed things for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks away. “You’ve … changed things for me too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, tugging on her lower lip with her thumb and forefinger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see you, Mia. Only you.” My gaze drops to her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops tugging on them, her hand falling to her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This Is Love” by Will.i.am starts to filter in the background. The piano medley eases through the crowd toward us. Mia’s eyes lift to mine. My heart starts to kick a beat in my chest. Then the song explodes, like the heat between us, until there’s a bonfire of want flaring all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer breathing falters, coming in quick … her eyes close on one of those sweet, short breaths … her lips part slightly…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment I’ve been waiting for since she walked into the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean into her, cupping her cheek in my hand, more than ready to press my mouth to those sweet lips of hers … and then the noise level around us increases exponentially until my ears are nearly bleeding from the squeals and screams of laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I feel the reason for those screams of laughter when paint splatters all over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia’s eyes flash open, her mouth popping to an O.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMotherfucking paint party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey couldn’t have waited like, five more fucking minutes before blasting out that shit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run my hand through my hair and look down at my palm. It’s streaked with yellow, blue and pink neon paint. Mia’s hand goes to her face. She’s equally as covered with the paint as I imagine I am. Running her fingers over her cheek, then her forehead, she streaks the colors, mixing them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks even more beautiful, if possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncandescent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExotic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd incredibly dangerous to my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up to watch the continuing shower of color, shielding her eyes with her hand, and laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I can’t wait a fucking second longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take her face in my hands, and I kiss her. Hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a tremble in her body. I feel her tense for just a split second, then she relaxes into me and her lips part on a soft moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel it all the way down to my dick. And let’s just say, he’s pretty fucking happy about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding my fingers into her hair, I cup the back of her head. “Is this okay?” I whisper over her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the only answer I need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss her deeper, slipping my tongue into her mouth, needing more of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia’s hands slide up my arms. I can feel the slick of the paint between my skin and hers, and it makes the sensation of her touch even more intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so maybe they’re onto something with this paint thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inches up on her tiptoes, looping her arms around my neck, gripping my hair with her fingers, keeping me with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that she needs to because I have no intention of going anywhere right now. If ever. But I like that she wants me closer. That she doesn’t want to let me go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrap my arms around her tiny waist, enveloping her, lifting her small body against mine. She’s so tiny, so fragile, yet so unbreakable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s fucking amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything I didn’t know I was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I’m fucked. She has me now. If there were ever a chance of me going back after this one taste of her, it’s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m gone for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know she’s meant to be leaving in a little over a week’s time, but I can’t let that happen. I’m going to have to figure out a way to keep her in my life for good. Figure out a way for her to want to stay with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Sixteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a moment could be held in time forever, kept there to revisit and cherished, then mine would be last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would box the memory, tie it tight with a ribbon, and keep it safe for always. Keep it there to open whenever I need to be reminded of a moment of wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know for most girls, going on a date with a guy, being taken to a nightclub and sprayed with neon paint, might not be their idea of an evening to cherish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for me, it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it was my night. Jordan made everything about me. Focused on me. Cared if I was happy, and if I was having a good time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like complete freedom while with another person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could dance how I wanted to dance. Talk to whomever I wanted to. Kiss who I wanted to kiss…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no fear. No control. No anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have never experienced anything like it, but I want to again…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd again…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd again…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like the best slice of freedom cake, topped with whipped cream and sprinkles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jordan was the sprinkles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stayed at the club, wrapped up in each other. When the night was over, and it was time to leave, Jordan and I went back to the hotel together in his car, and Beth got a ride home from Toni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was perfect. It was perfect. And when he walked me to my door, he kissed me goodnight, the sweetest kiss of all. Then he went to his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI showered the paint off best I could, and fell into bed in a cloud of contentedness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I’m lying in bed, wide awake at the butt crack of dawn, unable to go back to sleep. I’m counting the seconds until I can see Jordan again while recounting every moment of last night—barring the bumping into one of Jordan’s previous conquests. I cringe when I think of what she said, and I cringe even worse when I think of what I said to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I hear a knock at my door, I almost leap out of bed in my excitement, not remembering until I’m opening the door that I’m still in my pajamas. I probably look a complete state. I’ve never really been that concerned with how I look, until him. I only ever dressed and looked nice because it was expected of me by Oliver and Forbes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning.” His voice is low and husky. “I didn’t wake you, did I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, he looks gorgeous, even at this early hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I’ve been awake a while. Couldn’t sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me either. I’ve had this girl on my mind all night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyone I know?” I hold back a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDozer comes into view at Jordan’s side, all puppy dog eyes at me. Pushing past Jordan, he comes to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, buddy.” I kneel down to stroke him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might know her,” Jordan says, answering my question. “Blonde hair, blue eyes … beautiful. We went out on a date last night as it happens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just called me beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComposing myself, I look up at Jordan. “Really?” I say, playing along. “So how was the date?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s the thing…” He crouches down, stroking Dozer who’s positioned between us. His fingertips touch mine. Heat flashes up my arm careening straight for my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The date was amazing, and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about her … or her gorgeous mouth ever since…” He leans over Dozer. Close to me. I suck in a breath. “And the thing is, I really need to kiss her again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaboom! The sound of my heart … so loud, I’m sure he must hear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think she needs you to kiss her too,” I breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do?” He swipes his lower lip with his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy insides coil. “Mmm,” I murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes as he brings his mouth to mine, more than ready to taste him and feel the explosion his kiss creates inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s only when I part my lips against his that I remember I haven’t brushed my teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” I say against his mouth, pressing my hand to his chest. “I haven’t brushed my teeth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh.” His hand goes to the back of my head … holding me … kissing me deeper. Apparently he has no issue with my morning breath. I should, but I really don’t want to stop kissing him right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll thought is lost when he runs his tongue along my lower lip, then slips it into my mouth. I curl my fingers into his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis kisses are drugging. I could live a contented life being as high as a kite on him all day long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gets as close to me as he can with a hundred and sixty pound dog laid on the floor between us, and takes my face in both his hands, taking full control of the kiss. It’s at this exact point that I feel things change between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeepen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t ask me why or how, they just do, and I know he feels it too because of the look on his face when he parts his mouth from mine on a gasp, eyes staring deep into mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, in this moment, there’s an unbreakable connection between us. Something tying us together, irrevocably, and no matter what, I’ll never be without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi.” He smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDozer lifts his head between us, nudging Jordan back from me a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle, and stroke Dozer, giving him the attention he wants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, where was I before you distracted me?” He grins, still looking as dazed as I feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were telling me about the awesome date you had last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right, yeah. Well, it was so awesome that I was hoping she’d go on another date with me today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You always could ask her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think she’d say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm…” I press my lips together in thought. “I’m thinking that she’d definitely say yes.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trouble/page-30.html","bookId":2000,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM"}
