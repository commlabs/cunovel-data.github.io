It was completely devoid of any inflection she could use to determine his intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlightly shrugging, she answered, “I guess. I can only speak for my own family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see your father, Vanguard Mariano Martinez died fighting the Inferi Scourge when they invaded the sewer system a few years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwallowing hard, Maria slightly inclined her head in the affirmative. It was still difficult to discuss the death of her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Petersen turned his gaze toward her when she didn’t verbally respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she answered, her emotions threatening to choke her. “Yes, he died fighting the Scrags.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man behind the desk regarded her for several long moments before returning his attention to his pad. “I see you have several siblings and your mother is still living.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you close to them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As close as I can be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clarify that statement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria shifted in her chair uncomfortably. “They live on the far west of the city. It’s hard to get over there more than a few times a year. Since the trains shut down, it’s difficult to find transportation. It’s a full day’s walk to reach that side of the city.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” He tapped the stylus on the screen a few times. “You’re single. Never married. Correct?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of Dwayne, but she nodded in the affirmative. “Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you presently involved with anyone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t see-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you presently involved with anyone, Vanguard?” Mr. Petersen’s gaze was unnerving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria shook her head. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see you can’t have children due to a grievous wound you received in battle. They removed your uterus and ovaries.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwallowing hard, she answered, “Yes, sir.” She was uneasy with the personal aspect of the questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Petersen moved the stylus over the pad, making notations and sorting through several files she could see glowing on the screen. “Are you happy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you happy? Do you find your life satisfying in the city?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria rubbed her lips together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a difficult question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly, she answered, “No. I’m not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you find your patrols on the wall to be a waste of your time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not for me to judge my orders,” she answered briskly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But do you find your patrols on the wall to be a waste of your time?” Mr. Petersen’s gaze was piercing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am aware that a show of strength is important for the morale of the citizens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you feel ineffectual?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding tersely, Maria glared at the man across from her. He was picking at her wounds, making her angry and vulnerable. “I do not understand the line of questioning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Petersen leaned over the pad and made a few more notations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am a good soldier,” Maria continued. “I am well decorated for my bravery in the field. I have done my duty without question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re questioning now,” Mr. Petersen pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria pressed her lips together, considered her words, then said, “You want truthful answers. So do I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlightly arching one brow, Mr. Petersen slowly set his stylus down. Clasping his hands together, he leaned toward her. “What I am looking for, Vanguard Martinez, are soldiers that will be willing to spend an extended period of time on a special mission. If they’re single with not many attachments, they will fare much better than someone with closer familial ties.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria narrowed her eyes slightly, but didn’t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You fit those criteria.” Mr. Petersen’s intense gaze didn’t falter. “Don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly, Maria answered, “Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Petersen picked up his stylus and made another notation. He waited a few moments and then Maria caught sight of a communiqué flashing across his screen. Opening it, Mr. Petersen read it, and then set his stylus aside. Raising his eyes, he said, “Would you be interested in volunteering for a mission that will save the city and all its inhabitants and let us reclaim the valley from the Inferi Scourge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria hesitated as visions of Ryan being overwhelmed by the undead churned in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see you’re a little hesitant.” Mr. Petersen gave her a tight lipped smile. “You were involved in the last great battle against the Inferi Scourge, Vanguard Martinez. You were almost killed. You were rendered infertile. Don’t you wish to seek revenge upon them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would like to see them destroyed. I would like for humanity to be free again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That isn’t an answer to my question.” Mr. Petersen leaned toward her, narrowing his eyes. “Or is it not the Inferi Scourge you blame for your losses? Perhaps you blame your superiors for an ill-conceived battle plan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria flicked her gaze away from the man with the uncomfortable stare and carefully formed an answer. “I did what I was ordered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you feel the battle plan was faulty, no?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria’s mind lingered on the mobile walls getting stuck the in the mushy ground and the steel mesh ripping free. She remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can speak freely with me. In fact, I insist on it. It’s vital that I understand you, Vanguard Martinez.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting her eyes, Maria answered carefully, “I believe that certain factors were not taken into consideration when the battle plan was formalized.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Petersen gave her an unexpected smile, bobbing his head. “I concur! The SWD never supported the battle plan and was absolutely opposed. Commandant Young and the President’s council were adamant that a seventy-two percent probability of success was more than acceptable. We disagreed. In fact, we asked for more time to perfect our own plan to eliminate the Inferi Scourge from the valley and restore order.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If the plan was faulty, why did they do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Petersen tilted his head and gave her an amused look. “You’re a very smart young woman. Why do you think they did it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re running out of resources and time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly. It’s not so hard to surmise. Just walk through the streets of the city and see how much has been lost just in the last twenty years. Soon the city will go dark and humanity will be lost.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is your plan any different?” Maria asked pointedly. “What makes the SWD believe they can be successful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Simple.” Mr. Petersen flashed a wide, unexpected smile. “We found a way to allow our soldiers to walk among the Inferi Scourge without fear of attack or infection. We have found a way to deceive them into believing you’re one of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria gasped and slumped back in her chair in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our newly developed serum requires the healthiest of bodies. Our plan demands the strongest of minds. Once the serum is administered, you will leave the city and systematically clear the valley and close the gate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. “Oh, my God.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amazing, isn’t it? Just when it seems we’re on the verge of extinction, science has delivered us from evil.” Mr. Petersen picked up his stylus. “Now, would you be interested in volunteering for a mission that will save the city and all its inhabitants and let us reclaim the valley from the Inferi Scourge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria nodded her head adamantly. “Yes, absolutely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Petersen smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria was dozing lightly when Dwayne crawled into bed with her. The fans around the bed hummed softly, and her body was cool beneath the thin sheets. As Dwayne’s naked body stretched out next to hers, she rolled over and kissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re awake,” he said, surprised, and wrapped his arms around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re late,” Maria replied. She ran her fingers down over his face, feeling the light poke of his stubble against her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got my message, didn’t you?” Dwayne asked worriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh huh. Dinner with the kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The twins wanted to see me.” Dwayne’s hands gently pushed her hair back from her face, his fingers gentle as always. “Even Caitlyn joined us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria knew that Dwayne’s eldest daughter was usually unavailable. She was an assistant to one of the president’s council members. “How was she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Argumentative as always. I felt like I was on trial. She should have been a lawyer. It was exhausting. I just wanted to get back here and see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just see me?” Climbing on top of him, she whispered softly to him in Spanish, knowing he loved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what the hell you’re saying, but it sounds great,” he said with a little moan as she rubbed her bare breasts over his chest and kissed his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon he was hard and inside her and they gasped as their bodies rode together. Dwayne wrapped his fingers in her hair and kissed her deeply as they came together, perfectly matched as always. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-bastion-of-the-living/page-9.html","bookId":2486,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:06 PM"}
