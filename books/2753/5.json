Other than the holding cell I’ve shared with the fifteen-year-old who’s way too strung out for my taste, this is where I’ve spent the majority of my time since they arrested me for destruction of property. The guard relaxes his back against the wall. I sit at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need a cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbelievably bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike I would rip off my own arm if I could get one drag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you coming down from?” The guard stares at my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop tapping the table. “Nicotine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s rough,” he says. “I never kicked it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. It fucking blows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police officer who arrested me last night—this morning—steps into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She speaks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. Didn’t mean to. I clamp my mouth shut. Last night, this morning—who the hell knows—I managed to keep silent when they grilled me on my mom, my home life, my mom’s boyfriend. I refused to talk, refused to say one word, because if I did, I could have said the wrong thing and sent my mom to jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no way I could live with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea what happened to her or her boyfriend after they snapped the handcuffs on my wrist and sat me in the back of the squad car. If God’s hearing prayers from me, then maybe Mom’s in the clear and the asshole’s sharing a urinal with the other felons-of-the-month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer resembles a twenty-year-old Johnny Depp, and he smells clean—soap with a hint of coffee. He’s not the one who tried to talk to me last night. Just the guy that arrested me. He settles into the seat across from me and the guard leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Officer Monroe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficer Monroe reaches over, unlocks the cuffs, and slides them to his side of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you tell me what really happened last night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust one drag. Oh God, it’d be better than a deep kiss from a really hot guy. But I’m not kissing a hot guy and I don’t have a cigarette because I’m currently being questioned in purgatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mom’s boyfriend, Trent—we know he’s bad news, but he’s smart. We’ve never gotten enough to put him away. Maybe you can help us and yourself. Help us put him in jail, then he’ll be away from you and your mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agree—he’s Satan. Other than the fact that he’s a washed up has-been of a football player who traded tackling men on the field for beating the shit out of women, though, I have nothing to tell them beyond rumors I’ve heard on the street. The cops who walk the south-side beat are well aware of our bedtime stories regarding The Asshole Known as Trent. The tantalizing tidbit that he hits me and Mom could get us a flimsy piece of paper with the words Emergency Protection Order on the header, but domestic violence offenders rarely sit inside jail cells for long, plus Trent burns EPOs and puppies for fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven before my mother got involved with Trent, the police were after him, but he’s the walking, talking real-life version of an oil spill—impossible to pick up once he’s been released. Helping the police will only bring the ooze and his sickening wrath quicker to our doorstep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He lives in the same apartment complex as your mom, right? Wouldn’t it be nice to live with her again and not have to worry about him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving no idea how he knows I don’t live with my mom, I fight hard not to glance at him. Refusing to indicate he’s right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We didn’t even know he was dating your mom. He, uh, sees other women.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep from rolling my eyes. There’s a shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elisabeth,” he says after my nonresponse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beth.” I hate my given name. “My name is Beth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beth, your one phone call has been standing in the lobby since five a.m.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah! My eyes flash to Officer Monroe’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls I built to protect myself crumble and fatigue sets in as the iciness I’ve clung to all night melts. Fear and hurt rush to take its place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want Isaiah. I don’t want to be here. I want to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink, realizing the stinging sensation is tears. Wiping at my face, I try to find my strength—my resolve, but I only find a heavy emptiness. “When can I go home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone knocks. Officer Monroe cracks the door open and exchanges a few heated whispers before nodding. Seconds later, my aunt, an older and cleaner version of my mother, walks in. “Beth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficer Monroe leaves, closing the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley comes straight to me. I stand and let her hug me. She smells like home: stale cigarettes and lavender fabric softener. I bury my face in my aunt’s shoulder, wishing for nothing more than to lie in the bed in her basement for a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cigarette is a close second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Isaiah?” Though I’m grateful for my aunt, my heart was set on seeing my best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Outside. He called me the moment he heard from you.” Shirley squeezes me before breaking our embrace. “What a mess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. Have you seen Mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, then leans in and whispers in my ear, “Your mom told me what really happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muscles around my mouth tighten and I try to stop my lower lip from trembling. “What do I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley runs her hands up and down my arms. “Stick with your story. They brought Trent and your mom in for questioning. With you not talking, they couldn’t find anything to arrest them on. Your mom’s twitchy though. If you talk, they’ll send her to jail for breaking probation and the destruction of property. She’s scared of going to jail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo am I, but Mom can’t hack jail. “What’s going to happen to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer arms drop to her sides and she places the table between us. It’s only a few steps, but it creates a gap resembling a canyon. I turned seventeen last month. Before tonight, I felt like an adult: old and big. I don’t feel so big anymore. Right now I feel small and very, very alone. “Shirley?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your uncle and I don’t have money for a lawyer. Isaiah and Noah, even that girl Noah brings around, they offered what they had, but your uncle and I got scared once the cops told us you took a bat to Trent. Then I had an idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart sinks as if someone yanked a trapdoor right below it. “What did you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you don’t want anything to do with your dad’s side, but his brother, Scott—he’s a good man. Left that baseball team and became a businessman. He has a lawyer. A fancy one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scott?” My mouth gapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How…what…” My breathing becomes shallow as I try to make sense of the insanity falling out of my aunt’s lips. “Impossible. He left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He did,” she says slowly. “But he moved back to his hometown last month and he called me to find you. He wanted you to go live with him and his wife, but we blew him off. Your mom talked to him when he got persistent and she told him you ran away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lip curls at the thought of him anywhere near me. “Good choice. So why involve Scott now? We don’t need him. We can figure this out without him or his fancy lawyer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They said you were going to hit Trent with a bat,” Shirley repeats as she wrings her hands together. “That’s serious and I thought we needed help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Tell me you didn’t.” I’m in hell. Or pretty damn close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We would have respected your wishes about him, but then this happened and…I called him. Listen to me, he has a great life now. Lots of money and he wants you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to laugh. Only it’s not funny. It’s not even close to funny. It’s the saddest damn thing I’ve ever heard. I collapse into the seat and rest my head in my hands. “No, he doesn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He got the charges dropped.” Not a hint of happiness can be found in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep my face hidden, unable to look at her to see whatever truth she’s been building toward. “What did you do?” I ask again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley kneels beside me and pitches her voice low. “When I called him, your uncle Scott went to your mom’s apartment. He saw things he shouldn’t have seen. Things that can hurt your mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sway to the side as if I’ve been hit by a wave and the rushing sound of being sucked into the ocean whirls in my ears. My world is crashing around me. He went into my old room. Mom told me never to go in there after I left to live with Shirley. I never have. There are things even I don’t want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t tell the police,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked by her revelation, I peek at her through my fingers. “Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley’s lips turn down and she scrunches her forehead. “Your mom had no choice. He walked into the station with his lawyer and made the demand—she either turned over custody of you to him, or he would tell the cops what he saw.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy aunt stares at me, her eyes bleak. “She signed over custody. He’s your legal guardian now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHANKS TO THE SHOWERS at the community center, there’s no need to head home. Clean and dressed in street clothes, I return to heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone has left the ballpark. The bleachers are empty. The concession stand closed. Kenny Chesney blares from the parking lot, meaning that Chris ignored me when I told him I’d catch up with him later. Chris is really good at three things—playing shortstop, loving his girl, and knowing what I need even when I don’t know it myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least most of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the community pool, little kids squeal in delight in time to the sounds of splashing and the bounce of the diving board. My brother Mark and I spent most of our summers swimming in that pool. The other part, we spent playing ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand on the pitcher’s mound, except this time I’m in blue jeans and my favorite Reds Tshirt. The early evening sky fades from blue to orange-and-yellow. It’s no longer a million degrees and the breeze shifts from the south to the north. This is my favorite part of the game—the time alone afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rush of winning and the knowledge I have a scout interested in me still linger in my blood. My lungs expand with clean oxygen and my muscles lose the tension that weighed me down during the game. I feel relaxed, at peace, and alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at home plate and in my mind I see Logan crouched in position and the batter taking a practice swing. My fingers curl as if I’m clutching the ball. Logan calls for a curve; I accept, except this time I…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew you’d be here.” In her brown leather cowboy boots and blue dress, Gwen swings around the gate into the dugout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You screwed up the curve.” In one smooth motion, Gwen sits on the bench in the dugout and pats the wood beside her. She’s playing a game. One I’ll lose, but damn if my feet don’t move toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks good. Better than good. Beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ease down beside her as she tosses her blond ringlets behind her shoulder. “I remember you explaining the bases to me in this dugout. The best baseball conversation we ever had.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dare-you-to-pushing-the-limits-2/page-5.html","bookId":2753,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:14 PM"}
