Train had come up with a first-aid kit from a storage compartment and Flint\u0027s arm wound was bound up with gauze bandages. He had taken off his remaining shoe and his muddied socks and tossed those items overboard like a sacrifice to the swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to him stood Pelvis, his bald pate and face pink with sunburn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePelvis hadn\u0027t spoken more than a few words since they\u0027d gotten aboard; it was clear to Flint that there was a whole lotta thinkin\u0027gain\u0027on in Pelvis\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiuin turned the wheel and gwded them around to the Avrietta\u00273 Island island\u0027s eastern side. They passed spacious green meadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA herd of goats was running free, doing duty as living lawn mowers. There was an orchard with fruit trees, and a few small whitewashed clapboard buildings that looked like utility sheds. And then they came around into a natural harbor with a pier, and there it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint heard himself gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt stood on the green and rolling lawn, there on a rise that must have been the island\u0027s commanding point. It was a large, clean white mansion with multiple chimneys, a fieldstone path meandering between water oaks, and weeping willow trees from the harbor to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint\u0027s heart was racing. He gripped the rail, and tears burned his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was. It was.

The house of his birth had four chimneys; this one had only three. And it wasn\u0027t made of white stone, either. It was clapboard, and the paint was peeling. It was an old antebellum mansion, a huge two-storied thing with columns and wide porches. The rolling emerald-green lawn was the same as in his dreams, yes. A few goats were munching the blades down. But the house ... no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still had a star to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Murtaugh?\" Pelvis said in a voice that was more Cecil\u0027s than Elvis\u0027s. \"How come you\u0027re cryin\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not cryin\u0027.

The engine was rumbling quietly as they drew closer. So far they\u0027d seen no one. Arden had left Dan to stand at the bow, the breeze blowing through her hair, her eyes ashine with hope. In her right hand was gripped the pink drawstring bag with her little plastic horses in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I been wonderin\u0027,\" Pelvis said. \"\u0027Bout what you offered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what was that?

I mean, I don\u0027t know how successful I could be, but-I, \"Chopin you\u0027re not,\" Flint said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead, ain\u0027t he? Both him and Elvis. Dead as doornails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed heavily. \"And Mama\u0027s dead, too. It\u0027s gonna take me awhile to get over that one. Maybe I never will, but ... I figure maybe it\u0027s time for Pelvis to be put to rest, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint looked into the other man\u0027s face. It was amazing how much more intelligent he looked without that ridiculous wig. Dress him up in a nice suit, teach him how to talk without mangling English, teach him some refinements and anners, and maybe a human being of worth would come out of there. But then, it would be an almost impossible task, and he already had a job as a bounty hunter. \"I don\u0027t know, CeciL\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint said. \"I really don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I was just askin\u0027.\" Cecil watched the pier approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna take Lambert back to Shreveport?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s still a killer.

Just walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Smoates, from the ugliness, from the degradation. He still had his gambling debts and his taste for gambling that had gotten him so deep in trouble over the years.

The shadows of the oak and willow trees were deliciously cool, and a quartet of goats stood watching the group of pilgrims pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute,\" someone said, beside Dan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nuns stopped. Dan turned his head and found himself face-to-face with Flint Murtaugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint cleared his throat. He had his arms crossed over his chest, in case Clint made a spectacle of himself. These fine ladies would get a shock soon enough. \"I want to thank you,\" Flint said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saved our lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did the same for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did what I had to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So did l,\" Dan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared at each other, and Flint narrowed his eyes and looked away, then returned his cool blue gaze to Dan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I ought to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Dan nodded. Everything was still blurry around the edges; all of this-the morning\u0027s events, Gault\u0027s strong Avrietta\u0027s Island hold, the gun battle, the Swift severing of the house in two, this green and beautiful island-seemed like bits and pieces of a strange dream. \"Tell me what you\u0027re gonna do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think-\" Flint paused. He had careful considerations to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held a man\u0027s future in the balance: his own. \u002741 think ... I\u0027m gonna get out of this damn swam \" he saicl p \"Pardon me, Sisters.\" He looked up the path at the man walking alone. \"Cecil, can I talk to you, please?\" He left Dan\u0027s side, and Dan saw Murtaugh put his hand on Eisley\u0027s shoulder as they began to walk together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closer they got to the house, the more in need of repair Dan saw it was. He counted a half-dozen places where rainwater must be leaking through loose boards. A section of porch railing on the first floor was rotten and sagging, and several of the columns were cracked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place needed repainting, too, otherwise the salt breeze and the damp heat would combine to break down the wood in a very short time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bet the old house had termites, too, chewing at the foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey needed a carpenter around here, is what they needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan tried to put weight on his injured ankle, but the pain made him sick to his stomach. He was getting dizzy again, and his head was pounding. The blurred edges of tuw got still more blurry. He was about to give out, and though he fought it, he knew the sickness eventually had to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sisters?\" he said. \"I\u0027m sorry ... but I\u0027m real near passin\u0027 out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Train!\" the older one shouted. \"Help us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Dan\u0027s knees buckled and the darkness rushed up at him once more, he heard Train say, \"Got him, ladies.\" Dan felt himself being lifted over Train\u0027s shoulder in a fireman\u0027s carry before he \u003ca href\u003d\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class\u003d\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail\u003d\"40302133332500\"\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/a\u003e @ut completely, and Train-weak himself but unwilling to let Dan hit the ground-took him the last thirty yards to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate afternoon had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArden was freshly showered and had slept for five solid hours in a four-poster bed in the room Sister Caroline had brought her to, on the antebellum mansion\u0027s first floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore her shower another nun about Arden\u0027s age had brought her a lunch of celery soup, a ham salad sandwich, and iced tea. When Arden had asked the young woman if the Bright Girl lived here, the nun had given her a tentative smile and left without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way to this room they\u0027d passed through a long ward of beds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the beds were in use. Under ceiling fans and crisp white sheets lay some of the patients of the Avrietta Colbert Hospital: a mixture of men, women, and children, white, black, and Latino. Arden had heard the rattling coughs of tuberculosis, the gasping of cancerous lungs, the slow, labored breathing of people who were dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nuns moved around, giving what comfort they could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome patients were getting better, sitting up and talking-, for others, though, it seemed the days were numbered. Arden heard a few Cajun accents, though certainly not all the patients were of that lineage. She was left with the impression that this might be a charity hospital for the poor, probably from the Gulf Delta area, and that the patients were there because no mainland hospital would accept them or-in the case of the elderly ones who lay dying-waste time on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same young nun brought Arden a change of clothes: a green hospital gown and cotton slippers. Not long after she\u0027d awakened there\u0027d been a knock at the door, and when she\u0027d opened it there stood a tall, slim man who was maybe in his mid-sixties, wearing a pair of seersucker trousers, a rumpled white short-sleeve shirt, and a dark blue tie. He\u0027d introduced himself in a gentle Cajun accent as Dr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelicien, and he\u0027d sat down in an armchair and asked her how she was feeling, was she comfortable, did she have any aches or pains, things like that. Arden had said she was still tired but otherwise fine; she\u0027d said she had come here to find the Bright Girl, and did he know who she meant?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I most think I do,\" Dr. Felicien had said. \"But I gonna have to beg off and leave that for later. You try to get yourself some more sleep now, heah?\" He\u0027d gone without answering any ftu-ther questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvrietta\u0027s island A fan turned above her bed. Her window looked out toward the Gulf, and she could see waves rolling in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadows laY across the lawn. She had figured this room belonged to a doctor or someone else on the staff. When she went in the small but spotless bathroom to draw water from the faucet into a Dixie cup, she looked at her face in the mirror, studying her birthmark as she had a thousand times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was very, very d.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if it had been a lie? All along, a lie? Maybe Jupiter hadn\u0027t been lying, but he\u0027d just been plain wrong. Maybe he\u0027d seen a young and pretty blond woman in Lapierre when he was a little boy, and maybe later on he\u0027d heard the myths about a Bright Girl-a faith healer who could cheat time itself-and he\u0027d mixed up one with the other? But if there was a Bright GirL then who was she, really? Why had Train brought her here, and what was going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her hand and ran her fingers along the edges of her birthmarl What would she do, she asked herself, if this muk-this bad-luck stain that had ruined her life-had to remain on her face for the rest of her days? What if there was no magic healing touch? No ageless Bright Girl who carried a lamp from God inside her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing her eyes, Arden leaned her face against the mirror. She\u0027d reft she was so close. So very close. It was a cruel trick, this was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing but a cruel, cruel trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone knocked at the door. Arden vmnt to open it, thinking that it was probably Dr. Felicien with more questions or the young nun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the door and the face that looked at her both startled and horrified her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt belonged to a man.. He,had neatly combed sandy-brown hair on the right side of his head, but on the left side there were just tufts of it. A terrible burn and the subsequent healing Process had drawn the skin up into shiny parchment on that left side, his mouth twisted, the left eye sunken in folds of scar tissue. The left ear was a melted nub and the man\u0027s throat was mottled with burn scar. His nose, though scarred, had escaped the worst of the damage, and the right side of his face was almost untouched. Arden stepped back, her own face mirroring the shock she felt, but at once that feeling changed to shame. If anybody understood what it meant to look at someone shrink away from you in a display of ill manners and idiocy, it was she. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-south/page-30.html","bookId":2479,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:53:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:53:27 PM"}
