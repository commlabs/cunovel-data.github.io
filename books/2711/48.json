He smiles softly, then pulls my hand away from my heart and places it against his chest. Tears begin to well in my eyes. I have no idea how or if I even deserve him, but there’s one thing I know for sure. As long as he’s a part of it, I’ll never live a life of mediocrity. My life with Ridge will be nothing short of remarkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolls on top of me and lowers his cheek to mine, holding completely still for several long seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t hear his breaths, but I feel them as they fall against my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t hear his movements, but I feel him when he begins making the softest, most subtle shifts against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur hands are still locked between us, so I focus on the beat of his heart, drumming against my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeat, beat, pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeat, beat, pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeat, beat, pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel my entire body relaxing beneath him while he continues to make the subtlest of movements against me. He presses his hips into mine for two seconds, then relaxes and pulls back for a brief second before repeating the motion. He repeats this movement several times, and I can feel my need for him growing with each rhythmic movement against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more my desire builds, the more impatient I become. I want to feel his mouth on mine. I want to feel his hands all over me. I want to feel him push inside me and make me his completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more I think about what I want from him, the more responsive I become to the subtle shifts of his weight against me. The more responsive I become, the faster our hearts race against the palms of our hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeat, beat, pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatbeat, pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatbeatpause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatbeatpause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faster our hearts race, the quicker his rhythm becomes, matching each beat of my heart movement for movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s moving to the sound of my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrap my free arm around his neck and focus on his heartbeat, instantly aware that our hearts are perfectly in sync. I tighten my legs around his waist and lift myself against him, wanting him to make my heart beat even faster. He skims his lips across my cheek until they’re flush against my mouth, but he doesn’t kiss me. The silence around me makes me even more aware of the pattern of his breath falling against my skin. I focus on my palm against his chest and feel his quick intake of air, seconds before I taste the sweetness of his breath as he exhales, teasing my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInhale, exhale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInhale, exhale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInhale, exhale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis rhythmic breathing becomes quicker when his tongue slips inside my mouth, gently caressing the tip of mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I could hear, I’m positive I would have just heard myself whimper. It’s becoming a habit whenever he’s around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move my hand to the back of his head, needing to taste more of him. I pull him to me with such sudden urgency he moans into my mouth. Feeling his moan without hearing it is probably the most sensual thing I’ve ever experienced. His voice as it passes through me does more than hearing it ever could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge slides his hand away from my heart and presses his forearms into the mattress on both sides of my head. He boxes me in with his arms, and I slide my hand away from his chest, needing to grab hold of him with all my strength. What little I have left, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel him pull farther back, and then, without hesitation, he pushes inside me, claiming me, filling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan’t . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrist. He just silenced my heart, because I can no longer feel it at all. The only thing I feel is him moving against me . . . away from me . . . inside of me . . . into me. I’m completely consumed by him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep my eyes closed and listen to him without hearing a thing, experiencing him silently, the same way he’s experiencing me. I soak in every single beautiful thing about the smoothness of his skin and the feel of his breath and the taste of our moans, until it’s impossible to tell us apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continue to explore each other quietly, finding all the parts of ourselves we’ve only been able to imagine up to this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my body begins to tense again, it’s not at all because I’m nervous this time. I can sense his muscles clenching beneath my hands, and I grip his shoulders, ready to fall with him. He presses his cheek firmly to mine, and I feel him groan against my neck, making two final, long thrusts at the same second as I feel the moans escaping my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe begins to tremble with his release but somehow pulls his hand between us again and presses it against my heart. He’s shaking against me, and I’m doing my best to regain control of my own shudders while he begins to slow himself down, once again to the rhythm of my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis movements grow so soft and subtle I can barely feel them through all the tears I’m crying. I don’t even know why I’m crying, because this is by far the most indescribable feeling that has ever come over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that’s why I’m crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge relaxes on top of me and brings his mouth back to mine. He kisses me so softly and for so long my tears eventually subside and are replaced with complete silence, accompanied only by the rhythm of our hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close the bathroom door and return to her on the bed. Her face is illuminated by the moonlight pouring through the windows. Her mouth is curled up into a soft smile as I lower myself down beside her. I slide my arm beneath her shoulders, then lay my head on her chest and close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love the sound of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love her. Everything about her. I love that she’s never judged me. I love that she understands me. I love that despite everything I’ve put her heart through, she’s done nothing but support my decisions, no matter how much they destroyed her at the time. I love her honesty. I love her selflessness. Most of all, I love that I’m the one who gets to love all these things about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you,” I feel her say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and listen as she continues to repeat the phrase again and again. I adjust my ear until it’s directly over her heart, savoring every single thing about her. Her smell, her touch, her voice, her love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never felt so much at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never needed to feel more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my head and look back down into her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s a part of me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a part of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss her softly on the nose and mouth and chin, then press my ear against her heart again. For the first time in my life, I hear absolutely everything. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/maybe-someday/page-48.html","bookId":2711,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
