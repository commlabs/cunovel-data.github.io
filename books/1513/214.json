How about it? Do you want me to get it from him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaesar still hadn’t given up on his intentions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, however, Reynold was abnormally silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaesar obviously knew that the reason why they had not done anything to Leylin as of yet was because they believed whatever Leylin had gained in the ruins wasn’t anything precious. Hence, they could take their time, and did not have to do anything too unsightly. After all, they were light Magi! There had to be a certain level of trust between them and their peers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, however, no matter how much Leylin tried to conceal his might, his battle achievements were a fact that could not be disregarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the aura and energy waves that Leylin gave off was causing Reynold to become suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter what powerful magic artifact or technique Leylin may have obtained from the ruins, it could end up being an unpredictable factor that could change the tide of a battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHence, Reynold was a little interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing that couldn’t be done in this world. Not acting against Leylin previously was a matter of cost and benefit; it hadn’t been worth it to provoke Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, the situation was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can give it a try, but don’t go too far!” Reynold held onto a glazed porcelain cup, contentedly sipping a mouthful of a steaming hot liquid as he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaesar nodded, his figure disappearing into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt another place, Leylin was following the signs on the road, and eventually came to the area where the hunting team worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he arrived, he could see that there were very few acolytes and Magi. The stench of blood was thick in the air, causing everyone to feel pressure, as if there was a large rock pressed onto their hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This has... quite an uncomfortable atmosphere!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked up at the sky, which even seemed to be gloomy, and furrowed his brows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this area, one could occasionally see members of the hunting team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese members all donned black Magus robes which were adorned with blood-red flowers. They intimidated everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin could also smell the thick scent of blood, and even the smell of humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was evident that the dark Magi from before had been taken in by the hunting team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, this building is really quite large. The main thing is, how would I know where Caesar is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin held on to his document of appointment, and thought it over for a moment as he raised his eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe randomly picked a few Magi from the hunting team and blocked their path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want?” One of the Magi who he’d stopped was burly, and had a thick scar slashed across his forehead and middle of his face that made him look as if it had been split into half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith such a terrible wound, his already fiendish face was made to look even more horrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was currently shooting out death glares at Leylin, elemental particle waves fluctuating around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very cautious of him! Also, he doesn’t seem to be holding back at all!” Leylin commented inwardly. Shortly after, he put on a bright, gentle smile. “I’m a Magus that is new to the hunting team. May I know where Caesar—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whenever we have someone new, it’s customary for team leader Caesar to bring them in himself. You’re a spy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Leylin’s shock, just a word from him had caused the Magus to shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin was alarmed. Immediately after, the surrounding Magi of the hunting team halted, ready to watch a good show. He instantly understood the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Making things difficult for the new guy? What a repulsive practice!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scarred Magus roared, and immediately, two long metal blades appeared in his hands. Each blade was around 2 metres long, with the sheen enough to strike fear into the hearts of some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Storm!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Magus roared a syllable, and in a split second, the blade in his left hand began to emit a fierce, fiery red, while on the right blade, threads of white mist converged to form a blade of ice!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scorching heat on the left and the icy coldness on the right mixed together, forming a red and blue metal tornado that swept towards Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Metal Elemental Magic: A tornado formed from sharp blades, which has been upgraded by incorporating fire and ice elemental runes. With the bonus from his elemental essence conversion, the power of this attack is at least 35 degrees!]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA light flashed in Leylin’s eyes, and he instantly estimated the origin and power of this spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The average newly-advanced Magus would be killed in seconds if they were unfortunate enough to meet this sort of attack! This is just crazy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly after, Leylin smiled, as if he had gotten something he had wanted. “Hehe… And here I was, afraid that I wouldn’t be able to establish my superiority!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough it wasn’t good to attack the moment he came here, Leylin wasn’t just any regular member, but the vice team leader of the hunting team! Also, his opponent had been the one to initiate the first move, so even if he were to complain to Reynold, Leylin was not afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be honest, it would make him even happier if this incident would cause him to lose his position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these considerations flashed past in an instant, with only a second passing in real time. In this amount of time, the metal tornado attack of the scarred Magus was already in front of Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe violent wind pressure that accompanied the tornado turned into wind blades that had a strength comparable to regular weapons, instantly crumbling the walls on both sides of the passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Slash! Slash!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind blades that seemed to have materialised out of nowhere sliced against Leylin’s body, but they were repelled by a layer of illusory, crimson armour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a bad attack, but unfortunately, you’re dealing with me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked calm, enthusiastically evaluating his opponent’s attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a black flash of light, instead of retreating, Leylin advanced and rushed forwards into metal tornado formed from flames and ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is he a lunatic?” Not only the surrounding Magi, but also the scarred Magus had this thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat they saw next was the most unforgettable sight in their life!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang! Bang! Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the huge metal blades that had the added danger of the flames and ice struck Leylin’s body, immense noises resounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked indifferent, wandering around through the metal tornado as if he were strolling around his garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe defense from the Fallen Star Pendant and Leylin’s own support spells rendered this level of attack useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s figure appeared as a black shadow as he entered the tornado, extending a pale, delicate finger and tapping gently!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Poof!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a balloon that had been punctured, the excessive might of the metal tornado broke down, and bits of blue ice and red embers flew all over the place, eventually disappearing in mid-air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This…” Scarface gaped, unable to utter a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ice-fire metal tornado was his ultimate attack. With this one method, he had killed off countless official Magi, but now, this Magus had been able to move freely in the area of the metal tornado and even disable his most powerful attack with a gentle tap!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had Scarface stunned, causing him to think that he was dreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Leylin had wanted to do everything himself, he would have used his powerful magic to go head on against that metal tornado. Although he would have been able to destroy the tornado in the end, the consumption would be immense, though the scene would be extravagant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHence, Leylin had chosen not to go through with that method, and instead, used the A.I. Chip to calculate the weak point of the spell. He then made use of his powerful defense and took care of the spell by heading into the area the spell affected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis method was only viable when dealing with Magi weaker than Leylin. If the opponent’s spell was too powerful, Leylin wouldn’t want to risk entering the area of the magic like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, having used this method, he found that it might have been a little too effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked at the dazed Magi and gave a gentle smile, his figure flashing as he came to the front of the scarred Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarface raised his right hand, black fur extending from the palm of his hand and forming a red-eyed lion’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lion head opened its mouth, preparing to shoot out some kind of energy attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Ka-cha!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin struck quickly, like lightning, and before Scarface could react, a large hand made from shadows grabbed through his innate defensive spell and touched his right hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the piercing sound of bones being crushed, the lion head on Scarface’s right hand crumbled. His right hand was also bent in an awkward angle by the black hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scarred Magus showed a hint of pain on his face, but that quickly changed to a fierce expression, as if he wanted to do everything he could to kill Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarface’s remaining hand dipped into his bag and seemed to be touching some item.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? You still want to resist?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin furrowed his brows, and in front of him, a black shadow blade emerged and slashed at the Magus’ left arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Thud!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black blade noiselessly streaked across, and the Magus’ left arm fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, fresh blood gushed out like a fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah!” Scarface’s facial muscles contorted, making him look even more sinister and terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the eyes of Leylin, however, he just seemed like a clown!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin grabbed forward, black threads at the tips of his five fingers. These threads seemed to have their own intelligence, latching onto Scarface and pushing him to the ground, and then entering his nostrils, ears, mouth and other facial orifices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a duck that had been clutched by the neck, the Magus’ expression changed to that of resignation, and the violent undulations surrounding him immediately dissipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarface seemed like he had something to say, but Leylin didn’t give him any chance to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsympathetically, he raised his foot, clad with a leather boot, and stomped down on Scarface’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Thud!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarface’s chest sunk in, and his face turned deep red and then purple as he spat out a mouthful of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin stopped looking at him, and glanced at the surrounding Magi of the hunting team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter defeating Scarface, the Magi from the hunting team that were present seemed to have achieved a mutual understanding, and encircled him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s this? Are you all going to attack me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-213\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-215\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-214","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
