He seemed to be thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he nonchalantly kicked his back legs out as though hovering on your own stomach gases was something dragons had mastered over millions of years, somersaulted, and fled. For a moment he was visible as a silver streak, and then he was out over the city walls and gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA groan followed him. It came from ten thousand throats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes threw up his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t you worry, guv,” said Nobby quickly. “He\u0027s-he\u0027s probably gone to, to have a drink. Or something. Maybe it\u0027s the end of round one. Or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean, he ate our kettle and everything,” said Colon uncertainly. “He wouldn\u0027t just run away after eating a kettle. Stands to reason. Anyone who could eat a kettle wouldn\u0027t run away from anything. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And my armour polish,” said Carrot. “It was nearly a whole dollar for the tin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There you are then,” said Colon. “It\u0027s like I said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look,” said Vimes, as patiently as he could manage. “He\u0027s a nice dragon, I liked him as much as you, a very nice little chap, but he\u0027s just done the sensible thing, for gods\u0027 sake, he\u0027s not going to get burned to bits just to save us. Life just doesn\u0027t work like that. You might as well face it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverhead the great dragon strutted through the air and flamed a nearby tower. It had won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve never seen that before,” said Lady Ramkin. “Dragons normally fight to the death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At last they\u0027ve bred one who\u0027s sensible,” said Vimes morosely. “Let\u0027s be honest: the chances of a dragon the size of Errol beating something that big are a million-to-one”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one of those silences you get after one clear bright note has been struck and the world pauses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rank looked at one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Million-to-one?” asked Carrot nonchalantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely,” said Vimes. “Million-to-one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rank looked at one another again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Million-to-one,” said Colon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Million-to-one,” agreed Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s right,” said Carrot. “Million-to-one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another high-toned silence. The members of the rank were wondering who was going to be the first to say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Colon took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it might just work,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?” snapped Vimes. “There\u0027s no-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobby nudged him urgently in the ribs and pointed out across the plains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a column of black smoke out there. Vimes squinted. Running ahead of the smoke, speeding over the cabbage fields and closing fast, was a silvery bullet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe great dragon had seen it too. It flamed defiance and climbed for extra height, mashing the air with its enormous wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Errol\u0027s flame was visible, so hot as to be almost blue. The landscape rolled away underneath him at an impossible speed, and he was accelerating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead of him the king extended its claws. It was almost grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErrol\u0027s going to hit it, Vimes thought. Gods help us all, it\u0027ll be a fireball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething odd was happening out in the fields. A little way behind Errol the ground appeared to be ploughing itself up, throwing cabbage stalks into the air. A hedgerow erupted in a shower of sawdust . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErrol passed silently over the city walls, nose up, wings folded down to tiny flaps, his body honed to a mere cone with a flame at one end. His opponent blew out a tongue of fire; Vimes watched Errol, with a barely noticeable flip of a wing stub, roll easily out of its path. And then he was gone, speeding out towards the sea in the same eerie silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He miss-” Nobby began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air ruptured. An endless thunderclap of noise dragged across the city, smashing tiles, toppling chimneys. In mid-air, the king was picked up, flattened out and spun like a top in the sonic wash. Vimes, his hands over his own ears, saw the creature flame desperately as it turned and became the centre of a spiral of crazy fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagic crackled along its wings. It screamed like a distressed foghorn. Then, shaking its head dazedly, it began to glide in a wide circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes groaned. It had survived something that tore masonry apart. What did you have to do to beat it? You can\u0027t fight it, he thought. You can\u0027t burn it, you can\u0027t smash it. There\u0027s nothing you can do to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon landed. It wasn\u0027t a perfect landing. A perfect landing wouldn\u0027t have demolished a row of cottages. It was slow, and it seemed to go on for a long time and rip up a considerable stretch of city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWings flapping aimlessly, neck waving and spraying random flame, it ploughed on through a debris of beams and thatch. Several fires started up along the trail of destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally it came to rest at the end of the furrow, almost invisible under a heap of former architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence that it left was broken only by the shouts of someone trying to organise yet another bucket chain from the river to douse the fires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen people started to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the air Ankh-Morpork must have looked like a disturbed anthill, with streams of dark figures flowing towards the wreck of the dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of them had some kind of weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of them had spears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of them had swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of them had one aim in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what?” said Vimes aloud. “This is going to be the world\u0027s first democratically killed dragon. One man, one stab.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you\u0027ve got to stop them. You can\u0027t let them kill it!” said Lady Ramkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes blinked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pardon?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s wounded!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lady, that was the intention, wasn\u0027t it? Anyway, it\u0027s only stunned,” said Vimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean you can\u0027t let them kill it like this,” said Lady Ramkin insistently. “Poor thing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want to do, then?” demanded Vimes, his temper unravelling. “Give it a strengthening dose of tar oil and a nice comfy basket in front of the stove?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s butchery!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suits me fine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it\u0027s a dragon! It\u0027s just doing what a dragon does! It never would have come here if people had left it alone!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes thought: it was about to eat her, and she can still think like this. He hesitated. Perhaps that did give you the right to an opinion . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Colon sidled up as they glared, white-faced, at one another, and hopped desperately from one squelching foot to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You better come at once, Captain,” he said. \"It\u0027s going to be bloody murder!\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes waved a hand at him. “As far as I\u0027m concerned,” he mumbled, avoiding Sybil Ramkin\u0027s glare, “it\u0027s got it coming to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s not that,” said Colon. \"It\u0027s Carrot. He\u0027s arrested the dragon.\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean, arrested?” he said. “You don\u0027t mean what I think you mean, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could be sir,” said Colon uncertainly. “Could be. He was up on the rubble like a shot, sir, grabbed it by a wing and said \u0027You\u0027re nicked, chummy\u0027, sir. Couldn\u0027t believe it, sir. Sir, the thing is ...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant hopped from one foot to the other. “You know you said prisoners weren\u0027t to be molested, sir . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quite a large and heavy roof timber and it scythed quite slowly through the air, but when it hit people they rolled backwards and stayed hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now look,” said Carrot, hauling it in and pushing back his helmet, “I don\u0027t want to have to tell anyone again, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes shouldered his way through the dense crowd, staring at the bulky figure atop the mound of rubble and dragon. Carrot turned slowly, the roof beam held like a staff. His gaze was like a lighthouse beam. Where it fell, the crowd lowered their weapons and looked merely sullen and uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I must warn you,” Carrot went on, “that interfering with an officer in the execution of his duty is a serious offence. And I shall come down like a ton of bricks on the very next person who throws a stone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stone bounced off the back of his helmet. There was a barrage of jeers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let us at it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s right!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don\u0027t want guards ordering us about!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quis custodiet custard?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah? Right!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes pulled the sergeant towards him. “Go and organise some rope. Lots of rope. As thick as possible. I suppose we can-oh, tie its wings together, maybe, and bind up its mouth so it can\u0027t flame.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon peered at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you serious, sir? We\u0027re really going to arrest it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s been arrested, he thought, as he pushed his way forward. Personally I would have preferred it to drop in the sea, but it\u0027s been arrested and now we\u0027ve got to deal with it or let it go free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt his own feelings about the bloody thing evaporate in the face of the mob. What could you do with it? Give it a fair trial, he thought, and then execute it. Not kill it. That\u0027s what heroes do out in the wilderness. You can\u0027t think like that in cities. Or rather, you can, but if you\u0027re going to then you might as well burn the whole place down right now and start again. You ought to do it ... well, by the book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it. We tried everything else. Now we might as well try and do it by the book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, he added mentally, that\u0027s a city guard up there. We\u0027ve got to stick together. Nobody else will have anything to do with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burly figure in front of him drew back an arm with a halfbrick in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Throw that brick and you\u0027re a dead man,” said Vimes, and then ducked and pushed his way through the press of people while the would-be thrower looked around in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrot half-raised his club in a threatening gesture as Vimes climbed up the rubble pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, hallo, Captain Vimes,” he said, lowering it, “I have to report I have arrested this-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I can see,” said Vimes. “Did you have any suggestions about what we do next?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes, sir. I have to read it its rights, sir,” said Carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean apart from that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not really, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes looked at those parts of the dragon still visible under the rubble. How could you kill one of these? You\u0027d have to spend a day at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lump of rock ricocheted off his breastplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who did that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice lashed out like a whip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd went quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSybil Ramkin scrambled up on the wreckage, eyes afire, and glared furiously at the mob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said,” she said, “who did that? If the person who did it does not own up I shall be extremely angry! Shame on you all!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had their full attention. Several people holding stones and things let them drop quietly to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breeze flapped the remnants of her nightshirt as her Ladyship took up a new haranguing position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here is the gallant Captain Vimes-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh gods,” said Vimes in a small voice, and pulled his helmet down over his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“-and his dauntless men, who have taken the trouble to come here today, to save your-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes gripped Carrot\u0027s arm and manoeuvred him down the far side of the heap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You all right, Captain?” said the lance-constable. “You\u0027ve gone all red.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t you start,” snapped Vimes. “It\u0027s bad enough getting all those leers from Nobby and the sergeant.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guards-guards-discworld-8/page-46.html","bookId":1627,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM"}
