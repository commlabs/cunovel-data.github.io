His eyes were closed, his head pressed into the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holy shit,” he said finally. “I can’t feel my legs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes, telling herself that rapid separation and focus on pleasure was the way to go. Keep it simple. They were just screwing. And since it was phenomenal, she couldn’t complain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips brushed over her shoulder. “I was rough and you allowed it. Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoothed by the gesture and sentiment, she kept her eyes closed and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted. His mouth sealed over hers without warning, stealing her breath. Frozen for a moment, it took a few soft licks of his tongue to kick-start her brain. When she opened to him, he kissed her with a gentleness very much at odds with the impatience with which he’d taken her body. His hand cupped the back of her neck, his fingers pushing into the sweat-dampened roots and holding her just where he wanted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stroke of his tongue along hers was soft and slow, the press of his lips firm but not hard. It was a lush, hot, wet melding that curled her toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they parted, they were both breathing hard. Their gazes met. A long, somewhat awkward moment passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cleared her throat. “I need to take a shower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I bought a bag of Epsom salts, in case you’d like to soak.” Jared pushed to his feet. “Bathroom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled by his thoughtfulness, she managed to point down the hall. “Left side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set off, presenting her with a view of a really gorgeous ass. Her gaze was riveted to its rhythmic clenching as he walked away, her heartbeat elevated by the realization that she’d pushed such a gloriously masculine creature to his limits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a moment to collect herself, Darcy stood and moved into the kitchen, realizing as she went that Jared had known the state of her body before she did—she was slightly sore. Breaking a year-long abstinence with a hard, pounding fuck with a well-hung man would do that to a woman, she supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was just digging through the shopping bag for the salts when she heard the rush of bathtub water surging through the house’s old pipes. He had purchased men’s combo hair/body wash and razors, too, which gave her an odd flutter of delight—he’d planned on staying from the get-go. She wasn’t going to read anything into it, but it was nice to know he hadn’t planned on yanking his pants back up as quickly as he’d dropped them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she joined him, Darcy found the bathroom door open and her new lover leaning over the triangular-shaped tub, testing the temperature of the water. He glanced at her as she filled the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, this room,” he said, “fits you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had the bathroom redesigned after my parents moved out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d hired a contractor to gut the closet in the adjacent den to expand the home’s one bathroom into something she could live with. The room was still small, but it now accommodated a separate bath and shower, instead of the combo tub with showerhead that had been there before. The café au lait walls and tile, paired with accents of eggplant, gave the room a warm modern elegance she found soothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared held his hand out for the Epsom salts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn odd tenseness spread through her tummy. “You came prepared. I take it riding a woman hard is par for the course with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stilled, his extended fingers curling into a fist. “Not really, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped closer and handed him the bag. She hoped his answer meant she got to him in a unique way, especially considering how he so easily devastated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking almost…chagrined, Jared dumped a heaping handful of salt under the running water. “I have a sister with no concept of TMI,” he said gruffly. “You might know what that’s like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She said salt baths worked wonders after overenthusiastic nights. It seemed like a good idea to grab some, considering where things were heading.” He gestured her over. “Is this too hot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t. With a grateful, slightly bemused smile, Darcy stepped into the small corner tub and sighed her delight. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning off the water, he stood. He grabbed his toiletries and moved over to the floating glass shower stall. She relaxed into the neck pillow she kept on the ledge and watched as he stepped beneath the oversized showerhead. He was tall, but the flexible arm adjusted for that, and soon enough he was putting on a show she would have paid top-dollar for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompletely oblivious to her avid perusal, he soaped his hair and chest, his hands roaming over his gorgeously ripped body with brisk efficiency. The scent of his soap filled the air and she swallowed hard, her mouth watering. A flush swept over her skin that had more to do with her new lover than it did with the heat of the bathwater. Jared Cameron was her darkest sexual fantasies in the flesh, his thick biceps flexing as he moved, his abdomen and pectorals clenching as his arms lifted to scrub at his hair. Soapy water sluiced down his tanned skin, making her pussy clench in renewed hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he turned his attention to washing his genitals, stroking his long thick penis in one hand and rolling his scrotum with the other, Darcy couldn’t ignore the pulsing between her legs any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaying one leg on the lip of the tub, she cupped her slick pussy and massaged the tender knot of her clitoris. The fingers of her other hand caught a nipple in their grip, rolling and tugging the aching point, sending shards of delight straight to her womb. She made a soft noise of need and his head lifted abruptly, catching her in the act of pleasuring herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lower lip in a deliberately provocative come-on, feeling sexy and naughty as his desire rose in response to hers. His cock thickened in his hand and she arched her back, remembering how the hard length felt moving inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis resultant scowl wasn’t what she’d expected. Neither was the haste with which he finished rinsing off and vacated the shower. As he strode out of the bathroom with her towel wrapped around his lean hips, she wondered if she’d crossed a line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeflated and embarrassed, her hands fell away from her body. She sank her head beneath the water, submerging herself as long as her lungs would allow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she came up for air, Jared was there. Standing by the tub with his arms crossed and a new condom rolled over his raging erection. She quickly swiped the water off her face with her hands, blinking up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe uncoiled, stepping into the tub before she knew he intended to. Catching her beneath the arms, he hauled her up and set her ass atop her neck pillow on the wide ceramic edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to wait,” he muttered, kneeling in the water and spreading her legs. “At least until after dinner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dove for her pussy, his mouth latching on to her tender core and tonguing her cleft. He pushed inside her and she gasped, her hips arching. His tongue slid in and out, licking quick and shallow, luring her slickness until she heard how wet she was. He groaned and tilted his head, thrusting deeper into her, drinking her in as if he couldn’t get enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she started to tremble, hovering on the edge of orgasm, he wiped his mouth on her inner thigh and stood. Darcy shivered at the look he shot her, the edgy hunger that seemed little appeased by their animal screwing on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught himself in hand and gently nudged her. A rough sound escaped him. “Fuck, I wanted to wait,” he said again, with more vehemence. “You’re swollen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t help it if you hit all my hot buttons.” She gripped his hips to stabilize her perch. “You looked so damn hot in the shower. Turned me on watching you stroke yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were looking at my dick like you’d die if I didn’t give it to you. I almost blew my load in the shower.” He began a slow slide into her, exerting minimal pressure to ease past tender tissues. “After what you did to me on the couch, I shouldn’t have anything left to blow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would have loved to watch,” she said, breathless with lust. Every inch he pushed into her stole another piece of her sanity; every coarse word he spoke ratcheted up her need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCupping her cheek in one hand and her hip in the other, he shook his head, nudging deeper. His thumb pushed into her mouth. “I want this mouth first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew on the callused pad, rubbing her tongue over it, watching his eyes darken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll suck my dick just like that,” he said hoarsely. “I’ll have you on your knees, deep-throating my cock. After this, it’ll take me longer to come. I’ll be fucking your mouth for a good, long while. I’ll make it last because it’s going to feel so damn good. Everything about you makes me feel good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his thumb free and lowered his head to kiss her, his tongue thrusting into the warm recess in imitation of the act he spoke of. With his lips whispering over hers and his hand at her throat, he said, “You’ll swallow every drop of my cum, sucking it from the tip of my dick until I’ve got nothing left to give you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes…” she breathed, wanting him in her mouth now. Wanting to see the pleasure sweep across his face as she took him to orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roll of his hips, he sank into her to the root. His groan hardened her nipples. “You’re even tighter than before and your cunt was perfect then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilting her head back, Darcy’s lips and teeth followed the sharp line of his jaw. “You’re thicker than before and your cock was big then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because now I know how good it’s going to feel when I go off.” He leaned his head back to invite her attention to his throat. “How good it feels when you lose it and squeeze me like a fist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You make me come so hard,” she whispered by his ear, licking delicately into it and smiling when he shuddered. She deliberately tightened her pussy around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared cursed and withdrew, then slid balls deep in a measured glide. “Play all you want, sweetheart, but you’re not rushing me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGripping his taut ass in her hands, she squeezed and held him close so she could grind into him. She nearly came from the fleeting pressure of his pelvis against her clitoris, her sex spasming greedily around his erection. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-fire-shadow-stalkers-4/page-6.html","bookId":1921,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:18 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:18 AM"}
