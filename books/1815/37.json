She reached for another piece of bacon, then handed it to me. True love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva.” I waited until she looked at me. “It’s your day. Don’t feel obligated to do anything but enjoy yourself. And have sex with me, which should fall under enjoying yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought her smile back. “It’s going to be wonderful no matter what.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI voiced what was left unsaid. “But?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” She tucked her hair behind her ear and shrugged. “Thinking about my mom’s parents has me thinking about grandparents, and your mother is going to be our children’s grandmother. I don’t want that to be awkward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bristled. The thought of my mother and a child I created with Eva together in any way filled me with a riot of emotions I couldn’t deal with now. “Let’s cross that bridge when we come to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t our wedding the place to start?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t like my mother,” I snapped. “Don’t pretend you do for the sake of children who don’t exist yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEva jerked back slightly. She blinked at me, then reached for her coffee. “Did you try the waffles?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing it wasn’t in my wife’s nature to steer away from sensitive topics, I still let her do it. If we were going to get into the subject of my mother, we could do it later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set her mug down and tore off a piece of waffle with her fingers. She held it out to me. I took it for what it was: a peace offering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I stood and took her hand, leading her out to the beach for a walk to clear my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re welcome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning my head, I saw Cary grinning at me from where he lay on the sand a few feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you appreciate my packing that bikini,” he elaborated, jerking his chin toward Eva, who was standing thigh-deep in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair was damp and slicked back from her face. Oversize aviator sunglasses shielded her eyes from the sun as she threw a Frisbee back and forth with Martin and Lacey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you help her pick that out?” Monica asked, smiling from beneath an elegant wide-brim hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d watched her slather sunscreen all over Eva, a job I wanted for myself, but I didn’t press the point. Sometimes, Monica mothered Eva as if she were still a child. While my wife rolled her eyes at me, I could see that she basked in the attention. It was a very different relationship from the one I had with my own mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t say that my mom didn’t love me, because she did. In her own way—within boundaries. Monica’s love, on the other hand, had no limits, something Eva found stifling at times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho could say which was better or worse? To be loved too much or too little?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod knew I loved Eva beyond all reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden sea breeze snapped me out of it. Monica hung on to her hat as Cary turned his head toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did,” Cary replied, rolling over onto his stomach. “She was looking at one-pieces and I had to intervene. That bikini was made for her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. Hell yeah. I had my arms crossed over my bent knees so I could take in my fill of her. She was wet and nearly naked, and I was hot for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if she sensed we were talking about her, Eva crooked her finger at me, beckoning me to come to her. I nodded but waited for a few moments before rising from where I’d been sitting in the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chill of the water made me suck in a sharp breath, but I was grateful for it a moment later when she surged toward me and plastered herself against me. Her legs wrapped around my waist, her smiling mouth puckering into a heated kiss against my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not bored, are you?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she twisted in a way that sent us both tumbling into the water. I felt her hand cup my cock and give it a gentle squeeze. She wriggled away as I came up for air, laughing as she pulled her sunglasses off and tried to run onto the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught her by the waist and took us both down, absorbing the fall onto the sand on my back. Her squeal of surprise was my reward, as was the feel of her cool, sleek body writhing against my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, I pinned her down. My hair hung around my face, dripping water onto hers. She stuck her tongue out at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The things I’d do to you if we didn’t have an audience,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re newlyweds. You can kiss me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up, I saw all eyes on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also spotted Ben Clancy and Angus closing in on a house two lots down. Even at this distance, the glint of light from the patio betrayed a camera’s lens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to sit up, but Eva’s legs tangled with mine and held me down. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-37.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
