What many failed to understand, however, was that there could be the excitement of the chase even where the only thing you were chasing was an idea, a concept, a theory. As awareness developed, it became apparent that this was the most important chase of all, the one upon whose outcome all of humankind survives or fails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Raja Lon Flattery, The Book of Ship\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE CREAKING OF their action couches, the click-click of relays - all of the subtle and familiar sounds of Com-central worried at the edges of Prudence\u0027s awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the past half-hour, Bickel had been fussing through the schematics, plotting his way into the computer, sharing parts of his plan with the others. She had come to dislike the sound of the schematics being shuffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were tensions here that she did not fully understand, but her own role remained clear - mediate and goad... mediate and goad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe common stench of Com-central carried an acridity which she identified as fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a chance at glory, she told herself. Very few people ever have that opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an empty pep talk, forever confronted by that inescapable fact:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time since coming out of the hyb tank, she felt the old familiar pain-of-wonder, asking herself what it might have been like to have been born into a normal family in the normal way, to have grown up in the noisy, intimate belonging of the unchosen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are the cream, the select few,\" Morgan Hempstead and his cohorts had kept reminding them. But they all knew where the cream had originated. Normal biopsy tissue from a living human volunteer had been suspended in an axolotl tank, the genetic imprint triggered and the flesh allowed to grow. It produced an identical twin - an expendable twin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelect few! she thought. Something precious was taken from us and the compensations were inadequate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tuned the small screen at the corner of her board to one of the tail eyes, looked back toward the center of the solar system, toward the planet that had spawned them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stabbing pang of homesickness tightened her breast, made breathing difficult for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been molded and motivated, twisted, trained and inhibited - wound up like mechanical toys and sent scooting off into the darkness with their laser \"whistle\" tooting to let UMB know where they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where are we? she asked herself as she blanked the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prue, you\u0027d better take the big board,\" Flattery said. \"You\u0027d normally follow John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSight of the big board\u0027s dials and gauges filled her with an abrupt anger and fear. She felt the immediacy of the emotions in a dry throat, heat in her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... haven\u0027t had enough time off the board... to recuperate,\" Flattery said, speaking hesitantly. \"Or I\u0027d -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath, leaned back, signed to Timberlake to begin the count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe appeal to her nursing instinct did it, Flattery thought. She was ready to funk out. She had to take the board now or she might never be able to face it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery glanced at Timberlake, saw the relief so apparent on the man\u0027s face as he switched the green arrow to Prudence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimberlake, dominated by intuition, was terrified by the responsibility of Com-central. Prudence, deep in sensation, shared that fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I, because I feel their fear, overcome my own repugnance, Flattery thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Bickel, logical and with penetrating intelligence seemed immune to these pressures. It was a flaw in Bickel\u0027s character, Flattery thought, but he knew their lives could depend on that flaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the manifest and ship-loading plans, Tim,\" Bickel said. \"I\u0027ll give you a list of what we need from colony stores. We can set up in the computer maintenance shop next door for easy -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t stay outside the shield area too long,\" Prudence said. \"You\u0027d better key your dosimeters to repeaters in here; we\u0027ll keep an eye on you that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Bickel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped off his couch, looked back at Prudence, studying her profile, the intent way she watched the big board. He shifted his attention to Flattery, who lay back with eyes closed, resting for his shift at the controls; then to Timberlake, who was taking copies of the ship-loading plans from the computer memory-bank printers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them has really focused on what has to be done here, Bickel thought. They haven\u0027t faced the fact that the simulator eventually has to be tied directly to the computer. We\u0027ll just be building a set of frontal lobes - if we\u0027re successful. And our \"Ox\" can have but one source of experience upon which to come alive and conscious - the computer and its memory banks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they did face this fact, Bickel saw, he was going to have a fight on his hands. Too much of the ship was almost totally dependent on the master programs. Juggling those programs involved a kind of all-or-nothing danger. It was a flaw in the Tin Egg\u0027s design, Bickel felt. He could see no logical reason for it. Why should everything on the ship depend on conscious control or intervention - even down to the robox repair units?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrudence sensed Bickel\u0027s attention on her, saw his face reflected in a gauge\u0027s plastic cover. His questionings, doubts, and determination were all there for her to read just as surely as she read the dial beneath the plastic reflector. She had set him up - she had done that part of her job as well as could be expected, she thought. She focused now on the total console, feeling the sensory pulses of the ship reaching outward to the hull skin and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJob routine was beginning to smooth off the harsh edges of her fear. She took a deep breath, keyed a forward exterior sensor to the overhead screen, studied the star-spangled view of what lay ahead of the Tin Egg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s our prize, she thought, looking at the stars. First, we clean out the Augean stables - then we get to be first... out there. The candy and the stick. That\u0027s the candy, a virgin world of our own (and we have our tanks full of colonists to prove Earth\u0027s good faith) and......m the stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screenview appeared suddenly repulsive to her, and she blanked it, returned her attention to the big board and its pressures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s the uncertainty that gets to us, she thought. There\u0027s too much unknown out here - something has to go wrong. But we don\u0027t know what it\u0027ll be... or when it\u0027ll hit. We only know the blow when it falls can be totally destructive, leaving not a trace. It has been before - six times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard Bickel and Timberlake leave, the hiss of the hatch expanders sealing behind them; she turned and looked at Flattery. He had a small blue smudge-stain on his cheek just below his left eye. The stain appeared suddenly as an enormous flaw in an otherwise perfect creature. It terrified her, and she turned back to the big board to hide her emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why... why did the other six fail?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must have faith,\" Flattery said. \"One ship will make it... one day. Perhaps it\u0027ll be our ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems such... . wasteful way,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very little\u0027s wasted. Solar energy\u0027s cheap at Moonbase. Raw materials are plentiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027re... alive!\" she protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are plenty more where we came from. They\u0027ll be almost precisely like us... and all of them God\u0027s children. His eye is ever on us. We should -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, stop that! I know why we have a chaplain - to feed us that pap when we need it. I don\u0027t need it and I never will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How proud we are,\" Flattery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what you can do with your metaphysical crap. There is no God, only -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" he barked. \"I speak as your chaplain. I\u0027m surprised at your stupidity, the temerity that permits you to utter such blasphemy out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" she sneered. \"I forgot. You\u0027re also our wily Indian scout sniffing the unknown terrain in front of us. You\u0027re the hedge on our bets, the \u0027what-if\u0027 factor, the -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no idea how much unknown we face,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right out of Hamlet,\" she mocked him, and allowed her voice to go heavy with portentousness: \"\u0027There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt an abrupt pang of fear for her. \"I\u0027ll pray for you, Prudence.\" And he cursed inwardly at the sound of his own voice. He had come through as a fatuous ass. But I will pray for her, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrudence turned back to the big board, reminding herself: A stick is to beat people with... to goad them beyond themselves. Raj can\u0027t just be a chaplain; he has to be a super-chaplain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery took a deep, quavering breath. Her blasphemy had touched his most profound doubts. And he thought how little anyone suspected what lay beneath their veneer of science, deep in that Pandora\u0027s box where anything was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything? he asked himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the bind, of course. They were penetrating the frontiers of Anything... and Anything had always before been the prerogative of God. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/destination-void-destination-void-1/page-11.html","bookId":2449,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:22:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:22:21 PM"}
