I kept my right hand in my pocket while my eyes scanned the room, checking everybody out. After I was done with the pie I put my hand back in my pocket and drank my coffee left-handed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter awhile I ordered more coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone rang. Trina answered it, walked over to the bar. There was a heavyset fellow there with dark blonde hair. She said something to him and he went to the phone. He talked for a few minutes, looked around the room, came over to my table. Both of his hands were where I could see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Scudder? My name\u0027s George Lightner, I don\u0027t think we met.\" He pulled a chair out and sat in it. \"That was Joe just now,\" he said. \"There\u0027s no activity out there, nothing at all. They\u0027re laying doggo in the Mercury plus he\u0027s got two sharpshooters in second-floor windows across the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in here, and there\u0027s the two fellows at the front table. I figured you made us when you walked in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made them,\" I said. \"I figured you were either a cop or the killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, what a thought. This is a nice place. You more or less hang out here, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as much as I used to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s pleasant here. I\u0027d like to come back sometime when I can drink something instead of coffee. They\u0027re selling a lot of coffee tonight, what with you and me and the two guys down front.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s pretty good coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s not bad. Better than the shit in the station house.\" He lit a cigarette with a Zippo lighter. \"Joe said there\u0027s no activity elsewhere either. There\u0027s two men staked out downtown with your girlfriend. There\u0027s a couple others with the three hookers on the East Side.\" He grinned. \"That\u0027s the detail I shoulda drawn. Can\u0027t win \u0027em all, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long you want to stay here? Joe\u0027s guess is that the guy\u0027s either set up by now or he\u0027s not gonna move tonight. We can cover you every step from here back to the hotel. Of course we can\u0027t insure against the possibility of a sniper firing from a rooftop or a high window. We did a rooftop check earlier but there\u0027s no guarantee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll do it from a distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027re in pretty good shape. And you\u0027re wearing the bulletproof vest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a help. Of course it\u0027s mesh, it doesn\u0027t always stop a blade, but nobody\u0027s about to let him get that close to you. We figure if he\u0027s out there he\u0027ll make a move between here and the doorway of your hotel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I figure, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do you want to run the gauntlet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few minutes,\" I said. \"I might as well finish this coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" he said, rising, \"what the hell. Enjoy it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to his spot at the bar. I finished my coffee, got up, went to the lavatory. There I checked my.32 and made sure I had a round under the hammer and three more rounds to back it up. I could have asked Durkin for a couple more cartridges to fill the empty chambers. For that matter, he\u0027d have given me a larger gun with more of a punch to it. But he didn\u0027t even know I was carrying the.32 and I hadn\u0027t wanted to tell him. The way things were set up, I wasn\u0027t going to have to shoot anybody. The killer was supposed to walk right into our arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept it wasn\u0027t going to happen that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paid the check, left a tip. It wasn\u0027t going to work. I could feel it. The son of a bitch wasn\u0027t out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked out the door. The rain had let up some. I looked at the Mercury and glanced at the buildings across the street, wondering where the police sharpshooters were planted. It didn\u0027t matter. They weren\u0027t going to have any work to do tonight. Our quarry wasn\u0027t taking the bait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked down to Fifty-seventh Street, staying close to the curb just in case he\u0027d managed to find a spot in a dark doorway. I walked slowly and hoped I was right and he wouldn\u0027t try to do it from a distance, because a bulletproof vest doesn\u0027t always stop a bullet and it doesn\u0027t do anything to protect you from a head shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it didn\u0027t matter. He wasn\u0027t there. Damnit, I knew he wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I breathed easier when I walked into my hotel. I may have been disappointed but I was also relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were three plainclothesmen in the lobby. They identified themselves right away. I stood around with them for a few minutes, and then Durkin came in alone. He went into a huddle with one of them, then came over to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We struck out,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" he said. \"We didn\u0027t leave many loopholes. Maybe he smelled something but I don\u0027t see how. Or maybe he flew home to fucking Bogot–± yesterday and we\u0027re setting a trap for somebody who\u0027s on another continent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can go get some sleep, anyway. If you\u0027re not too wired to unwind. Have a couple of drinks, knock yourself out for eight hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guys have had the lobby staked out all night. There\u0027ve been no visitors, no check-ins. I\u0027m gonna keep a guard down here all night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think it\u0027s necessary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it can\u0027t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We gave it our best shot, Matt. It\u0027s worth it if we can smoke the fucker out because God knows how we could get anyplace combing the city for emerald smugglers. Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll catch the cocksucker sooner or later. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said, and shifted his weight awkwardly. \"Well, listen. Get some sleep, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rode up on the elevator. He wasn\u0027t in South America, I thought. I knew damned well he wasn\u0027t in South America. He was here in New York and he was going to kill again because he liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he\u0027d done it before. Maybe Kim was the first time he found out it felt good to him. But he\u0027d liked it enough to do it again the same way, and the next time he wouldn\u0027t need an excuse. Just a victim and a hotel room and his trusty machete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave a couple of drinks, Durkin had suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t even feel like a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen days, I thought. Just go to bed sober and you\u0027ve got ten days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the gun out of my pocket and put it on the dresser. I was still carrying the ivory bracelet in another pocket and I took it out and set it down next to the gun, still wrapped in paper towels from Kim\u0027s kitchen. I got out of my slacks and jacket, hung them in the closet, and took off my shirt. The bulletproof vest was a tricky thing to get out of and a cumbersome thing to wear, and most of the cops I knew hated wearing them. On the other hand, nobody likes getting shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the thing off and draped it over the dresser next to the gun and bracelet. Bulletproof vests aren\u0027t just bulky, they\u0027re also warm, and I\u0027d perspired inside this one and my undershirt had dark circles under the arms. I took off the undershirt and my shorts and my socks, and something clicked, some little alarm went off, and I was turning toward the bathroom door when it flew open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sailed through it, a big man, olive skinned, wild-eyed. He was as naked as I was and there was a machete in his hand with a gleaming foot-long blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw the mesh at him. He swung the machete and knocked it aside. I grabbed the gun off the dresser and dove out of his way. The blade arced down, missing me, and his arm rose again and I shot him four times in the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 33\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe LL train starts at Eighth Avenue, crosses Manhattan along Fourteenth Street, and winds up way the hell out in Canarsie. Its first stop across the river in Brooklyn is at Bedford Avenue and North Seventh Street. I left it there and walked around until I found his house. It took me a while and I took a couple of wrong turns, but it was a good day for walking, the sun out, the sky clear, and a little warmth in the air for a change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a heavy windowless door to the right of the garage. I poked the doorbell but got no response, and I couldn\u0027t hear the bell sounding within. Hadn\u0027t he said something about disconnecting the bell? I jabbed it again, heard nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brass knocker mounted on the door and I used it. Nothing happened. I cupped my hands and shouted, \"Chance, open up! It\u0027s Scudder.\" Then I pounded on the door some more, with the knocker and with my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door looked and felt awfully solid. I gave it a tentative nudge with my shoulder and decided it was unlikely I could kick it in. I could break a window and get in that way, but in Greenpoint some neighbor would call the cops, or pick up a gun and come over himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI banged on the door some more. A motor worked, and a winch began lifting the electrically operated garage door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way,\" he said. \"Before you knock my damn door down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went in through the garage and he pushed a button to lower the door again. \"My front door doesn\u0027t open,\" he said. \"Didn\u0027t I show you that before? It\u0027s all sealed shut with bars and shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great if you have a fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I go out a window. But when\u0027d you ever hear of the firehouse burning down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was dressed as I\u0027d last seen him, in light blue denim pants and a navy blue pullover. \"You forgot your coffee,\" he said. \"Or I forgot to give it to you. Day before yesterday, remember? You were gonna take a couple pounds home with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, I forgot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For your girlfriend. Fine-looking woman. I got some coffee made. You\u0027ll have a cup, won\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went into the kitchen with him. I said, \"You\u0027re a hard man to get hold of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I sort of stopped checking with my service.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Have you heard a newscast lately? Or read a paper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not lately. You drink it black, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. It\u0027s all over, Chance.\" He looked at me. \"We got the guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guy. The killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. I thought I\u0027d come out and tell you about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said. \"I guess I\u0027d like to hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went through the whole thing in a fair amount of detail. I was used to it by now. It was the middle of the afternoon and I\u0027d been telling the story to one person or another ever since I\u0027d put four bullets into Pedro Antonio Marquez a little after two in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you killed him,\" Chance said. \"How do you feel about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too early to tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew how Durkin felt about it. He couldn\u0027t have been happier. \"When they\u0027re dead,\" he had said, \"you know they\u0027re not going to be back on the street in three years, doing it again. And this one was a fucking animal. He had that taste of blood and he liked it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the same guy?\" Chance wanted to know. \"There\u0027s no question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No question. They got confirmation from the manager of the Powhattan Motel. They also matched a couple of latent prints, one from the Powhattan and one from the Galaxy, so that ties him to both killings. And the machete\u0027s the weapon used in both killings. They even found minute traces of blood where the hilt meets the handle, and the type matches either Kim or Cookie, I forget which one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d he get into your hotel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He walked right through the lobby and rode up in the elevator.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-47.html","bookId":2323,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:25 AM"}
