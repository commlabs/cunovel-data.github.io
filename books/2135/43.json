It turned out that Jill wasn\u0027t much of a girlfriend. She had been someone he\u0027d picked up tonight at a party. I doubted she would go to the police. Truth was, she hadn\u0027t a clue what had happened to her or what was going on, and just before she left, just as she was pulling on her clothes, I gave her a very strong suggestion to not go to the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe merely nodded, grabbed her stuff, gave Andre one last, fearful look, and headed out front to wait for her taxi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look so sad,\" I said. \"There\u0027s more where she came from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndre was presently pressing a bag of frozen peas to his right eye and alternately smoking. It was multi-tasking at its best. I suspected the cigarette might be accelerating the rate at which the bag of peas was melting, but decided to keep my hypothesis to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we listened to a car door open and heard what we both assumed was the taxi speeding off, Andre ground out his cigarette and looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who the fuck are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A private investigator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked. \"You\u0027re kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you learn to fight like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and motioned to the pack of cigarettes. He reached down and shook one out for me. I plucked it out deftly. He next offered me a light and I leaned into it and inhaled. I exhaled a churning plume of blue-gray smoke, and said, \"If I told you, I would have to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve never come across someone like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I doubt you ever will again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied with his free eye; the other being, of course, hidden behind a melting bag of Green Giant peas. \"I believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a thought, and wondered just how far I could go with this mind-control business. I waited until he caught my eye with his one good eye, and said, \"I will tell you what I am, but when I leave your house, you will forget it completely. Understood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me - and looked at me some more - and finally, his one good eye went blank. He nodded. My suggestion had sunk home. A moment later, the dazed look disappeared, and he looked at me again as he had a moment or two before: with confusion and maybe a little awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not human,\" I said. \"Not really. I\u0027m something else. Some call me a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered the bag of peas. His other eye was nearly swollen shut. I saw it working behind all the puffy folds, trying to see through. \"You\u0027re serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deadly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that explains why you\u0027re so fast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And strong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had witnessed my skills firsthand, had seen me doing things he had never seen another human do. It wasn\u0027t hard for him to accept that I was perhaps something different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I thought vampires were, you know, only in books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A form of them are, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to ask me another question and I shook my head. \"We\u0027re not here about me, Andre. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded again, resigned. He returned the peas to his swollen eye and sat back a little in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"When did you learn the dim mak?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Years ago. From a master in Japan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you used it before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought his cigarette to his lips. \"Can\u0027t vampires read minds or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it would do me little good to lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Little good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what will you do with this information?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t decided yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you go to the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. But I doubt they\u0027ll believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled lightly. \"True.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndre Fine was thirty-six years old and well spoken, but I sensed an urban roll to his words. No surprise there, since he had grown up in New Jersey. I knew he had a long list of priors, some of them violent. He had spent six years of his life in various prisons. He was a street fighter - no doubt, a natural fighter - one who had honed his skill into something deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I sat there looking at him, I suddenly knew why he did what he did. And how he could afford such a lifestyle. Whether it was a psychic hit or not, I didn\u0027t know. But I suddenly knew the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a hired killer,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at me and shook his head and smiled. \"You\u0027re good, lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited. He waited. I knew his every instinct was rebelling against talking to me, but I knew he would, even without my prodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am. Of sorts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means I can\u0027t always guarantee death. Some survive the dim mak.\" He shrugged. \"Others don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caesar Marquez was one of those who didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged again. The sign of a true killer. Nonchalance about life and death. Would I ever be that way? God, I hoped not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, people hire you to kill people?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how it works, lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only you can\u0027t guarantee death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"It\u0027s impossible to guarantee death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The victim dies two weeks later,\" I said, \"so no one expects foul play.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at me, his cigarette dangling from his lower lip. \"That\u0027s the beauty of it, lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your hands are registered as lethal weapons, are they not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are. So, you\u0027re really a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not a vampire, as far as I\u0027m aware. Give me your hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did, hesitantly, setting aside the peas. I wasn\u0027t compelling him to do what I wanted, but I think he thought I was, and that was good enough. I took his hands and instantly had image after image of bar fights and street fights and back alley brawls. In all of them, Andre was wearing a hood and shades. In disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you often pick fights with your unsuspecting victims.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. I\u0027d seen the dim mak being delivered, a ferocious blow that left his opponents reeling and dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve killed dozens of people,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged again. \"Who\u0027s keeping track?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, unblinking. He looked back at me, and promptly blinked and looked away. I sensed his fear, I also sensed he was about to do something stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Who hired you to kill Caesar Marquez?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Sorry, babe. That\u0027s where my cooperation ends, vampire or no vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept as he spoke the words, I saw a brief flash. An image. It appeared briefly in his thoughts and was gone. I released his hands and he sat back with the bag of peas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t prove any of this,\" he said. \"No one would believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True,\" I said. \"They wouldn\u0027t believe me, but they would believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat there and thought about it and smoked, and high above us, a low cloud briefly obscured the stars. The wind also picked up. Somewhere in the Malibu Hills, a coyote howled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one can know about what I\u0027ve done,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said nothing and watched him closely. I was certain I hadn\u0027t blinked in many, many minutes. He went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My family is so proud. Everyone is so proud. That feels good. It feels good knowing that I did my family proud. We were so poor. The money was so easy.\" He was babbling now, and I saw the tears. \"Just one punch and I make thousands, tens of thousands. Sometimes, even more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched and waited, catching a brief glimpse of what he was planning on doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t let my family down. I can\u0027t. They\u0027re so proud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said nothing, and watched as Andre Fine, a five-time champion fighter, was reduced to tears and incomprehensible mumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and left him there on the balcony. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-43.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
