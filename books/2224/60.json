I poked him in the ear again with the muzzle of the gun to strengthen my argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re here to snatch the girl. Right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah, man,” said Michael. “We’re here for her husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” said Lawrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” grunted Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You remember what he said, doncha?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah, like I’m gonna be more afraid of fucking Andrew Jackson than I am this asshole”—Michael gestured at me with his chin—“who’s pointing a gun at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s Andrew Jackson?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Man we’re workin’ for,” said Lawrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t give us a name,” said Michael. “But he paid us in twentydollar bills.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s why we call him Andrew Jackson,” said Lawrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he look like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I dunno,” Michael answered. “Tall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How tall?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“’Bout six feet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With black hair,” added Lawrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was he fat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He could afford to lose a few pounds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh. What was the job?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence glanced at Michael and sighed. “He’s going to be pissed, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but think how happy you’re going to make me,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said snatch Sykora,” said Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But not the girl,” added Lawrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said not to hurt the girl,” said Michael. “He was pretty serious about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You tried to hit the girl before,” I reminded Lawrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, man. That was just a message. We were just sending a message, you know, to her old man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t there,” Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you weren’t there,” Lawrence told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m just sayin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, both men turned their gazes forward and stared out the windshield. Lawrence shook his head sadly. Michael smiled. “Damn,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved so I could watch them and see what they were looking at at the same time. It was a pretty sight. Pen leaving the restaurant and striding purposely toward a yellow cab, looking splendid in her rose-colored silk. The cabbie held the back door open for her. She lifted her skirt slightly and slid inside. The cabbie closed the door. A moment later, the vehicle eased out of the lot and down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn,” Michael repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We was told to snatch her old man, but he ain’t even here.” Lawrence looked me in the eye. “You’re here, though. What’s up with that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who told you her husband would be here?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Andrew Jackson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did he know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Do I look psychic?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he tell you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told ya. He said to grab Sykora.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then we were supposed to take him to this place,” Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A motel. On I-35.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which one?” I asked, thinking, God, I’m getting tired of motels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, here. I have the—” Michael had taken his hands off the roof and was reaching for his pants pocket. He stopped when I turned the gun on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got a key,” he said cautiously. “In my pocket.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, Michael,” said Lawrence. “Why don’t you give ’im directions while you’re at it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Slowly,” I told Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key had the name of a motel and a room number on it. I had Michael pass it to Lawrence and Lawrence pass it to me, always keeping the gun trained on them, yet just out of reach. I slipped the key into my jacket pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said he’d call with instructions,” Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just sit in the room and wait for his call. Is that it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know why you were supposed to grab Sykora?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two partners glanced at each other like each was expecting the other to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you even know who he is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s FBI.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A fed?” said Lawrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No fucking way,” Michael insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t like feds,” said Lawrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t mess with ’em, neither,” Michael added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not in this lifetime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at it this way, then,” I told them. “I’m doing you both a favor. Have you got any idea what kind of shitstorm would drop on your heads if you kidnapped an FBI agent?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gee, mister. Thanks a lot,” Lawrence said, but I doubt he was being sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gestured toward the radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like your tunes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Public radio,” said Michael. “It kinda soothes us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you please shut up,” Lawrence told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped away from the pickup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gentlemen, you’ve been very helpful. But here’s the thing. I never want to see either of you again. If I see you again, I’ll figure it’s because you’re after me, and I’ll kill you. Do we understand each other?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another step backward and fired two shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first shot exploded the front tire. The second shot destroyed the rear. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2/page-60.html","bookId":2224,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM"}
