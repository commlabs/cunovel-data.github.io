Bill had worried about his herd, but Cody had told him bluntly that if they didn\u0027t put an end to the vampires within the next few days, the herd was going to be the least of his problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while, as they rode, Alex checked the sky. But she never saw that strange streak of crimson again, and not a single wolf howled at the moon, so she finally had to agree with Cody\u0027s reading of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they got back to Victory, Cody left Brendan to herd the others into the boardinghouse and walked over to the saloon to see how things had gone in town and fill the others in on the events at the Simpson ranch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeulah seemed to find nothing strange in the fact that they suddenly had four new boarders-nonpaying boarders, at that. She sent Tess and Jewell upstairs right away to prepare rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores, however, wouldn\u0027t be sleeping upstairs that night. She was going to lie on the couch in the parlor, and someone would keep watch over her until dawn. When, a few minutes later, someone suggested untying her so she could sleep more easily, Bill, his expression sad but his tone determined, was the first to protest. \"No. We can loosen the bonds a little, but...she\u0027s not to be trusted yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need some rest, Bill,\" Brendan told him. \"I\u0027ll take first watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hadn\u0027t seen Cody enter, yet there he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cody, damn it, you don\u0027t have to do everything,\" Brendan told him. \"I\u0027ll take first shift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Second,\" Bert volunteered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Lord knows, we won\u0027t need a third shift, \u0027cuz it\u0027ll be morning by then,\" Beulah said. \"And with all these mouths to feed come sunup, I\u0027m going to bed.\" She started to leave the parlor, then hesitated and turned, looking at Alex. \"You need your rest, too. Brendan and Bert have this covered. The rest of us need to sleep. And that\u0027s that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Beulah,\" Alex said. She was exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she couldn\u0027t help looking at Cody before she left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, all,\" she said, and headed for the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her room, she waited. She heard Cody enter his room and barely dared breathe as she heard something heavy being set down. His gun, she imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited, tense, her hands clenched at her sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, at last...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a tap on the connecting door. She flew to it, opened it and threw her arms around him, drawing him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her. Hard and deep, and with no sign of weariness. His arms were strong and reassuring as he lifted her against him. She wrapped her legs around him as they walked over to the bed, where he fell to the mattress with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rolled to face each other. \"I was afraid...\" she began, but then her voice faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid?\" he asked gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid that you wouldn\u0027t come, that...oh, Cody, my father, everything that happened...the dreams...I know I\u0027m not normal, and I know we don\u0027t have forever, you\u0027ve made that clear, but I want what we have now. I-\"...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed a finger to her mouth to silence her and smiled deeply, as if she\u0027d given him a tremendous gift. \"Alex...trust me. None of us are normal. Some of us are just farther away than others. Nothing you can do or say could keep me away right now, unless you say that you don\u0027t want me-and even then, I\u0027d still be here, protecting you, wanting you....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you here,\" she assured him, breathless, then stroked his check, threaded her fingers through his hair and marveled that he was there with her, and that he felt the same fever she did. He leaned down, capturing her lips, and she felt his fingers fumbling with the buttons on her shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir kiss, damp, wild and sloppy, was broken by their desire to be rid of the clothing that separated them. They pulled apart, and in moments they were on the bed again, naked flesh against naked flesh. She reveled in the heat that filled her, the energy, the need to get even closer to him.... It seemed like eons since they had been together this way. His eyes met hers with a sensual glitter. And tenderness. She reached out, capturing his head, drawing his mouth back to hers. Whatever inhibitions she might have had were swept away. She caressed his flesh and trembled at the erotic onslaught each time he touched her in return. His eagerness to savor each taste of her was palpable as he pressed his mouth against her, lips first, and then thighs, hips, abdomen, and then...She nearly howled like a wildcat in the night herself, but then she remembered that her house was full and bit down on her lip. She saw his shadow against the wall as he rose over her, then sank into her in a moment of ecstasy as he thrust fully and deeply home. The stars themselves seemed to enter the room, bursting in the night as she writhed and undulated to his rhythm, so close...reaching...easing...reaching...and finally climaxing in an explosion that was somehow both shattering and sweet, volatile and tender, as he wrapped his arms around her. His lips found hers again, and the kiss deepened as they eased down from the heights of sensual pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled to her side, pulling her against him, but he didn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was amazed when her eyes began to close. The feel of his hand, stroking her hair, was soothing and lulling. The warmth of his body, spooned around hers, was secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drifted off to sleep. To sleep, and not to dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she was reaching that nether region between the world of wakefulness and that of sleep, she thought she heard him whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just a few words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If only it could be forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA LEX WOKE UP EARLY the next morning, but it didn\u0027t matter. Cody was already up and gone. She washed and dressed quickly, and hurried downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBursting into the dining room, she was startled by the normality of the domestic scene that greeted her eyes. The Simpsons were seated at the table. All of them. Cody and Brendan were there, too, and Brendan was talking to Bill about the situation back East, while Cody was telling Jared about his experiences in medical school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men all stood as they realized she had entered the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Alex,\" Cody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, everyone,\" she responded, then walked to her chair, just as Beulah entered from the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there you are. Breakfast is warm and ready to be served. It\u0027s lovely, having the table filled, now isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores Simpson was still pale, but her color was much better than it had been, and her eyes were clear. Someone had untied her and allowed her to clean up for the meal. She looked at each one of them in turn and said, \"I can\u0027t thank all of you enough for what you\u0027re doing for me, for my family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a pleasure to have you here,\" Alex said. \"And to see you looking so well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I only remember a little of what happened. It\u0027s all like a-a nightmare,\" Dolores said, flushing and looking downward to work her napkin nervously with her fingers. She looked up again. \"I\u0027m still so afraid.\" She straightened. \"Not of dying. We\u0027re set on this earth to die. I\u0027m afraid of-of turning into a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared rose from his chair and hurried around the table to her. \"You\u0027re not going to become a monster, Mother. We won\u0027t let it happen.\" He looked around the room, as if challenging anyone to disagree with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged her son, and Alex smiled, then saw that Cody was watching them, too, something wistful in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now, that\u0027s that, so let\u0027s eat, shall we?\" Brendan suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as they started eating, they heard a commotion in the street. Horses coming into town, lots of them, and that meant lots of riders. Milo\u0027s men? Alex wondered with a shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody was out of his seat first, warning the others to stay back as he hurried to the front door, though Alex noted that he seemed more concerned than alarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Tall Feather, she saw with relief through the open door as she stepped up behind Cody, ignoring his order to stay put. The chief had brought a party of nine warriors and two extra horses bearing packs made of blankets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Tall Feather slipped down from his horse to greet Cody, she saw Cole coming out of his office, with Dave just a few steps behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, all over town, people were coming out to stand on their porches or the plank sidewalk. Jim Green even came closer to watch the action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tall Feather,\" Cody said, nodding in greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fox,\" Tall Feather returned gravely. \"We have been doing what you instructed. And we have brought something back for you. Last night, as dusk approached, they came. Different from what we had seen before.\" His eyes misted; Alex was sure he was thinking of his daughter. But he stood tall and proud as he spoke. \"They attacked us in a large number, but we were ready. Laughing Man was killed, to our great sorrow, but we dealt with him as we must. But this...travesty we have brought you-these are two of those we killed last night,\" Tall Feather said, indicating the piles on the packhorses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody looked at Tall Feather, then walked around to the packhorses. Cole arrived then, and greeted Tall Feather with respect. He set a hand on Cody\u0027s arm. \"Go carefully,\" he said softly, nodding toward the gathering crowd of townspeople. \"A lot of these folks had kin in Brigsby and Hollow Tree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody nodded as he carefully moved the first blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex had walked around for a better view, and she felt her stomach pitch downward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first corpse belonged to a young woman, just about Alex\u0027s age. She was missing part of her face, and her body was bloated and gray. She was lying next to an elderly man, and next to him, there was a teenage boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard a hoarse cry from down the street. Alex looked up to see Jim Green, his mouth opened in horror, running toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boy. I have to see the boy!\" he said. He pushed his way past them, grabbing the corpses, which fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throats had been slit so deeply that the heads were nearly severed. Each corpse had been staked, leaving a hole through the heart like a double-barrel-shotgun blast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim fell to the ground by the bodies, crying out, \"No, no, no, oh, no. It\u0027s my nephew. I was afraid, but I didn\u0027t want to believe....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex started over to him, then paused. Dolores was already on the way, a set and yet sympathetic look on her face. She rested her hands on his shoulders. \"Come away, Jim. I know how you\u0027re feeling, and you know that-you know how I loved Amy. But this is the right and fitting thing for them. They\u0027re not under the control of that demon from hell anymore. Now your nephew can be buried in hallowed ground. Sheriff Cole will see to it that he\u0027s tended to. You come away now and have some coffee, and don\u0027t be looking at things that will just break your heart. Come on with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed to pull Jim away, and Beulah joined her, putting an arm around his shoulders and leading him into the boardinghouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am sorry for the pain this brings,\" Tall Feather said. \"But we thought we must bring you those who were once your people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did the right thing,\" Cody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex went up to speak to the chief as Cody walked over to talk to the sheriff. \"Chief, do you-do you know any of the dead yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at her with his dark, wise eyes. \"No, Alex, your father is not among the dead we have brought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped back. She saw that Cole and Cody had walked over to the second packhorse and lifted the blanket from the bodies. They eased the dead down to the ground, more easily than Jim had done. Alex thought she recognized a barber from Hollow Tree, but he was so discolored and bloated that she couldn\u0027t be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t seen Dave leave, but he came down the street just then, driving a flatbed wagon. He stepped down and hitched the horses to the rail, and then he and the others began lifting the corpses, laying them out on the wagon bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tall Feather,\" she said, trying not to watch, \"may we offer some refreshment to you and your men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"We thank you for letting us know we are welcome, but today we must go back to our people. We cannot leave the camp alone and unprotected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTall Feather easily mounted his paint stallion by gripping the mane and throwing his leg over the animal\u0027s back. He was aging, but his agility was undiminished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bade a solemn farewell, and then he and his warriors turned, loping their ponies out of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were gone, Brendan turned to Cody. \"We need to go,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to go?\" Alex asked. \"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be back long before dusk,\" Cody promised. \"No need to worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cody, you didn\u0027t answer me,\" Alex said. \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out to the plain,\" he said. \"There are some...signs I need to find. Signs that can lead me to Milo Roundtree\u0027s hideaway.\" He paused for a moment. They had an audience. Jim Green, Beulah and Dolores had gone inside, but Tess and Jewell were still hovering on the porch with Bert and Levy, and Dave and Cole were still standing beside the wagon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody looked as if he wanted to say something to her, but he didn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should go with you,\" Alex said into the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you need to stay here,\" Cody said, and turned away. A moment later he and Brendan walked quickly toward the stables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex started to follow, but Bert set a heavy hand on her shoulder and drew her aside, making certain none of the others could hear when he said, \"Alexandra Gordon, what is wrong with you? Do you want to get that boy killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned quickly to him. \"Bert, I can help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can help best by staying right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and went into the house, furious but inwardly acknowledging that he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY REACHED Hollow Tree in a few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had come heavily armed, but when they reached the center of town, Cody held still, a sinking feeling in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe town felt empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Brendan, who was looking haggard. This was where his family had lived. There was no doubt now. Hollow Tree was a ghost town. Tumbleweeds swept down the street, and nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrendan dismounted in silence. \"Let\u0027s do this. If anything is left crawling around, we\u0027ve got to put it out of its misery-and prevent the same thing happening to anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody nodded, and Brendan started toward one of the buildings, his coat shoved behind his holster, a stake in his hand, his bow and quiver of arrows hung over his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brendan,\" Cody said, and Brendan stopped, his back to his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I should do this alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrendan swung around. \"I\u0027ll be all right. Really, what are the chances we\u0027ll find that my brother and his wife were the ones left here to...to feed on rodents? I say we move. Together. Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody joined him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHollow Tree had been built according to much the same plan as Victory, Brigsby and dozens of other small towns that serviced the ranches and farms in the vastness of Texas. The sheriff\u0027s office was at one end of town, and the saloon was on the opposite side of the street at the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHollow Tree had a small but fine church, however, at the corner of Main Street and what might have become a thriving cross street, had the town been given a chance to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a barber shop right next to the sheriff\u0027s office, along with a general mercantile, a haberdashery and a place that had been called Miss Lola\u0027s Boutique. There were a pharmacy and a bank on the other side of the street. A fellow named Dr. Bernard Pritchard had set up his practice in town, along with James Jones, Esquire, Attorney at Law. Cody also saw a livery, a saddle maker and a blacksmith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne by one, they started going through the buildings. Most were completely deserted, but a few contained corpses, human corpses, along with several decapitated vampires. Apparently someone in Hollow Tree had figured out how to fight the creatures, but if he had survived, he was no longer around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody had been convinced that this was where Milo was holing up, so he searched every building with painstaking thoroughness. He looked for storm cellars, thinking of the way Bill Simpson and his family had taken shelter the night before, but they found nothing. He opened every closet in every building, businesses and residences alike, including the aptly called Hollow Tree Lodging House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn small print beneath the name were the words Families Welcome. Not anymore, he thought grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was when they were nearly finished with the task at hand that they suddenly heard the loud slamming of a door. They stopped dead and looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound had come from the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA LEX WAS CONVINCED SHE couldn\u0027t spend another minute in the house without going crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her effort to make sure that their guests didn\u0027t sit around dwelling on the troubles in their lives, Beulah had set the Simpsons to work; they were busily sharpening brooms, mops and any appropriate household utensil into a stake. The archery targets were still set up, and Bert had promised that when they finished with burial detail, he would be back to help the boys practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim Green had rallied quickly and was angry now. He wanted revenge. He, too, was happy to sharpen brooms and think about getting some target practice in, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex managed to slip out to the stables. She didn\u0027t bother saddling Cheyenne; she leaped up on the horse the way Tall Feather had, then urged the mare along the carriage trail beside the house before hesitating. She didn\u0027t want to put anyone in danger-especially herself-and she didn\u0027t want to worry anyone, but she couldn\u0027t sit there in the house anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to help with the burial detail and called through one of the windows to tell Beulah where she was going, hoping to avoid giving the other woman a chance to protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Beulah tried to get one in, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex Gordon, why on earth would you want to do that? You really ought to be-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex didn\u0027t hear the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was already riding out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see the men working as she rode closer, struggling because the ground out here was hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a few of the townspeople had pitched in, and they seemed to be making as quick a task of it as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex flicked the reins across Cheyenne\u0027s neck, and the mare took off, delighting in stretching her legs as she galloped across the open land between the graveyard and the town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole looked up, resting his hands on his shovel as she drew near, slowing her mare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should be at home,\" he said wearily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to see if I could help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flicker of amusement crossed his face. \"What, you think you can dig faster than these men and me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flushed. \"No.\" She slid down from Cheyenne\u0027s back, tied the mare to the fence and walked over to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corpses had been taken from the wagon and were lined up on the ground, covered with blankets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breeze blew a strand of hair into her eyes and she swept it aside, looking at Cole. \"Did you know any of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said. \"The doc is there, and a young fellow named Sam Birch, who was starting up a newspaper. But there\u0027s one corpse...no. He might have been passing through or something. Looks like a Latin gentleman. None of us knew him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex sighed. \"The doc-I remember him. I saw him a few times when I got sick...and when I broke my fingers once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a right fine man,\" Cole said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Jim Green\u0027s nephew...\" she murmured. \"I really would like to help. I can\u0027t dig better or faster than anyone, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could say more, she noticed that Cole was looking past her. She heard hoofbeats and swung around to see who was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree riders were heading their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda Gordon, Dolly and Sherry Lyn, from the saloon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" Cole muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women slid down from their horses and walked over. They looked awkward-except for Linda, who seemed to be in charge, even though Dolly was the madam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda walked straight to the fence and accosted Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to see the corpses, Sheriff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Linda, please. No one needs to see those corpses,\" Cole said. \"Go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda nodded toward Alex. \"You let my stepdaughter in,\" she pointed out. \"Girls, come on. It\u0027s our right to see the dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole\u0027s jaw tightened, and he shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cole, please...\" Sherry Lyn said. \"There was someone...I had a man, an old friend from back East, and he was coming out to see me. I...he didn\u0027t care what I\u0027d been doing. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sherry Lyn, if you cared about him, you don\u0027t want to see him,\" Cole said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to, Cole,\" she said. \"His name is Carlos Ramiro, and...I have to know. I have to see....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole fell silent then, and he made no protest as they walked around to the gate, where the other men greeted them politely, tipping their hats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one tried to stop them, only watched as Linda walked straight over to the row of bodies. She pulled back each blanket in turn until she got to the fourth corpse and went still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSherry Lyn suddenly let out a cry that was horrified, mournful, and full of the worst agony and loss imaginable. Then she fell to her knees and crawled over to the corpses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sherry Lyn, no!\" Dolly cried in dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sherry Lyn wasn\u0027t to be deterred. She reached for the body of the man Cole had assumed to be a traveler and wailed, \"It\u0027s him. Oh, God, it\u0027s him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to reach for the corpse, moving to hold him as if he were a soldier, dead in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Cole called out, racing over to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Sherry Lyn clutched the body, the head went rolling away, and blank brown eyes stared sightlessly up to heaven. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-of-the-wolves-vampire-hunters-1/page-14.html","bookId":2698,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:37 AM"}
