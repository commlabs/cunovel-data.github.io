They went by the brown windmill. They saw Hilda, Karl, and Kassie playing in the snow. Hilda, Karl, and Kassie shouted at them and waved their hands. Jan and Katrina waved back to their friends, and Rink ran on and on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77970.html","bookId":498,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:50:38 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 12:50:38 PM"}
