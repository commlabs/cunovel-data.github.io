She opened her eyes, waking from her ten minute nap. A strong scent of alcohol still lingered about the tip of her nose.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe laboratory that was originally spotless was now a mess. Empty bottles of alcohol were tossed about everywhere, and the carts that were originally full of petri dishes had half a box of strong alcohol that was still untouched.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone sat in the middle of this pile of empty bottles, a bottle of half finished alcohol in her left hand. Her head was hung, and her right hand forcefully grabbed at her soft gray hair. Her arms were wrapped around her knees. On her body was still a set of dragonrider uniform that didn’t really seem to match her body. In addition, one could see from the lieutenant commander insignia that this wasn’t her uniform at all. Her upper clothes only had two buttons fastened, and behind them was supple and snow-white skin. It seemed like Persephone wasn’t wearing anything under the uniform.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAn intense wave of pain woke Helen up. She frowned, rubbing her head that felt like it was going to split open before standing up with some difficulty. However, when she stood up straight, her stomach suddenly rolled over and over, and her weak legs almost couldn’t support her body. Helen’s face immediately became pale as she grabbed the laboratory table beside her to support herself. She took a moment to compose herself and waited until the parts of her body that were unwell settled a bit before taking out a syringe and injecting it into her thigh. Only after two minutes had passed did some color return to her face that was as pale as paper.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt had already been several years since she was last drunk like this. Helen loathed the feeling of losing control, and thus she disliked alcohol. She could count the number of times she got drunk on her fingers, and they were almost always related to this worrisome Persephone. As a dragonrider general, Persephone’s powerful constitution allowed her to drink several boxes of strong liquor before feeling a slight buzz, while Helen without any abilities could only drink a single kilogram before losing consciousness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe drug quickly flowed through her bloodstream, comforting Helen’s stomach that was tossing about and turning itself inside out. After drinking a cup of water, she felt a bit better.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Dear, what have I done?” Persephone asked somewhat ambiguously.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen she heard this question that had been asked at least seven or eight times already, a raging headache returned to Helen’s head. She forcefully suppressed her disorderly mood and repeated her fixed answer, “You did what you had to do, you captured Su.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Su?” Persephone suddenly raised her head, her gray hair drawing a beautiful arc through the air. She finished the what remained in the bottle in her hands before laughing self-mockingly. “Going to bed with him once means that I’ve caught him? Heaven knows how many women have gone to bed with him!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen gave herself another nutrient-filled injection. While injecting herself, she said, “You are different.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHaha!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWe’re all women, so how am I any different?” Persephone’s laugh seemed a bit on edge.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Of course you are different! How much have you paid for Su? Moreover, it’s not unreasonable to say that you saved his life. Even though Su has never brought these things up, I believe that he remembers them all in his heart. Meanwhile, all of your investments will return several times in the future! These investments obviously include going to bed with him!” Helen injected all of the contents of the syringe and then tossed it into the disposal box. Quite a bit of color returned to her face.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone sighed and said, “Saved him? But if it weren’t for me, he wouldn’t have even entered the Black Dragonriders.

In this era, stealing was what was normal human behavior.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone grabbed another bottle, and with a light twist, she twisted off the cork together with the bottleneck. The alcohol poured into her mouth like a stream, immediately emptying a small half of the bottle into her stomach. Helen’s comforting was still unable to calm her down and instead often had the opposite effects.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen started up the complete scanner. She slowly dragged the snow white reclining platform from the semi-cylindrical apparatus and said towards Persephone, “Stop drinking. Come, lie down. I am going to examine your body.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone walked over, and after hesitating for a bit, she took off the uniform and laid down on the platform that Su had already experienced too many times. When the Black Dragonrider uniform was removed, one could see many traces of that intense battle she fought against Su on her sparkling and snow white skin. When she saw this, the corners of Helen’s eyes twitched ever so slightly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe scanner slowly closed, and then it released a slight rumbling sound. An enormous display stood vertically to the apparatus’s side. As the scan progressed, the screen continuously flickered with data, and it also formed a three-dimensional image of Persephone. Helen pulled up Persephone’s past data, and while comparing it with the current data, she said, “It seems like your gains from the northern front weren’t small.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA small screen displayed the naked Persephone who was lying on the scanner.
