Various public-spirited citizens-” the Patrician\u0027s eyes took in the Council and Lady Ramkin-“and, of course, myself, feel that an appropriate reward is due.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes still looked blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Reward?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is customary for such heroic endeavour,” said the Patrician, a little testily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes faced forward again. “Really haven\u0027t thought about it, sir,” he said. “Can\u0027t speak for the men, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an awkward pause. Out of the corner of his eye Vimes was aware of Nobby nudging the sergeant in the ribs. Eventually Colon stumbled forward and ripped off another salute. “Permission to speak, sir,” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Patrician nodded graciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant coughed. He removed his helmet and pulled out a scrap of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Er,” he said. “The thing is, saving your honour\u0027s presence, we think, you know, what with saving the city and everything, or sort of, or, what I mean is ... we just had a go you see, man on the spot and that sort of thing ... the thing is, we reckon we\u0027re entitled. If you catch my drift.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assembled company nodded. This was exactly how it should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do go on,” said the Patrician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we, like, put our heads together,” said the sergeant. “A bit of a cheek, I know ...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please carry on, Sergeant,” said the Patrician. “You needn\u0027t keep stopping. We are well aware of the magnitude of the matter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right, sir. Well, sir. First, it\u0027s the wages.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The wages?” said Lord Vetinari. He stared at Vimes, who stared at nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant raised his head. His expression was the determined expression of a man who is going to see it through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir,” he said. “Thirty dollars a month. It\u0027s not right. We think-” he licked his lips and glanced behind him at the other two, who were making vague encouraging motions-“we think a basic rate of, er, thirty-five dollars? A month?” He stared at the Patrician\u0027s stony expression. “With increments as per rank? We thought five dollars.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licked his lips again, unnerved by the Patrician\u0027s expression. “We won\u0027t go below four,” he said. “And that\u0027s flat. Sorry, your Highness, but there it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Patrician glanced again at Vimes\u0027s impassive face, then looked back at the rank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s if?”he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobby whispered in Colon\u0027s ear and then darted back. The sweating sergeant gripped his helmet as though it was the only real thing in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was another thing, your reverence,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah.” The Patrician smiled knowingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s the kettle. It wasn\u0027t much good anyway, and then Errol et it. It was nearly two dollars.” He swallowed. \"We could do with a new kettle, if it\u0027s all the same, your lordship.\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Patrician leaned forward, gripping the arms of his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to be clear about this,” he said coldly. “Are we to believe that you are asking for a petty wage increase and a domestic utensil?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrot whispered in Colon\u0027s other ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon turned two bulging, watery-rimmed eyes to the dignitaries. The rim of his helmet was passing through his fingers like a mill wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” he began, “sometimes, we thought, you know, when we has our dinner break, or when it\u0027s quite, like, at the end of a watch as it may be, and we want to relax a bit, you know, wind down ...” His voice trailed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose a dartboard would be out of the question-?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thunderous silence that followed was broken by an erratic snorting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes\u0027s helmet dropped out of his shaking hand. His breastplate wobbled as the suppressed laughter of the years burst out in great uncontrollable eruptions. He turned his face to the row of councillors and laughed and laughed until the tears came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughed at the way they got up, all confusion and outraged dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughed at the Patrician\u0027s carefully immobile expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughed for the world and the saving of souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughed and laughed, and laughed until the tears came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobby craned up to reach Colon\u0027s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you,” he hissed. “I said they\u0027d never wear it. I knew a dartboard\u0027d be pushing our luck. You\u0027ve upset \u0027em all now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Mother and Father [wrote Carrot] You will never guess, I have been in the Watch only a few weeks and, already I am to be a full Constable. Captain Vimes said, the Patrician himself said I was to be One, and that also he hoped I should have a long and successful career in the Watch as well and, he would follow it with special interest. Also my wages are to go up by ten dollars and we had a special bonus of twenty dollars that Captain Vimes paid for out of his own pocket,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSgt Colon said. Please find money enclosed. I am keeping a little bit by though because I went to see Reet and Mrs Palm said all the girls had been following my career with Great Interest as well and I am to come to dinner on my night off. Sgt Colon has been telling me about how to start courting, which is very interesting and not at all complicated it appears. I arrested a dragon but it got away. I hope Mr Varneshi is well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am as happy as anyone can be in the whole world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour son, Carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes knocked on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn effort had been made to spruce up the Ramkin mansion, he noticed. The encroaching shrubbery had been pitilessly hacked back. An elderly workman atop a ladder was nailing the stucco back on the walls while another, with a spade, was rather arbitrarily defining the line where the lawn ended and the old flower beds had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes stuck his helmet under his arm, smoothed back his hair, and knocked. He\u0027d considered asking Sergeant Colon to accompany him, but had brushed the idea aside quickly. He couldn\u0027t have tolerated the sniggering. Anyway, what was there to be afraid of? He\u0027d stared into the jaws of death three times; four, if you included telling Lord Vetinari to shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his amazement the door was eventually opened by a butler so elderly that he might have been resurrected by the knocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yerss?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain Vimes, City Watch,” said Vimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked him up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes,” he said. “Her ladyship did say. I believe her ladyship is with her dragons,” he said. “If you like to wait in \u0027ere, I will-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know the way,” said Vimes, and set off around the overgrown path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kennels were a ruin. An assortment of battered wooden boxes were lying around under an oilcloth awning. From their depths a few sad swamp dragons whiffled a greeting at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of women were moving purposefully among the boxes. Ladies, rather. They were far too untidy to be mere women. No ordinary women would have dreamed of looking so scruffy; you needed the complete self-confidence that comes with knowing who your great-great-great-great-grandfather was before you could wear clothes like that. But they were, Vimes noticed, incredibly good clothes, or had been once; clothes bought by one\u0027s parents, but so expensive and of such good quality that they never wore out and were handed down, like old china and silverware and gout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon breeders, he thought. You can tell. There\u0027s something about them. It\u0027s the way they wear their silk scarves, old tweed coats and granddad\u0027s riding boots. And the smell, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small wiry woman with a face like old saddle leather caught sight of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” she said, “you\u0027ll be the gallant captain.” She tucked an errant strand of white hair back under a headscarf and extended a veiny brown hand. “Brenda Rodley. That\u0027s Rosie Devant-Molei. She runs the Sunshine Sanctuary, you know.” The other woman, who had the build of someone who could pick up carthorses hi one hand and shoe them with the other, gave him a friendly grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Samuel Vimes,” said Vimes weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My father was a Sam,” said Brenda vaguely. “You can always trust a Sam, he said.” She shooed a dragon back into its box. “We\u0027re just helping Sybil. Old friends, you know. The collection\u0027s all to blazes, of course. They\u0027re all over the city, the little devils. I dare say they\u0027ll come back when they\u0027re hungry, though. What a bloodline, eh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m sorry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sybil reckons he was a sport, but I say we should be able to breed back into the line in three or four generations. I\u0027m famed for my stud, you know,” she said. “That\u0027d be something, though. A whole new type of dragon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes thought of supersonic contrails criss-crossing the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Er,” he said. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, we must get on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Er, isn\u0027t Lady Ramkin around?” said Vimes. “I got this message that it was essential, she said, for me to come here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She\u0027s indoors somewhere,” said Miss Rodley. “Said she had something important to see to. Oh, do be careful with that one, Rose, you silly gel!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More important than dragons?” said Vimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Can\u0027t think what\u0027s come over her.” Brenda Rodley fished in the pocket of an oversized waistcoat. “Nice to have met you, Captain. Always good to meet new members of the Fancy. Do drop in any time you\u0027re passing, I\u0027d be only too happy to show you around.” She extracted a grubby card and pressed it into his hand. “Must be off now, we\u0027ve heard that some of them are trying to build nests on the University tower. Can\u0027t have that. Must get \u0027em down before it gets dark.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes squinted at the card as the women crunched off down the drive, carrying nets and ropes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt said: Brenda, Lady Rodley. The Dower House, Quirm Castle, Quirm. What it meant, he realised, was that striding away down the path like an animated rummage stall was the dowager Duchess of Quirm, who owned more country than you could see from a very high mountain on a very clear day. Nobby would not have approved. There seemed to be a special land of poverty that only the very, very rich could possibly afford . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was how you got to be a power in the land, he thought. You never cared a toss about whatever anyone else thought and you were never, ever, uncertain about anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe padded back to the house. A door was open. It led into a large but dark and musty hall. Up in the gloom the heads of dead animals haunted the walls. The Ramkins seemed to have endangered more species than an ice age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes wandered aimlessly through another mahogany archway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a dining room, containing the kind of table where the people at the other end are in a different time zone. One end had been colonised by silver candlesticks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was laid for two. A battery of cutlery flanked each plate. Antique wineglasses sparkled in the candlelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA terrible premonition took hold of Vimes at the same moment as a gust of Captivation, the most expensive perfume available anywhere in Ankh-Morpork, blew past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, Captain. So nice of you to come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes turned around slowly, without his feet appearing to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Ramkin stood there, magnificently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes was vaguely aware of a brilliant blue dress that sparkled in the candlelight, a mass of hair the colour of chestnuts, a slightly anxious face that suggested that a whole battalion of skilled painters and decorators had only just dismantled their scaffolding and gone home, and a faint creaking that said underneath it all mere corsetry was being subjected to the kind of tensions more usually found in the heart of large stars. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guards-guards-discworld-8/page-50.html","bookId":1627,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM"}
