But I’m calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amy, do you really want our first time to be here…. In a dingy room with three other people?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pauses, relaxing a tiny bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make me horny,” I suggest. “Then we’ll go back to my hotel room and take it from there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitates, but only for a split second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.” She lifts her chin. “What would you like to see? What would make you horny, Dominic?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI settle onto a tall stool, my feet crossed in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lick her,” I gesture toward Anika. “Then her,” and I point at Anna. “Then they both can lick you. Do you have your pierced toy in your purse?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy shakes her head, but Anika chimes in. “We have a whole cabinet of toys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perfect,” I smile. “I’ll give you a toy when the time is right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey nod and words fade away as they pile into the bed. Clothing comes off and sex noises fill the room. Wet noises, moaning, sucking. Whimpers. Sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see that Amy is enjoying herself, just as I can see that Tara has passed out against the wall. It doesn’t matter. I’m not here for Tara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter everyone has been sufficiently licked, I find a toy in the cabinet, a two-headed dildo. A head for the front and one for the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hand it to Anika. “Use this on her. She likes it up the ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy’s eyes are unfocused as the three women continue. Hands are everywhere, on soft female thighs and plump female lips. It’s enough to lift my dick, but I don’t concentrate on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I can’t help but ponder how I got to this point. A twinge of pain pulls at my belly as I think of a pair of blue eyes, innocent eyes. Eyes that loved me. Eyes that decimated me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would horrified if she knew I was here, if she knew how far I’ve fallen into the darkness. I swallow hard and reach into my pocket, fingering her necklace and steeling my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’ll never be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBile rises from my stomach as I remember her…as I remember what happened. What I caused. I swallow the ugly taste and swallow again, hard. Forcing the memories from my mind, I turn my attention back to the present and the women debauching themselves in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one controls Dominic Kinkaide. Not anymore. I don’t have a heart left to control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the women are all distracted with each other, I pull out my phone and snap pictures. And when I’m done with that, I turn on the video camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only takes a couple of minutes to get what I need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for Amy to get what she needs. She moans and writhes on the bed as Anika brings her to orgasm, her hands twisting in the sheets beside her. Her face is sweaty, her eye make-up smeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she comes, she calls out and holds my gaze. She lies still for a moment, and then the twins get up matter-of-factly, straightening their hair and putting their lingerie back on, preparing for the next customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy is limp as we walk to the car and I almost have to carry Tara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ride to the hotel is quiet as Amy leans into me, spent from her kinky sex with the prostitutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts a hand on my thigh as our driver pulls up to the curb in front of the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come to my room,” she says throatily, her hands smelling like sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift an eyebrow. “For what? You already came tonight. I’m sure you’re exhausted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrow and she grips my leg tighter. “Dominic, I already told you what would happen if you don’t fuck me tonight. You don’t want to risk that, trust me. Because I meant what I said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her, my eyes hard as I lift her fingers from my thigh and squeeze them firmly in my hand. Not hard enough to hurt, but hard enough to get my point across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amy, you’re a bitch. And I don’t give a flying fuck if you walk away from me tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snarls, her face twisting into something ugly. “Don’t you know by now? I always get what I want. And trust me, if you walk away from me, I swear to Christ that I’ll make up a fantastic story about being jilted by you for the studio heads. They’ll be so pissed at you that they might fire you. Do you want that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile now, amused as I pull out my phone. Quickly, I find the video of her with the prostitutes on my phone. She gasps as she watches Anika fucking her with the dildo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I doubt they would be pissed at me when they hear that I broke up with you because this video leaked online. Obviously, they would understand that I just can’t be linked to something so scandalous. And they wouldn’t want to be linked to you, either. You’d be the one fired, Amy. Not me. So tread lightly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause with my fingers poised over the button that would link the video to YouTube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to get out of this car and you’re never going to try and put me into a corner again. I don’t like ultimatums. You’re going to go your way, I’m going to go mine. We’ll work together. I won’t say anything bad about you, and you won’t say anything bad about me. And this video will stay on my phone. But the first time I get a hint that you’re spreading shit about me to the studio heads, this video will be anonymously submitted to every possible gossip site online within minutes. Got it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy stares at me with poison in her eyes. “You’re a fucking dickhead, Dominic. And you’ve fucked with the wrong woman. Someday, I’ll fuck you back…so hard that your asshole will bleed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes at that visual as I open the car door and get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, until then,” I say calmly, and I close my door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel her astonished gaze burning into my shoulder blades as I walk away and leave her in the car with Tara passed out on the seat beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t feel vindicated. I don’t feel good. I just feel empty, like always. But at least I’ve got Amy off my back and I won’t have to deal with her anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make my way to my hotel room and as I do, I find police officers swarming the lobby and in the elevators. I turn to one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me, shaking his head wearily and speaking with a heavy accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An American rock band is having a wild party with under-age girls,” he growls. “Fecking celebrities. They think they don’t follow the same rules.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him, not responding, because I know that we don’t. We don’t follow the same rules. I get off on my floor and as soon as I do, I pick up the phone to call Tally. He answers on the first ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got a mess to clean up,” I tell him. “And it’s not mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShooting for the promos with Amy is uncomfortable, to say the least. She shoots daggers at me from across the room with her eyes and when we have to kiss for a picture, she bites my lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don’t react. I won’t give her the satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, when she is sitting in a lounger by the wall, I engage in phone sex with an old friend, Kira, from back home. Amy glares at me for a moment, then stalks away to her trailer. I grin into the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I’ll be home soon, Kira. No, I can’t fly you here. I won’t be here long enough. I’m coming to Chicago soon. Maybe I’ll even be home next weekend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira laughs her familiar laugh. I’ve known her for so long, she’s known me since we were kids. In fact, she was Emma’s best friend. She knows what Emma did to me. And she’s been here to comfort me for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard Sin almost got hauled off to jail last night,” she mentions. “Fiona called me this morning complaining about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin, trying to picture how worked up my little sister Fiona probably was. Since she’d taken the job as Sin’s manager, he’s definitely put her through her paces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. He’s got to get better about guessing girls’ ages. Or he has to start taking an interest. So far, he doesn’t give a flying fuck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira laughs. “Well, I’m glad he didn’t get into trouble. It’s a good thing the laws there are so much more relaxed about that stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I agree. “It’s the only thing that kept him out of jail. Has it hit the news there yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s on some gossip sites,” Kira answers. “But I wouldn’t worry about it too much. It’ll blow over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I agree,” I tell her. “Sin’s having a party next weekend at his house. Are you coming?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am if you are,” she purrs. “I’ve missed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin. “I’ll be there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hang up and I head outside, through the halls that lead to the doors. The sunlight pours in through the glass, and I can see the crowds of women flocking outdoors, just waiting to get a glimpse of Amy or me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second I emerge, the women begin screaming and pressing toward me. Security moves me fluidly through the crush of women and within a minute, I’m deposited into a waiting car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the darkness envelopes me, I close my eyes. As we drive away, I can still hear the women calling out my name. Asking for pictures, asking for autographs, asking for kisses and hugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey don’t know me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey don’t know what I’ve done, or what I’m capable of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey don’t know any of it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-we-burn-beautifully-broken-2-5/page-8.html","bookId":2760,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:04:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:04:03 PM"}
