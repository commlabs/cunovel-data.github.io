We didn\u0027t hide it, so he\u0027d be discovered by the police and given a real burial soon. I wanted his parents to be able to give him a ceremony, but this would keep him safe from scavenging animals (and Little People) in the meantime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe broke camp before dawn. Mr. Tall told everybody there was a long trek ahead. Sam\u0027s disappearance would create a fuss, so we had to get as far away as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered, as we left, what had become of R.V. Did he bleed to death in the forest? Did he make it to a doctor in time? Or was he still running and screaming, \"My hands! My hands!\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t care. Although he\u0027d been trying to do the right thing, this was R.V.\u0027s fault. If he hadn\u0027t gone messing with the locks on the wolf-man\u0027s cage, Sam would be alive. I didn\u0027t hope R.V. was dead, but I didn\u0027t say a prayer for him, either. I\u0027d leave him to fate and whatever it had in store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra sat beside me at the rear of the van as the Cirque pulled out. He started to say something. Stopped. Cleared his throat. Then he put a bag on my lap. \"I found that,\"he muttered. \"Thought you might want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough stinging eyes I read the name - \"Sam Grest\"- then burst into tears and cried bitterly over it. Evra put his arms around me and held me tight and cried along with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Crepsley told me what happened,\"Evra mumbled eventually, recovering slightly and wiping his face clean. \"He said you drank Sam\u0027s blood to keep his spirit alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently,\"I replied weakly, unconvinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\"Evra said, \"I know how much you didn\u0027t want to drink human blood, but you did this for Sam. It was an act of goodness, not evil. You shouldn\u0027t feel bad for drinking from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess,\"I said, then moaned at the memory and cried some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day went by and the Cirque Du Freak rolled on, but thoughts of Sam couldn\u0027t be left behind. As night came, we pulled over to the side of the road for a short break. Evra went to look for food and drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want anything?\"he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"I said, my face pressed against the window-pane. \"I\u0027m not hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called him back. \"Wait a sec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a strange taste in my mouth. Sam\u0027s blood was still hot on my lips, salty and terrible, but that wasn\u0027t what had started the buds at the back of my tongue tingling. There was something I wanted that I\u0027d never wanted before. For a few confusing seconds I didn\u0027t know what it was. Then I identified the strange craving and managed to crack the thinnest of smiles. I searched Sam\u0027s bag, but the jar must have been left behind when we left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up at Evra, I wiped tears from my eyes, licked my lips, and asked in a voice that sounded a lot like that smart-ass kid I once knew, \"Do we have any pickled onions?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-34.html","bookId":2438,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:08 PM"}
