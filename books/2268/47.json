He started to run down the nearest path, searching the shadows and mist, shouting her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blackhawk?\" Massey was chasing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent stopped dead. Huey was standing before him. \"They got out of here, Injun boy. Jumped the fence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blackhawk, what the hell… are you talking to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She got out of here. It\u0027s all right,\" Huey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blackhawk, sweet Jesus, but you\u0027re giving me the willies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring at Huey, knowing he was hearing the truth, Brent felt such a surge of relief that he nearly sank to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s all right,\" he murmured, closing his eyes. \"I was so afraid that I\u0027d find corpses!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are corpses. Three of them,\" Massey thundered. \"What in God\u0027s name are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Brent\u0027s pocket vibrated. He reached for his cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nikki?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his relief, he heard her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re outside, Brent,\" she said quickly. \"Julian thinks we should get the hell out of here as quickly as possible. He says we don\u0027t know anything. But I had to make sure you were all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should I do? I wouldn\u0027t know what to say to the police. They already think I\u0027m crazy. They must really think you\u0027re crazy, but at least you\u0027re \u0027officially\u0027 crazy—sorry, an official of some kind who\u0027s crazy—and… oh, God, you are all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blackhawk,\" Massey protested. \"Are you listening to me? We\u0027ve got three corpses in the cemetery. We\u0027ve got hours and hours\u0027 worth of paperwork, and you\u0027d better have some kind of explanation for all this. And what are you doing? Romancing your girl on the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine, Nikki. Listen, go—\" He paused, in an agony of indecision. He was almost positive that Julian was innocent of any wrongdoing. He would be willing to bet that neither Patricia nor Nathan was involved, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem was, there wasn\u0027t going to be just one guilty party in this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he didn\u0027t know just who was involved, or how deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to the police station, Nikki. Tell Julian to walk you there, and if he doesn\u0027t want to hang around, he can go home. Just tell them you\u0027re waiting for me, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to be here for hours,\" Massey told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Brent snapped back at Massey, who began swearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Massey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to the police station, Nikki,\" Brent repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent turned and stared at Massey. \"Three corpses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we had help tonight,\" he said dryly. \"Haggerty. Well, hell, none of them got away, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are they? Do we know any of them?\" Brent demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell do I know? We haven\u0027t gotten the ski masks off the stiffs yet,\" Massey said. \"Let\u0027s go. The ME is on his way. Oh, man, this is going to be bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the station, Nikki and Julian were told that they had to sit and wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian grew so restless that he was annoying. His phone rang countless times, and he winced every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you just answer?\" Nikki demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she might figure out where I am and come here,\" Julian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to deal with it,\" Nikki told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"Yeah, I know. How do I get into these things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By being cute and irresistible?\" Nikki suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared at her and began to pace. \"Man, we\u0027re a pair, aren\u0027t we? You\u0027re into a guy who sees ghosts, and I… man, I used to think I was all that. Then I met the nympho of the century. Nikki, do we have to wait here forever? What if we went to Harrah\u0027s or something? Someplace safe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brent said to wait here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to be morning soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when it is, I\u0027ll just call Max and tell him that he\u0027s got to deal with his own business for a day, because I\u0027m going to sleep. And I\u0027m giving you the day off, too. How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" he said, taking a chair again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desk sergeant gave him an aggravated look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t quell Julian, who was quickly up again, pacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I go to your house?\" he asked plaintively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, and he sighed. \"No, I\u0027m not going to leave you here alone. We\u0027ll wait. We\u0027ll just wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo men were dead by the wall. Brent was certain that he\u0027d never seen either of them before. Naturally, they carried no identification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third corpse, the one by the tomb—the one who had been taking aim right where Nikki and Julian had been hiding—was just as much a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey swore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A shoot-out, and all three of the perps dead. This is not good, not good. There\u0027s going to be some serious explaining to do. The higher-ups are going to be going crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shot this one,\" Brent said. \"In the hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can check the bullets,\" Brent told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey shook his head. \"I went after the two coming in from the rear after I heard the first shot. Joulette was right behind me. I don\u0027t know if I killed one of the other two or not. They started firing away at us, and I fired back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this one was killed by Haggerty,\" Brent said. \"And ballistics will prove that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haggerty was right behind us, but I couldn\u0027t say what he was doing. I warned him, but they were already firing at us. Who knows if he heard me.\" He swore again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent kept silent but clenched his teeth. \"We should have gotten some answers from these guys,\" he said. \"They shouldn\u0027t all be dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got answers,\" Joulette said, walking tiredly toward him. \"There\u0027s a stash of drugs in the oven tombs that you wouldn\u0027t believe. Apparently this has been a dispersal point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I guess that\u0027s it then,\" Massey said. \"This is what Tom Garfield was on to. This is why he died. He got in with these guys somehow, and then they made him, knew he was an agent, and that\u0027s why he died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not it. Or not all of it. Come on, Massey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent protested. \"There was something wrong with Tom Garfield when he was in Madame\u0027s that morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of these guys must have been around,\" Massey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent shook his head. \"That\u0027s not the end of it, and you know it. No one shot him up with heroin in the middle of Madame\u0027s,\" Brent said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but… someone could have slipped him something at Madame\u0027s, enough to mess him up. Then they got him out of the Quarter, shot him up and dumped him,\" Joulette said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how does that explain Andrea Ciello?\" Brent demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey swore. Joulette looked down at his feet. \"Maybe we\u0027ll have something when we get identities on these guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you believe there is a connection?\" Brent demanded. \"And that we\u0027re not done, that finding these guys isn\u0027t the end of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoulette looked at Massey. \"No. Right after you were in today, we got a report. Andrea Ciello\u0027s place was torn apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Brent said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looked like a robbery, except that our fellows don\u0027t think that it was. Nothing obvious was missing. We figured we\u0027d get Nikki DuMonde in tomorrow, find out for sure. But there was too much valuable stuff still left there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So someone was searching for something,\" Brent murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what it looks like,\" Joulette agreed. \"Anyway, let\u0027s get to work. We need to finish up here, leave it to the crime scene team, and get the paperwork done.\" He sounded exhausted and despondent. \"Dead, dammit. All dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rather them than us,\" Massey said, trying to sound more optimistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, there\u0027s that. But this isn\u0027t going to look good,\" Joulette said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did make a major drug bust,\" Brent pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how are you going to explain it?\" Massey asked. \"The papers will have a heyday with it. \u0027Psychic warns police on drug deal.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about we don\u0027t tell the papers mat?\" Brent said. \"Tell them that you talked to the girl who\u0027d been attacked, and that your conversation led you to believe it was more than just vandals or schoolkids pulling pranks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reporters and the television crews are already assembling,\" Joulette said. \"This mess isn\u0027t going to look good for Harold Grant. It will be like, wow, look at the city under him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It depends what spin you put on it,\" Brent said. \"Look at what the police officers did during his term. It could give him a boost. Go make your statement. I\u0027ll meet you at the station,\" Brent told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoulette looked at Massey, who shrugged. \"What about Haggerty ? What if he gives some kind of a statement, too? Knowing him, he\u0027ll claim he was the one who caught up with these guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, he didn\u0027t want to be in on the paperwork. He doesn\u0027t get to be in the papers,\" Joulette said. \"Blackhawk, you know a way out of here… ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet,\" Brent said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent was glad of the time it took to walk from the cemetery to Royal Street. It was time to think. Oddly enough, though it was sad to see anyone dead, it wasn\u0027t the fact that the drug dealers had been killed in the cemetery that disturbed him the most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the knowledge that Andrea Ciello\u0027s place had been ransacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doubted the culprits had been any of the thugs in the cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor had it been Max, Julian, Patricia or Nathan. Not given the timing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hoods were dead. But he knew damn well they hadn\u0027t been the limits of the operation. There had to be someone else behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he took Max, Julian, Patricia and Nathan off the list, that left Mitch. But he had seen Mitch during the day, when the apartment had been ransacked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-47.html","bookId":2268,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
