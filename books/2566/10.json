I’m sorry.” Her voice, as transparent and fragile as a soap bubble: “Let go, Chris. Stop fighting it. Let it go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“N-no.” The cold was a boot on his back, a fist on his chest, a hand draped over his eyes. Can’t see, can’t move, can’t . . . “Wuh . . . why . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh,” she said. “I’m sorry, Chris, but there’s nothing we can do for you. You’re hurt too badly. This is better, Chris. Trust me. It’ll go easier if you stop fighting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if he wanted to fight? I don’t want to die, I’m not ready, I’m not . . . “Nooo,” he moaned. “Don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh,” she said again, but now her voice was no more than a sliver, a waning crescent of sound. “Don’t fight it, Chris. Accept this and let go. I’ll stay with you until the end. You won’t be alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. But he couldn’t stop this. His mind was drifting away, higher and higher, the margins of his world closing down like an iris. No . . . don’t let go, Chris . . . don’t . . . let . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke in agony. Gasping—no, not gasping; croaking, straining for air, the sound a ragged awk-awk, an invisible fist crushing her throat. She swam up from the dark of nothing and into the blackness that was her now. The pain in her lungs was awful, more than a burn; every breath was like sucking down broken glass. Her brain was pulsing so hard it felt like her heart had crawled into her skull. Or maybe that was the monster, straining to get out, beating its fists against bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom just above her left eye came a dim, sulfurous glow. White light? Was this how it was supposed to go? First, the light as her brain, starved for oxygen, gave up the ghost, and then that tunnel, and at the end . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, not a glow. Tiny pinpricks. Not breaks in the snow either. She worked at bringing the light into focus and understood: Ellie’s Mickey Mouse watch. She hadn’t taken it off since the night before that terrible morning that Harlan shot Tom and took Ellie. Mickey said it was—she forced her vision to firm—five after seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePast dawn. Been here for . . . She couldn’t do the math. The glow from Ellie’s watch was fading, the lights winking out and pulling apart even as her mind shimmied and seemed to swell beyond the limits of her skull. For a brief moment, she actually thought she was standing above, on the snow, as her gaze swept over splintered trees, rocks fractured to rubble, and . . . a ski pole? She couldn’t tell, had no time to parse it out. The vision faded and what was left was something blinding and too white, like the eye of a full moon before the world died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis must be that last tunnel. There was the light. That was where she had to go, because Tom had been there, high above and unreachable, and if only she could float far enough, fast enough . . . Tom . . . wait . . . wait for me . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden, her mind shifted with a hard, panicky clench, a flutter, the sudden bunch and twist of the monster sensing that she really was on her way out. That this was it, end of the line—and it was fighting like hell to work its way free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite everything, she wanted to laugh. Might have, if she’d had the air. The monster had become something more, the way Kincaid thought it would, but it was still trapped inside her head, and she was buried alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGot you . . . I g-got you . . . Her thoughts were slurring. Hurts, this hurts. So hard to focus. Words slipping through her fingers, dropping out of her mind. Everything going away, except for the pain. Hurts. No air. Chest . . . hurt, hurt. Dark. No . . . air . . . n-no, can’t let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought to suck in one more breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan’t . . . l-let . . . Outside the torture house, the horses were restless, nickering and tossing their heads. Matching him step for step, Greg’s golden retriever, Daisy, alternated between anxious pants and high whimpers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Man, you see that?” Pru asked in a low voice. “Yeah. All the animals are spooked.” He looked up at the older boy. “You felt it, too. I know you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Felt what?” With his fun nixed, Aidan had attached himself to Greg and Pru. For Aidan, an alert over the radio? Excellent. Go where the trouble was, because you just never knew when the next opportunity for a little mayhem might present itself. “I didn’t feel nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I did. Ground shook, just like Kincaid said. Like a . . . a rumble, something vibrating. You know? When a semi goes by? Or a big lightning strike, real close?” Pru lifted his nose and sniffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” Aidan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sniffing for the ozone,” Pru said. “You know. The way air smells after lightning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up.” Aidan snorted. “Lightning’s electricity. It ain’t got a smell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it does,” Greg said. “Like car exhaust in summer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ozone,” Pru repeated, then shook his head. “I don’t smell anything but the snow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I can’t smell because it’s so damn cold,” Aidan said. “My nose froze five minutes ago. You guys are just being pussies, letting Kincaid psych you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah?” Pru pointed to the left of the stable’s slider. “Look at the snow, A.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreg saw what Pru meant at once. They’d had fresh snow the night before, but instead of only a new layer icing the hard pack piled atop the entry ramp, there were discrete hummocks, like miniature mountains of sifted confectioners’ sugar. Digging out his flashlight, Greg scrutinized the roof. The stable had no gutters, so whatever melt there’d been showed in a glittering bristle of long icicles, as sharp and pointed as bloodied fangs. Several had snapped, however, and now protruded, like silver stilettos, from the hard pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?” Flipping up his snorkel hood, Aidan jammed his gloved hands into his parka pockets and hunched his shoulders against a sudden snatch of wind. “Snow slid off,” he said, his voice so muffled and far back it reminded Greg of second grade: tin cans on string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.” Pru said. “But why’d the snow slip? It hasn’t been warm enough for a melt, and the snow’s not soft. Those icicles are snapped clean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Slabs got shaken so much they slid right off.” Greg skimmed the light over the roof and saw naked shingles where snow had caromed down the incline. “Same as an avalanche.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on.” But Aidan sounded uncertain now. “What could do that? Like . . . an earthquake? That’s crazy. This is Michigan. Stuff like that doesn’t happen here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Until now,” Greg said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePART TWO:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHERE THE BODIES ARE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was another foot this time—the left, and a guy’s. Those tufts of hair sprouting from the toes? Dead giveaway. The owner was a pig. Terminal case of corns, two huge bunions, calluses so rough you could use them for sandpaper, and toe rot. Since the person had been old—they were all old—the skin was mottled, papery, wormy with bulging blue veins. The crumbling nails were so long they actually curled into snot-colored talons. Peter couldn’t imagine how the old geezer had walked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got to kill the guards,” Simon hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” Peter said, over the bong-bong-bonging. Damn bells had started up eight days ago, right after the Rule mine blew, and just wouldn’t quit. Naked as a jay, he sat cross-legged on the chilled concrete of his corner cell, trying very hard not to look around for Simon. No point. That little bugger—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—hallucination—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas fast. And Peter certainly didn’t want to linger over the others, who watched from the remaining nine cells: glittery-eyed Changed, their faces pressed to the bars like monkeys in a zoo. The only thing they didn’t do was hoot. Peter thought there had to be at least sixty kids. Knowing Finn, there were probably a lot more Changed stashed in other cages throughout the camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing that got to Peter? Well, besides Simon and the bong-bongbong of the bells and being naked and stewing in his own shit? Some of these Changed had names. He knew these kids, and that freaked Peter out, big-time. For example, in the cage directly opposite, that honking big kid with the Neanderthal brow? Lee Travers: Forest Road, third house on the right. His squirrelly grandma spent all day whacking furrows with this wicked-sharp Warren hoe, whether that garden needed to be dug up or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what about this very pretty, doe-eyed brunette in the cell to his left? That girl who made him hungry in ways he couldn’t hide well without clothes? He was pretty sure that was Kate Landry: sixteen, liked cats, and oh my God, those lips, those breasts. Peter got these flashes, the two of them, naked, thrashing in the snow . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop it. Peter’s breathing had sped up, his mouth gone dry with desire. Get control. Think. Why is Finn snapping up these particular kids? Their friends?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, instead of thinking about sex,” Simon said, “you should be figuring a way out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand that, Simon,” Peter muttered, averting his eyes from the very luscious Kate, those lips, her breasts. At times, another idea floated into his brain, something right out of Rise of the Planet of the Apes: kill the guards, open the cages, and they’d surge out to conquer the world. Or The Wizard of Oz: Fly, my pretties! Fly, fly! But first: sex. Lots and lots of sex, in the snow, on concrete, anywhere; take Kate, bend her back, and take her and take her and take—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you wish,” Simon said. “Be lucky she doesn’t bite it off for a snack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus, Simon, shut the hell up.” Christ, he couldn’t have even a good fantasy in peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make me. You’ve got way more important things to worry about, like me and Penny, not to mention Finn and why he’s rounding up Changed, kids from Rule, the mine, and all you can think about is hooking up with some girl? We need you!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/monsters-ashes-trilogy-3/page-10.html","bookId":2566,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:03 PM"}
