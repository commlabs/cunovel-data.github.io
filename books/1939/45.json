I\u0027m charging you. Or Medicare, as the case may be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got to be kidding! No wonder people say no good deed goes unpunished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened to his heart. \"Not bad,\" I told him. There was a strong, steady beat. I listened again, then moved the stethoscope around to his back. \"Take a deep breath,\" I instructed. His lungs, too, sounded fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing all right,\" he muttered when I checked his reflexes. \"I\u0027ve decided I\u0027m not dying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, not yet, anyway. Those chest pains? They went away. Must\u0027ve been indigestion from eating cat food.\" I couldn\u0027t suppress a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to run a couple of blood tests,\" I said. \"Just to make sure your latest self-diagnosis is correct.\" I now suspected his fainting spells had been caused by hypoglycemia and I wanted to confirm that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You afraid of giving me a little blood, Harvey? If you do it, you\u0027ll get a sticker for your forehead and a lollipop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t respond for a moment, then sighed in resignation. \"Why didn\u0027t you say so earlier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good boy.\" As I said it, I had a clear memory of the time he\u0027d called me \"boy\" and how I\u0027d felt about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a long way from being a boy,\" he grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" I patted him on the back and helped him off the examination table, aiding him with his balance. \"Didn\u0027t you tell Macy you\u0027re in your second childhood? Just think of this as your annual checkup before you hit puberty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grumbled again, but I could tell he was amused. And he did let Linda take his blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning when I met Ritchie at the gym, I knew it was a mistake to say anything about Macy. But I hadn\u0027t slept well, and when he prodded me about that, I blurted it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s back?\" my brother-in-law said, half jogging, half running on the treadmill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pretended I hadn\u0027t heard him, running at my own pace. We were on machines that stood side by side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You talked to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I don\u0027t plan to, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRitchie slowed his speed. \"You honestly intend to stay away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise, he didn\u0027t have an automatic comeback. I glanced over at him and saw that he was studying me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get it, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What don\u0027t you get?\" I was foolish enough to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You. Macy disappears and you moon after her for weeks. In case you aren\u0027t aware of it, you were miserable and you made everyone else miserable, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologized for that.\" Unfortunately, Ritchie had been on the receiving end of my bad mood for much of that time. Fortunately, however, he\u0027s a good friend and he put up with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you apologized, but it wasn\u0027t enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What more do you want?\" I asked. This was probably going to cost me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, name it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask yourself what Hannah would want you to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped running and nearly lost my balance as the treadmill shot me backward. At least I had the presence of mind to grab the handlebars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was below the belt,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about it,\" Ritchie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would Hannah want me to do? Good question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she\u0027d just have to tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter and Pierre were sprawled at opposite ends of the leather sofa in her condo. Their feet met in the middle and they both had cookbooks propped on their laps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter dropped her book on the floor with a thud. \"What about a cold avocado soup for lunch?\" It was early Sunday afternoon, a lazy summer Sunday with flawless August weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blended with buttermilk?\" \"And fresh lime juice,\" Winter suggested. \"Add a little salt, and ooh-la-la!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds delicieux. But--\" he raised his eyebrows \"--the soup might be too thick, depending on how much avocado you use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" Winter nodded. \"I have a secret ingredient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierre\u0027s cell phone rang and he reached inside his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter could tell from the way he stiffened that it was bad news. He listened for a few minutes, then stood and walked over to the window. He started pacing, back and forth, back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up and watched him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Pierre swore and snapped his cell phone shut before shoving it in his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I work with a group of imbeciles,\" he shouted. \"Where do they find these people? I would assume I could have one day off, but, oh, no.\" He stormed into the kitchen. \"Where is my book?\" he demanded. \"Mon cahier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What book?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one I had with me earlier, of course. My book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter didn\u0027t think it was her responsibility to keep track of his book. Besides, it wasn\u0027t really a book, but a notebook, one he always carried with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pierre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you see I\u0027m in a rush?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inhaled and closed her eyes. This was a telling moment. She could respond with anger or she could remain calm. Her instinct was to return tit for tat, but experience told her that would only exacerbate the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked into the kitchen, where he was tossing papers to and fro, searching for his \"book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me help,\" she offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hide it from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally she\u0027d be infuriated by his ridiculous accusation. Instead, she laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and regarded her suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this what you\u0027re looking for?\" she asked, holding up his notebook. He\u0027d left it on the table in plain sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned and put out his hand. She held the notebook out of reach. \"It\u0027s going to cost you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile crinkled the corners of his eyes and then faded. \"Our Sunday afternoon is ruined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027ll be other afternoons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierre threw his arms around her. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank Alix\u0027s mother-in-law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her mother-in-law?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" she said, touching her lips to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left shortly afterward, and Winter settled back on the sofa. For the past six weeks, she and Pierre had been dating. This time, they hadn\u0027t made the mistake of moving ahead too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the initial meeting after their three-month break, Pierre had been guarded and brusque. He seemed determined to end their relationship until Winter had coerced him into trying the exercise Alix had taught her. When Pierre saw how he reacted to things that bothered him about Winter, his eyes, too, had been opened. Now, a month later, their relationship wasn\u0027t without problems, and breaking old habits required constant effort, but it was working. Winter was happier than she\u0027d been all year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell asleep on the sofa and was awakened by Pierre\u0027s kiss an hour later. She wrapped her arms around his neck and savored everything about him--his strong, solid body, his warm clean scent, the steady beating of his heart. \"Mmm. This is a lovely way to wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierre chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter\u0027s phone pealed in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not again,\" Pierre moaned. \"Don\u0027t answer it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pierre, I have to. It could be important.\" She didn\u0027t remind him that she hadn\u0027t asked him not to answer his phone earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released her with obvious reluctance, and she grabbed the phone just before it went to voice mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alix is having her baby!\" Lydia from A Good Yarn said excitedly. \"She called a few minutes ago and she\u0027s in labor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought Jordan was supposed to call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t, but you know Jordan when it comes to this baby--he can\u0027t think straight. Alix sounded a lot calmer than he did.\" Lydia laughed. \"I could hear him in the background insisting she get off the phone, that they had to get to the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their baby\u0027s going to be one spoiled infant.\" Winter intended to do a fair amount of that spoiling herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now Jordan\u0027s a nervous wreck,\" Lydia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he is. He\u0027s a first-time father and with what happened before--well, it\u0027s understandable.\" They talked a while longer and then Winter ended the conversation. \"Thanks for letting me know. Call me if you hear anything and I\u0027ll do the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierre and Winter made the avocado soup, and it was as delicious as Winter had known it would be. Pierre laughed at her \"secret ingredient,\" which was ice cubes. She added ten to the recipe, using the ice to both cool and thin out the avocado and buttermilk blend. She also added an extra cup of milk and served the soup with crumbled blue cheese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierre made chicken curry sandwiches to complement it. Halfway through lunch, Winter set down her spoon and lowered her half-eaten sandwich to her plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" Pierre asked. \"Too much curry in the chicken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s perfect.\" Pierre was a master at gauging spices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worried about Alix,\" Winter murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Women have babies every day. There\u0027s nothing to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter hoped that was true. \"It\u0027s just...a feeling I have.\" She stood and walked aimlessly around the kitchen. A moment later, she\u0027d made a decision. \"I want to go to the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mais, ce temps--c\u0027est pour la famille. A time like this is for family,\" he translated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Alix\u0027s family. She doesn\u0027t have anyone except us-- the people of Blossom Street who love her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierre considered her words, then slowly nodded. \"Would you like me to accompany you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded with relief. \"I was hoping you\u0027d offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you, my love, anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter put their dirty dishes in the sink while Pierre dealt with the leftovers. She collected her purse and they headed out together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason she felt less worried when they arrived at the hospital. Perhaps that was simply because she was doing something now, even if that something was just waiting in a different place. To her surprise she discovered the waiting room was full. She recognized Larry and Susan Turner, who were sitting across from Lydia Goetz and Casey, her thirteen-year-old daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Winter.\" Lydia smiled when she saw her. She was a lovely woman, a two-time cancer survivor whose petite, delicate beauty belied her emotional strength. \"I told Casey you wouldn\u0027t be able to stay away, either, and I was right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom\u0027s always right,\" Casey said teasingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And don\u0027t you forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter knew that Lydia and her husband, Brad, had adopted the girl the year before. She\u0027d started off as a foster child and, over the summer, the family had grown to love her. The girl had become close to Alix and often stopped at the cafe to chat with her. Casey must be anxious for news of the baby\u0027s birth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You all know Pierre, don\u0027t you?\" Winter asked, stepping over to where the Turners had gathered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarry stood, and Pierre shook hands with Jordan\u0027s father. \"We met at the wedding,\" Larry said. \"This is our first grandchild,\" he added nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonne chance,\" Pierre said. \"I\u0027m wishing you the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you two stop?\" Susan said with a laugh. \"Everything\u0027s going to be fine.\" She had a crochet project on her lap, and Winter could see that Casey had brought her knitting. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-45.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
