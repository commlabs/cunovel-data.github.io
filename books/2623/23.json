The same scene all over again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll tell you in the morning. Okay?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re out of your mind,\u0027 said the boss\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you really have to go away?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t say that!\u0027 Olga shouted. She\u0027d sensed what I was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I said it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sveta, when they suggested you should mutilate yourself to prolong your mother\u0027s life, and you refused . . . You did what was right, what was rational, didn\u0027t you? But now you\u0027re suffering. And the pain\u0027s so bad, it would have been better to act irrationally.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If you don\u0027t go now, will you suffer?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then go. Only come back, Anton.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up from the table, leaving my cold tea. The Inferno vortex swayed above us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I will, for sure,\u0027 I said. \u0027And believe me . . . the situation isn\u0027t hopeless.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of us said another word. I went out of the apartment and began walking down the stairs. Svetlana closed the door behind me. That silence . . . That deathly silence, even the dogs had howled themselves out that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrrational, I thought, I\u0027m being irrational. If there\u0027s no ethically correct solution, act irrationally. Did someone tell me that? Have I just remembered a line from my old course notes, a phrase from a lecture? Or am I looking for excuses?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The vortex . . .\u0027 Olga whispered. Her voice was almost unrecognisable, husky. I wanted to press her head against my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed the door to the building open and stepped out on to the icy pavement. The owl circled above my head like a bundle of white fluff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Inferno vortex had shrunk, it was shorter. Not a lot, relative to its overall height, but enough so that I could see it, maybe one and a half or two metres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Did you know that would happen?\u0027 asked the boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at the vortex and shook my head. Just what was going on here? Why had the Inferno reacted by growing larger and stronger when Ignat showed up? Putting people into a mellow state of mind was his speciality. Why had my aimless conversation and unexpected departure made the vortex shrink?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s time I sacked that group of analysts,\u0027 said the boss. I realised he\u0027d said it to everyone, not just me. \u0027When will we have a working hypothesis for what\u0027s going on?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car suddenly appeared from the direction of Zelyony Avenue, catching me in the glare of its headlights. Its tyres squealed as it bounced clumsily over the bumps of broken tarmac and stopped beside me. The hot-orange, low-slung, sporty cabriolet looked ridiculous, surrounded by the prefabricated, multi-storey blocks of a city where the best way of getting around was still a jeep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSemyon stuck his head out on the driver\u0027s side and nodded:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Get in. I\u0027ve been told to drive you like the wind.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked round at Olga and she sensed my glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve got a job to do here. Go.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked round the car and got into the front. Ilya was sprawled in the back – the boss must have decided the Tiger Cub-Bear double act needed reinforcements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anton,\u0027 said Olga\u0027s voice, pursuing me through the Twilight. \u0027Remember . . . you made a deal today. Don\u0027t forget that, not for a single moment. . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t understand at first what she was talking about. The witch from the Day Watch? What had she got to do with anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car jerked, scraping across the hummocks of ice. Semyon swore with relish as he twisted the wheel and the car began crawling toward the avenue with an indignant roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What halfwit did you get this car from?\u0027 I asked. Driving around in this in this weather . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlya laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Shshsh! Boris Ignatievich has lent you his very own car.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you serious?\u0027 I asked, turning to face him. The boss was always delivered to work in his office BMW. I\u0027d never realised he had a penchant for impractical luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s the truth. Antosha, how did you manage that?\u0027 Ilya nodded in the direction of the vortex hanging above the houses. \u0027I never realised you had powers like that!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I never touched it. Just talked to the girl.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Talked? You mean you didn\u0027t fuck her?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was Ilya\u0027s usual way of talking when he was feeling tense about something. And he had plenty of reasons for feeling tense just then. But it still made me wince. I thought what he said sounded strained ... or maybe he just hit a raw nerve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No. Ilya, don\u0027t talk like that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sorry,\u0027 he said flippantly. \u0027So what did you do?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I just talked.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car finally hurtled out onto the avenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hold tight,\u0027 said Semyon curtly. I was pressed back in my seat. Ilya lolled about behind me, taking out a cigarette and lighting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty seconds later I realised that my previous ride had been no more than a lazy jaunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Semyon, has the probability of an accident been deleted?\u0027 I shouted. The car hurtled through the night, as if it was trying to overtake the beams of its own headlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve been driving for seventy years,\u0027 Semyon said contemptuously. \u0027I drove trucks on the Road of Life during the siege of Leningrad!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no reason to doubt what he said, but the thought crossed my mind that those journeys had been less dangerous. He hadn\u0027t been moving this fast, and predicting where a bomb\u0027s going to fall is no great challenge for an Other. There weren\u0027t many cars around now, but there were some, the road was terrible, to put it mildly, and our sports car was never meant for conditions like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ilya, what happened over there?\u0027 I asked, trying to tear my eyes away from a truck swerving out of our path. \u0027Have you been posted on that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You mean with the vampire and the kid?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We did something stupid, that\u0027s what happened,\u0027 said Ilya, and then he swore. \u0027Maybe not really all that stupid . . . We\u0027d done everything right. Tiger Cub and Bear introduced themselves to the kid\u0027s parents as their favourite distant relatives.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027\"We\u0027re from the Urals\"?\u0027 I asked, remembering our course on social contacts and how to get to know people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. Everything was going fine. The table was set, the drink was flowing, they were pigging out on Urals delicacies . . . from the nearest supermarket. . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They were really having a great time.\u0027 That note in Ilya\u0027s voice didn\u0027t sound like envy, more like enthusiastic approval of his colleagues. \u0027Everything was just fine. The kid sat with them some of the time, some of the time he was in his room . . . How could they know he was already able to enter the Twilight?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a cold shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, how could they have known?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t told them. And I hadn\u0027t told the boss. Or anyone. I\u0027d been satisfied with pulling Egor out of the Twilight and sacrificing a little of my own blood. A hero. The solitary warrior in the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlya went on, not suspecting a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The vampire hooked him with the Call. Very neatly too, the guys felt nothing. And firmly . . . the kid never made a sound. He entered the Twilight and climbed up on to the roof.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Over the balconies. He only had to climb up three floors. The vampire was already waiting for him. And she knew the boy was under guard – the moment she took him, she revealed herself. Now the parents are sound asleep and the vampire\u0027s standing there with her arms round the kid, while Tiger Cub and Bear are going out of their minds.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything. I didn\u0027t have anything to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Our stupid mistake,\u0027 Ilya concluded. \u0027And a combination of unforeseen circumstances with potentially fatal consequences. Nobody had even initiated the kid . . . How could anyone know he could enter the Twilight?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I knew.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it was my memories that did it, or perhaps I was just frightened by our terrible speed as the car raced along the highway, but I looked into the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople are so lucky that they can\u0027t see this – ever! And so unlucky that they will never be able to see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA high, grey sky, where there have never been any stars, a sky as glutinous as milk jelly, glowing with a ghastly, wan light. The outlines of everything have softened and dissolved – the buildings, covered with a carpet of blue moss, and the trees, with branches that sway regardless of which way the wind\u0027s blowing, and the streetlamps, with the birds circling above them, barely moving their short wings. The cars coming towards you move really slow, the people walking along the street are hardly even moving their feet. Everything appears through a grey light filter, everything sounds as if your ears are plugged with cotton wool. A silent, black and white movie, an eerie, elegant director\u0027s cut. The world from which we draw our strength. The world that drinks our life. The Twilight. Whoever you really are when you enter it, that\u0027s who you are when you come out. The grey gloom dissolves the shell that has been growing over you all your life, extracts the core that people call the soul and tests its quality. And that\u0027s when you\u0027ll feel yourself crunching in the jaws of the Twilight, you\u0027ll feel the chilly, piercing wind, as corrosive as snake venom . . . and you\u0027ll become an Other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd choose which side to take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is the boy still in the Twilight?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They\u0027re all in the Twilight,\u0027 said Ilya, diving in there after me. \u0027Anton, why didn\u0027t you tell them?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It never occurred to me. I didn\u0027t think it was that important. I\u0027m not a field operative, Ilya.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe find it impossible, or almost impossible, to reproach each other. Especially when someone\u0027s really messed up. There\u0027s no need, our punishment is always there, all around us. The Twilight gives us more strength than humans can ever have, it gives us a life that is almost immortal in human terms. And it also takes it all away when the time comes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one sense we all live on borrowed time. Not just the vampires and werewolves who have to kill in order to prolong their strange existence. The Dark Ones can\u0027t afford to do good. And we can\u0027t afford the opposite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If I don\u0027t pull this off. . .\u0027 I didn\u0027t finish the sentence. Everything was already clear anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEEN THROUGH the Twilight it actually looked beautiful. Up on the roof, the flat roof of that absurd \u0027box on stilts\u0027, I could see different-coloured patches of light. The only things that have any colour in there are our emotions. And there were plenty of those around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brightest of all was the column of crimson flame that pierced the sky – the vampire\u0027s fear and fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027She\u0027s powerful,\u0027 Semyon said simply, glancing up at the roof and kicking the car door shut. He sighed and started taking off his coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are you doing?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll go up the wall. . . over the balconies. I advise you to do the same, Ilya. Only you go in the Twilight, it\u0027s easier.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And how are you going?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-23.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
