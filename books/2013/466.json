It is for you! Karsa Orlong, it is for you!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was coming up from the sand. A wide, heavily muscled man, and three black-skinned bhokorala.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa limped to meet them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal felt his heart pounding in his chest. He’d not expected… well, he’d not known what to expect, only what was expected of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are not welcome,’ said the giant with the tattooed face and the wounded leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m not surprised. But here I am anyway.’ Withal’s eyes flicked to the sword lying in the grass. The Tiste Edur’s head was resting on it like a gift. The weaponsmith frowned. ‘Poor lad, he never understood-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I do,’ growled the giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal looked up at the warrior. Then over to where crouched the Crippled God, before returning once more to his regard of the giant. ‘You said no?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As much.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Will you take it now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will-to break it on the forge where it was made.’ And he pointed to the ramshackle smithy in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crippled God hissed, ‘You said it could never be broken, Withal!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weaponsmith shrugged. ‘We’re always saying things like that. Pays the bills.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA horrid cry was loosed from the Crippled God, ending in strangled hacking coughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant was studying Withal in return, and he now asked, ‘You made this cursed weapon?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I did.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back-handed slap caught Withal by surprise, sent him flying backward. Thumping hard onto his back, staring up at the spinning blue sky-that suddenly filled with the warrior, looking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t do it again.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after saying that, the giant moved off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking in the white sunlight, Withal managed to turn onto his side, and saw the giant walk into a portal of fire, then vanish as the Crippled God screamed again. The portal suddenly disappeared with a snarl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the nachts brought its horrid little face close over Withal, like a cat about to steal his breath. It cooed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, yes,’ Withal said, pushing it away, ‘get the sword. Yes. Break the damned thing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world spun round him and he thought he would be sick. ‘Sandalath, love, did you empty the bucket? Sure it was piss but it smelled mostly of beer, didn’t it? I coulda drunk it all over again, you see.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clambered upward, swayed back and forth briefly, then reached down and, after a few tries, collected the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff to the smithy. Not many ways of breaking a cursed sword. A weapon even nastier would do it, but in this case there wasn’t one. So, back to the old smith’s secret. To break an aspected weapon, bring it home, to the forge where it was born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, he would do just that, and do it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the three nachts peering up at him, he scowled. ‘Go bail out the damned boat-I’m not in the mood to drown fifty sweeps from shore.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creatures tumbled over each in their haste to rush back to the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal walked to the old smithy, to do what needed doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, the Crippled God bawled to the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA terrible, terrible sound, a god’s cry. One he never wanted to hear ever again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the forge, Withal found an old hammer, and prepared to undo all that he had done. Although, he realized as he set the sword down on the rust-skinned anvil and studied the blood-splashed blade, that was, in all truth, impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, the weaponsmith raised the hammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen brought it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEPILOGUE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked through the shrouds of dusk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd came to repast\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Gates of Madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the living gamed with death And crowed triumphant At the Gates of Madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the dead mocked the living And told tales of futility At the Gates of Madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came to set down her new child There on the stained altar At the Gates of Madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This,’ said she, ‘is what we must do, In hope and humility At the Gates of Madness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the child did cry in the night To announce bold arrival At the Gates of Madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave we dreamed this enough now?
