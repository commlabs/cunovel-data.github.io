He stared out over the oddly silent Fifth Avenue at the pale, dawn-lit shadows of Central Park. We\u0027re done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t been able to sleep so he\u0027d turned on the TV and begun channel surfing. He\u0027d paused when he recognized Reverend Eckert\u0027s face - that damn fool seemed to be on some channel somewhere every hour of the day and night - and stayed when he heard him rant about a sim giving birth to a half-human baby. And then he\u0027dshown the birth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortero and SIRG had failed. Miserably. And worse, the sim baby was a girl, an all too human-looking girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do I do now? he wondered, his gaze wandering to the squatting granite mass of the Metropolitan Museum a few blocks uptown. The markets were closed today in the US and most of Europe, and the trading day had already ended in Asia. But when the Pacific Rim markets reopened later tonight, SimGen stock would go into freefall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoney wasn\u0027t the issue; even without SimGen he was worth more than he could spend in a dozen lifetimes. No, it was the company itself that mattered. He\u0027d devoted his life to building SimGen. It was his child, his only family, and now the wild dogs he\u0027d kept at bay for so long would leap upon her and tear her to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer thought of the .38 caliber revolver he kept in the drawer by the bed. Maybe that would be the best way, the easiest way. Better that than -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I thinking? It\u0027snot over! I\u0027ll fight this! Stonewall any questions, deny any and all allegations. Sims aremy property, and it will take years - decades! - before someone can say otherwise. And that someone will be the Supreme Court of the United States, because that\u0027s how far I\u0027ll take it. And I\u0027ll win that fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no. This is not over.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-104.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
