We\u0027d come after a zombie, and once we put him back... wherever... Cassandra wanted to listen to music and drink wine spritzers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen in Rome, I guess. By then I probably would need a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now we start walking through alleys, peeking in bars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems a little half-assed to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got a better idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Charlie!\" I shouted. \"Chaaaaaaarlie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne bartender and two waitresses stepped onto the sidewalk, saw us, shrugged, and went back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Cassandra. \"You said names have power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did, didn\u0027t I?\" She took a deep breath and shouted, \"Charlie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarther down, past the jazz clubs, a head poked out between a grocery store and an abandoned building. I recognized that head even before Charlie stepped into the flare of a streetlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bingo,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the powder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did as she said, and each of us took a little into our hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember, blow it right into his face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took one step in Charlie\u0027s direction and he ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell!\" Cassandra snapped, and started to run, too. \"He isn\u0027t supposed to run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hustled after her. I had longer legs, but Cassandra had less weight on hers. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it should be all he can do to shuffle. This guy is weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This guy is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t bother to answer. Charlie was too fast to keep up a conversation and keep up with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led us away from the dewy lights of Frenchmen Street, down roads I couldn\u0027t name without a sign, past signs I couldn\u0027t see without a light. Cassandra didn\u0027t seem disturbed, but then, she probably knew where we were going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, I didn\u0027t think it was a good idea to chase a corpse all over New Orleans when all we had for protection was a zombie-revealing powder that might or might not work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should let him go,\" I wheezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on your life.\" Cassandra wasn\u0027t wheezing, of course. \"This is the closest I\u0027ve ever gotten to a zombie. I\u0027m not giving up the chance to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, she did have to take a deep breath. I felt so much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned, her gaze flicking past me. \"That\u0027s Louis Armstrong Park.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouis Armstrong Park was not a place we wanted to be after the dark. The only place worse was -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going into St. Louis Cemetery Number One.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the guidebooks said, in big, bold, red letters, not to enter any of the cemeteries at night. And not because of a zombie problem, either. There was a certain diceyness, even in the daytime, that made it best to visit in groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp until about eighty years ago, this part of New Orleans had been known as Storyville and was the only legal red-light district in the country. Customers could peruse a book that listed the bordellos and even had pictures of the prostitutes. Jazz flourished, too, since the musical movement was not considered legitimate until much later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after prostitution became illegal again, Storyville remained the place to find a certain kind of girl well into the 1960s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA police station had been built nearby. However, the area still had a dangerous aura that never seemed to go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go back to your place.\" I tugged on Cassandra\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Her mouth thinned into a stubborn line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you so obsessed with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face took on a faraway expression, and for an instant I thought she might confide in me; then the stubbornness returned. \"I have my reasons. You still have your powder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But I\u0027d feel better if I had a gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the one Adam had given me, which was still locked in the trunk of my car, where it was going to be of so much use to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout commenting, Cassandra reached into her bag and withdrew a very long knife. I gaped. Who was this woman?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, it probably isn\u0027t a good idea to walk around with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted a brow. \"Believe me, in this neighborhood, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no one here but us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong. They\u0027re all over the place.\" She headed for the cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back of my neck tingled. Who were \"they\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot wanting to be left alone, I scurried to catch up just as Cassandra reached the front of St. Louis Cemetery Number One. Barbed wire lined the top of the stone fence. The front gate was iron and sported a big lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed a sigh of relief until Cassandra reached out and gave it a shove. The gate slid open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cast me an amused glance. \"How do you think Charlie got in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t just slide through the walls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a zombie, not a ghost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra lifted a palm filled with powder. \"Let\u0027s find out\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout wailing for me to agree or disagree, she slipped through the gate. I glanced longingly at the street, which was lit up like the Superdome on Super Sunday. There were lots of cars and even a few non-zombie people; I wanted to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diana!\" Cassandra snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t let her go alone, so I followed her inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe half-moon only shone enough light into St Louis Cemetery Number One to make the shadows dance and the white stone gleam. Other than that, darkness reigned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch your step,\" Cassandra murmured. \"A lot of the old markers are crumbling. Easy to trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best place to look for a zombie would be Marie Laveau\u0027s tomb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crypt of the New Orleans voodoo queen wasn\u0027t very far from the front gate. Tall but otherwise unimpressive, it was tucked among many others. I wouldn\u0027t have taken the white boxy monument for anything special if not for the flowers in front of the door and the Xs drawn on the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are those?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People believe if they mark three Xs on Marie\u0027s tomb, scratch the ground three times with their feet, or rap three times on the grave, their wish will be granted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to hum \"Knock Three Times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra snorted, then moved closer to the tomb and rapped on the door. Once. Twice. Three times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze as the sound echoed in the stillness of the night. As I half-expected someone to answer, my head snapped around when a bell began to ring somewhere in the cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead ringer,\" Cassandra murmured, and started in the direction of the sound. Since I had no desire to stay behind and see if her rapping had woken the voodoo queen, I followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is a dead ringer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never heard the expression?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. But it means someone who resembles someone else. What does that have to do with a bell in the cemetery?\" I rubbed my arms against a sudden chill. \"In the dark, in the night\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This place was opened in 1789, back when they didn\u0027t know yellow fever was spread by mosquitoes. People thought it could be passed from person to person, be they living or dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understandable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they placed the cemetery outside the city limits in an attempt to keep the fever away. But so many died, and so many panicked, sometimes people got buried before they were dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bummer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and lifted a brow in my direction. \"Times ten. Because of the unique burial practices here, the tombs are opened to inter new bodies. When they started to find fingernail furrows in the doors, they came up with a brilliant idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bell suddenly stopped ringing, and the ensuing silence was so loud, I could hear both of us breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra pointed to a crypt. \"They installed a bell on top, with a string leading inside. People were told if they suddenly awoke in a dark, enclosed space all they had to do was find the string and ring the bell. The cemetery attendant would come and let them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty smart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bad,\" she agreed. \"Except when people began to see the folks they\u0027d only buried a few days ago walking around on the street they were understandably freaked. They coined the term dead ringer to explain the phenomenon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI contemplated the now-silent bell. \"So who was ringing this one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not.\" I grabbed at her arm, but she was already gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the tomb faced away from us. Before we could turn the corner, a loud thunk split the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra stopped so fast, I ran into her back. \"Sounded like a door,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are there still cemetery attendants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I was afraid of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether we peeked around the corner and discovered Charlie helping a woman out of the crypt. The name on the tomb read: Favreau. I filed that away for later use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You take him; I\u0027ll take her,\" Cassandra ordered, and stepped out of hiding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Charlie and the woman growled at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Beasly,\" I blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave no indication that she heard me or that she knew her name, just continued to snarl in tandem with Charlie. I hadn\u0027t thought a person could snarl, and while Cassandra and I were too far away to be sure, I could swear both of them had fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra cut a quick glance in my direction. \"You know her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Missing librarian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder they couldn\u0027t find her. Why search in a crypt marked: Favreau?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she dead?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see a lot of live people climb out of tombs snarling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the two stalked in our direction, Cassandra hurriedly lifted her palm and put her lips near her wrist. I did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" Cassandra ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe exhaled; the powder flew, coating their faces in pale yellow particles. Slowly my arm dropped back to my side as Charlie and Mrs. Beasly stopped walking and started coughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for them to shrivel, disintegrate, disappear. But they didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie smacked me in the chest with the flat of his hand. Any air I had left in my lungs rushed out as I sailed backward and slammed into a crypt wall. I collapsed, too stunned to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra\u0027s knife flashed; Mrs. Beasly hissed as smoke rose from the cut in her forearm. She recovered quickly, backhanding Cassandra hard enough that she joined me on the ground. Mrs. Beasly was far too strong to be a live little old lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two advanced. I tried to get up, but I was still loopy. Cassandra didn\u0027t look much better; she was going to have a shiner in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced around for her knife, but the weapon had clattered in another direction when she was hit. Not that it had done her any good against a superhuman zombie librarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that redundant?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two paused a few feet away, their bodies blotting out the light of the half-moon so that a silver halo appeared behind their heads. I couldn\u0027t see their faces, but the mumbles coming from their mouths were more animal than human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that zombie powder works,\" Cassandra murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo sharp reports split the night Charlie and Mrs. Beasly jerked once and then exploded in blazing balls of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think they\u0027re zombies,\" I said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-19.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
