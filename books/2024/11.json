{"id":107788,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\u003cp\u003eJACOB DIDN\u0027T CALL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first time I called, Billy answered and told me that Jacob was still in bed. I got nosy, checking to make sure that Billy had taken him to a doctor. Billy said he had, but, for some reason I couldn\u0027t nail down, I didn\u0027t really believe him. I called again, several times a day, for the next two days, but no one was ever there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday, I decided to go see him, invitation be damned. But the little red house was empty. This frightened me��was Jacob so sick that he\u0027d needed to go to the hospital? I stopped by the hospital on the way back home, but the nurse at the front desk told me neither Jacob or Billy had been in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made Charlie call Harry Clearwater as soon as he got home from work. I waited, anxious, while Charlie chatted with his old friend; the conversation seemed to go on forever without Jacob even being mentioned. It seemed that Harry had been in the hospital . . some kind of tests for his heart. Charlie\u0027s forehead got all pinched together, but Harry joked with him, blowing it off, until Charlie was laughing again. Only then did Charlie ask about Jacob, and now his side of the conversation didn\u0027t give me much\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto work with, just a lot of hmms and yeahs. I drummed my fingers against the counter beside him until he put a hand over mine to stop me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Charlie hung up the phone and turned to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry says there\u0027s been some trouble with the phone lines, and that\u0027s why you haven\u0027t been able to get through. Billy took Jake to the doc down there, and it looks like he has mono. He\u0027s real tired, and Billy said no visitors,\" he reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No visitors?\" I demanded in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie raised one eyebrow. \"Now don\u0027t you go making a pest of yourself, Bells. Billy knows what\u0027s best for Jake. He\u0027ll be up and around soon enough. Be patient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t push it. Charlie was too worried about Harry. That was clearly the more important issue��it wouldn\u0027t be right to bug him with my lesser concerns. Instead, I went straight upstairs and turned on my computer. I found a medical site online and typed \"mononucleosis\" into the search box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I knew about mono was that you were supposed to get it from kissing, which was clearly not the case with Jake. I read through the symptoms quickly��the fever he definitely had, but what about the rest of it? No horrible sore throat, no exhaustion, no headaches, at least not before he\u0027d gone home from the movie; he\u0027d said he felt \"fit as a fiddle.\" Did it really come on so fast? The article made it sound like the sore stuff showed up first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at the computer screen and wondered why, exactly, I was doing this. Why did I feel so�� so suspicious, like I didn\u0027t believe Billy\u0027s story? Why would Billy lie to Harry?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was being silly, probably. I was just worried, and, to be honest, I was afraid of not being allowed to see Jacob��that made me nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI skimmed through the rest of the article, looking for more information. I stopped when I got to the part about how mono could last more than a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA month? My mouth fell open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Billy couldn\u0027t enforce the no-visitors thing that long. Of course not. Jake would go crazy stuck in bed that long without anyone to talk to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was Billy afraid of, anyway? The article said that a person with mono needed to avoid physical activity, but there was nothing about visitors. The disease wasn\u0027t very infectious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d give Billy a week, I decided, before I got pushy. A week was generous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week was long. By Wednesday, I was sure I wasn\u0027t going to live till Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027d decided to leave Billy and Jacob alone for a week, I hadn\u0027t really believed that Jacob would go along with Billy\u0027s rule. Every day when I got home from school, I ran to the phone to check for messages. There never were any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cheated three times by trying to call him, but the phone lines still weren\u0027t working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in the house much too much, and much too alone. Without Jacob, and my adrenaline and my distractions, everything I\u0027d been repressing started creeping up on me. The dreams got hard again. I could no longer see the end coming. Just the horrible nothingness��half the time in the forest, half the time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the empty fern sea where the white house no longer existed. Sometimes Sam Uley was there in the forest, watching me again. I paid him no attention��there was no comfort in his presence; it made me feel no less alone. It didn\u0027t stop me from screaming myself awake, night after night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hole in my chest was worse than ever. I\u0027d thought that I\u0027d been getting it under control, but I found myself hunched over, day after day, clutching my sides together and gasping for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t handling alone well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was relieved beyond measure the morning I woke up��screaming, of course��and remembered that it was Saturday. Today I could call Jacob. And if the phone lines still weren\u0027t working, then I was going to La Push. One way or another, today would be better than the last lonely week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dialed, and then waited without high expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt caught me off guard when Billy answered on the second ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hey, the phone is working again! Hi, Billy. It\u0027s Bella. I was just calling to see how Jacob is doing. Is he up for visitors yet? I was thinking about dropping by��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Bella,\" Billy interrupted, and I wondered if he were watching TV; he sounded distracted. \"He\u0027s not in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" It took me a second. \"So he\u0027s feeling better then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Billy hesitated for an instant too long. \"Turns out it wasn\u0027t mono after all. Just some other virus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. So�� where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s giving some friends a ride up to Port Angeles��I think they were going to catch a double feature or something. He\u0027s gone for the whole day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s a relief. I\u0027ve been so worried. I\u0027m glad he felt good enough to get out.\" My voice sounded horribly phony as I babbled on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob was better, but not well enough to call me. He was out with friends. I was sitting home, missing him more every hour. I was lonely, worried, bored�� perforated��and now also desolate as I realized that the week apart had not had the same effect on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything in particular you wanted?\" Billy asked politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll tell him that you called,\" Billy promised. \"Bye, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye,\" I replied, but he\u0027d already hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood for a moment with the phone still in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob must have changed his mind, just like I\u0027d feared. He was going to take my advice and not waste any more time on someone who couldn\u0027t return his feelings. I felt the blood run out of my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something wrong?\" Charlie asked as he came down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I lied, hanging up the phone. \"Billy says Jacob is feeling better. It wasn\u0027t mono. So that\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he coming here, or are you going there?\" Charlie asked absentmindedly as he started poking through the fridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither,\" I admitted. \"He\u0027s going out with some other friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tone of my voice finally caught Charlie\u0027s attention. He looked up at me with sudden alarm, his hands frozen around a package of cheese slices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it a little early for lunch?\" I asked as lightly as I could manage, trying to distract him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m just packing something to take out to the river��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, fishing today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Harry called�� and it\u0027s not raining.\" He was creating a stack of food on the counter as he spoke. Suddenly he looked up again as if he\u0027d just realized something. \"Say, did you want me to stay with you, since Jake\u0027s out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay, Dad,\" I said, working to sound indifferent. \"The fish bite better when the weather\u0027s nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me, indecision clear on his face. I knew that he was worrying, afraid to leave me alone, in case I got \"mopey\" again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously, Dad. I think I\u0027ll call Jessica,\" I fibbed quickly. I\u0027d rather be alone than have him watching me all day. \"We have a Calculus test to study for. I could use her help.\" That part was true. But I\u0027d have to make do without it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good idea. You\u0027ve been spending so much time with Jacob, your other friends are going to think you\u0027ve forgotten them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and nodded as if I cared what my other friends thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie started to turn, but then spun back with a worried expression. \"Hey, you\u0027ll study here or at Jess\u0027s, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, where else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s just that I want you to be careful to stay out of the woods, like I told you before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a minute to understand, distracted as I was. \"More bear trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie nodded, frowning. \"We\u0027ve got a missing hiker��the rangers found his camp early this morning, but no sign of him. There were some really big animal prints�� of course those could have come later, smelling the food�� Anyway, they\u0027re setting traps for it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I said vaguely. I wasn\u0027t really listening to his warnings; I was much more upset by the situation with Jacob than by the possibility of being eaten by a bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glad that Charlie was in a hurry. He didn\u0027t wait for me to call Jessica, so I didn\u0027t have to put on that charade. I went through the motions of gathering my school-books on the kitchen table to pack them in my bag; that was probably too much, and if he hadn\u0027t been eager to hit the holes, it might have made him suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so busy looking busy that the ferociously empty day ahead didn\u0027t really crash down on me until after I\u0027d watched him drive away. It only took about two minutes of staring at the silent kitchen phone to decide that I wasn\u0027t staying home today. I considered my options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t going to call Jessica. As far as I could tell, Jessica had crossed over to the dark side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could drive to La Push and get my motorcycle��an appealing thought but for one minor problem: who was going to drive me to the emergency room if I needed it afterward?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr�� I already had our map and compass in the truck. I was pretty sure I understood the process well enough by now that I wouldn\u0027t get lost. Maybe I could eliminate two lines today, putting us ahead of schedule for whenever Jacob decided to honor me with his presence again. I refused to think about how long that might be. Or if it was going to be never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a brief twinge of guilt as I realized how Charlie would feel about this, but I ignored it. I just couldn\u0027t stay in the house again today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later I was on the familiar dirt road that led to nowhere in particular. I had the windows rolled down and I drove as fast as was healthy for my truck, trying to enjoy the wind against my face. It was cloudy, but almost dry��a very nice day, for Forks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting started took me longer than it would have taken Jacob. After I parked in the usual spot, I had to spend a good fifteen minutes studying the little needle on the compass face and the markings on the now worn map. When I was reasonably certain that I was following the right line of the web, I set off into the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forest was full of life today, all the little creatures enjoying the momentary dryness. Somehow, though, even with the birds chirping and cawing, the insects buzzing noisily around my head, and the occasional scurry of the field mice through the shrubs, the forest seemed creepier today; it reminded me of my most recent nightmare. I knew it was just because I was alone, missing Jacob\u0027s carefree whistle and the sound of another pair of feet squishing across the damp ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sense of unease grew stronger the deeper I got into the trees. Breathing started to get more difficult��not because of exertion, but because I was having trouble with the stupid hole in my chest again. I kept my arms tight around my torso and tried to banish the ache from my thoughts. I almost turned around, but I hated to waste the effort I\u0027d already expended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rhythm of my footsteps started to numb my mind and my pain as I trudged on. My breathing evened out eventually, and I was glad I hadn\u0027t quit. I was getting better at this bushwhacking thing; I could tell I was faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t realize quite how much more efficiently I was moving. I thought I\u0027d covered maybe four miles, and I wasn\u0027t even starting to look around for it yet. And then, with an abruptness that disoriented me, I stepped through a low arch made by two vine maples��pushing past the chest-high ferns��into the meadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same place, of that I was instantly sure. I\u0027d never seen another clearing so symmetrical. It was as perfectly round as if someone had intentionally created the flawless circle, tearing out the trees but leaving no evidence of that violence in the waving grass. To the east, I could hear the stream bubbling quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place wasn\u0027t nearly so stunning without the sunlight, but it was still very beautiful and serene. It was the wrong season for wildflowers; the ground was thick with tall grass that swayed in the light breeze like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eripples across a lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same place�� but it didn\u0027t hold what I had been searching for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disappointment was nearly as instantaneous as the recognition. I sank down right where I was, kneeling there at the edge of the clearing, beginning to gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the point of going any farther? Nothing lingered here. Nothing more than the memories that I could have called back whenever I wanted to, if I was ever willing to endure the corresponding pain��the pain that had me now, had me cold. There was nothing special about this place without him. I wasn\u0027t exactly sure what I\u0027d hoped to feel here, but the meadow was empty of atmosphere, empty of everything, just like everywhere else. Just like my nightmares. My head swirled dizzily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least I\u0027d come alone. I felt a rush of thankfulness as I realized that. If I\u0027d discovered the meadow with Jacob�� well, there was no way I could have disguised the abyss I was plunging into now. How could I have explained the way I was fracturing into pieces, the way I had to curl into a ball to keep the empty hole from tearing me apart? It was so much better that I didn\u0027t have an audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I wouldn\u0027t have to explain to anyone why I was in such a hurry to leave, either. Jacob would have assumed, after going to so much trouble to locate the stupid place, I would want to spend more than a few seconds here. But I was already trying to find the strength to get to my feet again, forcing myself out of the ball so that I could escape. There was too much pain in this empty place to bear��I would crawl away if I had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow lucky that I was alone!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone. I repeated the word with grim satisfaction as I wrenched myself to my feet despite the pain. At precisely that moment, a figure stepped out from the trees to the north, some thirty paces away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dizzying array of emotions shot through me in a second. The first was surprise; I was far from any trail here, and I didn\u0027t expect company. Then, as my eyes focused on the motionless figure, seeing the utter stillness, the pallid skin, a rush of piercing hope rocked through me. I suppressed it viciously, fighting against the equally sharp lash of agony as my eyes continued to the face beneath the black hair, the face that wasn\u0027t the one I wanted to see. Next was fear; this was not the face I grieved for, but it was close enough for me to know that the man facing me was no stray hiker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, in the end, recognition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laurent!\" I cried in surprised pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an irrational response. I probably should have stopped at fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent had been one of James\u0027s coven when we\u0027d first met. He hadn\u0027t been involved with the hunt that followed��the hunt where I was the quarry��but that was only because he was afraid; I was protected by a bigger coven than his own. It would have been different if that wasn\u0027t the case��he\u0027d had no compunctions, at the time, against making a meal of me. Of course, he must have changed, because he\u0027d gone to Alaska to live with the other civilized coven there, the other family that refused to drink human blood for ethical reasons. The other family like�� but I couldn\u0027t let myself think the name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, fear would have made more sense, but all I felt was an overwhelming satisfaction. The meadow was a magic place again. A darker magic than I\u0027d expected, to be sure, but magic all the same. Here was the connection I\u0027d sought. The proof, however remote, that��somewhere in the same world where I lived�� he did exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was impossible how exactly the same Laurent looked. I suppose it was very silly and human to expect some kind of change in the last year. But there was something�� I couldn\u0027t quite put my finger on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\" he asked, looking more astonished than I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember.\" I smiled. It was ridiculous that I should be so elated because a vampire knew my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"I didn\u0027t expect to see you here.\" He strolled toward me, his expression bemused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it the other way around? I do live here. I thought you\u0027d gone to Alaska.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped about ten paces away, cocking his head to the side. His face was the most beautiful face I\u0027d seen in what felt like an eternity. I studied his features with a strangely greedy sense of release. Here was someone I didn\u0027t have to pretend for��someone who already knew everything I could never say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" he agreed. \"I did go to Alaska. Still, I didn\u0027t expect�� When I found the Cullen place empty, I thought they\u0027d moved on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I bit my lip as the name set the raw edges of my wound throbbing. It took me a second to compose myself. Laurent waited with curious eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did move on,\" I finally managed to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" he murmured. \"I\u0027m surprised they left you behind. Weren\u0027t you sort of a pet of theirs?\" His eyes were innocent of any intended offense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled wryly. \"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" he said, thoughtful again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that precise moment, I realized why he looked the same��too much the same. After Carlisle told us that Laurent had stayed with Tanya\u0027s family, I\u0027d begun to picture him, on the rare occasions that I thought of him at all, with the same golden eyes that the�� Cullens��I forced the name out, wincing��had. That all good vampires had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took an involuntary step back, and his curious, dark red eyes followed the movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they visit often?\" he asked, still casual, but his weight shifted toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lie,\" the beautiful velvet voice whispered anxiously from my memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started at the sound of his voice, but it should not have surprised me. Was I nor in the worst danger imaginable? The motorcycle was safe as kittens next to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did what the voice said to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now and again.\" I tried to make my voice light, relaxed. \"The time seems longer to me, I imagine. You know how they get distracted��\" I was beginning to babble. I had to work to shut myself up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" he said again. \"The house smelled like it had been vacant for a while��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must lie better than that, Bella,\" the voice urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried. \"I\u0027ll have to mention to Carlisle that you stopped by. He\u0027ll be sorry they missed your visit.\" I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epretended to deliberate for a second. \"But I probably shouldn\u0027t mention it to�� Edward, I suppose��\" I barely managed to say his name, and it twisted my expression on the way out, ruining my bluff \"��he has such a temper�� well, I\u0027m sure you remember. He\u0027s still touchy about the whole James thing.\" I rolled my eyes and waved one hand dismissively, like it was all ancient history, but there was an edge of hysteria to my voice. I wondered if he would recognize what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he really?\" Laurent asked pleasantly�� skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my reply short, so that my voice wouldn\u0027t betray my panic. \"Mm-hmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent took a casual step to the side, gazing around at the little meadow. I didn\u0027t miss that the step brought him closer to me. In my head, the voice responded with a low snarl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how are things working out in Denali? Carlisle said you were staying with Tanya?\" My voice was too high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question made him pause. \"I like Tanya very much,\" he mused. \"And her sister Irina even more�� I\u0027ve never stayed in one place for so long before, and I enjoy the advantages, the novelty of it. But, the restrictions are difficult�� I\u0027m surprised that any of them can keep it up for long.\" He smiled at me conspiratorially. \"Sometimes I cheat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t swallow. My foot started to ease back, but I froze when his red eyes flickered down to catch the movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I said in a faint voice. \"Jasper has problems with that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t move,\" the voice whispered. I tried to do what he instructed. It was hard; the instinct to take flight was nearly uncontrollable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Laurent seemed interested. \"Is that why they left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I answered honestly. \"Jasper is more careful at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Laurent agreed. \"I am, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe step forward he took now was quite deliberate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Victoria ever find you?\" I asked, breathless, desperate to distract him. It was the first question that popped into my head, and I regretted it as soon as the words were spoken. Victoria��who had hunted me with James, and then disappeared��was not someone I wanted to think of at this particular moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the question did stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said, hesitating on that step. \"I actually came here as a favor to her.\" He made a face. \"She won\u0027t be happy about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\" I said eagerly, inviting him to continue. He was glaring into the trees, away from me. I took advantage of his diversion, taking a furtive step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back at me and smiled��the expression made him look like a black-haired angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About me killing you,\" he answered in a seductive purr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI staggered back another step. The frantic growling in my head made it hard to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wanted to save that part for herself,\" he went on blithely. \"She\u0027s sort of�� put out with you, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" I squeaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head and chuckled. \"I know, it seems a little backward to me, too. But James was her mate, and your Edward killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven here, on the point of death, his name tore against my unhealed wounds like a serrated edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent was oblivious to my reaction. \"She thought it more appropriate to kill you than Edward��fair turnabout, mate for mate. She asked me to get the lay of the land for her, so to speak. I didn\u0027t imagine you would be so easy to get to. So maybe her plan was flawed��apparently it wouldn\u0027t be the revenge she imagined, since you must not mean very much to him if he left you here unprotected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother blow, another tear through my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent\u0027s weight shifted slightly, and I stumbled another step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"I suppose she\u0027ll be angry, all the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why not wait for her?\" I choked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mischievous grin rearranged his features. \"Well, you\u0027ve caught me at a bad time, Bella. I didn\u0027t come to this place on Victoria\u0027s mission��I was hunting. I\u0027m quite thirsty, and you do smell�� simply mouthwatering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent looked at me with approval, as if he meant it as a compliment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Threaten him,\" the beautiful delusion ordered, his voice distorted with dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll know it was you,\" I whispered obediently. \"You won\u0027t get away with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why not?\" Laurent\u0027s smile widened. He gazed around the small opening in the trees. \"The scent will wash away with the next rain. No one will find your body��you\u0027ll simply go missing, like so many, many other humans. There\u0027s no reason for Edward to think of me, if he cares enough to investigate. This is nothing personal, let me assure you, Bella. Just thirst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beg,\" my hallucination begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent shook his head, his face kind. \"Look at it this way, Bella. You\u0027re very lucky I was the one to find you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I?\" I mouthed, faltering another step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent followed, lithe and graceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he assured me. \"I\u0027ll be very quick. You won\u0027t feel a thing, I promise. Oh, I\u0027ll lie to Victoria about that later, naturally, just to placate her. But if you knew what she had planned for you, Bella��\" He shook his head with a slow movement, almost as if in disgust. \"I swear you\u0027d be thanking me for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sniffed at the breeze that blew threads of my hair in his direction. \"Mouthwatering,\" he repeated,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tensed for the spring, my eyes squinting as I cringed away, and the sound of Edward\u0027s furious roar echoed distantly in the back of my head. His name burst through all the walls I\u0027d built to contain it. Edward, Edward, Edward. I was going to die. It shouldn\u0027t matter if I thought of him now. Edward, I love you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough my narrowed eyes, I watched as Laurent paused in the act of inhaling and whipped his head abruptly to the left. I was afraid to look away from him, to follow his glance, though he hardly needed a distraction or any other trick to overpower me. I was too amazed to feel relief when he started slowly backing away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it,\" he said, his voice so low that I barely heard it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to look then. My eyes scanned the meadow, searching for the interruption that had extended my life by a few seconds. At first I saw nothing, and my gaze flickered back to Laurent. He was retreating more quickly now, his eyes boring into the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I saw it; a huge black shape eased out of the trees, quiet as a shadow, and stalked deliberately toward the vampire. It was enormous��as tall as a horse, but thicker, much more muscular. The long muzzle grimaced, revealing a line of dagger-like incisors. A grisly snarl rolled out from between the teeth, rumbling across the clearing like a prolonged crack of thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bear. Only, it wasn\u0027t a bear at all. Still, this gigantic black monster had to be the creature causing all the alarm. From a distance, anyone would assume it was a bear. What else could be so vast, so powerfully built?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished I were lucky enough to see it from a distance. Instead, it padded silently through the grass a mere ten feet from where I stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t move an inch,\" Edward\u0027s voice whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the monstrous creature, my mind boggling as I tried to put a name to it. There was a distinctly canine cast to the shape of it, the way it moved. I could only think of one possibility, locked in horror as I was. Yet I\u0027d never imagined that a wolf could get so big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother growl rumbled in its throat, and I shuddered away from the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent was backing toward the edge of the trees, and, under the freezing terror, confusion swept through me. Why was Laurent retreating? Granted, the wolf was monstrous in size, but it was just an animal. What reason would a vampire have for fearing an animal? And Laurent was afraid. His eyes were wide with horror, just like mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if in answer to my question, suddenly the mammoth wolf was not alone. Flanking it on either side, another two gigantic beasts prowled silently into the meadow. One was a deep gray, the other brown, neither one quite as tall as the first. The gray wolf came through the trees only a few feet from me, its eyes locked on Laurent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could even react, two more wolves followed, lined up in a V, like geese flying south. Which meant that the rusty brown monster that shrugged through the brush last was close enough for me to touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave an involuntary gasp and jumped back��which was the stupidest thing I could have done. I froze again, waiting for the wolves to turn on me, the much weaker of the available prey. I wished briefly that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent would get on with it and crush the wolf pack��it should be so simple for him. I guessed that, between the two choices before me, being eaten by wolves was almost certainly the worse option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf closest to me, the reddish brown one, turned its head slightly at the sound of my gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf\u0027s eyes were dark, nearly black. It gazed at me for a fraction of a second, the deep eyes seeming too intelligent for a wild animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it stared at me, I suddenly thought of Jacob��again, with gratitude. At least I\u0027d come here alone, to this fairytale meadow filled with dark monsters. At least Jacob wasn\u0027t going to die, too. At least I wouldn\u0027t have his death on my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen another low growl from the leader caused the russet wolf to whip his head around, back toward Laurent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent was staring at the pack of monster wolves with unconcealed shock and fear. The first I could understand. But I was stunned when, without warning, he spun and disappeared into the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolves were after him in a second, sprinting across the open grass with a few powerful bounds, snarling and snapping so loudly that my hands flew up instinctively to cover my ears. The sound faded with surprising swiftness once they disappeared into the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I was alone again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy knees buckled under me, and I fell onto my hands, sobs building in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I needed to leave, and leave now. How long would the wolves chase Laurent before they doubled back for me? Or would Laurent turn on them? Would he be the one that came looking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t move at first, though; my arms and legs were shaking, and I didn\u0027t know how to get back to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind couldn\u0027t move past the fear, the horror or the confusion. I didn\u0027t understand what I\u0027d just witnessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vampire should not have run from overgrown dogs like that. What good would their teeth be against his granite skin?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the wolves should have given Laurent a wide berth. Even if their extraordinary size had taught them to fear nothing, it still made no sense that they would pursue him. I doubted his icy marble skin would smell anything like food. Why would they pass up something warmblooded and weak like me to chase after Laurent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t make it add up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold breeze whipped through the meadow, swaying the grass like something was moving through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrambled to my feet, backing away even though the wind brushed harmlessly past me. Stumbling in panic, I turned and ran headlong into the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next few hours were agony. It took me three times as long to escape the trees as it had to get to the meadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I paid no attention to where I was headed, focused only on what I was running from By the time I collected myself enough to remember the compass, I was deep in the unfamiliar and menacing forest. My hands were shaking so violently that I had to set the compass on the muddy ground to be able to read it. Every few minutes I would stop to put the compass dowr and check that I was still heading northwest, hearing��when the sounds weren\u0027t hidden behind the frantic squelching of my footsteps��the quiet whisper of unseen things moving in the leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call of a jaybird made me leap back and fall into a thick stand of young spruce, scraping up my arms and tangling my hair with sap. The sudden rush of a squirrel up a hemlock made me scream so loud it hurt my own ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last there was a break in the trees ahead. I came out onto the empty road a mile or so south of where I\u0027d left the truck. Exhausted as I was, I jogged up the lane until I found it. By the time I pulled myself into the cab, I was sobbing again. I fiercely shoved down both stiff locks before I dug my keys out of my pocket. The roar of the engine was comforting and sane. It helped me control the tears as I sped as fast as my truck would allow toward the main highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was calmer, but still a mess when I got home. Charlie\u0027s cruiser was in the driveway��I hadn\u0027t realized how late it was. The sky was already dusky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\" Charlie asked when I slammed the front door behind me and hastily turned the locks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s me.\" My voice was unsteady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been?\" he thundered, appearing through the kitchen doorway with an ominous expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. He\u0027d probably called the Stanleys. I\u0027d better stick to the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hiking,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were tight. \"What happened to going to Jessica\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t feel like Calculus today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie folded his arms across his chest. \"I thought I asked you to stay out of the forest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know. Don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t do it again.\" I shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie seemed to really look at me for the first time. I remembered that I had spent some time on the forest floor today; I must be a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Charlie demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I decided that the truth, or part of it anyway, was the best option. I was too shaken to pretend that I\u0027d spent an uneventful day with the flora and fauna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the bear.\" I tried to say it calmly, but my voice was high and shaky. \"It\u0027s not a bear, though��it\u0027s some kind of wolf. And there are five of them. A big black one, and gray, and reddish-brown��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s eyes grew round with horror. He strode quickly to me and grabbed the tops of my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head bobbed in a weak nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn\u0027t pay any attention to me. But aftet they were gone, I ran away and I fell down a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of my shoulders and wrapped his arms around me. For a long moment, he didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolves,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rangers said the tracks were wrong for a bear��but wolves just don\u0027t get that big��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These were huge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many did you say you saw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie shook his head, frowning with anxiety, He finally spoke in a tone that allowed no argument. \"No morehiking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" I promised fervently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie called the station to report what I\u0027d seen. I fudged a little bit about where exactly I\u0027d seen the wolves��claiming I\u0027d been on the trail that led to the north. I didn\u0027t want my dad to know how deep I\u0027d gone into the forest against his wishes, and, more importantly, I didn\u0027t want anyone wandering near where Laurent might be searching for me. The thought of it made me feel sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hungry?\" he asked me when he hung up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, though I must have been starving. I hadn\u0027t eaten all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tired,\" I told him. I turned for the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Charlie said, his voice suddenly suspicious again. \"Didn\u0027t you say Jacob was gone for the day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what Billy said,\" I told him, confused by his question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied my expression for a minute, and seemed satisfied with what he saw there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I demanded. It sounded like he was implying that I\u0027d been lying to him this morning. About something besides studying with Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s just that when I went to pick up Harry, I saw Jacob out in front of the store down there with some of his friends. I waved hi, but he�� well, I guess I don\u0027t know if he saw me. I think maybe he was arguing with his friends. He looked strange, like he was upset about something. And�� different. It\u0027s like you can watch that kid growing! He gets bigger every time I see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy said Jake and his friends were going up to Port Angeles to see some movies. They were probably just waiting for someone to meet them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Charlie nodded and headed for the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood in the hall, thinking about Jacob arguing with his friends. I wondered if he had confronted Embry\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout the situation with Sam. Maybe that was the reason he\u0027d ditched me today��if it meant he could sort things out with Embry, I was glad he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused to check the locks again before I went to my room. It was a silly thing to do. What difference would a lock make to any of the monsters I\u0027d seen this afternoon? I assumed the handle alone would stymie the wolves, not having opposable thumbs. And if Laurent came here��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr�� Victoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay down on my bed, but I was shaking too hard to hope for sleep. I curled into a cramped ball under my quilt, and faced the horrifying facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing I could do. There were no precautions I could take. There was no place I could hide. There was no one who could help me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized, with a nauseous roll of my stomach, that the situation was worse than even that. Because all those facts applied to Charlie, too. My father, sleeping one room away from me, was just a hairsbreadth off the heart of the target that was centered on me. My scent would lead them here, whether I was here or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tremors rocked me until my teeth chattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo calm myself, I fantasized the impossible: I imagined the big wolves catching up to Laurent in the woods and massacring the indestructible immortal the way they would any normal person. Despite the absurdity of such a vision, the idea comforted me. If the wolves got him, then he couldn\u0027t tell Victoria I was here all alone. If he didn\u0027t return, maybe she\u0027d think the Cullens were still protecting me. If only the wolves could win such a fight��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy good vampires were never coming back; how soothing it was to imagine that the other kind could also disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed my eyes tight together and waited for unconsciousness��almost eager for my nightmare to start. Better that than the pale, beautiful face that smiled at me now from behind my lids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my imagination, Victoria\u0027s eyes were black with thirst, bright with anticipation, and her lips curled back from her gleaming teeth in pleasure. Her red hair was brilliant as fire; it blew chaotically around her wild face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent\u0027s words repeated in my head. If you knew what she had planned for you ��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my fist against my mouth to keep from screaming. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-2-new-moon-twilight-2/page-11.html","bookId":2024,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM"}
