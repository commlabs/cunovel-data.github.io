But Aranict, what happened there saved Tavore’s life, and quite possibly the lives of the rest of the Bonehunters. The Nah’ruk reeled from that place.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yet still I fear it,’ she insisted, plucking out another rustleaf stick. ‘Allies should show themselves.’ She drew out the small silver box containing the resin sparker. The night wind defeated her efforts to scrape a flame to life, so she stepped close against Brys and tried again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Allies,’ he said, ‘have their own enemies. Showing themselves imposes a risk, I imagine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flicker of flame and then the stick was alight. She took a half-step back. ‘I think that’s a valid observation. Well, I suppose we always suspected that the Adjunct’s war wasn’t a private one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No matter how she might wish it so,’ he said, with something like grudging respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tomorrow’s parley could prove most frustrating,’ Aranict observed, ‘if she refuses to relent. We need to know what she knows. We need to understand what she seeks. More than all that, we need to make sense of what happened the day of the Nah’ruk.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached up, surprised her by brushing her cheek, and then leaning closer and kissing her. She laughed deep in her throat. ‘Danger is a most alluring drug, isn’t it, Brys?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes,’ he whispered, but then stepped back. ‘I will walk the perimeter now, Atri-Ceda, to witness the dawn with my soldiers. Will you be rested enough for the parley?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘More or less.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good. Until later, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him walk away. Errant take me, he just climbed back out .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When it’s stretched it stays stretched,’ Hanavat said in a grumble. ‘What’s the point?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelemasa continued rubbing the oil into the woman’s distended belly. ‘The point is, it feels good.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, I’ll grant you that, though I imagine it’s as much the attention as anything else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Exactly what men never understand,’ the younger woman said, finally settling back and rubbing her hands together. ‘We have iron in our souls. How could we not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanavat glanced away, eyes tightening. ‘My last child,’ she said. ‘My only child.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo that Shelemasa was silent. The charge against the Nah’ruk had taken all of Hanavat’s children. All of them. But if that was cruel, it is nothing compared to sparing Gall. Where the mother bows, the father breaks. They are gone. He led them all to their deaths, yet he survived. Spirits, yours is the gift of madness .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe charge haunted Shelemasa as well. She had ridden through the lancing barrage of lightning, figures on either side erupting, bodies exploding, spraying her with sizzling gore. The screams of horses, the thunder of tumbling beasts, bones snapping – even now, that dread cauldron awakened again in her mind, a torrent of sounds pounding her ears from the inside out. She knelt in Hanavat’s tent, trembling with the memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older woman must have sensed something, for she reached out and settled a weathered hand on her thigh. ‘It goes,’ she murmured. ‘I see it among all you survivors. The wave of remembrance, the horror in your eyes. But I tell you, it goes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For Gall, too?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand seemed to flinch. ‘No. He is Warleader. It does not leave him. That charge is not in the past. He lives it again and again, every moment, day and night. I have lost him, Shelemasa. We have all lost him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight hundred and eighty warriors remained. She had stood among them, had wandered with them the wreckage of the retreat, and she had seen what she had seen. Never again will we fight, not with the glory and joy of old. Our military effectiveness, as the Malazan scribes would say, has come to an end . The Khundryl Burned Tears had been destroyed. Not a failure of courage. Something far worse. We were made, in an instant, obsolete . Nothing could break the spirit as utterly as that realization had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new Warleader was needed, but she suspected no acclamation was forthcoming. The will was dead. There were no pieces left to pick up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will attend the parley,’ said Hanavat, ‘and I want you with me, Shelemasa.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your husband—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is lying in his eldest son’s tent. He takes no food, no water. He intends to waste away. Before long, we will burn his body on a pyre, but that will be nothing but a formality. My mourning has already begun.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know …’ Shelemasa hesitated, ‘it was difficult between you. The rumours of his leanings—’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-44.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
