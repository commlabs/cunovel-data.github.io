The hollow needle in the crook of her elbow was an icy tick. Her already blurry vision dotted with smudges of grey fog. She could not feel her toes. Her fingers tingled. Her blood surged through rubber tubing, filled the valves of the pulsing pump, and disappeared into another tube, flowing into the patient\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVampire donors were prized at the military hospital in Amiens. The restorative power of their blood was remarkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrowsmith, a warm American whose face was prematurely scored with worry-lines, stroked her hair. He did not show he felt the chill in her but could not have failed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We have taken enough from you,\u0027 he said, ceasing to coax the pump. \u0027We must be wary of going back too often to the well.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate tried to tell him to go on. She wasn\u0027t even unconscious. Her body could regenerate its blood within an hour, especially if she fed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other cot, the patient - an American captain, Jake Barnes -was mummified in bandages. The only inch of his skin exposed was stuck with the transfusion needle. Barnes was a new-born, his power of regeneration not yet developed enough to heal the wounds he had sustained. Hung on the wire during a bombardment, he had been pelted with a hailstorm of bullets, lead and silver. There was little left of him to save.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer bloodstream connected with Barnes\u0027s, troubling her with flashes of his life. In her guts, she felt the stinging bites of silver bullets through a long night. It was hours before Barnes\u0027s comrades crept out to take him down. Despair had twisted his mind. She felt it like a poison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrowsmith carefully took the needle out of her arm and pressed the open vein with his thumb. Her tiny wound healed over in an instant. The doctor examined the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not a mark. A little miracle.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrowsmith had little experience with vampires. There were relatively few American undead. Barnes had been warm on the ship over, but turned in Paris. He thought the vampire state would better his chances of surviving the war. With distaste, Kate pictured the mindless can-can nymph who had turned him. Barnes might not be satisfied with the shape of his survival. His jaw was shattered, silver shrapnel embedded, spreading gangrene. He\u0027d not be capable of feeding himself in the near future. He\u0027d be dependent on medical transfusions. He was, in many senses, no longer a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor saw to his patient. Barnes could not talk, of course. His eyes shone angry and pained through slits in his crisp white mask. From their communion, Kate knew Barnes yearned to be allowed true death. Should she pass on his wishes to the doctors striving to keep him alive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to sit. Her head, a hundredweight of lead, dragged her to the pillow. She was weaker than she had thought. On the too-short canvas cot, feet stuck out beyond the sheet, she tried to summon her strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrowsmith was concerned. \u0027Be careful, Miss Reed. You\u0027re not right, yet. Don\u0027t try to talk. Rest. You\u0027ve done enough today. Because of you this man will live.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth opened and closed, but she had no words. Essentially, that was her problem. The war left her without words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she should not allow herself to feel so, but something had broken off with Edwin Winthrop\u0027s death. They had not been close but they might have been. It was not the truncation of a past that bothered her but the curtailment of a future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustrated and exhausted, she had turned her body over to the Red Cross. As a bloodmilk cow, she was useful without having to take action, without having to think, without having to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the war began, the first fought with significant numbers of vampires on both sides, it was assumed the undead would make unvanquishable, all-conquering soldiers. In magazine serials, nosferatu hordes swept across Europe, establishing tyrannies of centuried elders. As armies mobilised and diplomats manoeuvred in the summer of 914, Saki\u0027s When Vlad Came, with its imaginary reoccupation of Britain by Dracula\u0027s vampire knights, was popular in railway station bookstalls. Hector Munro, \u0027Saki\u0027, was truly dead now, a Royal Fusilier shot by a German sniper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the high ceiling. It was a grubby white, lightly spattered with blood no one could reach to scrub away. Fizzing electric lights hung from brass chandeliers, wires wound round wax-crusted candle-sconces. Before the war, the hospital had been a government building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the European stalemate, as the war of mobility turned to a face-off between entrenched positions, vampires did not prove all-conquering or invincible. But they survived injuries fatal to a warm soldier. It was an unappreciated curse of the undead. For a vampire, there were few \u0027Blighty\u0027 wounds, not mortal but dire enough to earn honourable discharge and a passage home. Aside from the odd Jake Barnes, a vampire who survived his wounds was liable to recover and be returned to active service. A good many preferred to stay warm and take their chances. The war was a plague of fire and silver. Its scythe swept away hundreds of thousands of new-borns along with their warm cousins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a hundred years, with Kate\u0027s blood in him, Jake Barnes might be ready to fight again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer bath chair was wheeled into the conservatory. Moonlight flooded down upon the row of convalescents. The illumination was a proven restorative for sorely wounded vampires. Kate did not feel it herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was willing to give more blood but Arrowsmith ruled it out. She did not want to be left to herself, to think. She wanted to be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to the swaddled mummy of Barnes sat Lieutenant Chatterley, who had received Kate\u0027s blood yestereve. Another rare Blighty case, his lower body had been blown to pieces. Though new bone-shoots sprouted from the stumps of his legs, they were dead. His body would become whole but he would not have the use of it. He contemplated his lack of reflection in the moonlit glass of the conservatory windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Clifford, good evening,\u0027 she said to the Englishman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked queerly at her. \u0027Do I know you? Were you one of the nurses?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tic pulled at Chatterley\u0027s mouth. \u0027You\u0027re her. The elder?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027An elder? Hardly. If I\u0027d lived, I wouldn\u0027t even be dead yet. Probably.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChatterley would not thank her for his life and his dead legs. Like Barnes, he had a bitterness in his blood. He turned away, face to the moon. She had a touch of him also in her mind. From Barnes, she had only recent impressions, of Paris and his turning. From Chatterley, she had vivid pictures; a colliery wheel rising over a stretch of forest, a country house and grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate was too tired even to feel any rejection. She could give nothing anyone wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pretty warm nurse fussed around Chatterley and Barnes. Neither showed interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ve found you a cat, miss,\u0027 the nurse said to Kate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate was too exhausted to fake a smile of gratitude. A cat would ease but not slake her red thirst. There would be little pain in a cat\u0027s life. She would drink without tasting agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thank you.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re welcome, miss.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse did a tiny but perfect curtsey. She must have been a maid before the war. Kate noticed healed bites on her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen warm, Kate had once been fed upon, by Mr Frank Harris, and she had died of it. Her memories were of turning, not of being food and drink for another. Now, she imagined she felt as the nurse must feel after letting her vampire lovers bleed her. She was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Someone to see you, miss ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate had been in sleepless reverie. In the fogs of the \u002780s, dodging Carpathian Guards, scattering leaflets ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stirred like a very old lady, bones creaking, limbs stiff. She could not turn in her chair, but she saw a shadowy reflection in the moonlit windows. A man in uniform stood with the nurse, leaning on a crutch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse wheeled her bath chair round. The visitor stepped into pale light. Kate felt a silver spasm in her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Miss Mouse,\u0027 Edwin said, \u0027you look like you\u0027ve seen a ghost.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-28.html","bookId":1619,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:29 PM"}
