I do know I can\u0027t talk Caitlin out of her plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s convinced it will work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then there\u0027s not much we can do except stand by in case Kincaid gets nasty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evening wore on toward midnight. In the dense crowd, it was relatively simple for Jonas and Verity to avoid Kincaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimple, that was, until Kincaid sought them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, there you are, Miss Ames. Quarrel. I understood you two had been invited tonight,\" Kincaid said smoothly as he walked up to them with the easy attitude of an old acquaintance. He helped himself to a couple of canapes from the buffet table. \"An interesting affair, isn\u0027t it? Falls a little short of the real thing in places, however. This food, for instance, is certainly very twentieth century.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not particularly,\" Verity countered crisply. \"A lot of the items on this buffet would have looked right at home on a Renaissance table. The egg-based dishes, the meats, and the pastas would have appeared familiar to someone from that era. A lot of modern cooking dates from the Renaissance. Of course, there aren\u0027t any pies with live birds inside, and I don\u0027t see any salted pork tongues or boiled calves\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeet, but I expect the caterer had to make a few concessions to modern tastes. You\u0027re the expert, Jonas. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas had heard the underlying hostility in her voice as she defended the buffet selections and he winced. Acting was apparently not one of his love\u0027s talents. Now that Verity had decided Kincaid was the bad guy, she was going to have a tough time hiding her dislike of him. He tried to gloss over the implicit rudeness, not wanting to alert Kincaid any more than he already was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re right. The buffet table could have passed muster four hundred years ago. The caterer had an advantage tonight, however. He didn\u0027t have to worry about kitchen security.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Security?\" Kincaid cocked a handsome brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the Renaissance, food for an important gathering had to be prepared under tight security,\" Jonas explained patiently. \"Everyone worried about getting poisoned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, that\u0027s right.\" Kincaid chuckled and helped himself to another canape. \"Life back then must have been a constant adventure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s an understatement. Did you ever get around to having the dagger authenticated?\" Jonas asked conversationally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKincaid sipped his wine. \"I did. And you were quite right. I hate to say it, but it appears I was taken. Not something I like to admit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll just bet you don\u0027t, Jonas thought. \"Did you speak to whoever handled the deal for you? Or contact the original owner?\" He didn\u0027t know what made him ask that last question. He simply couldn\u0027t resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the attentive gleam in Verity\u0027s eyes and knew she, too, was remembering the man who had died in a bowl of linguini.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no third party involved in the deal,\" Kincaid said casually. \"Perhaps if I had been willing to pay a commission to someone qualified to authenticate the dagger, I wouldn\u0027t have found myself in the embarrassing position I was in when you spotted it for a fake in my office. As for the original owner, I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s no going back to him for restitution. He\u0027s unavailable. The man had the bad manners to die a few years back. Shot, I believe, by a thief who got into his home one evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How awful,\" Verity said with more depth of feeling than Jonas would have liked under the circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he a friend of yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merely a business acquaintance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did the police ever catch the murderer?\" Verity persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea. I didn\u0027t follow the story.\" Kincaid dismissed the subject as he glanced around the throng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the mysterious, reclusive artist finally greets her public. I must admit she\u0027s doing it in grand style. Miss Evanger is a striking woman. Pity about the scar and that leg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was in an accident,\" Verity muttered defensively. \"She\u0027s lucky to be alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that right?\" Kincaid studied Caitlin from across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas gave serious consideration to throttling his lady. He contented himself with putting his arm around her waist and squeezing. Hard. She flinched and slanted him a reproachful glance. Silently he shook his head and she finally got the message. He saw the chagrin in her eyes as she realized she was getting too mouthy in front of Caitlin\u0027s enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity\u0027s problem, Jonas decided objectively, was that she tended to be too mouthy most of the time and the tendency got worse when her temper was aroused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be back here tomorrow along with the other bidders?\" Jonas asked smoothly, hoping to distract Kincaid from his intense study of Caitlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I can\u0027t say I appreciate the delay or all this nonsense Evanger is insisting upon, but I guess we must humor the eccentric artist. A relatively small price to pay for a chance at Evanger\u0027s final work,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKincaid replied absently. \"What about you and Miss Ames?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be at the auction, but we won\u0027t be bidding. We\u0027re here as Caitlin\u0027s guests,\" Verity volunteered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again Jonas let his grip tighten unmercifully around her waist. Jonas didn\u0027t want Kincaid to have any more information than he already possessed. The whole damn situation was already too dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. Miss Evanger must value your company,\" Kincaid said blandly. \"Have you known her long?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood she had few acquaintances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve known her awhile,\" Jonas replied stonily, wishing Kincaid would leave before he pried any more information out of Verity. In the next moment, he got his wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s someone I should speak to across the room. A fellow collector. I\u0027m surprised he\u0027s here tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe usually avoids this kind of gathering. If you\u0027ll both excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Verity said primly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKincaid\u0027s eyes went to her bare shoulders and the white skin above the blue bodice. \"I hope you will honor me with a dance later, Miss Ames. Unless, of course, Quarrel objects?\" He smiled blandly at Jonas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He does,\" Jonas said easily. \"I keep close tabs on Verity. I\u0027m sure you understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For heaven\u0027s sake, Jonas,\" Verity exclaimed in exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKincaid chuckled and moved off into the crowd. Verity rounded on Jonas. \"Let\u0027s get something clear, Jonas. I don\u0027t particularly want to dance with that bastard, but I\u0027m perfectly capable of making the decision and acting on it myself. I don\u0027t want you thinking you can pick and choose my dance partners for me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-83.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
