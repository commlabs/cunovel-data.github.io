Your favorite!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice lifted higher and higher. After Teenage Murder Suspect Breaks Into Home, Dutiful Wife Tries to Lighten Mood with Talk of Dessert, Emma thought with a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“May I be excused?” Laurel asked, even though a whole waffle remained on her plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” Mrs. Mercer said distractedly, her eyes still on her husband’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma jumped up, too. “I have German homework,” she said. “Might as well get an early start on it.” This was something Sutton clearly wouldn’t say, but she was eager for the escape. She carried her dish to the sink and kept her head pointedly down as Laurel brushed past. Laurel muttered something under her breath. Emma was almost positive it was bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she passed by the table again, on her way toward the hall, she felt Mr. Mercer’s eyes on her. He was giving her such a suspicious stare that a sharp pain shot through Emma’s stomach. Suddenly, her mind flashed back to the look Mr. Mercer and Thayer had exchanged the previous night. Was it just her imagination, or did something big happen between them? Did they have some sort of … history together? Did Mr. Mercer know something about Thayer—something potentially dangerous—that he wasn’t letting on about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to agree—my dad definitely knew something about Thayer. As I followed Emma up the stairs, I caught a glimpse of the mountains outside the window, and two puzzle pieces connected for a brief moment in my mind. I saw spidery branches casting shadows across the packed earth while sticky, late summer air clung to my bare legs. I saw Thayer keeping pace at my side, sliding his arm through mine as we navigated a rocky path in the twilight. I saw him opening his mouth to speak, but the memory scattered before I could hear what he’d been about to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe, just maybe, it had been something I hadn’t wanted to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEVERYONE LOVES A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePOET\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that evening, Emma made her way to the local park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though it was dusk, there were still lots of people jogging on the dirt paths that wound up toward the mountains, cooking burgers on the public grills, and roughhousing with their dogs on the grass. A radio was playing a Bruno Mars song, and a bunch of kids were splashing each other with water from a fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust seeing that park made me ache. It was only a few blocks away from my house, and even though I couldn’t remember specifics, I knew I’d spent lots of time here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I wouldn’t give to dip my fingers into the cool water of that fountain or bite into a juicy burger hot off the gril —even if it did go straight to my thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was still a basketball game raging, but all of the tennis courts were dark. Emma walked to the very last one and pushed open the creaky gate. She could just make out a figure lying on the ground near the net. Her heart swelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Ethan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“hello?” Emma whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan jumped to his feet and walked toward her, his stride even and calm. His hands were shoved deep into the pockets of his worn Levi’s. A tissue-thin T-shirt clung to his strong arms. “Hey,” he said. Even in the dark she could tell he was grinning. “Did you sneak out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma shook her head. “I didn’t have to. The Mercers lifted my punishment—I guess all the homework I’ve been doing changed their minds. But Mr. Mercer asked me a million questions about where I was going.” She glanced over her shoulder at the dark trees beyond. “It’s a wonder he didn’t follow me. Then again, I guess I should be grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody’s ever cared enough to know where I was at all times.” She laughed halfheartedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not even Becky?” Ethan asked, raising an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma gazed out at the twisted trees beyond the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Becky left me at a convenience store once, remember?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t exactly a model parent.” She felt guilty for trashing her mother. She had some good memories of Becky—like the time she had let Emma dress up in a silky slip and play Snow White around their hotel room, or the many nights Becky had set up treasure hunts for her—but they’d never make up for how she had abandoned Emma when she needed her most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’m glad you made it,” Ethan said, changing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too,” Emma answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met his eyes for a brief moment. There was a long pause, and they both looked down. Emma kicked a loose tennis ball near the net. Ethan jingled change in his pockets. Then he reached out and took her hand. She caught the scent of his spicy aftershave as he leaned in close. “Lights on or off?” he asked. The tennis courts had manual lights—seventy-five cents for every thirty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Off,” Emma answered, excitement flooding her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan tugged her down until they were both lying on the cement. The ground was still warm from the day’s heat, and it smelled vaguely of tar and rubber sneakers. Above them, a silvery moon shone. An owll flapped to a high tree branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe Thayer broke into your house,” Ethan said after a beat, holding her close. “Are you okay?” Emma rested her cheek against his chest, feeling suddenly exhausted. “I’m better now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So did Thayer sneak in to see Sutton?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma pulled back and sighed. “I guess so. Unless …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unless what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unless Thayer knows who I really am and came to remind me to stay in line.” Just saying the words aloud made Emma shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan hugged his knees to his chest. “You think Thayer killed Sutton?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s definitely possible. He’s the only one of her friends we haven’t been able to investigate. What do you think was going on between Sutton and Thayer before he ran away?” Emma placed her palm flat on the asphalt, feeling its heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed to touch something solid, something she understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn expression of regret crossed Ethan’s face. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “I wish I did, but they weren’t my crowd.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A couple of people hinted that he might’ve been fooling around with Sutton,” Emma said. One of them was Garrett, Sutton’s ex—he’d more or less accused Sutton of it at Homecoming on Friday. And Nisha Banerjee had pretty much spelled out how Sutton had stolen Laurel’s crush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there were the icy glances Laurel had been shooting Emma ever since Thayer had turned up in Sutton’s bedroom, and the cryptic thing she’d said. You just make his life worse. What was that about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then again, other people have made it sound like Sutton did something that caused Thayer to leave town,” Emma said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard something about that.” Ethan kicked at a crack in the court with the heel of his sneaker. “But who knows if it’s true? People only started whispering that recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Thayer first went missing, everyone assumed he’d just run away to escape his dad. He was always screaming at Thayer during soccer matches and putting a ton of pressure on him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma winced, remembering something else from the night of the dance. At Homecoming, Emma had noticed purple bruises on Madeline’s arms. She said they’d come from her father. She’d also said he was hard on Thayer, too. The moment had been heart-wrenching, but it also felt special. It was the first time Emma had had a real, honest conversation with one of Sutton’s friends. She craved that connection: Other than her best friend, Alex, who lived in Henderson, Nevada, it had been hard to make many lasting friends because she’d moved around so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to admit it made me sort of sad that Emma was bonding with my bestie. In some ways, Emma was a better version of me, Sutton 2.0, which really stung. Madeline had never shared her secret about her dad with me—she’d more or less implied that she thought I didn’t care. I’d definitely sensed something was up with Mr. Vega, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night, Charlotte, Laurel, and I had sat in Madeline’s bedroom as Mr. Vega flung pots and pans around the kitchen, screaming at Mads and Thayer about God knows what. When Madeline returned to her room, eyes wide and bloodshot, we’d all pretended nothing had happened. If only I’d taken the time to ask Mads if she was okay. She’d probably given me plenty of clues. My twin was turning out to be a better friend to Mads and Char than I’d ever been—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand now there wasn’t a thing I could do about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan leaned back on his elbows, exposing a taut line of tanned stomach muscles. “Thayer could have left for a reason other than his dad or Sutton. I’ve heard people say that he was mixed up in some really dangerous stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like what? Alcohol? Drugs?” Emma asked, recalling what Mr. Mercer had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan shrugged. “It was all just vague gossip. I can try to ask around. Now that he’s back, people will definitely be talking about him. It’ll just be a matter of separating rumor from fact.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma flopped down on the hard court. “Have I mentioned how frustrating this is? I have no idea how to find out exactly what happened between Thayer and Sutton without giving away who I really am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan linked his fingers through hers. “We’ll figure this out. I promise. We’re so much closer than we were a month ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGratitude washed over Emma like a wave. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan waved his free hand. “Stop that. We’re in this together.” Then he shifted his weight and pulled out a crinkled piece of paper from his back pocket. “Hey… so I wanted to ask you… Do you have any interest in going to this with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma smoothed the creases from the paper. 10TH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eANNUAL POETRY SLAM CONTEST, a typewriter font read. The event was in early November. She glanced up at him questioningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve read my poems at Club Congress the last couple of weeks,” Ethan explained. “I just thought it might be nice to have some moral support in the audience for once.” Emma couldn’t stop the grin that spread across her face. “You’re going to let me hear your poetry?” The very first night she’d met Ethan—which was also the very first night she’d been in Tucson—she’d seen him scribbling poems in a notebook. She’d been dying to read his work but was afraid to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As long as you don’t make fun of it.” Ethan ducked his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I won’t!” Emma clasped his hand. “I’ll absolutely be there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan’s eyes shone. “Seriously?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma nodded, moved by how vulnerable he seemed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingertips touched the inside of his palm. Fireflies sparked in the distance, flitting back and forth between cacti and madrone trees. The wind gusted through the dark pieces of Ethan’s hair as he put his arm around Emma’s shoulders. Emma inched closer, her knees brushing against the denim of Ethan’s jeans. She thought of their kiss last night, of how soft his lips had been on hers. It felt selfish to indulge her feelings for Ethan while her sister’s murder remained unsolved, but Ethan was the only thing keeping her sane right now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/two-truths-and-a-lie-the-lying-game-3/page-4.html","bookId":2395,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:29 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:29 AM"}
