Most of the vampires had gathered in the Hall of Princes or were waiting outside for the verdict - vampires loved intrigue almost as much as they loved fighting, and all were anxious to hear the news firsthand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come you leapt to my rescue?\" I asked Harkat after a while, to break the nerve-racking silence. \"You might have been killed trying to save me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To be honest,\" Harkat replied sheepishly, \"I acted... for my own sake... not yours. If you die, I might... never find out... who I used... to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"You\u0027d better not tell the vampires that. The only reason they\u0027ve gone lightly on you is that they respect bravery and self-sacrifice. If they learn you did it to save your own skin, there\u0027s no telling what they\u0027d do!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not... mind?\" Harkat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they decide... to kill you, will you... let them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be able to stop them,\" I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But will you... go quietly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure,\" I sighed. \"If they\u0027d taken me right after the fight, I\u0027d have gone without a murmur - I was pumped up with adrenaline and wasn\u0027t scared of dying. Now that I\u0027ve calmed down, I\u0027m dreading it. I hope I\u0027ll go with my head held high, but I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll cry and beg for mercy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not you,\" Harkat said. \"You\u0027re too... tough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\" I laughed dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fought... boars and faced... fire and water. You didn\u0027t... show fear before. Why should... you now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was different,\" I said. \"I had a fighting chance. If they decide to kill me, I\u0027ll have to walk to the Hall of Death knowing it\u0027s all over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Harkat said. \"If you do... die, maybe you... will come back... as a Little... Person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Harkat\u0027s misshapen body, his scarred, disfigured face, his green eyes, and the mask he couldn\u0027t survive without. \"Oh, that\u0027s a great comfort,\" I said sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just trying... to cheer you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, don\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes trickled by agonizingly. I wished the vampires would reach their decision quickly, even if it meant death - anything would be better than sitting here, not knowing. Finally, after what felt like a lifetime, there came the sound of feet in the tunnel outside. Harkat and I tensed, rolled off our hammocks, and jumped to attention by the door of the cell. We glanced nervously at each other. Harkat grinned weakly. My grin was even weaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we go,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footsteps slowed, stopped, then came again, softly. A vampire emerged from the gloom of the tunnel and slid into the cell - Kurda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to see how you were doing,\" he said, smiling crookedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine!\" I snapped. \"Just dandy. Couldn\u0027t be better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought as much.\" He looked around twitchily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have they... decided yet?\" Harkat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But it won\u0027t be long. They...\" - He cleared his throat - \"They\u0027re going to demand your death, Darren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been expecting it, but it hit me hard all the same. I took a step backwards, and my knees buckled. If Harkat hadn\u0027t caught and steadied me, I would have fallen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve tried arguing them out of it,\" Kurda said. \"Others have too - Gavner and Vanez put their careers on the line to plead for you. But there aren\u0027t any precedents. The laws are clear - failure to complete the Trials must be punished with death. We tried convincing the Princes to let you take the Trial again, but they turned a deaf ear to our pleas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why haven\u0027t they come for me?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re still debating. Larten\u0027s been calling older vampires forward and asking if they ever heard of something like this happening before. He\u0027s trying hard for you. If there\u0027s the slightest legal loophole, he\u0027ll find it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there isn\u0027t, is there?\" I asked glumly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda shook his head. \"If Paris Skyle knows of no way to save you, I\u0027m sure none of the others do either. If he can\u0027t help you, I doubt that anyone can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s over. I\u0027m finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not necessarily,\" Kurda said, averting his eyes, strangely embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\" I frowned. \"You just said -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The verdict\u0027s inevitable,\" he interrupted. \"That doesn\u0027t mean you have to stay and face it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kurda!\" I gasped, appalled by what he was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can get out,\" he whispered. \"I know a way past the guards, a breach point I never informed anybody about. We can take rarely used tunnels down through the mountain, to save time. Dawn isn\u0027t far off. Once you get out in the open, you\u0027ll have a free run until dusk. Even then, I don\u0027t think anybody will come after you. Since you don\u0027t pose a threat, they\u0027ll let you go. They might kill you if they run into you later, but for the time being -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t do that,\" I interrupted. \"Mr. Crepsley would be ashamed of me. I\u0027m his assistant. He\u0027d have to answer for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Kurda said. \"You\u0027re not his responsibility, not since you embarked on the Trials. People might say things behind his back, but nobody would question his good name out in the open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t,\" I said again, with less conviction this time. \"What about you? If they found out you\u0027d helped me escape...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t,\" Kurda said. \"I\u0027ll cover my tracks. As long as you aren\u0027t caught, I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I am caught, and they worm the truth out of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda shrugged. \"I\u0027ll take that chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, torn by uncertainty. The vampire part of me wanted to stay and take what I had coming. The human part said not to be a fool, grab my opportunity and run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re young, Darren,\" Kurda said. \"It\u0027s crazy to throw your life away. Leave Vampire Mountain. Make a fresh start. You\u0027re experienced enough to survive on your own. You don\u0027t need Larten to look after you anymore. Lots of vampires lead their own lives, having nothing to do with the rest of us. Be your own person. Don\u0027t let the foolish pride of others cloud your judgment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\" I asked Harkat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think... Kurda\u0027s right,\" he said. \"No point... letting them kill... you. Go. Live. Be free. I will... come with you... and help. Later, maybe you... can help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harkat won\u0027t be able to come,\" Kurda said. \"He\u0027s too broad to fit through some of the tunnels I plan to use. You can arrange to meet somewhere else, when Council is over and he\u0027s free to leave without drawing suspicion to himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Cirque... Du Freak,\" Harkat said. \"You\u0027ll be able... to find it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. I\u0027d gotten to know a lot of people around the world during my years with the Cirque, people who assisted Mr. Tall and his colleagues when they came to town. They\u0027d be able to point me in the direction of the traveling circus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you decided?\" Kurda asked. \"There\u0027s no time to stand and debate the issue. Come with me now, or stay to face your death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulped deeply, stared at my feet, came to a decision, then locked gazes with Kurda and said, \"I\u0027ll come.\" I wasn\u0027t proud of myself, but shame was a lot sweeter than the sharpened stakes in the Hall of Death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trials-of-death-the-saga-of-darren-shan-5/page-17.html","bookId":2441,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:40 PM"}
