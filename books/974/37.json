{"id":40416,"no":37,"title":"THE RABBIT PEN","content":"They marched her to the rabbit pen, where about fortyhandcuffed Smokies sat inside the wire fence. A dozen or soSpecials stood in a cordon around them, watching theircaptives with empty expressions. By the entrance to thecompound a few rabbits hopped aimlessly, too addled bytheir sudden freedom to make a break for it.\n\u003cbr\u003e The Special who had captured Tally took her to the endfarthest from the gate, where a handful of Smokies withbloody noses and black eyes were clustered.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Armed resistor,” he said to the two cruel pretties whoguarded this end of the pen, and shoved her down to theground among the others.\n\u003cbr\u003e She stumbled and fell onto her back, where her weightstretched the cuffs painfully across her wrists. When shestruggled to turn over, a foot planted itself into her backand pushed her up. For a moment, she thought the shoebelonged to a Special, but it was one of the other Smokies,helping her up the only way he could. She managed to situp cross-legged.\n\u003cbr\u003e The wounded Smokies around her smiled grimly, noddingencouragement.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Tally,” someone hissed.\n\u003cbr\u003e She struggled to turn toward the voice. It was Croy, a cutover his eye bleeding down onto his cheek, one side of hisface covered with dirt. He scooted himself a bit closer. “Youresisted?” he said. “Huh. Guess I was wrong about you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally could only cough. Traces of the burning pepperseemed stuck in her lungs, like the embers of a fire thatwouldn’t go out. Tears still streamed from her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I noticed you slept through breakfast call this morning,”\n\u003cbr\u003e he said. “Then when the Specials came, I figured you’dpicked an awfully convenient time to disappear.”\n\u003cbr\u003e She shook her head, forced words through the cindersin her throat. “I was out late with David. That’s all.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Speaking made her sore jaw ache.\n\u003cbr\u003e Croy frowned. “I haven’t seen him all morning.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Really?” She blinked away tears. “Maybe he got away.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I doubt anyone did.” Croy jutted his chin toward thegate of the pen. A large group of Smokies was on its way,guarded by a squad of Specials. Among them, Tally recognizedfaces from those who’d made a stand at the mess hall.\n\u003cbr\u003e “They’re just mopping up now,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you seen Shay?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Croy shrugged. “She was at breakfast when theyattacked, but I lost track of her.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “What about the Boss?”\n\u003cbr\u003e 298 Scott WesterfeldCroy looked around. “No.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I think he got away. He and I made a run together.”\n\u003cbr\u003e A dark smile crossed Croy’s face. “That’s funny. Healways said he wouldn’t mind getting captured. Somethingabout a face-lift.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally managed to smile. But then she thought about thebrain lesions that went along with becoming pretty, and ashiver passed through her body. She wondered how manyof these captives knew what was really going to happento them.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yeah, the Boss was going to give himself up, to help meget away, but I couldn’t have made it through the forest.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why not?”\n\u003cbr\u003e She wriggled her toes. “No shoes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Croy raised an eyebrow. “You picked the wrong day tosleep late.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I guess so.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Outside the overcrowded rabbit pen, the new arrivalswere being organized into groups. A pair of Specials movedthrough the pen, flashing a reader into the bound Smokies’\n\u003cbr\u003e eyes, taking them outside one by one.\n\u003cbr\u003e “They must be separating everyone by city,” Croy said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “To take us home,” he said coldly.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Home,” she repeated. Just last night, that word hadchanged its meaning in her mind. And now home wasdestroyed. It lay around her in ruins, burning and captured.\n\u003cbr\u003e UGLIES 299She scanned the captives, looking for Shay and David.\n\u003cbr\u003e The familiar faces in the crowd were haggard, dirty, crumpledby shock and defeat, but Tally realized that she no longerthought of them as ugly. It was the cold expressions of theSpecials, beautiful though they were, that seemed horrific toher now.\n\u003cbr\u003e A disturbance caught her eye. Three of the invaderswere carrying a struggling figure, bound hand and foot,through the pen. They marched straight to the resistors’\n\u003cbr\u003e corner and dumped her onto the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e It was Shay.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Watch this one.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The two Specials guarding them glanced at the stillwrithing figure. “Armed resistor?” one asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e There was a pause. Tally saw that one of the Specialshad a bruise marring his pretty face.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Unarmed. But dangerous.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The three left their captive behind, their cruel gracemarked with a touch of hurry.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Shay!” Croy hissed.\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay rolled herself over. Her face was red, her lips puffyand bleeding. She spat, saliva trailing from her mouth to abloodred glob on the dusty ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Croy,” she managed with a thick tongue.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then her eyes fell on Tally.\n\u003cbr\u003e “You!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Uh, Shay . . . ,” Croy began.\n\u003cbr\u003e 300 Scott Westerfeld“You did this!” Her whole body writhed like a snake inits death throes. “Stealing my boyfriend wasn’t enough? Youhad to betray the whole Smoke!”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally closed her eyes and shook her head. It couldn’t betrue. She had destroyed the pendant. The fire had consumedit.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Shay!” Croy said. “Calm down. Look at her. She foughtthem.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Are you blind, Croy? Look around you! She did this!”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally took a deep breath and forced herself to look atShay. Her friend’s eyes burned with hatred.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Shay, I swear to you, I didn’t. I never . . .” Her voicefaltered.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Who else could have led them here?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “We can’t blame each other, Shay,” Croy said. “It could’vebeen anything. A satellite image. A scouting mission.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “A spy.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Will you look at her, Shay?” Croy cried. “She’s tied up,like us. She resisted!”\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay slammed her eyes shut and shook her head.\n\u003cbr\u003e The two Specials with the eye-reader had reached theresistors’ corner of the pen. One stood back while the otherstepped forward warily. “We don’t want to hurt you,” sheannounced. “But we will if we have to.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The cruel pretty grabbed Croy’s chin and flashed thereader in his eye. She looked at its readout.\n\u003cbr\u003e UGLIES 301“Another one of ours,” she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e The other Special raised an eyebrow. “Didn’t know wehad so many runaways.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The two hauled Croy to his feet and marched himtoward the largest group of Smokies outside. Tally bit herlip. Croy was one of Shay’s old friends, so these twoSpecials were from her own city. Maybe all the invaderswere.\n\u003cbr\u003e It had to be a coincidence. This couldn’t be her fault.\n\u003cbr\u003e She’d seen the pendant burn!\n\u003cbr\u003e “So you’ve got Croy on your side too now, I see,” Shayhissed.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tears began to fill Tally’s eyes, but not from the pepperthis time. “Look at me, Shay!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “He suspected you from the beginning. But I told himevery time, ‘No, Tally’s my friend. She’d never do anythingto hurt me.’”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Shay, I’m not lying.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “How did you change Croy’s mind, Tally? The sameway you changed David’s?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Shay, I never meant for that to happen.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “So where were you two last night?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally swallowed, trying to hold her voice steady. “Justtalking. I told him about my necklace.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “That took all night? Or did you just decide to makeyour move before the Specials came? One last game withhim. With me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 302 Scott WesterfeldTally lowered her head. “Shay . . .”\n\u003cbr\u003e A hand grabbed her chin and forced it up. She blinked,and a dazzling red light flashed.\n\u003cbr\u003e The Special looked at the device closely. “Hey, it’s her.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally shook her head. “No.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The other Special looked at the readout, nodding confirmation.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Tally Youngblood?”\n\u003cbr\u003e She didn’t answer. They lifted her to her feet and dustedher off.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Come with us. Dr. Cable wants to see you immediately.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I knew it,” Shay hissed.\n\u003cbr\u003e “No!”\n\u003cbr\u003e They pulled Tally toward the gate of the pen. Shetwisted her head around to look back, trying to think ofwords that would explain.\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay glared up at her from the ground, bloody teethgritted, her eyes falling to Tally’s bound wrists. A secondlater, Tally felt the pressure release, and her hands poppedapart. The Specials had cut her handcuffs.\n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” she said softly.\n\u003cbr\u003e One of the Specials squeezed her shoulder. “Don’tworry, Tally, we’ll have you home in no time.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The other chimed in. “We’ve been looking for thisbunch for years.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yeah, good work.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1847/53569.html","bookId":974,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:02:53 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:02:53 PM"}
