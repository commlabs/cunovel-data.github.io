Understand what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why you have no companions, Hedge of the Bridgeburners.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re not going to turn into a cloud of dust on me, are you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In this place, I cannot. Alas.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, Hedge resumed, ‘It’s not like I died a virgin or anything, of course. Even ugly bastards like me-well, so long as there’s enough coin in your hand. But I’ll tell you something, Emroth, that’s not what you’d call love now, is it? So anyway, the truth of it is, 1 never shared that with anybody. Love. I mean, from the time I stopped being a child, right up until I died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now there was this soldier, once. She was big and mean. Named Detoran. She decided she loved me, and showed it by beating me senseless. So how do you figure that one? Well, I’ve got it worked out. You see, she was even less lovable than me. Poor old cow. Wish I’d understood that at the time. But I was too busy running away from her. Funny how that is, isn’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She died, too. And so I had a chance to, you know, talk to her. Since we found ourselves in the same place. Her problem was, she couldn’t put enough words together to make a real sentence. Not thick, much, just inarticulate. People like that, how can you guess what’s in their mind? They can’t tell you, so the guessing stays guessing and most of the time you’re so wrong it’s pathetic. Well, we worked it out, more or less. I think. She said even less as a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But that’s the thing with it all, Emroth. There’s the big explosion, the white, then black, then you’re stirring awake all over again. A damned ghost with nowhere worthwhile to go, and all you’re left with is realizations and regrets. And a list of wishes longer than Hood’s-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No more, Hedge of the Bridgeburners,’ Emroth interjected, the tremor of emotion in its voice. ‘I am not a fool. I comprehend this game of yours. But my memories are not for you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge shrugged. ‘Not for you either, I gather. Gave them all away to wage war against the Jaghut. They were so evil, so dangerous, you made of yourselves your first victims. Kind of a backwards kind of vengeance, wouldn’t you say? Like you went and done their work for them. And the real joke is, they weren’t much evil or dangerous at all. Oh, maybe a handful, but those handful earned the wrath of their kin real fast-often long before you and your armies even showed up. They could police themselves just fine. They flung glaciers at you, so what did you do to defeat that? Why, you made your hearts even colder, even more lifeless than any glacier. Hood knows, that’s irony for you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am unbound,’ Emroth said in a rasp. ‘My memories remain with me. It is these memories that have broken me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Broken?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother shrug. ‘Hedge of the Bridgeburners, unlike you, I remember love.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither spoke for a time after that. The wind whipped bitter and dry. The crusted remnants of snow crackled underfoot in the beds of moss and lichen. On the horizon ahead there was a slate-grey ridge of some sort, angular like a massed line of toppled buildings. Above it the sky was milky white. Hedge gestured northward. ‘So, Emroth, is that it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe half-shattered head lifted. ‘Omtose Phellack.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Really? But-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We must cross it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, and what lies beyond?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe T’lan Imass halted and stared at Hedge with its withered, shadow-shrunken eyes. ‘I am not sure,’ it replied. ‘But, I now believe, it may be… home.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn you, Emroth. You’ve just made things a lot harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe temple stood on a low hill, the land barren on all sides. Its huge cyclopean walls looked battered, shoved inward as if by ten thousand stone fists. Crooked fissures tracked the dark grey granite from ground level to the massive lintel stone leaning drunkenly above what had once been a grand, noble entranceway. The remnants of statues jutted from pedestals set to either side of the broad, now sagging steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas did not know where he was. Just another dream, or what started as a dream. Doomed, like all the others, to slide into something far worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he waited, trembling, his legs crippled, broken and lifeless beneath him-a new variation on the theme of incapacity. Bludgeoning symbol to his many flaws. The last time, he recalled, he had been squirming on the ground, limbless, a broken-backed snake. It seemed his subconscious lacked subtlety, a most bitter admission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless, of course, someone or something else was send-ing these visitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, corpses had appeared on the stony slopes beneath the temple. Scores, then hundreds. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-169.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
