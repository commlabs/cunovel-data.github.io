After which, he walked and went beside Ling Qingzhu, whose head was tilted towards one side, before he looked at her blood stained veil. Meanwhile, there was still a familiar chillness on the latter’s brows. However, this was different from the iciness of Ying Huanhuan. Her chillness contained an inborn pride and that was also perhaps the reason why she was so outstanding.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu also realized that that young man had walked to her side.

Immediately, all their faces darkened. After all, there was still a huge army from Yuan Gate on the outside, eyeing them with ill intent. Moreover, even Ling Qingzhu was defeated by the first elder of Yuan Gate. Therefore, they had essentially lost their final pillar of support.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Leave everything else to my Dao Sect.

In fact, each time they were about to make eye contact, she would turn away immediately.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Big brother Lin Dong… you… be careful.

However, she did not dare to speak up. After all, she had a close relationship with Ling Qingzhu and knew that there was a murky relationship between the two of them. In fact, over the past three years since Lin Dong left, she occasionally caught Ling Qingzhu falling into a daze during her training. Moreover, judging by her demeanor, it was clear that she was pining after someone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThose incidents piqued Su Rou’s curiosity. After all, Ling Qingzhu had a cool and aloof character, and she had strong mental fortitude. In fact, there were countless geniuses and monsters in the Eastern Xuan Region who were pining after her. However, none of them were able to make any headway. At times, Su Rou even thought that there was no man in this world, who could cause this haughty fairy like senior to behave like an ordinary little girl. As such, when she saw Ling Qingzhu acting in this manner, she felt great shock in her heart.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, what puzzled her was that Ling Qingzhu chose to treat big brother Lin Dong like a stranger, even though there was clearly a relationship between the both of them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough she had her doubts, Ling Qingzhu clearly enjoyed an extremely high status in Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace.

Immediately, he turned around and left. However, Ling Qingzhu involuntarily clenched her hand at this moment. Meanwhile, her teeth gently bit her red lips, which were hidden under her veil.

She hurriedly opened her eyes before she touched her jade like face. After which, she was startled when she saw the veil in Lin Dong’s hand. Finally, shame and anger appeared on her usually cool and aloof face. Those emotions, which appeared instantly, caused the surrounding Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace disciples to be stunned. After all, Ling Qingzhu typically acted in a cool and indifferent manner within the palace, and she seldom revealed such a touching emotion, that was comparable to a fairy descending in the mortal world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You look much better than before.

As such, there would always be a unique spot for each other in their respective hearts. This was something that even the prideful Ling Qingzhu had no choice but to admit. After all, if it was another man who had removed her veil, she would have pierced him with her sword immediately. However, since it was Lin Dong who did so, that act, which could incite her murderous intent, only left her vexed and embarrassed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu was undoubtedly a haughty and aloof person. This was clearly demonstrated when they met for the first time many years ago. However, on their first encounter, she was an extremely talented individual from Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace, while Lin Dong was merely a kid from the branch family of a clan in a low rank empire. Hence, there was a massive gap between them, both in terms of status and strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBack then, Ling Qingzhu ought to have killed this person, who had taken her virginity, with a stab from her sword. However, Lin Dong’s bright and heated eyes stopped her from doing so. At that time, she knew that this seemingly weak young man possessed tenacity and determination that no one could match up to.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMoreover, she was aware that she had become the target whom he was actively chasing after.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFurthermore, she was also well aware of the tremendous efforts that he had put in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn order to accomplish his goal, since that day onwards, this cub like young man had began to run with all his might on a path filled with all sorts of dangers and obstacles. Even though he ended up covered with wounds, he never regretted his decision.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePerhaps, at that time, even she did not expect that this once weak young man, would actually stand in front of her many years later and use his small body to help her to block the wild storms, which even she could not endure.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEmotions churned within her heart. Past memories also began to replay within Ling Qingzhu’s mind. Finally, a gentle emotion appeared within her clear and bright eyes. After which, a soft voice was slowly transmitted into Lin Dong’s ears.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Be careful.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1199\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1201\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1200","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:55 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:55 AM"}
