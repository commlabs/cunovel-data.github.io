{"id":83729,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I cradle his face with my hands, I\u0027m bothered by what I see. This should be the happiest moment of our lives—it is for me—but his expression leaves me with a different feeling. Something isn\u0027t right. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face is pained. \"We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, we need to talk but his tone makes me uneasy. If I\u0027m being honest, it downright scares the shit out of me because it sounds so ominous. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you need to go inside to get your things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But it\u0027ll only take a minute.\" I take his hand because I don\u0027t want to be away from him for even a second. I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll disappear. \"I want you to come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans inside and tells the driver, \"I\u0027m staying,\" before he shuts the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grasp his hand tightly as we walk toward the entrance to the concert hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m certain he saw Charlie kiss me. Shit! He probably thinks I\u0027m with him now. But I\u0027ll explain. I\u0027ll make him see that he\u0027ll always be the only one for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we get to the door of the lounge, he stops. \"I think I better stay out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. He definitely saw Charlie kiss me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk through the lounge door and Charlie is still sitting in the same spot I left him. I have no idea what to say to him. He\u0027s spent the last two months patiently pursuing me in the sweetest manner. It\u0027s going to be painful for him for a while, but my heart knows it\u0027s the only way. He deserves to be someone\u0027s everything, not second place to a man I could never stop loving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit next to him to explain—because he\u0027s a friend and I feel I owe him that—but he already knows. I see it on his face. \"He chose to come for you on the night I planned to make my big move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod because I can\u0027t answer. Charlie loves me and has been so kind the last two months. It\u0027s painful to hurt him like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis forearms are propped on his thighs as he leans forward, staring at the floor. \"That\u0027s good. You deserve to be happy. But I sure wish he\u0027d come before I had the chance to fall in love with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDammit. Why does this have to be so hard? \"I\u0027m sorry. I truly didn\u0027t intend for that to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continues staring at the floor and I suspect it\u0027s because he doesn\u0027t want me to see the tears in his eyes. \"I know, and it\u0027s not your fault. You\u0027re just too damn easy to love. You told me from the beginning you didn\u0027t think you could love anyone else after him. Now you\u0027ll never have to try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to tell him he deserves so much more than me and reassure him he\u0027ll find the one to give him all the love he deserves, but he\u0027s not in a place where he\u0027s ready to hear that. \"I have to go, Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do.\" He looks up at me. I was right. He has huge tears in his eyes and my heart breaks for him. \"Don\u0027t forget that the bus pulls out at nine sharp tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he afraid I won\u0027t come back? \"I\u0027ll be there.\" I pick up my Martin and place it on the couch next to him. \"Can you ask the crew to be sure this makes it onto the bus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Henry is waiting for me in the hallway. He\u0027s standing on the far side of the corridor and I wonder if it\u0027s because he\u0027s afraid he might overhear something Charlie has to say. He walks in my direction when he sees me. \"Where do you want to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to go wherever I can get naked with Jack Henry and show him how much I\u0027ve missed him. And I don\u0027t want to risk running into any of the band or crew. \"Where are you staying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a suite at the Fairmont.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to take me there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re both silent in the cab on the way to the hotel. He looks straight ahead while I stare at him from where I\u0027m sitting. I\u0027m sure he must see me but I don\u0027t care. I can\u0027t stop because I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll disappear like a phantom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want him to kiss me like crazy all the way to the hotel, but he doesn\u0027t. In fact, he never even looks in my direction. I wish I were brave enough to reach for his hand so I could get some kind of reaction from him, but I don\u0027t. I\u0027m too afraid—I\u0027m not sure where his head is after seeing Charlie kiss me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0027t going to be good. Why did he have to see that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk through the luxurious hotel lobby and get onto the elevator. I\u0027m closed up with him and two other people in the tiny space for only a minute or so, but the sexual tension we\u0027re radiating is almost suffocating. I want him so badly, it hurts. I need to touch him, to feel his skin against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t have time to brush up next to him because the elevator arrives on the sixth floor where his suite is located. After the door clicks behind us, my heart, and my body, rejoice. We are alone at last. And I\u0027m scared to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve been apart for three months and another man is kissing me when Jack Henry sees me for the first time. The situation is a nightmare that never factored into any dreams or fantasies I had about our reunion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, this sucks. What is he thinking? Is he angry with me? Or hurt? Or worse—maybe he doesn\u0027t care enough to feel pain or anger. I can\u0027t tell because he\u0027s being so obscure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air conditioning is on and the room is really cold. I\u0027m soaked to the bone and feel myself shivering. Or maybe I\u0027m trembling from fear. Either way, he takes notice. \"You\u0027re drenched and freezing to death. Go take a hot shower to warm up and we\u0027ll talk after you\u0027re finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it\u0027s a bad sign he doesn\u0027t want to take me to bed and strip me out of these cold, wet clothes so he can warm me up himself. That\u0027s what my Jack Henry would do, without any hesitation at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I say, feeling deflated. This isn\u0027t what I had in mind. I\u0027d hoped he\u0027d want me as much as I want him. But he doesn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go into the bathroom and look at myself in the mirror. Holy shit, I look awful. No wonder he wants me to shower. Who wants to look at this? I look like a drowned raccoon thanks to the black mascara smudged under my eyes. Beetlejuice never looked this shitty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn the water on as hot as I can tolerate and step under the raining heat. It feels good and I warm up in a matter of minutes. I use his masculine products to wash my hair and body and I remember the way these scents mix with his skin to create the most intoxicating essence. Oh, I have missed his smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurry through my shower because I\u0027m eager to be with him. Next to him. Hopefully, under him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I\u0027m out, I blow-dry my hair using the hotel-provided dryer. I flip my head up and my tresses are wild and untamed. I could really use a brush. I rummage through my purse and find an old one floating around in the bottom. I brush out the tangles and wish I had a flatiron to smooth it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI use his toothpaste and my finger to brush my teeth before I slosh around a mouthful of minty goodness. I would\u0027ve preferred to have found a toothbrush in my purse to the hairbrush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo luxurious velour robes hang on the back of the door. I slip one on. I don\u0027t really want to wear it. I\u0027d like to hang it back on the hook and walk out naked. But I don\u0027t because he says he wants to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI come out of the bathroom and see him sitting on the couch. He\u0027s traded his wet clothes for a T-shirt and lounge pants like he used to wear around Avalon on his days off. He\u0027s drinking from a short, clear glass containing a dark amber liquid over ice. I suspect it\u0027s some kind of whiskey, which isn\u0027t like my Jack Henry at all. He never drank straight whiskey before and I\u0027m suddenly more afraid than I already was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop just outside the bathroom, unsure what to do. He watches me from where he\u0027s sitting. He seems looser than when we arrived, and I wonder how many of those little amber drinks he had while I was in the shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe holds up his glass. \"Want a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his glass to settle the ice. \"Come sit with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t say anything but I walk over and lower myself onto the seat right next to him. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s where he wants me, but it\u0027s where I want to be. I twist so I\u0027m facing him—I have to look into his brilliant blue eyes. I don\u0027t want to go another minute without searching them for all the things he\u0027s about to tell me. Good or bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts his glass away and reaches for my hand. He brings it to his lips and closes his eyes as he presses a kiss into my skin and strokes my hand against his scruffy face. \"I\u0027ve missed you so much, Laurelyn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach flips before it races my heart up toward my throat to see which can get there first. He\u0027s facing me now and I can\u0027t resist reaching out to touch his cheek. \"I\u0027ve missed you too—more than you could ever know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns his face toward my palm and covers the top of my hand with his. \"Believe me—I know all too well what it\u0027s like missing you. I\u0027ve been a mess since you left me. I thought I would lose my mind before I found you. You didn\u0027t make it easy on me, Miss Laurelyn Paige Prescott.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just said my name—the whole thing. \"How long have you been trying to find me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since the week you left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree months? My head is reeling. All this time I believed he hadn\u0027t given me a second thought because he was too busy screwing number fourteen. I was wrong. He\u0027s been looking for me all this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s when I can stand it no longer. I have to feel him against me. I put my knees on each side of his hips so that I\u0027m straddling him, as I\u0027ve done so many times before. I bring my mouth down on his and he reaches for the back of my head to pull me closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shared a multitude of kisses while we were together, but never one like this. I can\u0027t label it because this isn\u0027t the kiss of a man making a temporary arrangement with a woman he cares nothing about. This is different from anything I ever felt while in Australia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls away from our kiss but presses his forehead against mine. \"Please tell me you\u0027re not in love with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim? Oh. It takes a moment for me to realize who he means—Charlie. \"No! I\u0027m not in love with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look into his eyes and I can see that my denial isn\u0027t going to suffice. \"But you let him touch you…and kiss you,\" he says through gritted teeth, as though it pains him to say the words. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-12.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
