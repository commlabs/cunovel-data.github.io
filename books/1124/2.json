and then I gave one of them a kick with the side of my bare foot which sent it half way under the bed. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But what was I to do? \u0026nbsp;I began washing myself and brushing my hair with this horrid weight upon my mind. \u0026nbsp;My first plan was to go to bed, and send down word that I had been taken suddenly ill in the stomach; then to rise early in the morning and get away unobserved. \u0026nbsp;But by such a course of action I should lose all chance of any further acquaintance with those pretty girls! \u0026nbsp;That they were already aware of the extent of my predicament, and were now enjoying it—of that I was quite sure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What if I boldly put on the shooting-boots, and clattered down to dinner in them? \u0026nbsp;What if I took the bull by the horns, and made, myself, the most of the joke? \u0026nbsp;This might be very well for the dinner, but it would be a bad joke for me when the hour for dancing came. \u0026nbsp;And, alas! \u0026nbsp;I felt that I lacked the courage. \u0026nbsp;It is not every man that can walk down to dinner, in a strange house full of ladies, wearing such boots as those I have described.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Should I not attempt to borrow a pair? \u0026nbsp;This, all the world will say, should have been my first idea. \u0026nbsp;But I have not yet mentioned that I am myself a large-boned man, and that my feet are especially well developed. \u0026nbsp;I had never for a moment entertained a hope that I should find any one in that house whose boot I could wear. \u0026nbsp;But at last I rang the bell. \u0026nbsp;I would send for Jack, and if everything failed, I would communicate my grief to him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I had to ring twice before anybody came. \u0026nbsp;The servants, I well knew, were putting the dinner on the table. \u0026nbsp;At last a man entered the room, dressed in rather shabby black, whom I afterwards learned to be the butler.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What is your name, my friend?” said I, determined to make an ally of the man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My name? \u0026nbsp;Why Larry sure, yer honer. \u0026nbsp;And the masther is out of his sinses in a hurry, becase yer honer don’t come down.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is he though? \u0026nbsp;Well now, Larry;

the largest foot,” and then I proceeded to explain to him my misfortune. \u0026nbsp;He took up first my top-boot, and then the shooting-boot—in looking at which he gazed with wonder at the nails;—and then he glanced at my feet, measuring them with his eye; and after this he pronounced his opinion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yer honer couldn’t wear a morsel of leather belonging to ere a one of ’em, young or ould. \u0026nbsp;There niver was a foot like that yet among the O’Conors.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But are there no strangers staying here?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There’s three or four on ’em come in to dinner; but they’ll be wanting their own boots I’m thinking. \u0026nbsp;And there’s young Misther Dillon; he’s come to stay. \u0026nbsp;But Lord love you—” and he again looked at the enormous extent which lay between the heel and the toe of the shooting apparatus which he still held in his hand. \u0026nbsp;“I niver see such a foot as that in the whole barony,” he said, “barring my own.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now Larry was a large man, much larger altogether than myself, and as he said this I looked down involuntarily at his feet; or rather at his foot, for as he stood I could only see one. \u0026nbsp;And then a sudden hope filled my heart. \u0026nbsp;On that foot there glittered a shoe—not indeed such as were my own which were now resting ingloriously at Ballyglass while they were so sorely needed at Castle Conor; but one which I could wear before ladies, without shame—and in my present frame of mind with infinite contentment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let me look at that one of your own,” said I to the man, as though it were merely a subject for experimental inquiry. \u0026nbsp;Larry, accustomed to obedience, took off the shoe and handed it to me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My own foot was immediately in it, and I found that it fitted me like a glove.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And now the other,” said I—not smiling, for a smile would have put him on his guard; but somewhat sternly, so that that habit of obedience should not desert him at this perilous moment. \u0026nbsp;And then I stretched out my hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But yer honer can’t keep ’em, you know,” said he. \u0026nbsp;“I haven’t the ghost of another shoe to my feet.” \u0026nbsp;But I only looked more sternly than before, and still held out my hand. \u0026nbsp;Custom prevailed. \u0026nbsp;Larry stooped down slowly, looking at me the while, and pulling off the other slipper handed it to me with much hesitation. \u0026nbsp;Alas! as I put it to my foot I found that it was old, and worn, and irredeemably down at heel;—that it was in fact no counterpart at all to that other one which was to do duty as its fellow. \u0026nbsp;But nevertheless I put my foot into it, and felt that a descent to the drawing-room was now possible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But yer honer will give ’em back to a poor man?” said Larry almost crying. \u0026nbsp;“The masther’s mad this minute becase the dinner’s not up. \u0026nbsp;Glory to God, only listhen to that!” \u0026nbsp;And as he spoke a tremendous peal rang out from some bell down stairs that had evidently been shaken by an angry hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Larry,” said I—and I endeavoured to assume a look of very grave importance as I spoke—“I look to you to assist me in this matter.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Och—wirra sthrue then, and will you let me go? just listhen to that,” and another angry peal rang out, loud and repeated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you do as I ask you,” I continued, “you shall be well rewarded. \u0026nbsp;Look here; look at these boots,” and I held up the shooting-shoes new from Burlington Arcade. \u0026nbsp;“They cost thirty shillings—thirty shillings! and I will give them to you for the loan of this pair of slippers.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They’d be no use at all to me, yer honer;

there, he’s at it agin, as mad as blazes.” \u0026nbsp;This last exclamation had reference to another peal which was evidently the work of the master’s hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I confess I was not quite comfortable as I walked down stairs. \u0026nbsp;In the first place I was nearly half an hour late, and I knew from the vigour of the peals that had sounded that my slowness had already been made the subject of strong remarks. \u0026nbsp;And then my left shoe went flop, flop, on every alternate step of the stairs. \u0026nbsp;By no exertion of my foot in the drawing up of my toe could I induce it to remain permanently fixed upon my foot. \u0026nbsp;But over and above and worse than all this was the conviction strong upon my mind that I should become a subject of merriment to the girls as soon as I entered the room. \u0026nbsp;They would understand the cause of my distress, and probably at this moment were expecting to hear me clatter through the stone hall with those odious metal boots.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n However, I hurried down and entered the drawing-room, determined to keep my position near the door, so that I might have as little as possible to do on entering and as little as possible in going out. \u0026nbsp;But I had other difficulties in store for me. \u0026nbsp;I had not as yet been introduced to Mrs. O’Conor; nor to Miss O’Conor, the squire’s unmarried sister.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Upon my word I thought you were never coming,” said Mr. O’Conor as soon as he saw me. \u0026nbsp;“It is just one hour since we entered the house. \u0026nbsp;Jack, I wish you would find out what has come to that fellow Larry,” and again he rang the bell. \u0026nbsp;He was too angry, or it might be too impatient to go through the ceremony of introducing me to anybody.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I saw that the two girls looked at me very sharply, but I stood at the back of an arm-chair so that no one could see my feet. \u0026nbsp;But that little imp Tizzy walked round deliberately, looked at my heels, and then walked back again. \u0026nbsp;It was clear that she was in the secret.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There were eight or ten people in the room, but I was too much fluttered to notice well who they were.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mamma,” said Miss O’Conor, “let me introduce Mr. Green to you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It luckily happened that Mrs. O’Conor was on the same side of the fire as myself, and I was able to take the hand which she offered me without coming round into the middle of the circle. \u0026nbsp;Mrs. O’Conor was a little woman, apparently not of much importance in the world, but, if one might judge from first appearance, very good-natured.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And my aunt Die, Mr. Green,” said Kate, pointing to a very straight-backed, grim-looking lady, who occupied a corner of a sofa, on the opposite side of the hearth. \u0026nbsp;I knew that politeness required that I should walk across the room and make acquaintance with her. \u0026nbsp;But under the existing circumstances how was I to obey the dictates of politeness? \u0026nbsp;I was determined therefore to stand my ground, and merely bowed across the room at Miss O’Conor. \u0026nbsp;In so doing I made an enemy who never deserted me during the whole of my intercourse with the family. \u0026nbsp;But for her, who knows who might have been sitting opposite to me as I now write?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Upon my word, Mr. Green, the ladies will expect much from an Adonis who takes so long over his toilet,” said Tom O’Conor in that cruel tone of banter which he knew so well how to use.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You forget, father, that men in London can’t jump in and out of their clothes as quick as we wild Irishmen,” said Jack.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. Green knows that we expect a great deal from him this evening. \u0026nbsp;I hope you polk well, Mr. Green,” said Kate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I muttered something about never dancing, but I knew that that which I said was inaudible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t think Mr. Green will dance,” said Tizzy; “at least not much.” \u0026nbsp;The impudence of that child was, I think, unparalleled by any that I have ever witnessed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But in the name of all that’s holy, why don’t we have dinner?” \u0026nbsp;And Mr. O’Conor thundered at the door. \u0026nbsp;“Larry, Larry, Larry!” he screamed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, yer honer, it’ll be all right in two seconds,” answered Larry, from some bottomless abyss. \u0026nbsp;“Tare an’ ages;
