{"id":8062,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"0600 Hours, July 18, 2552 (Military Calendar) /UNSCIroquois , military staging area in orbit around Sigma Octanus IVCommander Keyes had a sinking feeling that although he had won the battle, it would be the first ofmany to come in the Sigma Octanus System.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He watched the four dozen other UNSC ships orbit the planet: frigates and destroyers, two carriers, anda massive repair and refitting station—more vessels than Admiral Cole had at his disposal during hisfour-year-long campaign to save Harvest. Admiral Stanforth had pulled out all the stops.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Although Commander Keyes was grateful for the quick and overwhelming response, he wondered whythe Admiral had dedicated so many ships to the area. Sigma Octanus wasn’t strategically positioned. Ithad no special resources. True, the UNSC had standing orders to protect civilian lives, but the fleet wasspread dangerously thin. Commander Keyes knew there were more valuable systems that neededprotection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He pushed these thoughts aside. He was sure Admiral Stanforth had his reasons. Meanwhile the repairand resupply of theIroquois was his top priority—he didn’t want to get caught half ready if the Covenantreturned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Or rather,when they returned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a curious thing: the aliens dropping their ground forces and then retreating. That was not theirusual mode of operation. Commander Keyes suspected this was just an opening move in a game hedidn’t yet understand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A shadow crossed the fore camera of theIroquois as the repair stationCradle maneuvered closer.Cradlewas essentially a large square plate with engines. Large was an understatement; she was over a squarekilometer. Three destroyers could be eclipsed by her shadow. The station running at full steam couldrefit six destroyers, three from her lower surface and three on her upper surface, within a matter of hours.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scaffolds deployed from her surfaces to facilitate repairs. Resupply tubes, hoses, and cargo trams fedinto theIroquois . It would take the full attention ofCradle thirty hours to repair theIroquois , however.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The aliens had not landed a single serious shot. Nonetheless, theIroquois had almost been destroyedduring the execution of what some in the fleet were already calling the “Keyes Loop.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Commander Keyes glanced at his data pad and the extensive list of repairs. Fifteen percent of theelectronic systems had to be replaced—burned out from the EMP when the Shiva missile detonated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e TheIroquois ’ engines required a full overhaul. Both coolant systems had valves that had been fusedfrom the tremendous heat. Five of the superconducting magnets had to be replaced as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But most troublesome was the damage to the underside of theIroquois . When they had told CommanderKeyes what had happened, he went outside in a Longsword interceptor to personally inspect what he haddone to his ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The underside of theIroquois had been scraped when they passed over the prow of the alien destroyer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He knew there was some damage . . . but was not prepared for what he saw.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e UNSC destroyers had nearly two meters of titaniumabattleplate on their surfaces. Commander Keyeshad abraded throughall of it. He had breached every bottom deck of theIroquois . The jagged serratededges of the plate curled away from the wound. Men in EVA thruster packs were busy cutting off thedamaged sections so new plates could be welded into place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The underside was mirror smooth and perfectly flat. But Keyes knew that the appearance of benignflatness was deceptive. Had the angle of theIroquois been tilted a single degree down, the force of thetwo ships impacting would have shorn his ship in half.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The red war stripes that had been painted on theIroquois ’ side looked like bloody slashes. Thedockmaster had privately told Commander Keyes that his crew could buff the paint off—or even repaintthe war stripes, if he wanted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Commander Keyes had politely refused the offer. He wanted them left exactly the way they were. Hewanted to be reminded that while everyone had admired what he had done—it had been an act ofdesperation, not heroism.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He wanted to be reminded of how close a brush he had had with death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Commander Keyes returned to theIroquois and marched directly to his quarters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sat at his antique oak desk and tapped the intercom. “Lieutenant Dominique, you have the bridge forthe next cycle. I am not to be disturbed.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye, Commander. Understood.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Commander Keyes loosened his collar and unbuttoned his uniform. He retrieved the seventy-year-oldbottle of Scotch that his father had given him from the bottom drawer, and then poured four centimetersinto a plastic cup.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had to attend to an even more unpleasant task: what to do about Lieutenant Jaggers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jaggers had exhibited borderline cowardice, insubordination and come within a hairbreadth of attemptedmutiny during the engagement. Keyes could have had him court-martialed. Every reg in the booksscreamed at him to . . . but he didn’t have it in him to send the young man before a board of inquiry. Hewould instead merely transfer the Lieutenant to a place where he would still do the UNSC some good—perhaps a distant outpost.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Was all the blame his? As Commander, it was his responsibility to maintain control, to prevent acrewman from even thinking that mutiny was a possibility.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sighed. Maybe he should have told his crew what he was attempting . . . but there had simply been notime. And certainly, no time for discussion as Jaggers would have wanted. No. The other bridge officershad concerns, but they had followed his orders, as their duty required.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As much as Commander Keyes believed in giving people a second chance, this was where he drew theline.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To make matters worse, transferring Jaggers would leave a hole in the bridge crew.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Commander Keyes accessed the service records ofIroquois ’ junior officers. There were several whomight qualify for navigation officer. He flipped through their files on his data pad, and then paused.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The theoretical paper on mass-space compression was still open, as well as his hastily calculated coursecorrections.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He smiled and archived those notes. He might one day give a lecture on this battle at the Academy. Itwould be useful to have the original source material.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was also the data from theArchimedes Sensor Outpost. That report had been thoroughly made:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e clean data graphs and a navigational course plotted for the object through Slipstream space—not an easytask even with an AI. The report even had tags to route it to the astrophysics section of the UNSC.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thoughtful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked up the service record of the officer who had filed the report: Ensign William Lovell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keyes leaned closer. The boy’s Career Service Vitae was almost twice as long as his own. He hadvolunteered and been accepted at Luna Academy. He transferred in his second year, having alreadyreceived a commission to Ensign for heroism in a training flight that had saved the entire crew. He tookduty on the first outbound corvette headed into battle. Three Bronze Stars, a Silver Cluster, and twoPurple Hearts, and he had catapulted to a full Lieutenant within three years.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then something went terribly wrong. Lovell’s decline in the UNSC had been as rapid as his ascent. Fourreports of insubordination and he was busted to Second Lieutenant and transferred twice. An incidentwith a civilian woman—no details in the files, although Commander Keyes wondered if the girl listed inthe report, Anna Gerov, was Vice Admiral Gerov’s daughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had been reassigned to theArchimedes Sensor Outpost, and had been there for the last year, anunheard of length of time in such a remote facility.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Commander Keyes reviewed the logs when Lovell had been on duty. They were careful and intelligent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So the boy was still sharp . . . was he hiding?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a gentle knock on his door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Lieutenant Dominique, I said I was not to be disturbed.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sorry to intrude, son,” said a muffled voice. The pressure door’s wheel turned and Admiral Stanforthstepped inside. “But I thought I’d just stop by since I was in the neighborhood.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Admiral Stanforth was much smaller in person than he appeared on-screen. His back was stooped overwith age, and his white hair was thinning at the crown. Still, he exuded a reassuring air of authority thatKeyes instantly recognized.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir!” Commander Keyes stood at attention, knocking over his chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “At ease, son.” The Admiral looked around his quarters, and his gaze lingered a moment on the framedcopy of Lagrange’s original manuscript in which he derived his equations of motion. “You can pour mea few fingers of the whiskey, if you can spare it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir.” Keyes fumbled with another plastic cup and poured the Admiral a drink.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Stanforth took a sip, then sighed appreciatively. “Very nice.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keyes righted his chair and offered it to the Admiral.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sat down and leaned forward. “I wanted to congratulate you personally on the miracle you performedhere, Keyes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir, I don’t—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Stanforth held up a finger. “Don’t interrupt me, son. That was a helluva piece of astrogation you pulledoff. People noticed. Not to mention the morale boost it’s given to the entire fleet.” He took another sip ofthe liquor and exhaled. “Now, that’s the reason we’re all here. We need a victory. It’s been too damnlong—us getting whittled to pieces by those alien bastards. So this hasgot to be a win. No matter what ittakes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I understand, sir,” Commander Keyes said. He knew morale had been sagging for years throughout theUNSC. No military, no matter how well trained, could stomach defeat after defeat without it affectingtheir determination in battles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How is it going planetside?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Right now don’t you worry about that.” Admiral Stanforth eased back in his chair, balancing on twolegs. “General Kits has his troops down there. They’ve got the surrounding cities evacuated, and they’llbe assaulting C.te d’Azur within the hour. They’ll paste those aliens faster than you can spit. You justwatch.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Of course, sir.” Commander Keyes looked away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You got something else to say, boy? Spit it out.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, sir . . . this isn’t the way the Covenant normally operates. Dropping an invasion force and leavingthe system? They either slaughter everything or die trying. This is something altogether different.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Admiral Stanforth waved a dismissive hand. “You leave trying to figure out what those aliens arethinking to the spooks in ONI, son. Just get theIroquois patched up and fit for duty again. And you letme know if you need anything.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Stanforth knocked back the last of his whiskey and stood. “Got to marshal the fleet. Oh—” He paused.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “One more thing.” He dug into his jacket pocket and retrieved a tiny cardboard box. He set it on theCommander’s desk. “Consider it official. The paperwork will catch up with us soon enough.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Commander Keyes opened the box. Inside were a pair of brass collar insignia: four bars and a single star.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Congratulations,Captain Keyes.” The Admiral snapped a quick salute, then held out his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keyes managed to grasp and shake the Admiral’s hand. The insignia was real. He was stunned. Hecouldn’t say anything.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’ve earned it.” The Admiral started to turn. “Give me a shout if you need anything.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir.” Keyes stared at the brass star and stripes a moment longer then finally tore his gaze away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Admiral . . . there is one thing. I need a replacement navigation officer.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Admiral Stanforth’s relaxed posture stiffened. “I heard about that. Ugly business when a bridge officerloses their stomach. Well, you just say the candidate’s name and I’ll make sure you get him . . . as longas you’re not pulling him off my ship.” He smiled. “Keep up the good work, Captain.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir!” Captain Keyes saluted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Admiral stepped out and closed the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keyes practically fell into his chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had never dreamed they’d make him a Captain. He turned the brass insignia over in his palm andreplayed his conversation with Admiral Stanforth in his mind. He had said, “Captain Keyes.” Yes. Thiswas real.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Admiral had also brushed aside his concerns about the Covenant too quickly. Something didn’tquite add up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keyes clicked on the intercom. “Lieutenant Dominique: track the Admiral’s shuttle when he leaves. Letme know which ship he’s on.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir? We had an Admiral aboard? I wasn’t informed.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, Lieutenant, I suspect you weren’t. Just track the next outbound shuttle.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keyes looked back on his data pad and reread Ensign Lovell’s CSV. He couldn’t take back what hadhappened with Jaggers—there could be no second chance for him. But maybe he could somehowbalance the books by giving Lovell another chance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He filled out the necessary paperwork for the transfer request. The forms were long and unnecessarilycomplex. He transmitted the files to UNSC PERSCOM and sent a copy directly to Admiral Stanforth’sstaff.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir?” Lieutenant Dominique’s voice broke over the intercom. “That shuttle docked with theLeviathan .”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Put it on-screen.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The screen over his desk snapped on to camera five, the aft-starboard view. Among the dozens of shipsin orbit around Sigma Octanus IV, he easily spotted theLeviathan . She was one of the twenty UNSCcruisers left in the fleet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A cruiser was the most powerful warship ever built by human hands. And Keyes knew they were beingslowly pulled out of forward areas and parked in reserve to guard the Inner Colonies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A piece of shadow moved under the great warship, black moving on black. It revealed itself for only aninstant in the sunlight, then slithered back into the darkness. It was a prowler.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Those stealth ships were used exclusively by Naval Intelligence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A cruiser and an ONI presence here? Now Keyes knew there was more going on here than a simplemorale boost. He tried not to think about it. It was best not to go too far when questioning the intentionsof one’s superior officer—especially when that officer was an Admiral. And especially not when NavalIntelligence was literally lurking in the shadows.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keyes poured himself another three fingers of Scotch, set his head on his desk—just to rest his eyes for amoment. The last few hours had drained him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir.” Dominique’s voice over the intercom woke Captain Keyes. “Incoming fleet-wide transmission onAlpha priority channel.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keyes sat up and ran his hand over his face. He glanced at the brass clock affixed over his bunk—he hadslept for almost six hours.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Admiral Stanforth appeared on-screen. “Listen up, ladies and gentlemen: we’ve just detected a largenumber of Covenant ships massing on the edge of the system. We estimate ten ships.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On-screen the silhouettes of the all-too-familiar Covenant frigates and a destroyer appeared as ghostlyradar smears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We’ll remain where we are,” the Admiral continued. “There’s no need to charge in and have those uglybastards take a shortcut through Slipspace and undercut us. Make your ships ready for battle. We’ve gotprobes gathering more data. I’ll update you when we know more. Stanforth out.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The screen went black.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keyes snapped on the intercom. “Lieutenant Hall, what is our repair and refit status?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir,”she replied.“Engines are operational, but only with the backup coolant system. We can heat themto fifty percent. Archer and nuclear ordnance resupply is complete. MAC guns are also operational.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Repairs to lower decks have just started.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Inform the dockmaster to pull his crew out,” Captain Keyes said. “We’re leaving theCradle . When weare clear, fire the reactors to fifty percent. Go to battle stations.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/975/29431.html","bookId":266,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:12:27 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:12:27 AM"}
