Just as she was about to speak again, an old man with silver hair approached Lin Ming. This old man wore purple robes and his white hair was frizzy like needles that stuck up from his head.

But as he heard Lin Ming’s words, he nearly spat out all the wine in his mouth. In less than two years, Lin Ming had completed 500 Heretical God Symbols as well as casually completing the 500 improved Heavenly Fire Symbols!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen one considered the difficulty and time required to draw up these two divine runic symbols, this was simply… unbelievable!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You…” The silver-haired old man licked his dry lips. “Little friend Lin, since when did you complete the 500 Heavenly Fire Symbols that my Holy Lands purchased?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHe asked this question because he had some slight suspicions that Lin Ming might have completed a portion of the Heavenly Fire symbols before the auction had begun.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, Lin Ming refuted this. He shook his head and said, “It was last year. I first drew up the Heavenly Fire Symbols and after I completed them I began to draw up the Heretical God Symbols. After all, the Heretical God Symbol is a bit more difficult to draw up so it would be easier with the experience of drawing up 500 Heavenly Fire Symbols before that.
