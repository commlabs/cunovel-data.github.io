Leaning against the balustrade, she stared out over Ched Nasad. Her abode was not far from House Melarn, but in that direction, the matron mothers could see very little but thick smoke. Despite the obscuring clouds, the fighting around House Melarn still raged, and the sound of it reached the matron mothers even high on the tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has gotten out of control,\" Umrae D\u0027Dgttu said grimly, standing beside Ssipriina. \"Your agent said nothing of this stone-burning fire when we agreed to this plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Ulviirala Rilynt chimed in, pacing back and forth behind them, her numerous bracelets, rings, and necklaces clanking with each step. \"I dislike the idea of so much destruction, especially right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" Nedylene Zinard scolded, also leaning against the railing very casually but with her back to the unfolding scene of ruin. She seemed more interested in her lacquered fingernails than in the activity around her. \"We knew going into this that we might have to be aggressive. If we are to remake this city to our liking, now is the time to act, and we can let nothing stand in our way. Not the other Houses and not our own misgivings. Sometimes you have to break a few lizard eggs to make an omelet. Sometimes you have to kill a few slaves to win the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" Umrae D\u0027Dgttu said, her whip-thin frame belying her puissance as the most powerful cleric among them, \"but this is unnecessary. You should not have summoned us to install you as a new member of the Council until you eliminatedall of the Menzoberranyr. Allowing that wizard to weave his lies did not help your cause.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShriNeerune Hlaund snorted. \"The wizard\u0027s lies were inconsequential. Ssipriina was a fool to send her mercenaries out so prematurely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not do that!\" Ssipriina retorted. \"Someone else gave them the signal before it was time. I still held out hope that we could resolve the dissolution of House Melarn bloodlessly. These fire pots were not my idea either. The gray dwarves procured them from somewhere else without my knowledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re saying that you don\u0027t even have control over your own House?\" ShriNeerune sneered. \"And you expect us to continue to back you? I should have known better than to support a merchant House.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSsipriina\u0027s fists clenched, and she dearly wanted to strike the dark elf belittling her, but she held them at her sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be careful, if I were you,\" she snapped, staring coldly at the offending drow. \"I\u0027m still the one those grays answer to, and right now, we\u0027re winning. You could find yourself on the other side of the battle very quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough,\" Umrae said, stepping between the two of them. \"What\u0027s done is done. Now is the time to fight, not argue. Ssipriina, did you bring it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSsipriina kept her stare steadily on ShriNeerune\u0027s face for a moment longer, her eyes narrow in anger, but then she turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course,\" she answered. \"I have it right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s do this,\" the thin matron mother said, motioning for the five of them to gather together. \"It\u0027s time to claim our legacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSsipriina nodded and produced a small bundle wrapped in black silk. Undoing the covering, she revealed a crystalline statue of a spider, as black as darkness itself, broken into several pieces. The head and the abdomen were separated, as were two sets of four legs, one for each side of the figurine. The five matron mothers gathered around as Ssipriina held the cloth in the palms of her hands, the collection of parts sitting atop it, stretching her arms out for them to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has been many years,\" Nedylene said, reaching out with her lacquered nails and lifting one set of legs to examine them. \"The city will tremble before our might. Let us begin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold them steady, Ssipriina,\" Umrae warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took hold of the abdomen of the statue. One by one, the other three matron mothers each took up a part. They looked from one to another, and finally, when Umrae nodded, they fitted the pieces together, making the figurine whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quickly, now!\" Umrae hissed, and Ssipriina wasted no time re-wrapping the completed statue in the cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready, the matron mothers could see that the bundle was squirming, growing larger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry!\" ShriNeerune hissed. \"Throw it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSsipriina did. She reached back and hurled the bundle out into the void, as hard as she could, and as one the five matron mothers watched the wiggling cloth tumble away from House Zauvirr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cloth fell away, and the assembled drow gasped as one. The statue had transformed into a living thing, a spider as black as the crystal it was born from, and it was growing rapidly in size. In the blink of an eye, it was the size of a rothe, and as it disappeared past the side of the web street it was still growing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSsipriina watched, awed, as the creature shot forth a string of webbing at the street, attaching a line to anchor itself as it fell. Then it was gone, vanished from their vantage point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five dark elves waited breathlessly, hoping to catch another glimpse of the thing they had created. The strand of webbing had jerked taut and visibly vibrated as it dropped straight down. Obviously, the spider was still attached to it. For a moment, there was nothing to see, though allfive matron mothers strained to do so, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the first black leg stabbed into view, feeling for a foothold on the web street, Ssipriina felt her heart skip a beat. The appendage was longer than she was tall. Slowly, delicately, the spider lifted itself into view, and all five matron mothers took an involuntary step back from the balustrade, even though their creation was dozens of yards away from them. It was as large as the street was wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the Dark Mother,\" someone breathed. \"It\u0027s magnificent!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant spider righted itself atop the street, and Ssipriina could hear the screams of those below, screams of terror as the spider was spotted. It began to scurry in the other direction, toward the masses of soldiers still fighting several streets away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the Abyss,\" Umrae groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What is it?\" Nedylene asked, worry in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no link,\" Umrae replied, her eyes closed in concentration. \"I can\u0027t control it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra could feel her sense of impending dread growing. While House Melarn had not collapsed all together, as she had so direly predicted back in her rooms, it had certainly shaken violently more than once, and to her senses, familiar with every hallway, chamber, and nuance of the dwelling, it seemed to lean very slightly to one side. As impossible to fathom as the idea was, Halisstra wondered if the place was still stable. She wanted desperately to get outside and see for herself just what was happening in the city. The drow couldn\u0027t imagine violence so potent as to be able to physically disturb House Melarn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark elf priestess was leading the others toward her mother\u0027s chambers, where she was certain Quenthel\u0027s personal belongings had been taken after the Mistress of the Academy had been imprisoned. Though she would have some competition from Aunrae Nasadra, Ssipriina Zauvirr would certainly claim much of House Melarn\u0027s bounty for herself, including the high priestess\u0027s personal items, to keep as trophies of her affront to the city of Menzoberranzan, if nothing else. It remained to be seen if everything Quenthel Baenre had in her possession upon arrival in the city was still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more she thought about the actions of Ssipriina and the other matron mothers, the more incensed Halisstra grew. Beyond the consequences of turning on House Melarn, they were potentially offending the most powerful House in Menzoberranzan. Plus, the course of action they had taken seemed to Halisstra to be a symbolic thumbing of the nose at the very idea of eventrying to discover what was going on with Lolth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least Quenthel and the others are trying to figure something out, she\u0027d told herself more than once since her entanglement with them. Lolth might value devotion, but Halisstra didn\u0027t believe the goddess expected her servants to sit back and wait for her to come save them, even if they showed overzealous dedication or sacrificed a thousand gray dwarves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruthfully, Halisstra had found herself wondering just what Lolth wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra passed through a large intersection and turned down a new pathway, one even more lavishly decorated, if that were possible, with plush carpeting, murals, and images of House Melarn triumphs. They were entering Drisinil\u0027s personal quarters, and Halisstra was fearful that a large contingent of House Zauvirr guards would be posted to protect the chambers, insurrection outside or not. The dark elf\u0027s concerns were well founded, for as she rounded a corner, she spotted a squadron of troops milling about, blocking access to the door beyond, which led into Drisinil\u0027s private residence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing down here?\" Halisstra demanded, hoping to throw the soldiers off-balance with her commanding tone. \"You are needed on the parapets at once!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" the sergeant said, eyeing the motley group following the First Daughter as he raised his sword and pointed it at her. \"We received word that the traitor had escaped, and now you appear right here, conveniently for us. I\u0027m afraid we have orders to kill you and anyone aiding you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers fanned out, brandishing their weapons as they advanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra\u0027s first instinct was to bring her mace up to defend herself, but her hand was empty, for Quenthel had not yet permittedher to rearm herself. Danifae, who was at Halisstra\u0027s side, was no longer bound, but she had no weapon, either. Danifae did, however, carry a small knapsack with some of their other belongings. Quenthel had agreed to let them stop at Halisstra\u0027s chambers and pack a few things before departing, for if the House continued to thrash about like it had, there was no telling when they might have to evacuate, and there would be no better chance later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of her eye, Halisstra saw her attendant falter a step, too, but before the soldiers could close the gap, a blur of yellowish-white fur flashed between the two drow, slamming into the front rank of troops with a deep, unsettling snarl and a whirl of arms and claws. There was a sickening sound of rending flesh before Halisstra realized that the draegloth, Quenthel\u0027s personal bodyguard, was the source of the carnage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra\u0027s gasp of surprise came only after three of the soldiers, including the sergeant, went down screaming before the onslaught of the creature, their bodies horribly mangled and their blood splattered everywhere. Several other soldiers began to surround the draegloth, trying to stay clear of the fiend\u0027s savage claws, but at the same time looking for ways to press the attack. Jeggred crouched, watching his multiple foes as they swarmed around him, lashing out with their swords but unwilling to get in close enough to do any good. A handful were already backing out of the fray, producing hand crossbows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother figure darted past Halisstra, and a third, and she settled back against the wall as Ryld and Valas entered the fight. The larger of the two, whom she had found striking when they first came face to face, was wielding his greatsword in a manner she found comforting. The blade seemed light and easy in his hands as he carved half the face off of one soldier and spun to swipe through the midsection of a second enemy in the same motion. The diminutive one, on the other hand, seemed content to slink up behind one of the drow soldiers still trying to find an opening inside Jeggred\u0027s deadly reach. The guard never heard or felt Valas coming, and when the scout plantedhis kukri into the small of the soldiers back, a flash of energy accompanied the stroke. The soldier arched his back in agony and crumpled to the ground as Valas pulled his blade free and stepped aside, disappearing into the shadows again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of the way, foolish girl, and let them do their work,\" Quenthel snapped at Halisstra from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe daughter of House Melarn glanced back over her shoulder to where the high priestess was standing. She saw the wizard producing some odd ingredient or another, which she knew meant he was preparing to fling a spell. In front of him, a rapier seemed to dance of its own accord in the air, as though it was defending him from any foes who might try to get close to him. She pressed herself against the wall to allow him ample room then sidestepped her way back to where Quenthel waited. On the opposite side of the passage, Danifae was doing the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No sense getting in the thick of things when they\u0027re more than capable of handling it themselves,\" Quenthel explained, scowling. \"At least they\u0027re good for that, if nothing else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra wanted desperately to ask the other drow how she tolerated such insubordination from the three of them, especially the wizard, Pharaun, but she thought it best to keep her mouth shut and stay in the high priestess\u0027s good graces. It might be a long while before Quenthel trusted her, and she didn\u0027t want to do anything to jeopardize that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hissing sound accompanied a long, thin sliver of ice that shot from Pharaun\u0027s fingertips and streaked straight at one of the soldiers, embedding itself in the back of the drow\u0027s shoulder like a deadly icicle. The soldier cried out in pain and stumbled backward, but too late. Jeggred, seeing his foe\u0027s attention diverted, darted in and slashed with his massive claws, ripping through the muscle wall of the guard\u0027s abdomen and smiling delightedly as entrails began to tumble out. The force of the blow was so strong that it spun the dark elf around. With a sickeningplop,the soldier fell onto his back, gazing sightlessly toward Halisstra while the contents of his body leaked out around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold!\" a voice shouted from behind Quenthel. Halisstra turned, along with the high priestess, to see a whole new force of soldiers, who had approached from the direction Halisstra and the others had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wizard, do something!\" Quenthel ordered, stepping back as the new soldiers slipped their weapons from sheaths and trotted forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun spun around, and seeing the new threat, he stabbed a hand inside hispiwafwi and produced several small items. His dancing rapier swung around and darted forward, bobbing and weaving through the air in an attempt to hold the new squad, which was even larger in size than the first one, at bay. At the same time, Halisstra heard the wizard utter some word or phrase under his breath. Though she didn\u0027t understand his speech, the effect was immediate and impressive. A blinding streak of lightning shot forward from the wizard\u0027s fingertips and struck the closest soldier squarely in the chest. Immediately afterward, several fingers of the same bolt crackled again, fanning outward from its first victim to strike the rest of the dark elves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra cried out in pain and flung her arm up to shield her eyes from the flaring light of the bolt, cowering against the wall and cursing the wizard for blinding her and making her vulnerable to the soldiers\u0027 attacks. Her vision swam for several moments with the afterimage as she groped along the wall, trying to listen for the sound of imminent attack, but nothing came. Ahead, she heard one last gasp as someone was wounded, and the sounds of battle faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her vision finally cleared, she saw Danifae and Quenthel looking as dazed as she felt. Pharaun appeared proud of himself, and the entire host of House Zauvirr soldiers lay on the ground to either side of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you, Pharaun,\" Quenthel snarled, her hands on her hips as she glared at the wizard, who was a few inches shorter than the high priestess. \"You warn me next time you intend to cast a spell like that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun bowed, and Halisstra wasn\u0027t sure if it was meant to be mocking or not, but he said, \"My apologies. There wasn\u0027t time to warn anyone. They would have been upon us if I hadn\u0027t acted as swiftly as I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel sniffed, apparently not completely satisfied with his explanation, but she said nothing else. After a moment, Halisstra realized that the Mistress of the Academy was looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Quenthel said, \"Lead on. I don\u0027t want another horde of Ssipriina\u0027s lackeys finding us still standing around their comrades\u0027 corpses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra nodded curtly and turned toward the door. She was careful not to stare overly longat any of the bodies of the soldiers Jeggred had dispatched. She reached the door and waved her brooch in front of it, allowing the magic to do its work and unlock the portal. The priestess stepped inside and beckoned the others to follow her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interior of her mother\u0027s chambers was gaudy and out of style for Halisstra\u0027s tastes, but she paid the decorations no mind. As the rest of the group filed inside, she gestured toward the rest of the room and the different doorways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mistress Baenre\u0027s things are here somewhere,\" Halisstra said. \"If we spread out, we can find them more quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to punctuate the need for urgency, another rumbling vibration bounced through the House, and Halisstra thought she heard the fracturing of solid rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind that,\" Quenthel said brusquely. \"They\u0027re in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed through one of the doorways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the bedrooms,\" Halisstra said, slightly puzzled at how the high priestess would know they were in there. \"Come on,\" she said, and the entire group followed her into the interior chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oversized bed sat to one side, a huge, round affair that could accommodate five or six drow and probably had on more than one occasion, Halisstra supposed. In addition to that, there were a number of couches, chests, dressers, and tables for furniture, and rich tapestries covered every square foot of the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel trudged across the room to a point between two tall armoires, where a tapestry woven of black fabric glowed in phosphorescent hues of green, purple, and yellow with an image of a drow priestess. Halisstra knew it was supposed to be her grandmother, and she wondered why Drisinil had kept it. Halisstra certainly didn\u0027t intend to keep anything to remind her of her own mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" Quenthel said. \"Everything\u0027s behind here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well don\u0027t touch it, yet,\" Pharaun admonished, striding up beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied the tapestry for a moment then nodded to himself as though satisfied. He took hold of a corner of the weaving and yanked it off the wall. Behind it was only bare stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel\u0027s scowl deepened, but the wizard simply produced a wand from inside the folds of hispiwafwi, waved it about, and uttered an arcane phrase. He pocketed the magical device and went back to studying the space as the others gathered around. Danifae stood near Halisstra, and the priestess felt her attendant press something against her hand. Looking down, Halisstra saw that the battle captive had procured a pair of daggers and was handing one to her, on the sly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, you clever girl, Halisstra thought. She quickly palmed the weapon and tucked it into the folds of her piwafwi,out of sight. Then she returned her attention to what the wizard was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course,\" Pharaun said, as though he had recognized something that should have been obvious to him. \"All right everyone, step back. I can disarm the protective wards and sigils that are here, but I cannot deal with the more mechanical trap that I suspect is also present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right,\" Valas said. \"If you can remove all of the magical protections, I might be able to manage the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun nodded and began to gesture and mutter, finally pointing toward the space between the two tall armoires with a flourish. Halisstra supposed the wizard must have some ability to sense the presence of various spells, wards, and charms, for she could not see what he was working on and had never known of a secret portal anywhere in her mother\u0027s rooms. Pharaun gazed at the wall a moment longer after he was finished with his casting then nodded for the scout to give it a try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValas moved up closely to the wall and began to inspect it little by little, inch by inch. Halisstra wanted to get inclose beside him, to see what he was looking at, but she dared not disturb his concentration. At that moment, yet another in the series of rumbles shook the room, and Halisstra nearly lost her footing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the Abyss!\" Valas yelled, waving his arms in an effort to avoid falling against the wall. \"This is no good. I can\u0027t do this with all of the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scout\u0027s words were cut off as the whole room suddenly lurched and began to tilt. Halisstra fell to the floor as the chamber was no longer level but instead tipped to one side, away from the wall they had been inspecting. She realized she was screaming as she rolled along the floor. The movement stopped, but all through the House she could hear the horrendous sound of fracturing rock, loud popping noises that sounded as if the whole world was snapping apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve no time! We\u0027ve got to get out now!\" Halisstra heard one of the males yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not without my possessions,\" Quenthel insisted, sitting up and trying to stand on the yawing floor. \"Get that door open - now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun, who had actually begun to levitate to avoid falling down, nodded as the others left their feet - all except Valas, who seemed perfectly capable of maintaining his balance despite the tilt of the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard removed a soft glove from inside hispiwafwi . He donned it and began casting again as the floor made several popping sounds and began to tilt even more. A massive, glowing fist appeared, twice as tall as Pharaun, floating in the air in front of the mage. Pharaun guided the magical conjuration with his own gloved hand, turning it so that the knuckles were aimed at the point on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get back!\" Pharaun yelled. \"I don\u0027t know what kind of backlash this will create.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more popping from the structure of the House - closer, the sounds deafening - and Halisstra found she had her hands over her ears. Her heart was pounding in her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re going to die in here, she thought. The whole house is falling apart, and we\u0027re going to be crushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magical fist lurched forward and slammed into the wall between the armoires, smacking against the stone with a powerful crunch. The wall cracked in several places. Pharaun directed the fist to back up and go again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel was beside Halisstra, grabbing her by the arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he gets that wall down,\" the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith said, \"we will need to hurry. What\u0027s the fastest way out of here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra looked at the other drow helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in the very heart of the House,\" she answered. \"The most protected point. It\u0027ll take us forever to get out, no matter which way we go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel scowled, but then she nodded and moved away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant fist had slammed into the wall two or three more times, and the wall was about to collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more blow should do it, Halisstra thought as she felt the concussions of more cracking and breaking beyond the room. If it\u0027s not too late already, she added to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround Halisstra, the others were wide-eyed, trying to maintain their balance and eyeing the walls, ceiling, and floor warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next slam of the fist finally did the section of wall in, and it collapsed in a pile of rubble. Behind it, a small chamber sat dark and dusty, filled with shelves containing a number of items Halisstra had never seen before. Quenthel pushed ahead of everyone else and strode - or rather hiked, for it was like walking up a hillside - into the chamber, snatching up a five-headed snake whip with a gleam in her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" was all she said as she held the weapon aloft, the five vipers hissing and writhing joyously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly, Quenthel gathered up several other items that obviously belonged to her then eyed the other things displayed on the shelves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No time,\" Pharaun insisted. \"We leave now!\" Turning to Halisstra, the wizard demanded, \"Which way is out? Get us there, before the whole place falls!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra shook her head miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re as far away from the exits as we can be!\" she shouted over the cacophony of popping, shattering stone. The room lurched again. \"There\u0027s no close way out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll make one,\" Pharaun shouted. \"Which direction is closest to the outside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of the ceiling on the far side of the room collapsed, sending a shower of stone fragments and dust into Halisstra\u0027s face. She covered her nose and mouth with one hand as she flung her arm up to shield her eyes from the stinging shards of rock that pelted her. She couldn\u0027t think. She was going to die. There was no way out, no escape - and no Lolth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra felt the wizard\u0027s hands grasp her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me,\" he shouted, \"which way is the closest way to the outside, regardless of walls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra shook her head, trying to focus despite the panic rising in her chest. She spied Danifae clinging to Quenthel as both of them held on to the edge of the broken wall leading into the secret room. Jeggred had his claws embedded in the rock of the floor and was clambering along it toward his mistress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closest outside wall . . . which way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn image appeared in her head, a mental map, and she knew that her mother\u0027s chambers backed up nearly to an outside wall, which meant that the secret room Pharaun and Quenthel had discovered was very close to the outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrantically, Halisstra pointed to the hidden room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That way!\" she yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun nodded. Scrambling on his hands and knees, the wizard headed in that direction, almost slipping and sliding back the other way as the room tilted again. Halisstra began to slide along the floor, herself and decided against trying to stop, instead bracing her feet against the far, lowest wall. She craned her neck around to watch the mage as he began yet another spell. He seemed to have an endless supply of them. He dug in hispiwafwiand pulled out something too small for Halisstra to see, then he began to gesticulate wildly in the direction of the wall at the back of the secret closet. Before her eyes, a tunnel formed right into the rock itself, and after about fifteen feet, it broke through into space beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" Pharaun shouted to everyone as the whole House seemed to be one solid rumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise of the cracking stone was deafening, and Halisstra had barely been able to hear the wizard. The room tilted over even more sharply, and Halisstra realized that it was nearly sideways, with the new opening to the outside almost over her head. She began to float, lifting herself magically toward the impromptu exit, as the other members of the group did the same. As she reached the top and was about to pass through into the open air of the city beyond, she saw that Jeggred had a hold of Valas. The draegloth lifted effortlessly toward the hole, and it was at that moment that Halisstra remembered that Danifae could not levitate either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe House Melarn daughter looked down desperately and saw her attendant, crouched in the low corner of the room, near the collapsed ceiling, scrambling to stay atop the shifting pile of rock as the room continued to tip over. Danifae\u0027s eyes were blazing with fury as she gazed angrily up toward where everyone else was escaping the collapsing dwelling. There was another excruciatingly loud snapping sound as more stone buckled and popped, and Danifae, still inside the destroyed remains of House Melarn, was falling away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhorrl Xornbane was bloody and exhausted. His clan, gathered all around him, looked that way too. He had no idea how long they\u0027d been fighting, but it was too long. They needed rest and water. They couldn\u0027t keep this up for much longer. Unfortunately, the captain of Clan Xornbane feared that the day would grow much worse before it got better. He hoped he was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhorrl had already passed the word that his troops were to abandon their positions defending House Melarn. They had been besieged there for so long andhad used up so many of their firepots that he feared the place was growing unstable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not going to lose my boys that way, he told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remains of his forces were reforming on the opposite side of the plaza from the House, and for the moment they were being left alone. It was hard to be sure how long that peace would, last, though, because none of them could see very far in the thick smoke of the burning stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Khorrl and his duergar could see told the tale clearly enough, though. The plaza was covered with the bodies of goblinsand kobolds. Littered in between them were slightly fewer drow, though the number of dead dark elves surprised, him. More dead gray dwarves than Khorrl would have liked were scattered here and there, too. It had been a hellish day, and it was far from over, the captain feared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir,\" one of his aides said, running up to Khorrl, \"we\u0027ve completely abandoned the estate. The last of the troops have formed a line from that corner - \" the young gray dwarf pointed through the smoke toward the edge of a dwelling behind them - \"across to the flank of our main position, there.\" He swung his arm acrossto the far right side of the plaza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Khorrl replied, visualizing the battlefield in his mind, since he could no longer clearly see it with his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also,\" the aide continued, \"there\u0027s another force of drow coming toward us, from that direction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed off to the left, where the plaza was joined by a large web street. It was, regrettably, the weakest point ofClan Xornbane\u0027s defenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friend or foe? Did you get a look at their House insignias?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aide shrugged and said, \"Not in this smoke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhorrl sighed. He would have to send scouts out to reconnoiter the new troops. He said as much to the aide, who saluted him and started to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" the captain said, and the aide stopped attentively. \u0027Get some boys up there - \" Khorrl pointed toward the street one level above where they were currently positioned - \"I don\u0027t want another swarm of those damned dark elves dropping in on us like they did earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" the aide replied, and hurried off to execute his captain\u0027s commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhorrl sighed again and turned to call for water. From behind him there was a loud popping sound, a sound he knew too well - splintering stone. He spun back around and peered through the gloom of smoke in the direction from which it had come. All up and down the lines that protected the clan\u0027s position, the word was spreading, and it reached Khorrl quickly enough. House Melarn was burning to oblivion, and it was about to go over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhorrl shook his head, knowing what was about to happen. He hoped his aide was right and hoped that all his boys had gotten out of there. He lamented the ones who couldn\u0027t, for whatever reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe popping started again, and grew louder and more steady. He could feel the vibrations in the stone beneath his feet. He almost wished he could see it, butin a way, he didn\u0027t. It was going to be a deathtrap for anyone still inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snapping, splintering sound of stone reached a crescendo, and there was one final explosion, a tremor that shook the entire street enough that Khorrl had to brace himself with his axe. There was a jerk, and the rumbling ceased. Khorrl knew the whole building had gone over the side, tumbling into the void.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few seconds later, there was a horrendous crash from below. House Melarn had struck something. A heartbeat later, he felt the vibrations of the impact. It was subtle, but for that sort of vibration to travel through a web street and into the walls of the huge cavern, and back along the other web streets, the initial impact must have been devastating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might take out several more streets, the duergar mused grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the aide again, rushing up to his captain, his look wide-eyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Khorrl demanded, wondering what would so shake up the lad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A spider! A huge one, as big as a house! It\u0027s coming this way!\" Khorrl groaned, realizing just how much worse things had gotten. He hated being right. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurrection-war-of-the-spider-queen-2/page-15.html","bookId":2160,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:53 PM"}
