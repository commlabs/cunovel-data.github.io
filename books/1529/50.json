Upon the spit of land rested the remains of the old castle. It had once been separated from the ancient city by a wide moat, but it was now silted up, marked only by a sunken line drawn from east to west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the plane crossed over the ruins, Seichan studied their target. The massive fort was surrounded by tall seawalls, but the western side had long ago lost its battle with those seas, undermined and toppled by battering waves. The eastern side, sheltered by a gentle bay, had fared better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane angled for a landing in this bay, diving low, then skimming the water. Seichan caught a glimpse of rusty iron cannons on the roof of the fort, and six more on the beach of the bay, now used as mooring ties for boats. In fact, a small tin boat was tied up to one. A small brown figure, naked except for a long pair of shorts, waved an arm at their approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan expected that the young man was the guide she had ordered up from the village. With only two hours to spare, they needed someone who knew the castle grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seaplane coasted down to the water, spraying a fierce wash behind as the flying boat settled to the sheltered waters. Seichan was shoved forward in her seat belt, earning a twinge of complaint from her wounded side. She had checked the injury earlier, in the airport\u0027s bathroom. The bandages were damp with some leakage, but more pink than red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot guided his ship around as the tin boat sped at them, bouncing through the plane\u0027s wake. Their guide sat in the rear, a hand on the rudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few moments later, the hatches were opened, and the party climbed from plane to skiff. Their guide ended up being a boy of twelve or thirteen, all rib bones and smiles. And plainly he wanted to practice his English, as fractured as it might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good chaps, fine lady, welcoming to Hormuz! I am named Fee\u0027az!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray helped Seichan into the boat, cocking one eyebrow. \"This is your experienced guide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you\u0027re willing to melt down one of those gold passports, that\u0027s the best money can buy here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she had already spent top dollar to get them here so quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched Gray settle to a seat. His eyes were already studying the castle. She noted the worry in the hunch of his shoulders. In profile, his features were hard, all angles, from chin to cheekbones. But he was mortally torn, broken and weakened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver his mother and father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a slight dismissive shake of her head, Seichan turned away. She could not even remember her parents. Only one memory existed: of a woman being dragged through a door, weeping, reaching for her, then gone. She wasn\u0027t even sure it was her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFee\u0027az whined up the small outboard and sputtered toward the palm-lined beach and the towering ruins of the castle. Kowalski trailed a hand in the water, yawning. Vigor stared over toward the village. Some celebration was under way, with music wafting over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray glanced back at her. He wore a familiar expression, both eyebrows high, that asked, Are you ready?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Gray turned back, he shook out of his light jacket. The sunlight blazed down. He wore only a khaki T-shirt. She noted a flash of sunlight at his collar. His right hand absently tucked back the bright bit of silver under his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dragon charm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had given it to. him mostly as a teasing joke from a past cooperation. But Gray had kept it and still wore it. Why? It made her feel inexplicably warm—not so much from affection as a mix of confusion and embarrassment. Did Gray think she had given the charm as some token, some sign of attraction? She should have been amused, but for some reason it just irritated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat\u0027s bow scraped against the sand, jarring her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d reached the shore and began unloading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan tossed Kowalski a satchel that contained additional gear, including a laptop computer, several more flash-bang grenades, six boxes of ammunition for the four pistols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray held out a hand to help her out of the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brushed him aside and hopped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFee\u0027az tied up the boat to one of the rusty cannons and waved them toward a square opening in the fort\u0027s walls. Higher up, narrow casements pierced the ramparts, where once Portuguese gunmen had defended the bastion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group passed under the wall and into the abandoned stone courtyard. Thorny weeds grew from cracks, a few steps away a large open cistern threatened a nasty fall, and a couple of scraggly date palms sprouted from an old garden patch. Everywhere else, loose sand whispered across the rock with the hissing voices of ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFee\u0027az lifted an arm toward the main bulk of the castle. It climbed in six stories to toothed ramparts, where the rusted tips of cannons still protruded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1 will show you all!\" Fee\u0027az declared. \"Much to watch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to set off, but Vigor touched the boy\u0027s shoulder. \"Does the castle have a chapel?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy frowned for a moment, then brightened again with his perpetual smile. \"Chappie! You are thirsty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor smiled. \"No. A church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy\u0027s brow pinched, but his smile refused to fade. \"Ah, you are Christian. That\u0027s okay. All good. Muslims like the Bible. It\u0027s a holy book, too. We have saints, too. Muslim saints. But the Prophet Mohammed is best.\" He shrugged sheepishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor squeezed his shoulder, recognizing the boy was struggling between being a good tourist guide and being a good Muslim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The church?\" he asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy nodded vigorously. \"The room of the crosses.\" He led them toward the dark opening, still babbling in a furious stream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski shook his head at the boy\u0027s antics and set off after them. \"He needs to cut caffeine out of his life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray smiled, a rarity, sunshine through thunderclouds. \"Let\u0027s go,\" he whispered to Seichan as he passed. He brushed close. His hand grazed hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost reflexively grabbed it. Instead, angry at herself, she clenched her fingers. But her reaction wasn\u0027t all fury or frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was guilt, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hated lying to this man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:18 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, this is going to be a pain in the ass,\" Kowalski said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray did not argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chapel rested on the first floor of the castle, all the way to the rear. After passing through the entrance hall, they had needed flashlights to traverse the low, back passages. It grew quieter the deeper they traveled. The air went still. The only movement was from a few nesting rats, scurrying from the beams of their lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall had ended at a low door, requiring not just ducking one\u0027s head, but also bowing at the waist. Vigor had been the first to enter the room with their guide. A small gasp escaped him as he straightened inside. Gray had followed next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood now, splashing his beam around the dark chapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCut high into the far wall, a cross-shaped window allowed in some sunlight, but not much. The window was no more than a pair of crossed slits, certainly too narrow to squeeze through, but maybe another place from which to defend the castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe window cast a cross of sunlight across a waist-high slab of stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chapel\u0027s altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was otherwise empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not unadorned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross every surface—walls, floor, roof, even the altar—crosses had been carved into the stone. Hundreds, if not thousands of them. They varied from ones no larger than a thumbprint to ornate, life-size giants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No wonder they call it the room of crosses,\" Vigor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, real serial-killer chic,\" Kowalski commented sourly. \"Must be all that island inbreeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray studied the expanse of crosses, remembering the faint cross inscribed into the marble tile in Hagia Sophia. He pulled out the silver cross, Friar Agreer\u0027s crucifix. \"Now all we have to do is find the one that matches this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stepped over and asked Fee\u0027az to leave them alone here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed confused until the monsignor pointed to the cross in Gray\u0027s fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must pray,\" the monsignor explained. \"We will come out when we are done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy quickly stepped away, nodding. He could not dart out quick enough, plainly fearful of being caught while a Christian ceremony was performed. From his speed, he must suspect they\u0027d be sacrificing babies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce they were alone, Gray scratched his head, momentarily daunted, too conscious of the press of time. \"One of these crosses must be an exact match to Friar Agreer\u0027s crucifix. We must find which one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe split the party up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour of them, four walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that still left floor and ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray placed the cross on the altar, readily available for each person to grab and compare. He also ripped four pages out of his notebook and traced the cross\u0027s shape, crib sheets for each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they all searched, Gray noted the shift of the sunlight across the altar, creeping steadily as the sun set, as time escaped him. He finished his wall. Nothing. Sweat poured; his clothes clung to his skin. He started on the floor. The others, one at a time, joined him. Seichan worked on the altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most important cross—the one formed of sunshine—continued to inch inexorably across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on the floor either,\" Vigor said, red-faced, straightening from his knees. He stood, one hand supporting his lower back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the altar, Seichan shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo luck either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray stared up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roof was low, but not low enough to touch. It would require much lifting to test every cross up there that might be the right size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I was wrong,\" Vigor said. \"Maybe Kokejin\u0027s tomb is somewhere else in the castle. All these crosses may be a false lead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray shook his head. No. They had lost a full hour already. They didn\u0027t have time to search every nook and cranny of the castle by hand. They had committed to the chapel. There was no turning back, no second-guessing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-50.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
