the same with too little law.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;One seeks a balance.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We are like the balancing force among the Gowachin:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;without hope of achieving heaven in the society of mortals, we seek the unattainable.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Each agent knows his own conscience and why he serves such a master.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That is the key to us.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We serve a mortal conscience for immortal reasons.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We do it without hope of praise or the sureness of success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The early writings of Bildoon, PanSpechi Chief of BuSab\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved out onto the streets as soon as the afternoon shadows gloomed the depths of the city, Tria and six carefully chosen companions, all of them young Human males.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She\u0027d musked herself to key them up and she led them down dim byways where Broey\u0027s spies had been eliminated.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;All of her troop was armored and armed in the fashion of an ordinary sortie team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027d been rioting nearby an hour earlier, not sufficiently disruptive to attract large military attention, but a small Gowachin salient had been eliminated from a Human enclave.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A sortie team was the kind of thing this Warren could expect after such a specific species adjustment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Tria and her six companions were not likely to suffer attack.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;None of the rioters wanted a large-scale mopping up in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA kind of hushed, suspenseful waiting pervaded the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crossed a wet intersection, green and red ichor in the gutters.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The smell of the dampness told her that a Graluz had been broached and its waters freed to wash through the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would attract retaliation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Some Human children were certain to be killed in the days ahead.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;An old pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe troop crossed the riot area presently, noting the places where bodies had fallen, estimating casualties.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;All bodies had been removed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Not a scrap remained for the birds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey emerged from the Warrens soon afterward, passing through a Gowachin-guarded gate, Broey\u0027s people.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A few blocks along they went through another gate, Human guards, all in Gar\u0027s pay.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey would learn of her presence here soon, Tria knew, but she\u0027d said she was going into the Warrens.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She came presently to an alleyway across from a Second Rank building.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The windowless grey of the building\u0027s lower floors presented a blank face broken only by the lattice armor of the entrance gate.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Behind the gate lay a dimly lighted passage.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Its deceptively plain walls concealed spy devices and automatic weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding back her companions with a hand motion, Tria waited in the dark while she studied the building entrance across from her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The gate was on a simple latch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was one doorguard in an alcove on the left near the door which was dimly visible beyond the armorwork of the gate.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A building defense force stood ready to come at the doorguard\u0027s summons or at the summons of those who watched through the spy devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTria\u0027s informants said this was Jedrik\u0027s bolt hole.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Not in the deep Warrens at all.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Clever.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But Tria had maintained an agent in this building for years, as she kept agents in many buildings.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A conventional precaution.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Everything depended on timing now.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Her agent in the building was poised to eliminate the inner guards at the spy device station.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Only the doorguard would remain.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Tria waited for the agreed upon moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe street around her smelled of sewage:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;an open reclamation line.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Accident?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Riot damage?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Tria didn\u0027t like the feeling of this place.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What was Jedrik\u0027s game?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Were there unknown surprises built into this guarded building?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Jedrik must know by now that she was suspected of inciting the riot - and of other matters.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But would she feel safe there in her own enclave?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;People tended to feel safe among their own people.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She couldn\u0027t have a very large force around her, though.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Still, some private plot worked itself through the devious pathways of Jedrik\u0027s mind, and Tria had not yet fathomed all of that plot.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There were surface indicators enough to risk a confrontation, a parley.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was possible that Jedrik flaunted herself here to attract Tria.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The potential in that possibility filled Tria with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, we\u0027d be unbeatable!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Jedrik fitted the image of a superb agent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;With the proper organization around her . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, Tria glanced left and right.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The streets were appropriately empty.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She checked the time.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Her moment had come.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;With hand motions, she sent flankers out left and right and another young male probing straight across the street to the gate.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;When they were in place, she slipped across with her three remaining companions in a triangular shield ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorguard was a Human with grey hair and a pale face which glistened yellow in the dim light of the passage.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His lids were heavy with a recent dose of his personal drug, which Tria\u0027s agent had supplied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTria opened the gate, saw that the guard carried a round dead-man switch in his right hand as expected.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His grin was gap toothed as he held the switch toward her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She knew he\u0027d recognized her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Much depended now on her agent\u0027s accuracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to die for the frogs?\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Tria asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew about the rioting, the trouble in the streets.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And he was Human, with Human loyalties, but he knew she worked for Broey, a Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The question was precisely calculated to fill him with indecision.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Was she a turncoat?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He had his Human loyalties and a fanatic\u0027s dependence upon this guard post which kept him out of the depths.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And there was his personal addiction.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;All doorguards were addicted to something, but this one took a drug which dulled his senses and made it difficult for him to correlate several lines of thought.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He wasn\u0027t supposed to use his drug on duty and this troubled him now.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There were so many matters to be judged, and Tria had asked the right question.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He didn\u0027t want to die for the frogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed to the dead-man switch, a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only a signal relay,\" he said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"No bomb in this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remained silent, forcing him to focus on his doubts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard swallowed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"What do you . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Join us or die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peered past her at the others.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Things such as this happened frequently in the Warrens, not very often here on the slopes which led up to the heights.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The guard was not a one trusted with full knowledge of whom he guarded.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He had explicit instructions and a dead-man relay to warn of intruders.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Others were charged with making the more subtle distinctions, the real decisions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That was this building\u0027s weak point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Join who?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was false belligerency in his voice, and she knew she had him then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your own kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis locked his drug-dulled mind onto its primary fears.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He knew what he was supposed to do:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;open his hand.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That released the alarm device in the dead-man switch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He could do this of his own volition and it was supposed to deter attackers from killing him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A dead man\u0027s hand opened anyway.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But he\u0027d been fed with suspicions to increase his doubts.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The device in his hand might not be a simple signal transmitter.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What if it actually were a bomb?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He\u0027d had many long hours to wonder about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll treat you well,\" Tria said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put a companionable arm around his shoulder, letting him get the full effect of her musk while she held out her other hand to show that it carried no weapon.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Demonstrate to my companion here how you pass that to your relief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the young males stepped forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard showed how it was done, explaining slowly as he passed the device.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"It\u0027s easy once you get the trick of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her companion had the thing firmly in hand, she raised her arm from the guard\u0027s shoulder, touched his carotid artery with a poisoned needle concealed in a fingernail.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The guard had only time to draw one gasping breath, his eyes gaping, before he sank from her embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I treated him well,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer companions grinned.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was the kind of thing you learned to expect from Tria.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They dragged the body out of sight into the guard alcove, and the young male with the signal device took his place at the door.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The others protected Tria with their bodies as they swept into the building.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The whole operation had taken less than two minutes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Everything was working smoothly, as Tria\u0027s operations were expected to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lobby and its radiating hallways were empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer agent in this building deserved a promotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took a stairway rather than trust an elevator.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was only three short flights.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The upper hallway also was empty.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Tria led the way to the designated door, used the key her agent had supplied.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The door opened without a sound and they surged into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, the shades had been pulled, and there was no artificial illumination.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Her companions took up their places at the closed door and along both flanking walls.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This was the most dangerous moment, something only Tria could handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight came from thin strips where shades did not quite seal a south window.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Tria discerned dim shapes of furniture, a bed with an indeterminate blob of darkness on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jedrik?\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTria\u0027s feet touched soft fabric, a sandal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jedrik?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shin touched the bed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She held a weapon ready while she felt for the dark blob.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was only a mound of bedding. She turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom door was closed, but she could make out a thin slot of light at the bottom of the door.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She skirted the clothing and sandal on the floor, stood at one side, and motioned a companion to the other side.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Thus far they had operated with a minimum of sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently, she turned the knob, thrust open the door.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was water in a tub and a body face down, one arm hanging flaccidly over the edge, fingers dangling.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A dark purple welt was visible behind and beneath the left ear.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Tria lifted the head by the hair, stared at the face, lowered it gently to avoid splashing.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was her agent, the one she\u0027d trusted for the intelligence to set up this operation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And the death was characteristic of a Gowachin ritual slaying:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that welt under the ear.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A Gowachin talon driven in there to silence the victim before drowning?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Or had it just been made to appear like a Gowachin slaying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTria felt the whole operation falling apart around her, sensed the uneasiness of her companions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She considered calling Gar from where she stood, but a feeling of fear and revulsion came over her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She stepped out into the bedroom before opening her communicator and thumbing the emergency signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Central.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The voice was tense in her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her own voice flat.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Our agent\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She could imagine them centering the locator on her transmission, then:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"There?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She\u0027s been murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGar\u0027s voice came on:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"That can\u0027t be.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I talked to her less than an hour ago.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drowned in a tub of water,\" Tria said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"She was knocked out first - something sharp driven in under an ear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence again while Gar absorbed this data.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He would have the same uncertainties as Tria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at her companions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They had taken up guard positions facing the doorway to the hall.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yes, if attack came, it would come from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe channel to Gar remained open, and now Tria heard a babble of terse orders with only a few words intelligible:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\". . . team . . . don\u0027t let . . . time . . .\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Then, quite clearly:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"They\u0027ll pay for this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho will pay?
