Shivering, he replied, “Big Fatty Zhang is trying to reach Core Formation, and fell into a deadly crisis!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking equally anxious, Xu Baocai offered further explanation. “Last month, Elder Brother Zhang could tell that he was on the verge of reaching Core Formation, and went into secluded meditation. Master God-Diviner and I stood as Dharma protectors outside of his immortal\u0027s cave. At first, everything seemed normal, and we assumed he would only need a couple of months to finish the process. But for some reason, on the third day, his aura began to weaken. As of now, there’s only a faint bit of it left!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I went too,” Chen Manyao said anxiously, “but his immortal\u0027s cave is sealed tight, and we can’t get in. We didn’t want to blow up the door either, in case that would cause further problems.” Considering how long she had been part of the group, she considered herself part of them now, and was just as anxious as they were about Big Fatty Zhang being in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter hearing their explanations, Bai Xiaochun didn’t hesitate for even a moment. Transforming into a beam of prismatic light, he shot through the air at high speed toward Big Fatty Zhang’s immortal\u0027s cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster God-Diviner, Xu Baocai and Chen Manyao all followed along as fast as they could. After enough time passed for an incense stick to burn, Big Fatty Zhang’s immortal\u0027s cave appeared up ahead. Bai Xiaochun’s heart was pounding with nervousness; Big Fatty Zhang was his Eldest Brother, and the two of them had a deep connection. After all, the two of them had begun their friendship on the very day Bai Xiaochun joined the Spirit Stream Sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind was almost a complete blank as he landed in front of the immortal\u0027s cave, the door of which was sealed tightly. Bai Xiaochun quickly sent out some divine sense, backed by the power of his mid Gold Core stage cultivation base. Almost instantly, he could sense Big Fatty Zhang’s aura, and how weak it was. Apparently, the flame of his life force was on the verge of being snuffed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt almost looked as if he had made repeated efforts to reach Core Formation, and had failed each time, causing much of his life force to waste away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could this be happening?!” Bai Xiaochun said. Eyes bloodshot, he clenched his hands into fists and then called upon the explosive power of his Undying Hex, as well as the frigid qi that came from being on the verge of the Frigid Master level. Almost instantly, the door of the immortal\u0027s cave was covered with spider-web like cracks, before exploding into bits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun charged inside, to find Big Fatty Zhang sitting there as ashen as death, looking like little more than a skeleton!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint mist surrounded him, some of which would occasionally be sucked into his body before flowing out again. As that happened, Big Fatty Zhang’s aura slowly faded, to be replaced by an increasingly strong aura of death. From the look of it, he was hovering on the very brink of perishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eldest Brother....” Bai Xiaochun murmured. It felt like his heart was being cut in half by the sharpest of blades. Without hesitation, he reached out and put his right hand on the top of Big Fatty Zhang’s head, then poured life force into him, hoping to bolster the flickering flame of his life force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took a moment for Bai Xiaochun to realize that there was some sort of strange power inside of Big Fatty Zhang, something that was repelling the outside life force. That power felt like some sort of complete and utter determination. Furthermore, there in Big Fatty Zhang’s dantian region was a dense cloud of mist that looked almost like a sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery so often, the mist would converge together into the shape of a core, after which it would fall apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, the mist swirling around Big Fatty Zhang had been created by the same force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on!?” Bai Xiaochun said, stunned. Because of the force of expulsion inside of Big Fatty Zhang, any life force he sent in was almost completely dispelled. At best, he could slightly reduce the speed at which Big Fatty Zhang’s life force was fading away. At the current rate, it would likely be only two hours or so before Big Fatty Zhang wasted away into death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in that moment that Master God-Diviner and Chen Manyao arrived. When they saw Big Fatty Zhang’s appearance, they both gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is this possible?” Master God-Diviner said, looking shocked. “Big Fatty Zhang was only in secluded meditation for a month! How could he have been reduced to this state? It looks like he made ten failed attempts at reaching Core Formation!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Manyao looked a bit more closely at the mist, and then suddenly, she said, “That mist.... Big Fatty Zhang is a spirit enhancer. Could it be... that he’s trying to form a Will Core?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will Core?” Bai Xiaochun looked up at Chen Manyao, his expression fierce, not because of Chen Manyao, but because he was hovering on the brink of madness because of Big Fatty Zhang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Manyao immediately revealed everything she knew about Will Cores. “In ancient times, spirit enhancers often attempted to form Will Cores. However, it\u0027s fundamentally very dangerous, and nowadays, virtually no one even tries. Only someone completely and utterly confident in their spirit enhancement abilities could attempt it successfully. It’s basically like creating something from nothing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If the spirit enhancer successfully forms the Will Core, he will experience incredible good fortune afterward. But if he fails, he will be killed beyond the shadow of a doubt!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon hearing the explanation, a tremor ran through Bai Xiaochun, and he suddenly realized he had sensed a form of utter confidence within the mist inside Big Fatty Zhang. Suddenly, a look of regret appeared on Bai Xiaochun’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will Core....” He couldn’t help but think back to the Spirit Stream Sect, and how he had tricked Big Fatty Zhang into thinking he had succeeded, all to prevent his feelings from being hurt. From that moment on, Big Fatty Zhang’s journey along the path of spirit enhancement had completely changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, Bai Xiaochun realized that Big Fatty Zhang’s path of spirit enhancement was closely related to his confidence, and that his confidence had been significantly affected by Bai Xiaochun himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guys keep feeding him as much life force as you can. I’m going to get a Nascent Soul Daoist master!” With one final glance at Big Fatty Zhang’s dwindling aura, Bai Xiaochun raced out of the immortal\u0027s cave and headed toward the Hall of Devil Slayers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster God-Diviner and Chen Manyao immediately began to pour life force into Big Fatty Zhang, as did Xu Baocai, who had only just arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s eyes were bloodshot as he raced along, his mind empty except for a single thought: he could not allow Big Fatty Zhang to die!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA whistling sound echoed out in all directions on Sky Quarter Rainbow as he shot at top speed toward the Hall of Devil Slayers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hall of Devil Slayers was some distance from Big Fatty Zhang’s immortal\u0027s cave, and Bai Xiaochun couldn’t have been more anxious. Therefore, he used as much speed as possible, unleashing the Mountain Shaking Bash and also relying on the power of the Undying Tendons in his left leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore long, he was nearing the Hall of Devil Slayers. However, it was at that point that, just up ahead, five cultivators were being blocked from passing through the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people blocking their path were three disciples wearing long green robes, with cold expressions on their faces. When they saw Bai Xiaochun hurrying in their direction, one of them realized who he was, and hesitated a moment before calling out,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You there, get back! This whole 500-kilometer area is set aside for our Young Lord’s personal cultivation!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Our Young Lord is Sima Feiru!” Apparently, they thought that uttering the name Sima Feiru would be a huge threat. After all, this was essentially the same thing they said to anyone who tried to pass through this area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite a few people on Sky Quarter Rainbow were familiar with Sima Feiru. After all, he ranked 97 in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars. As a member of the top 100, he was extremely famous!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt any other time, when he was in his usual mood, Bai Xiaochun would never have bickered with these people about being able to pass through. But at the moment, his heart was on fire because of the situation with Big Fatty Zhang, and he had absolutely no patience. He couldn’t have cared less if Sima Feiru had the area locked down. In fact, if an even more famous Chosen had done the same thing, he still wouldn’t have taken the time to go around!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, every breath of time counted. Completely ignoring the three green-robed disciples, he continued onward at top speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three disciples’ faces flickered, and one of them said, “How dare--”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before he could finish speaking, Bai Xiaochun roared, “Beat it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, a wild wind sprang up, and the three disciples’ ears filled with deafening rumbling sounds as an incredible force smashed into them, forcing them off to the side as Bai Xiaochun shot past them into Sima Feiru’s sealed, 500-kilometer land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost immediately, a powerful aura erupted from a deep cistern within that 500-kilometer area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who dares to interrupt my cultivation!?!?” Along with the voice which echoed out, a magical technique was unleashed that caused a huge face to appear above the cistern. It was the face of a young man, twisted in rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis person was none other than Sima Feiru!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-431\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-433\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-432","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM"}
