When Lin Ming was at the mere Holy Lord realm, the saints had dispatched Soaring Feather God King to personally chase and hunt him down. Because the disparity in strength was too great, Lin Ming wasn’t able to escape this disaster. Otherwise many people believed that if he were able to grow for another 10,000 years, then he would definitely have been able to bring about a great reversal to humanity’s fate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBut history had no ‘ifs’ or ‘whats’.
