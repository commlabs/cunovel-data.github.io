I was sitting in a lecture hall in some educational institution\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a technical college to judge from all the pieces of equipment standing along the walls. I can\u0027t say what kind of equipment it was, some pieces had screens like televisions, others looked like scales with a lot of springs and counterweights. The lecture hall looked like an amphitheatre\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it sloped down to a board and standing there beside it was the same dwarf who spoke to me by the fountain. Apart from us two, there was no one there. The entire board was covered by a complicated diagram of some kind of device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you remember what came before that? How you got there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. The dwarf waved to me as if I was an old friend and told me they had heard about our wish to discover what was on their master\u0027s mind. He said that would be the subject of the lecture. Everything that happened seemed to be perfectly natural, and I didn\u0027t feel like I needed to ask any questions. Although there were lots of strange things. For instance, the diagram wasn\u0027t drawn on the board with chalk. It was carved into it, like an engraving. I realised that because when the dwarf wanted to correct something in the drawing he took a chisel and began stripping long shavings of plastic off the board and leaving bright lines on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it a diagram of?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Asterisk\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. The diagram was called \u0027the helmet of horror\u0027\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it was written in big letters above the drawing. But the dwarf repeated very insistently several times that it wasn\u0027t any kind of hat or apparatus, but precisely a mind, although everything about it looked like a drawing of some machine. The main body of the machine was shaped like a helmet. And there was an identical helmet standing on the demonstration table\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;an ancient bronze headpiece, and underneath it a visor with holes in it curving back inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you mean by \u0027curving back inside\u0027?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts lower section ran back inside the helmet through a slit in the middle of the face. And there were some kind of side plates too\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;everything was very old, green with age. It looked like a Roman gladiator\u0027s helmet\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;like a bronze hat with a visor. Only this one had horns as well. They came out of the upper section of the helmet and curved backwards. I\u0027d already seen that on the square by the fountain, when Asterisk walked by, only his helmet was bigger and more complicated, with lots of different wires and tubes. The dwarf said this one was a simplified model. What he told me sounded really peculiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you tell me about it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember that the helmet of horror consisted of several major parts and a lot of secondary ones. The parts had strange names: the frontal net, the now grid, the separator labyrinth, the horns of plenty, Tarkovsky\u0027s mirror and so forth. The largest element consisted of the now grid and the frontal net. It had two parts that were sometimes fused into a single unit. Its external part, the net, looked like a visor with holes in it, and its internal part, the grid, divided the helmet into an upper section and a lower one, so there was no way you could squeeze even the smallest head into it. The dwarf said the now grid separates the past from the present, because it is the only place where what we call \u0027now\u0027 exists. Hence the name. The past is located in the upper section of the helmet, and the future in the lower section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn\u0027t seem logical somehow. Maybe it\u0027s the other way round?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I definitely remember that. After that the dwarf began explaining how the helmet works. He said you had to grasp the essence of the matter first before going into the details. The helmet\u0027s operating cycle has no beginning, so it can be explained starting from any phase. And so, he said, start by imagining the gentle glow of a summer day caressing your face. That\u0027s precisely how the frontal net, heated by the action of the stream of impressions falling on it, transmits heat to the now grid. The grid sublimates the past contained in the upper section of the helmet, transforming it into vapour, which is driven up into the horns of plenty by the force of circumstances. The horns of plenty emerge from the forehead, curve round the sides of the helmet and intertwine to form the occipital braid, which descends into the base of the helmet. There, below the now grid, the bubbles of hope that arise in the occipital braid are ejected into the region of the future. As they rise, these bubbles burst against the now grid, generating the force of circumstances, which induces the stream of impressions in the separator labyrinth. And the stream of impressions, in turn, is shattered against the frontal net, heating the now grid and renewing the energy of the cycle. The heat he was speaking about when he used the verb \u0027to heat\u0027 is different from the kind of heat you get from fire, more like the kind you get from love. He said he was simply using an analogy with something I knew about, so I would be able to imagine what happens. And in the same way the stream of impressions doesn\u0027t actually flow anywhere, the bubbles of hope aren\u0027t really bubbles at all, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t really say I understood all of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t understand anything at first either, and the dwarf told me to ask questions. I didn\u0027t know where to begin, because everything was equally hard to understand. The last thing he\u0027d mentioned was the bubbles of hope, so I asked why they were called that. The dwarf was a bit embarrassed and said it was the official name, like a formal title. In actual fact it\u0027s not always hope at all, he said, it\u0027s more likely to be fear and apprehension, suspicion and hate, all sorts of nonsense, in fact any of the cud that is chewed on with such habitual stupidity by ... But then he broke off, glanced round furtively and muttered something about that not being the right way to put it. And then he went on in the formal lecturer\u0027s voice he\u0027d been using before and said that technically speaking it was correct to call them bubbles of the past. And they were called bubbles because their constant tendency is to expand and occupy the entire volume of the helmet, preventing anything else from appearing in it and leaving no space or opportunity for the recognition of what is actually happening. The dwarf jabbed his pointer at the part of the diagram that showed the kind of vertical coil the horns formed where they came together at the back of the helmet and said that bubbles of hope arise in the occipital braid following the enrichment of past in the horns of plenty. But since past is enriched exclusively with more past, the bubbles of hope consist entirely of past, they are simply past in a different state. Which means that when Asterisk peers into the future, he sees nothing but the past. The lower section of the helmet is required primarily in order to cool the bubbles of hope, a process which endows them with vernal freshness and the elastic resilience of novelty. As they break against the now grid, they generate the force of circumstances, which lifts the past out of the upper section of the helmet into the entry chamber of the horns of plenty and forces it through the separator labyrinth, where the stream of impressions arises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is the separator labyrinth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a kind of plate with wavy slits in it located in the region of the forehead, in front of the entry chamber of the horns of plenty. The separator labyrinth is the most important part of the helmet of horror. It\u0027s the place where everything else is produced out of nothing, that is, the place where the stream of impressions arises. And it\u0027s also the place where the past, the present and the future are separated. The past moves upwards, the future moves downwards, and the present, in the form of the stream of impressions, falls on to the outer surface of the frontal net, generating the cycle\u0027s passionate desire to recur, so that it becomes a kind of perpetuum mobile .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHang on a moment. The bubbles of hope are just another state of past, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, that\u0027s the way I understood it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after they break, you get past, present and future?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means it\u0027s past that decomposes into past, present and future?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn actual fact the whole cycle is simply the circulation of now in various states of mind, in the same way that water can be ice, or the sea, or thirst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how does the stream of impressions arise in the separator labyrinth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the force of circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see. But no, hang on. The separator labyrinth is inside the helmet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou said the stream of impressions falls on to the outer surface of the helmet. But how can that happen, if it arises inside?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked about that too. The dwarf laughed and said that was merely an apparent contradiction. The point is, he explained, the \u0027inside\u0027 and \u0027outside\u0027 I was talking about have no existence in themselves. They are generated in the separator labyrinth by the force of circumstances and from there they enter the horns of plenty, where they enrich the past, transforming it into the state of bubbles of hope. But since there is no \u0027inside\u0027 and \u0027outside\u0027 anywhere except in the horns of plenty, the stream of impressions can quite easily arise inside the helmet and fall on to it from the outside. And the same applies to everything else as well. But the dwarf warned me that I should never under any circumstances regard anything as real. The entire phenomenon is induced, like the electromagnetic field in a transformer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAha. Then what is Tarkovsky\u0027s mirror?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a small, fogged-up mirror set at an angle of forty degrees between the region of the future and the now grid. When the bubbles of hope entering from below are reflected in it they appear to be further along the line of their course than they are, which gives rise to the feeling that the line actually exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see. And why is the separator labyrinth the most important section of the structure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, it\u0027s where the stream of impressions arises. Secondly, it\u0027s where \u0027I\u0027 and \u0027you\u0027, good and bad, right and left, black and white, so on and so forth and everything else arises. The dwarf said this part of the helmet of horror is the most important and it hasn\u0027t changed for thousands and thousands of years. Then just at that moment a ray of sunlight lit up a poster hanging beside the board. It showed a Cretan coin with a diagram of a labyrinth stamped into it. Most opportune, said the dwarf, that is the separator labyrinth. Its appearance is very distinctive. It has a cross section at the centre, which is reached immediately after entry, and numerous parallel paths running around the cross which seem at first to lead you off into the unknown but then come full circle. This is the most widespread image of the labyrinth, the one that is repeated on almost all the antique coins and drawings. The scanned projection of this labyrinth is a straight line, which means that once you\u0027ve entered it there\u0027s no way you can get lost or find your way out. And that means we can regard the horns of plenty, the now grid, the separator labyrinth, the past and future as different sections of one and the same continuous route, which no one is actually following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy are the horns of plenty called that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause they contain all sorts of everything\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tender feelings, sidelong glances, exalted words, final thoughts and everything else. A genuine treasure house or rubbish tip. But all this infinite variety actually consists entirely of past. As far as I could understand it, the horns of plenty operate like enrichment units in a chemical plant. When it\u0027s driven through them by the force of circumstances, past gets mixed up with everything else, becoming richer and acquiring value, with the result that bubbles of hope are produced in the occipital braid, go gurgling through the region of the future, are reflected in Tarkovsky\u0027s mirror and perceived as the novel freshness of a brand new day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while now I\u0027ve been getting the feeling something\u0027s not right here, but I just can\u0027t quite put my finger on it. Right, now I think I\u0027ve got it! Who are they perceived by?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho?

The way I understand it, this helmet is arranged so you can\u0027t even squeeze your fist inside it, never mind your head. I don\u0027t suppose you asked about that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I didn\u0027t, the dwarf told me himself.
