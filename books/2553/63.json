All looked empty, no plumes of idling exhaust. After the other night, he was spooked, and not ashamed to admit it. You weren\u0027t paranoid when they really were out to get you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped out onto the sidewalk and cried out as he collided with someone. He jumped back, ready to run back inside, when he noticed it was an older woman. He grabbed her arm to keep her from falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I wasn\u0027t looking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I frighten you, Mr. Sullivan?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her face. Uh-oh. Alice Fredericks. The Mother of All Sims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Miss Fredericks. Nice to see you again. No, you didn\u0027t frighten me. I just didn\u0027t expect anyone there.\" He made a show of glancing at his watch. \"I\u0027m just heading off to a meeting and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t call me, Mr. Sullivan.\" Her look was reproachful. \"You said you would and I\u0027ve been waiting every day but you haven\u0027t called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you,\" he said, backing away, \"I\u0027ll call when my schedule lightens up. It\u0027s just that there\u0027s been so much going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo lie there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not afraid, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he should tell her he was very afraid, that he was terrified. Then she\u0027d look for someone else. But he couldn\u0027t make himself say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not of space aliens.\" True enough. Too many other truly frightening things going on in his life right now to worry about space aliens. \"Not a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll be waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and hurried toward Catherine Street to find a taxi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a ride during which Patrick spent more time looking out the rear window than the front, the cabby dropped him off at Penn Station. He wandered around Seventh Avenue, going in and out of stores to make sure he wasn\u0027t being followed, then headed further west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he arrived at Zero\u0027s garage just behind a middle-aged woman. Despite the parka-like hood cinched tight around her head against the cold, he recognized her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Cannon,\" he said, extending his hand. \"I\u0027m Patrick Sullivan. I don\u0027t know if you remember me, but I was - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were helping at the Beacon Ridge atrocity,\" she said with a smile as she pushed back her hood. He noticed that her long graying mane had been shorn to an almost boyish length. \"Yes, of course I remember. And call me Betsy, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and Romy was there, smiling. \"A two-fer! Come in, Betsy. So good of you to come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. It\u0027s easier for me to come to Zero than him to come to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you cut your hair. I love it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick stepped inside and closed the door behind him, remembering Zero\u0027s hurried phone conversation with Dr. Cannon last night. She was on staff at Nassau County Community Hospital and, following her instructions to Zero, Patrick and Romy had driven David Palmer out to the hospital and left him in the parking lot for her to \"find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, as the three of them trooped toward the rear of the garage, Kek suddenly came bounding down the ladder from his domain in the loft and charged them. Patrick tensed, waiting for Zero or Romy to call him off, but they said nothing. Then Betsy Cannon opened her arms and embraced the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is my friend Kek doing?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKek signed something to her and Betsy laughed. They had a brief conversation - Betsy speaking, Kek signing, then Kek scrambled back up the ladder to his observation post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You nursed him back to health, I\u0027m told,\" Patrick said as Kek vanished into the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. Zero did most of the nursing. I tried to save his frostbitten fingers but was only eighty- percent successful. As an OB-GYN I have surgical training, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OB?\" Patrick glanced past her at Zero who nodded. \"Then if we find this pregnant sim - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll bring her to me, of course. I\u0027ve lots of experience delivering sims.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. I spent six years as medical director of SimGen\u0027s natal center. When it finally seeped through to me that I was delivering a race of slaves into the world, I quit. And not long after that I received a call from Zero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of birthing sims thrust Alice Fredericks\u0027s crazy, tortured face into Patrick\u0027s mind. \"Let me pop you a question out of far left field: Do you know if SimGen ever used human women to bear sims?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Romy said. \"That\u0027s not out of left field, that\u0027s from the bleachers!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not while I was there, I assure you,\" Betsy said. \"Why do you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick told them about Alice Fredericks and her story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She certainly sounds delusional,\" Betsy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ready to believe that SimGen\u0027s connected to almost anything bad,\" Zero said, \"but I draw the line at space aliens. Let\u0027s get back to reality, shall we?\" He turned to Betsy Cannon. \"Any idea yet as to what\u0027s wrong with the patient we sent you last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The more we learn about his condition,\" she said, shaking her head, \"the more mysterious it becomes. He has a form of aphasia that\u0027s both expressive and receptive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry?\" Patrick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t understand what\u0027s said to him, or even written out for him, and can only jabber word salad when he wants to speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick shivered inside. \"Sounds like an inner circle of lawyer hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Syndromes like it can occur with strokes or sometimes with tumors that affect the Broca speech area of the brain, but an MR scan showed a perfectly normal brain. We shipped him out to NYU Medical Center this morning where they did a PET scan - that\u0027s positron emission tomography. It gives us a functional as opposed to structural view of the brain, and Mr. Palmer\u0027s Broca area has been damaged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damaged how?\" Romy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetsy shrugged. \"Neurology is not my field but I\u0027ve been asking a lot of questions under the guise of being interested because I found him in the parking lot. The experts\u0027 best guess is a toxin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Totuus?\" Romy said. \"You mean I did that to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Totuus was found in his system, but the NYU neurologists believe he had another compound in his bloodstream that combined with the Totuus to form a neurotoxin specific to the Broca area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty damn sophisticated,\" Zero said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetsy nodded. \"Amazingly sophisticated, according to the experts. All just theory, of course, one they have no way of testing at the moment, but it goes a long way toward explaining his syndrome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it fits with his behavior last night,\" Romy said. \"Remember how he broke down and cried when he found out we\u0027d injected him with the Totuus? He must have known he had the other compound floating through his bloodstream, and knew what was coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero said, \"A failsafe to prevent anyone from using Palmer\u0027s own Totuus against him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it permanent?\" Romy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetsy shrugged. \"Who can say? No one I\u0027ve spoken to has ever dealt with anything like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My guess is it\u0027s temporary,\" Zero said. \"I can\u0027t see anyone willingly taking something that could cause irreversible brain damage. But temporary can be a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk about covering your tracks,\" Romy said, shaking her head. \"How are we ever going to nail these monsters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetsy smiled and tightened her scarf around her neck. \"That I will leave to you. As for me, as long as I\u0027m in the city I believe I\u0027ll do some Christmas shopping. Good luck. And you know I\u0027m available anytime day or night if you find that pregnant sim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick showed her out, then returned to where Zero and Romy were standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been thinking,\" he said. \"What if it wasn\u0027t just the mixture of the two drugs in his bloodstream? What if saying a vital word was what triggered the - what was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aphasia,\" Zero said, then shook his head. \"That sounds even more farfetched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. But what was he saying at the very instant something tripped the circuit breaker in his brain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember,\" Romy said, \"but it\u0027s easy enough to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to a shelf on the wall and retrieved the recorder. She reversed it for a second, then hitPLAY . Romy\u0027s voice burst from the tiny speaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - op stalling! Tell me now: Who do you work for?\"was followed by Parker\u0027s hoarse rasp:\"SIRG - \" and then strangled noises and cries of alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy switched off the player. She looked pale. \"Want to hear it again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay. You heard the word: \u0027Surge,\u0027 right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero shrugged. \"I doubt he was talking about a fabric or an electric current. I believe he got out the first syllable of the answer - \u0027s-u-r\u0027 or \u0027s-e-r\u0027 or \u0027c-e-r\u0027 or maybe even \u0027c-i-r\u0027 for circle - and then the seizure hit and the rest of the word or words were crushed into a guttural mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this was in direct response to \u0027Who do you work for?\u0027 so it\u0027s got to have some relevance, don\u0027t you think? I mean, at least it\u0027s a start. Question is, how to find out if it means anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we simply ask?\" Romy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure. I\u0027ll just call up Mercer Sinclair and say, \u0027What does the word \"surge\" mean to you?\u0027 That\u0027ll work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile played about Romy\u0027s lips, the first since last night. \"Why call when you can ask in person?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-63.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
