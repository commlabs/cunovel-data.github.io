We have a question about the papier-mâché stars.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria glanced at Hanna, then shrugged and followed Ryan back into the barn. As she instructed how the stars should look, her stomach churned. They couldn’t talk to Agent Fuji, not with that painting in Aria’s closet. They had to figure this out soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even though she’d lashed out at Hanna for it, the new detail about Noel scared her, too. Noel didn’t know anyone at the Bill Beach. Why was he there? To see Graham?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo steal meds?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached into her pocket and touched the ticket stub she’d found in Noel’s wallet yesterday—she’d given Mike the wallet to return to Noel this morning and prayed he wouldn’t notice the stub was missing. The movie from only a few years ago, after Courtney’s death, when Real Ali was definitely imprisoned in The Preserve. That weird message on the back about Noel believing in someone. Aria hadn’t told her friends about it—they’d jump all over the hockey-girl doodle. Other people drew girls wielding hockey sticks, though. It didn’t necessarily mean anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she was curious. Darting to her bag across the room, she pulled out her iPad and typed THE WOODS CINEMA into Google. In a split second, the results came up. The first entry was for a cinema in Maplewood, New Jersey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s mouth went dry. Tabitha was from Maplewood. And Ali and Tabitha had clearly been at The Preserve together—and were even friends. Did this mean Noel had visited Ali when she was at The Preserve? Did he spring Ali and Tabitha out for a night so they could go to a movie? It made no sense, though—why would they go all the way to New Jersey? And why would Noel say to Agent Fuji that he’d never met Tabitha if he clearly had?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aria?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria spun around. Noel stood behind her, almost like she’d conjured him. His hands were in his pockets, and there was a serious look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“H-hey,” Aria said shakily, turning the iPad facedown on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel glanced toward the door. “Can you talk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria nodded and slipped her iPad back into her bag. When they walked into the sculpture garden again, Hanna was gone. For a while, there was only the sound of their footsteps. Halfway down the path, Noel stopped next to what everyone called the Slinky. “So I’ve been thinking about Olaf.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria felt her throat close. “Noel, I . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his finger to her lips. “I was an asshole that trip, Aria. I felt jealous that I didn’t know the Iceland side of you, and I was afraid that when you got there you were going to change and not be into me anymore. Instead of stepping up, I just acted like a whiny, ridiculous idiot. I should have just let you go with Hanna and Mike instead of coming along, too. I’m not happy that you hooked up with that guy, but I also sort of get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria blinked. It was the last thing she’d thought he was going to say. Just last week, she would have been flattered and touched—here was gorgeous Noel, worrying she was going to drop him. But now she felt hollowed out. Suspicious. Why was Noel forgiving her so easily?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel took her hands. “I still want to be with you. I want to go on another vacation and do it right. We can even go back to Iceland if you want. This time, I’ll ride one of those silly horses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria knew she was supposed to laugh, but she couldn’t muster the emotion. She looked away instead, a lump in her throat. Her hands felt like two dead weights. Ali and Tabitha, her mind screamed. Maplewood. Hockey-player girl. Ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel cocked his head. “You seem miserable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not,” Aria said, her voice squeaking. “I just . . .” She trailed off. If only there was a way to bring Tabitha’s name into the conversation without it seeming really random or suspicious. But how?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel pulled his hands away. “What the hell, Aria? Here I am, bending over backward for you, telling you everything, getting you the decor chairwoman spot, putting up with your weird moods, forgiving you for cheating on me, and you’re still treating me like shit. It’s getting kind of old, okay? The secrets, the strange behavior . . . it’s like I’m not fully part of your life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t say that,” Aria whispered. “I’ve just been distracted, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With what?” Noel demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s throat bobbed. All she wanted was to exonerate him. But she couldn’t just ask for the answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at Noel. An indentation of something showed through the pocket of his jeans. It was his cell phone. A tantalizing idea wormed its way into her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a few moments to center herself, then stepped closer and cleared her throat. “I can’t stop thinking about what I did to you. I still feel awful because of it. And with the explosion on the boat and almost dying out at sea, I’ve been a mess, Noel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then tell me about it,” Noel said. “Don’t hide it. Don’t hold it inside and make me guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” Aria mumbled, even mustering up some tears. “I will. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she pulled him into a hug. For a moment, she was afraid Noel wouldn’t hug back, but he tentatively wrapped his arms around her. Aria’s heart banged against his chest. She slid one hand down the length of his waist. Carefully, delicately, she pinched the top of the phone with two fingers and slipped it out one inch at a time, as deftly as a pickpocket. Noel shifted, but he didn’t seem to notice it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria dropped the phone in the big pouch of her hoodie. When they broke away, Noel was staring at her lovingly again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed hard and gestured to the barn door. “Well, they need me back inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel kissed her cheek. “Call me when you’re done, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” Aria said shakily. In seconds, he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t get back into the barn fast enough; it would only be a few minutes before Noel discovered his phone was missing. She ran to her iPad and found a USB cord inside her bag. She plugged the phone in. A window appeared asking if she wanted to transfer data to the device. She stabbed YES. Numbers flashed across the screen. In under a minute, a message popped up that the transfer was complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria yanked the phone from the USB, opened the barn door, and flung the phone into the grass. Hopefully, Noel would just think he’d dropped it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe returned to the iPad. Noel’s texts had loaded. She scanned them quickly, not expecting to find much—if Noel was A, he’d probably use a different phone with an unlisted number. Besides the texts Noel had sent to Aria about couple stuff, most of them were to his lacrosse buddies or family members. But as she skimmed farther down the list, there was something strange. Two Februarys ago, Noel had sent a text to an unlisted number. Anything you need, it said. The unlisted number had texted back. Thanks for helping me. You know what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria did the math. February was when Noel and Aria bonded at the séance at that head shop in Yarmouth. It was bizarre he’d even saved this text—surely he’d had an earlier-model phone back then. He must have transferred it from that phone to this one. It must have been sentimental. Could this text be from Ali? What did You know what to do mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria shut her eyes. This was all horrible conjecture. Was she really doing this? Had she lost her mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clicked out of the texts, her limbs feeling heavy. Noel’s e-mails had loaded, too, but Aria no longer wanted to look at them. Then a familiar name caught her eye. Agent Jasmine Fuji. It was from just two days ago. Aria felt dizzy. But Noel had talked to her last week, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t just one e-mail to Fuji, either—there were six in the thread. Words flashed before her eyes. Thank you for your thoughts. The next one: I’m very sorry you lost your friend. And the last: We will speak more soon. I was very intrigued when you said not everyone is telling me the whole truth, and I hope you can elaborate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone laughed loudly behind her, and Aria dropped the iPad back to the desk. She stared around the room blearily, as if she were caught in a nightmare. Noel had lost his friend . . . as in Tabitha? Or Ali? And who did he think was lying? Aria? Was that why Fuji was frantically trying to speak with them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for her phone and punched in Spencer’s number. This was getting out of hand. It was time to admit some of this stuff to her friends. The phone rang once, then twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?” Spencer answered. “Aria? What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded on the window, and Aria jumped. Noel stood on the other side, his discarded cell phone now in his palm. He smiled at her so sweetly, so guilelessly, that Aria’s heart cracked into a million pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aria?” Spencer’s voice came through the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria waved back to Noel, tears in her eyes. “Um, I—I butt-dialed you,” she said to Spencer. And then she hung up, telling her nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone Slips\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday afternoon, a few hours before prom, Spencer and Hanna sat in Hanna’s bedroom at her father’s house. A giant full-length mirror stood near the corner. The bed was strewn with makeup cases, hair dryers, and hair spray, and an assortment of bobby pins, clips, and curling irons lay on the floor like pickup sticks. Jewelry on loan from Spencer’s and Hanna’s moms sat on a velvet cloth on the bureau. Their gowns hung from hooks on the back of the closet doors, and their shoes sat at attention on the carpet underneath. The air smelled like perfume and that vague, chemical dry cleaning scent Spencer could never quite pin down. It made her feel a little sad that they all couldn’t be here for pre-prom prep, but no one had heard from Aria, and Emily had, bizarrely, invited Iris as her date. They were getting ready at the Fieldses’ house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knock on the door. Hanna’s father popped his head in. “How’s it going, girls? Anything I can do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know, Dad.” Hanna smirked. “Want to help with makeup?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Marin raised his palms and backed away. “That’s not my territory.” He smiled adoringly at Hanna. “You look beautiful, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do look awesome.” Kate poked her head in next. Half her hair cascaded down her shoulders in tendrils, but the other half was still straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” Hanna said, sounding surprised. “You do, too, Kate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Kate and Mr. Marin disappeared into the hall. Hanna looked at Spencer. “Do you think I should have asked her to hang out with us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe.” Spencer shrugged. Not that she was really into socializing. And Kate’s simple, uncomplicated life would probably rub her the wrong way at the moment. That girl didn’t have an A in her life. Or secrets she was hiding. Or a death threat on her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna slumped back in the chair, making no move to go into the hall and call Kate back. “I wish Mike would call the house and let me know he’s still my date.” She eyed Spencer in the mirror. “Who’s the guy you’re going with, Spence?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer picked up an eyelash curler. “Oh, just someone I met.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the King James,” Spencer said automatically, using the story she’d rehearsed in her head. “He works at that upscale men’s boutique.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crushed-pretty-little-liars-13/page-29.html","bookId":2389,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM"}
