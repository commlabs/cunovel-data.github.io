One of them was a crimson-haired middle-aged man with a cold smile. As he strode forward, he waved his hand, resulting in Ksitigarbha and the others coughing up mouthfuls of blood as they spun backward beyond control. A few of them even directly exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took only a moment for it to be apparent that there was nothing the Mountain and Sea cultivators could do to block the advance. It was simply impossible to compare the Mountain and Sea Realm and the butterfly to the Immortal God Continent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crimson-haired man strode forward and stepped onto the butterfly itself, causing a tremor to run through it. He instantly headed toward the unconscious Meng Hao, and a flicker of scorn could be seen in his eyes as he reached his hand out to grab the top of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the other suns and other cultivators of the Immortal God Continent were closing in. In only a moment, they would burst into the world which contained the survivors of the Mountain and Sea Realm, and put them all to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the moment in which the crimson-haired man was about to grab Meng Hao, the butterfly’s wings shivered, and Meng Hao’s parents suddenly appeared to block his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think a bit too much of yourselves,” the man said, smiling. His energy surged, transforming into a powerful attack which headed directly toward Meng Hao’s parents, to wipe them out of existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe destructive power in his hand was enough to eradicate anything and everything, and it was now only moments away from slamming into Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was absolutely a moment of incredible danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crisis Meng Hao faced was being shared by his parents, by Ksitigarbha and the others, and by everyone living inside the world of the butterfly!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the world inside Meng Hao’s mind, lightning and thunder crashed. At the same time, countless copies of Meng Hao were joining their voices together to shout out in a powerful roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the voices echoed out endlessly, more and more versions of Meng Hao appeared, filling the entire world, roaring at him in an attempt to awaken him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt eventually pierced into the remaining cultivation base sea, entering the ears of Meng Hao’s true self, causing him to tremble. Then his eyes opened!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, back out in the real world, where Meng Hao lay on the butterfly’s back, his eyes... also opened!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his bright red pupils appeared, an explosive aura surged out, causing the Vast Expanse to shake, and the starry sky to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShockingly, as everything quaked around him, lightning bolts appeared, transforming the area into a lake of lightning. It almost looked as if the Vast Expanse itself were furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn intense pressure began to weigh down that was difficult to put into words. It filled the entire area, crushing down onto the cultivators from the Immortal God Continent who were attempting to break into the butterfly world. All of them coughed up blood, and then uncontrollably dropped to their knees and began to kowtow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the 8-Essences paragons were shocked to find that they were trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire world was completely shaken!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe starry sky was vibrating, and the Vast Expanse was howling!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Immortal God cultivators who were trying to cut down Ksitigarbha and the others felt their cultivation bases weakening, and then some of them began to explode!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was what happened when Meng Hao merely opened his eyes and unleashed his energy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intensity of the power caused the face of the cold-eyed 9-Essences Paragon to drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the crimson-haired man in front of Meng Hao, his scalp was completely numb, and he was shaking in his boots. His cultivation base was unstable, and the attack he had just unleashed on Meng Hao’s parents was completely destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn indescribably majestic air radiated off of Meng Hao, causing everything around him to vibrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crimson-haired man, who was an 8-Essences Paragon sun from the Immortal God Continent, couldn’t stop himself from looking at Meng Hao. As soon as their eyes met, the man’s face fell, and his mind began to spin. It felt like red daggers were stabbing through his eyes into his brain. Any resistance on his part was crushed like twigs as the pain stabbed into him, sending his sea of consciousness boiling, causing his cultivation base to grow unstable, and filling him with a sensation of imminent death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This....” Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and his entire body shook violently as he subconsciously took a step back in fear of the complete and utter bizarreness of Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the moment he fell back, Meng Hao took a step forward, and before the man could dodge, viciously head-butted him in the forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes were bright red as he slammed into the man, instantly turning the top of his head into a mash of blood and gore. He screamed and struggled, but then Meng Hao smiled and once again butted his head forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t you just say that we wouldn’t withstand a single blow?” He grabbed the man’s robe and slammed his head into him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn\u0027t you just say that we overestimate ourselves?” Meng Hao grinned, and blood soaked his head as he bashed it into the man over and over again. Finally, the 8-Essences Paragon’s head exploded, and his body was destroyed. His Nascent Divinity flew out, looking at Meng Hao in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao let the man’s Nascent Divinity fly away, and turned to look at the other forces who had already landed on the butterfly, then waved his hand furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Screw off!” he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds erupted out as the lightning surrounding him sent the midst of the Vast Expanse seething. Incredible pressure radiated out from Meng Hao, and shocking power filled his voice. Instantly, the cultivators from the Immortal God Continent who were on the butterfly coughed up blood, and then began to explode one after another. In the end, not a single one could remain on the butterfly’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Immortal God Continent was buzzing as countless cultivators flew out, eyes filled with disbelief as they stared at Meng Hao. In addition to the original 9-Essences female Paragon, there was also the white-robed, white-eyebrowed old man who had fought Daoist Immortal Ancient, and who was now looking at Meng Hao with a very serious expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s 9-Essences....” Those were the words coming out of the mouths of the bedraggled cultivators who had survived their brush with Meng Hao’s power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s... that 9-Essences power. How is that even possible!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could he be 9-Essences? Shui Dongliu used Immortal Dao Transference to consecrate him. But... even if he passed on everything to this guy, it\u0027s not likely that he would be able to... to have 9-Essences power!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most importantly, you can tell that he’s actually not finished with the process!! If... if he ever completely absorbs that legacy, just think of how strong he’ll be!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cultivators of the Immortal God Continent felt as if they had been struck in the head. Their minds were spinning as they looked at Meng Hao with complete disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9-Essences! Only 9-Essences could possess energy like this, and only 9-Essences could destroy the fleshly body of an 8-Essences Paragon as easily as flipping over a hand!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly 9-Essences could allow a faction to stand firm and unthreatened within the Vast Expanse!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShui Dongliu killed himself as the price to give Meng Hao unmatchable good fortune. That was not only to pay back the debt he owed to the Fang Clan, it was also... to ensure that someone remained behind after he died to protect the Mountain and Sea Realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the exact role which he had chosen Meng Hao to play: the guardian of the Mountain and Sea Realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes glowed red as he slowly turned and looked at the hosts of cultivators from the Immortal God Continent. His sudden appearance on the scene left Ksitigarbha and the other forces on the butterfly stirred and excited. Meng Hao’s parents appeared, along with Xu Qing and others from within the world of the butterfly. All of them were paying close attention to Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stood in front of the group, tall, his hair floating around him, looking as powerful as a mountain. Behind him on the butterfly were his parents, Fang Yu, Xu Qing, and other friends and family, the few surviving cultivators from the Mountain and Sea Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacing Meng Hao was the vast and boundless Immortal God Continent, as well as a seemingly neverending force of cultivators. There were multiple 8-Essences Paragons, countless Imperial Lords, as well as two paramount figures who were the pillars of their army... the two 9-Essences Paragons!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked at them, his seething Demonic qi causing the mists of the Vast Expanse around him to recede, the starlight to gleam. Seemingly endless amounts of Demonic qi flowed out of him, and at the same time, his cultivation base continued to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore accepting Shui Dongliu’s legacy, he had been capable of fighting with Paragons. Then he became the Demon, and his battle prowess had increased dramatically, to the point where he could battle 8-Essences Paragons. But now, thanks to the preeminent good fortune given him, his Hexing magics were complete. Although he was missing the Ninth Hex, in some ways, his collection could be considered finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was the cultivation base and Essence power from Shui Dongliu, which helped him to advance by leaps and bounds!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, there were his extinguished Soul Lamps, which pushed him even higher. As of this moment, he had... battle prowess that was no weaker than the 9-Essences level!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith all of that... Meng Hao still hadn’t reached his peak. He still had room for progress with his cultivation base; he still had more than 10 Soul Lamps which had not been extinguished. He had yet to create his Ninth Hex, and although all of the other Hexing magics had Essence to some degree or another, he still needed more enlightenment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne could only imagine how powerful he would be when he reached the true pinnacle. It would be something incomparable even to his current power. After all, he was... the Demon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had transformed from being an Immortal, to being... the Demon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a God who is the acme of all Gods. There is a Devil who is the ultimate expression of Devils. There is also an Immortal, who is like an Emperor among Immortals. And there is also... the Demon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pinnacle of all Demons!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, the Vast Expanse was completely silent. Demonic qi rolled out of Meng Hao as he stood there, looking coldly at the crowds from the Immortal God Continent. A smile twisted the corner of his mouth, a brutal smile which caused icy cold to fill the hearts of anyone who looked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one spoke. Even the 9-Essences female Paragon looked at him with cold, flickering eyes. Then she took a step forward, and Meng Hao smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached up and pushed down onto his forehead, causing a group of Mountains and Seas to fly out. Nine Mountains. Eight Seas!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was... the Mountain and Sea Realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, he held the Mountain and Sea Realm in his hands!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1400\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1402\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1401","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
