Not long ago, all of them were in complete despair. After all, once their city was overrun, the Great Yan Empire would be history.

Lin Dong had introduced all of them previously. After Lin Fan and the elders of the Lin Clan learnt that they were all ultimate experts who had advanced to the Samsara stage, even the servant serving them tea began to tremble. After all, although the Lin Clan was much stronger compared to before, they were hardly worthy of the attention from so many ultimate experts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, they all secretly sighed in relief when they realized that these ultimate experts, who must be treated with extreme respect even by sect masters of various super sects in the Eastern Xuan Region, were not arrogant individuals. Instead, all of them returned their greetings with a smile. Though they knew that this was likely because of their relationship with Lin Dong, Lin Fan and the elders still felt joy and excitement in their hearts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Haha, Lin Dong ah.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Fan’s face was full of smiles. Moreover, even though he was the clan head, there wasn’t a tinge of pride on his face. Instead, all he did was grin when he looked at Lin Dong. The latter found his smile a little comical. After all, back then, the clan head of the Lin Clan seemed like a rather prestigious role to his eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It’s all thanks to you that our Lin Clan is able to develop until such an extent.

Given Lin Dong’s current strength, if he was to become the clan head, notwithstanding the Great Yan Empire, it was likely that their Lin Clan would become extremely well known across the entire Eastern Xuan Region.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith this in mind, Lin Fan involuntarily turned to look at Lin Zhentian for help.

He was not an old fool. Since Lin Dong was unwilling to do so, there was no way he would force the latter to comply. After all, Lin Dong was no longer a child like he was before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Fan could only helplessly shake his head when he saw Lin Zhentian acting in this manner.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong saw through their actions. Finally, he laughed softly before he placed the teacup in his hands down.

Moreover, Lin Zhentian had a strong clan mentality and he put in a great deal of effort back then, in order for his family to return to the main clan. Therefore, it was impossible for Lin Dong to completely differentiate between the two. In that case, it was best to allow his family to reap more benefits.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Fan was startled. He quickly rejoiced and nodded continuously. Lin Xiao was Lin Dong’s father. Therefore, it didn’t matter whether the son or the father became the clan head.

Things had truly exceeded his expectations. After all, Ling Qingzhu was a prideful person and he had never expected her to take the initiative to visit Lin Xiao and Liu Yan. On the other hand, Ying Huanhuan was just like a little princess whom others treasured and took care of.

Within a couple of minutes, a familiar mountain range appeared in front of his eyes. Meanwhile, an extremely large sect guarding formation was fully activated and it enveloped the entire mountain range.
