I know it\u0027s a completely fucked up way of keeping her close to me for as long as possible, but I don\u0027t give a shit. Everything inside of me is raging at the idea of letting her go. And the outside\u0027s not far behind. My skin is hardcore addicted to her. Like even now, with her arms wrapped around my waist, it\u0027s just not fucking tight enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we hit the Strip, I take my turns easy instead of how I like them, fast and as close to upside down as possible without getting my skin peeled off by the asphalt. Because we\u0027re close. Too close. I don\u0027t know what we\u0027re doing here, what I\u0027m doing, but I don\u0027t want to push her. If I push her and she fucking kicks me to the curb again, I\u0027m done for. As in, major therapy and lots of colorful pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we pull into the hotel\u0027s driveway, I don\u0027t stop in front of the sliding glass doors. Those bozos who check bags and shuttle tourists around aren\u0027t going to witness our farewells. Shit, I don\u0027t want anyone to see it, especially me. Instead I park down a ways, in the shadows of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step off the bike, then help her. I think my hands are shaking, which they\u0027ve never done-ever. But this girl, she just fucking tears me up. I watch as she pulls off my helmet and holds it out to me. Her long hair is mussed, her cheeks are pale, and those eyes-fuck me-those mismatched eyes that belong to me, well, at least the one, bore into mine. And this time, I let her. I let her look. I let her take a good, long gander inside my ribs to my newly repaired and fully-functioning heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you see, Ads? I want to ask her. Grab her by the shoulders and force her to tell me. Tell me she wants nothing else but me. But shit, that\u0027s not fair. Twenty-four hours can\u0027t demolish a whole life. She has friends and school. Shit, she\u0027s graduating in a few weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Addison...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes prick with tears and she shakes her head. Really fast, really manic. Her hands are balled into fists and she looks like she\u0027s about to lose it. And frankly I\u0027m not far behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me?\" she rasps out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I return, my gut rolling, eating itself alive because I don\u0027t know if I can. I don\u0027t know if I can hear her voice and not go insane. Wouldn\u0027t it better to block her ass out, leave it here on the stained Vegas concrete and go back to real life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe starts to walk away, but I grab her wrist and haul her back against me. She melts into me like chocolate, and I breathe in the scent of her hair. For several moments, we cling together like scared monkeys, then I release her. Our eyes connect one last time before I turn away and straddle my bike. I don\u0027t look up as I drop my brain bucket on my head and kick start the engine. Don\u0027t look back as I haul ass away from the curb. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/first-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-1/page-10.html","bookId":1915,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:02 PM"}
