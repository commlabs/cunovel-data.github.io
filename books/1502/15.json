Before dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoft wind blew across still water, the moon and stars sank. Lamplight grew brighter. In the blackness preceding dawn, lamps are the brightest thing in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is because a lamp sacrifices itself. It burns itself to shine on others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople are the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a person sacrifices themselves up, no matter how black the surroundings, light will shine forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Tianjue. So, this person was Gao Tianjue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“End the heavens, destroy the earth; wipe the whole lot out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis mysterious person who only appeared in legends, now sat in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun was an orphan. By the time he was born, Gao Tianjue was already one of the most feared figures in Jianghu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them shouldn’t have any relationship whatsoever. But now, for some mystical reason, their fates seemed to be tied together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Tianjue suddenly asked, “Do you wish to remove my mask to see what type of person I am?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At first, I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As of now, I don’t,” said Xiao Jun, “because I realized something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t see your face, but neither can you see mine. On the way here just now, you walked very slowly. The reason is because you can’t see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen people use masks, they will leave two holes which will reveal their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the silver mask had no eye holes, only a single hole for the mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could drink tea, but could not see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a blind person would use such a mask. How could the universally famous Gao Tianjue be blind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun didn’t ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew the question must touch on something deeply painful to Gao Tianjue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t see me, therefore I do not wish to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think that’s fair?” asked Gao Tianjue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I suppose there’s no harm in telling you something else that’s very fair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun didn’t ask about what he referred to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d noticed that this entire time, Gao Tianjue’s kept his left arm concealed in the black cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, he suddenly stretched it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he stretched out was not an arm, but a glittering, silver pincer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cut off your arm, and someone else cut off mine.” Gao Tianjue’s voice contained a sneering pain that anyone could hear. “Is that not fair?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun didn’t answer the question. Instead, he retorted, “Does the person who chopped off your arm resemble me? Is that why you cut off mine?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Tianjue laughed loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laughing” is an innately joyful thing, not only for oneself, but for others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the face of Gao Tianjue’s gray-robed subordinate was suddenly covered in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Could this be because he knew the source of the laughter was not joy, but calamity and misfortune?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun’s palms grew wet with cold sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt an indescribable fear in his heart. It was not because he had never heard such fearsome laughter before, but rather, because he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, he suddenly remembered many things. Some seemed real, but others seemed the stuff of nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNightmare, not nightmares, he couldn’t tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Tianjue’s laughter suddenly ceased. The gray-robed subordinate’s face grew rigid, and Xiao Jun awoke from his reverie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing had changed in the cabin. Around the boat, Daming Lake was as tranquil as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut to them, it seemed as if everything under heaven had changed. They felt some type of enormous pressure in their hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no wind in the cabin, nor had Gao Tianjue moved. And yet suddenly, it seemed as if his cloak were billowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cover of the tea bowl flipped up three inches into the air, then shattered into pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a clattering sound rang out as the window slammed shut, shredding the window paper and sending pieces fluttering about like hellish butterflies scattered about by a demon in hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thrumming sound arose from a seven-stringed zither which lay on a wooden rack in the corner, and the pearl curtain in the doorway began to rattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a cracking sound rang out as the zither strings snapped. The curtain’s pearls fell to the ground like tears. All the sounds stopped. The two gray-robed men who had been standing guard outside were nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nobody at all on the deck. Nobody knew what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept Gao Tianjue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s come,” he said with a deep sigh. One word at a time, he said: “He’s already come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Boss Tang stared at Ingot, her eyes and mouth wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were not small to begin with. As of now, though, they were twice as large as normal. Her mouth was not small either, but currently it seemed large enough to be able to swallow two whole eggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was thirty-four years old, and had seen many things in her life, yet at the moment, she looked like a little girl who had been frightened half to death. Right now, it seemed as if she were not more than seven or eight years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Ingot just said really had startled her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you just say?” She shook her head. “You didn’t say it. I must have misheard. You didn’t say anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I did say it,” replied Ingot, his face completely straight. “I said it very clearly, every single word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I didn’t hear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did hear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You absolutely did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I absolutely didn’t,” said Big Boss Tang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngot stared at her, then, shouting in a voice like that of a drowning person crying for help, repeated himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to marry me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Boss Tang was yet again shocked. This little devil shocked her so badly she felt as if her soul had departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My god,” she said hoarsely. “My god.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you hear me this time?” asked Ingot. “Or should I say it again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I beg you, please, listen to me.” Big Boss Tang didn’t seem anything like a Big Boss now. “If you say it again, I’ll go jump into a river and drown myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would you drown yourself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even a deaf person five streets away could hear what you said just now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong with that?” said Ingot, staring at her. “I’m never afraid of people hearing anything I say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might not be afraid, but I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you afraid of?” he said, slapping his chest. “With me here, what do you have to fear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Boss Tang moaned, and it looked as if she might pass out onto the table at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know how old I am?” she said. “I’m just about old enough to be your grandmother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngot nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right, right, right. You’re almost old enough to be my grandmother. My grandmother is only one hundred and one years old.” Then he deliberately asked, “How old are you, by the way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well I’m not that old, but I am over thirty. At the very least I’m old enough to be your mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mother? Hahaha!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does hahaha mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hahaha means that you’re just about to really piss me off. My fourth sister is just over thirty, and you say you’re old enough to be my mother? Are you trying to get me angry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then let me tell you something. My oldest sister is old enough to be your mother,” he said in all earnestness. “If you want to come home with me, the only way you can do it is by being my wife. And you have no other choice but to be my wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Boss Tang covered her ears with her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t hear anything,” she said. “You didn’t say anything and I didn’t hear anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, then I’ll say it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he did, in a voice even louder than the last time. “I want you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, he only got half of the sentence out, because Big Boss Tang lurched forward and used her hands to cover his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands were warm and soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body was also soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngot knew, because as she lurched forward, he seized the opportunity to embrace her. She wanted to push him away, but couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You little devil, you’re really a good-for-nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not good-for-nothing, I’m a person. A man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a bullshitter,” she said. “At the very least, I’m ten years older than you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My third and fifth brothers-in-law are both over ten years older than my sisters,” argued Ingot courageously. “If a thirty-year-old man can marry a girl in her teens, why can’t a thirty-year-old woman marry a boy in his teens?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re drunk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re obviously drunk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not, I’m not…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was “he?” Who had come?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass-like waters of Daming Lake were suddenly split by a white wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small boat sliced through the waters like a sharp knife cutting through silk. It sped forward like an arrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall man in a black robe stood at the front of the boat, his arms clasped behind his back. His long robe rippled in the breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stars had disappeared, as had the moon. This was the darkest period of night, and though his features could not be distinguished, anyone could sense his mighty dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no one else on the small boat, no sail, no punt-pole, no one pulling the oars, no one at the helm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the boat had already arrived, faster than anyone could have imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowering his voice, Gao Tianjue asked, “Do you know who it is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Li Xiao?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.

But this person didn’t look at all like Wu Tao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had become someone else, because as of now, he had no reason to conceal his identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGone was his belly. All the fat on his body had miraculously disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis narrow, pointed forehead was now wide and sanguine, his previously ashen face now glowed like white jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Was he really that ordinary, low-class businessman whose coin purse had been stolen away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun couldn’t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never believed that anyone in the world could possess such miraculous appearance-changing techniques, nor had he believed that anyone could change so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now, he couldn’t disbelieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the person he wanted to kill, and yet, he suddenly felt indescribable fear and admiration for him, the kind of feeling a hot-blooded youth has in his heart upon seeing his idol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun did not understand this feeling, but it caused him to realize something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—There seemed to be two people battling inside him, battling with two swords. When one sword stabbed back, the other stabbed forth, and both chopped at his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis cause his heart to be constantly filled with contradiction and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will only have one chance, and you must take it.

But, he noticed something strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed the two of them knew each other, and perhaps had once been friends. And yet, some irresolvable hatred existed between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere they enemies or friends? Who could tell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motionless General Li suddenly moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one could possibly describe this movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed slow, and yet so fast that it couldn’t be seen clearly. It appeared clumsy and awkward, and at the same time as graceful and elegant as a soaring phoenix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Tianjue wanted him dead and in the ground. But he didn’t want Gao Tianjue dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe simply wanted to take off that mask, ugly and beautiful, mysterious and fearsome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Tianjue wouldn’t let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Tianjue also moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them, motionless, suddenly sprang into motion. They moved like the wind, like the ripples, the catkins, the clouds amidst the wind. Like the wind amidst the ripples and catkins and clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun’s heart sank deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d always thought of himself as one of the peak masters in Jianghu. Most others also thought this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now he knew how laughable it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis martial arts couldn’t compare to that of these two. Completely incomparable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never imagined that anyone in the world could possibly have martial arts like them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now he was watching it with his own eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could he make a move? How could he have a chance to make a move?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir shadows flickered, and the lamp light went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the darkest part of night had passed. The first rays of the morning sun shone down on Daming Lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe contending shadows suddenly parted, and General Li appeared directly in front of Xiao Jun. His hand shot out like lightning, and he grabbed Xiao Jun’s right arm. His only arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun had no time to react. He could only hear General Li say in a low voice: “You can’t stay here, come with me, now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he finished speaking, Xiao Jun had left the ground, and was flying along with General Li.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as they flew out of the cabin, he suddenly saw his chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, pale rays of morning sun shone onto General Li’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis back was empty. This was the first time in his entire life that he had exposed his back to someone, and it would undoubtedly be the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never imagined that Xiao Jun would attack, never imagined that he now had another arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw the sun shining on General Li’s back, the short sword held in the steel pincer shot out, stabbing into the ribs below his left shoulder, directly into his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe move seemed like the reflexive reaction of someone who grabbed a hot coal; it didn’t even pass through Xiao Jun’s conscious mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—This person was his enemy, and this was his only chance. He had to seize the opportunity to attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought had taken root in his heart, and so he didn’t even need to think in order to act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had finally seized his chance. Because of all his experience in life, his reaction was fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis reaction speed was born from his countless bitter battles and painful training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should have been quite pleased with the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for the rest of his life, whenever he thought about it, he felt a stab of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though his sword had stabbed General Li, he felt as if he had stabbed his own heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glitter of the sword was no longer visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Li’s body shrank inward and he slid off the blade, writhing in mid-air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head turned to face Xiao Jun, and the sun shone down onto his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face did not contain the dread of someone facing death, nor indignation at being plotted against. It was only filled with regret, remorse and sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun looked upon his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would never be able to forget the expression he saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the drops of blood fell onto the deck, General Li had already descended into the waters of the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater sprayed everywhere, and he sank down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRipples spread out, and each ripple contained the blood of General Li.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the ripples had subsided, Xiao Jun heard Gao Tianjue’s laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should be laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Li was finally dead, exactly according to his plan. He should be quite pleased with himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet his laughter contained not even a drop of joy, but instead was filled with pain and sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun would never be able to forget that sad, shrill laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/dragon-king-with-seven-stars/dkss-chapter-14\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/dragon-king-with-seven-stars/dkss-chapter-16\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/dragon-king-with-seven-stars/dkss-chapter-15","bookId":1502,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:47 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:47 AM"}
