Alexander sensed her presence even before he vaulted over the fence, landing lightly on his feet. Through the darkness, he could see her, a slender form clad in green pants and a white, off-the-shoulder blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he closed the distance between them, Kara stood up and began walking toward him. They met near a flowering peach tree. For a moment, their gazes met, and then she was in his arms and he was kissing her, holding her, as though he would never again let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kara.\" He held her close, wanting to draw her goodness into him. She smelled of sunlight and flowers. Her skin was soft and warm. Closing his eyes, he let himself bask in her nearness, her warmth. Two hundred years, he thought. It had been two hundred years since he\u0027d last held a woman he cared for; two hundred years since he\u0027d let a woman care for him. He had forgotten how wonderful it was to hold and be held in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed you,\" Kara said. She looked upat him, startled by the intensity of his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you?\" His voice was deep and husky and unsteady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I thought about you all day.\" She glanced away, then met his gaze again. \"Did you think of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every waking moment.\" He slipped his arm around her waist and they walked over to the swing and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a phone call from the hospital today,\" Kara said. \"They want me to go to the hospital in Grenvale for some tests tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of tests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. Blood tests of some sort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. When I wasin the hospital, all the doctors could talk about was the remarkable recovery I had made, but now they want to do more tests. You don\u0027t think the blood they gave me was tainted, do you?\" She couldn\u0027t bring herself to voice her worst fears, but the threat of AIDS loomed large in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it wasn\u0027t.\" Alexander stared into the distance. He knew what they had found_a trace of his blood, alien blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you have a telephone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I find them an intrusion into my life, my privacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how do you stay in touch with your editor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By mail. I write during the day, and prefer to be undisturbed by phones ringing. I find it breaks my concentration.\" He took her hand in his. \"Did you try to call me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara nodded. \"A couple of weeks ago,\" she admitted. \"And then today, after I heard from the hospital, I wished I could call you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps I shall have to get a phone then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled up at him as if she\u0027d just won the lottery. \"I\u0027ll probably spend the night in Grenvale. Nana\u0027s going with me. She has an old friend who lives there. They\u0027re going to spend the day together while I\u0027m at the hospital.\" She stared down at his hand covering hers. \"Maybe you could call me tomorrow night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, you can use my cell phone. I\u0027ll be staying at the Grenvale Motel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex stared at the compact instrument for a moment, then nodded. \"I shall call you there,\" he said, tucking the phone into his pocket. \"And I will see you here Wednesday evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be looking forward to it.\" She chewed the inside of her lower lip a moment. \"Do you think maybe you could come by earlier on Wednesday night so we could spend more time together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you wish.\" He watched as her finger traced meaningless patterns on the back of his hand. His life had been like that, he thought, meaningless circles that started nowhere and went nowhere. Until now. \"What will your grandmother say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. I picked up my car from the repair shop today, and I\u0027ll be moving back to my own apartment on Thursday. I\u0027ll give you my address when I get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander nodded, although he already knew where she lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t born in this country, were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Why do you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the way you talk. I mean, there\u0027s nothing wrong with the way you talk. Oh, I don\u0027t know how to explain it. It\u0027s just the way you turn a phrase sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander smiled at her. How perceptive she was. English was not his first language, or even his second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you care to go out Thursday night?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Where shall we go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wherever you wish, Kara. A movie, perhaps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that. I\u0027ve been dying to see the new Mel Gibson flick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time shall I pick you up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven,\" he repeated solemnly. \"I should go now. It\u0027s late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clenched his fists, afraid to stay longer, afraid the yearning he felt for her would overcome his self-control. The bond they shared called to him, urging him to complete the ritual, to join his body to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning forward, his lips brushed hers in a quick kiss of farewell. \"I shall call you at the motel tomorrow night. And don\u0027t worry. Everything will be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, Kara? What do you wish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you could take me.\" Except for picking up her car that morning, she hadn\u0027t driven since the accident. It was silly to be afraid, but she couldn\u0027t help feeling apprehensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could, too. Unfortunately, I have an appointment tomorrow morning that I cannot break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\" It was like falling off a horse, she mused, and since Nana didn\u0027t drive, there was nothing to do but get back on, only in her case, it wasn\u0027t a horse but a dark green Camry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Kara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed into her eyes and wondered how she had managed to retain such innocence, such trust, in this day and age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a modern woman. She lived alone. She had a job, and yet he sensed a vulnerability about her that set her apart. Perhaps it was that very trait that reminded him of AnnaMara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara stared up at the doctor. His name was Dale Barrett. He was a tall, middle-aged man, with straight brown hair and pale brown eyes that did nothing to invite her trust. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid we don\u0027t, either, Miss Crawford. There\u0027s an unusual antibody in your blood that we\u0027ve never seen before. We want to do some extensive tests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More tests?\" Kara shook her head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Crawford, surely you can see how important it is that we determine the origin of this antibody. At the moment, we don\u0027t know what its effects might be. We must determine if it\u0027s contagious. I don\u0027t want to alarm you, but there\u0027s every possibility that this antibody could prove fatal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fatal! But how could that be? I feel fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand your concern, Miss Crawford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I\u0027ve already made all the arrangements. Your room is waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara jumped off the table. \"Now, wait a minute. I haven\u0027t agreed to this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I must insist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does Dr. Peterson know about this? Why isn\u0027t he here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be coming to see you as soon as you\u0027re settled.\" Barrett smiled reassuringly. \"Dr. Peterson is a fine doctor, but he\u0027s only a general practitioner. He wanted to be sure you got the best of care, and that\u0027s why he called me in as a consultant. My field of expertise is hematology.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic rose up in Kara as two men wearing white lab coats and masks entered the examining room. \"I want to talk to my grandmother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All in good time.\" Dr. Barrett pulled a syringe from his coat pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara took a step backward. \"What\u0027s that for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing to be alarmed about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just something to help you relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re on the verge of hysteria, Miss Crawford. This will calmyou.\" Barrett nodded at the two white-coated men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" She screamed the word as the two men took hold of her, flinched as she felt the prick of the needle in her arm. \"No, please . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up at the doctor, her vision blurring. This couldn\u0027t be happening. Alexander! Her mind screamed his name as she tumbled into oblivion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena Corley shook her head. \"I don\u0027t understand. What are you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ve found an abnormality in your granddaughter\u0027s blood, Mrs. Corley. We need to keep her here for further observation until we\u0027ve determined the cause of the abnormality and determined whether it might be contagious. Or toxic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did such a thing happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was there something wrong with the blood she received?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor shook his head. \"We screen all of our blood donors very carefully. That\u0027s why we\u0027re so confused. We have the names of the people whose blood was used. They\u0027ve all been rechecked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena Corley stared at the paper in front of her. They wanted her to admit Kara to the hospital for some extensive tests. The doctor, whose name was Barrett, had informed her that Kara had fainted during an examination and that she was still unconscious. They feared it had something to do with the abnormal red cells in her blood. It was urgent, the doctor said, that they find the cause of her problem as soon as possible. Until then, it was imperative that she be kept in isolation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think of your other granddaughter, Mrs. Corley. You don\u0027t want to take a risk of infecting her, now do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, of course not, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand, but you mustn\u0027t worry,\" Barrett said reassuringly. \"I promise you that we\u0027ll do everything we can for Kara.\" He handed her a pen. \"Just sign your name there, on the first page, and again on page four. I\u0027ll take care of everything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena shook her head as she squinted at the fine print. \"So many big words that I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. All that legal mumbo jumbo. All it says is that we have your permission to keep Kara overnight, and to prescribe treatment for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Corley, time is of the essence in cases like this. Do you really want to put Kara\u0027s life at risk by waiting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh of resignation, Lena signed the papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex called the Grenvale Motel at six o\u0027clock that evening, but the clerk informed him that Kara had not yet checked in. He knew a moment of concern, and then he shrugged it aside. She was a grown woman. Perhaps she had gone out to dinner or shopping. Grenvale was a big city, much larger than Moulton Bay, and it was still early. He would write a chapter, then call again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deeper-than-the-night/page-8.html","bookId":2308,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:00 PM"}
