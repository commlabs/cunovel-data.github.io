In fact, even the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander and the rest were stunned as they stared at Lin Dong. After all, they clearly knew how powerful the Zhou Yi duo was. At the very most, they could only match up to them in a one on one fight. Therefore, although Lin Dong’s fighting strength was comparable to a Samsara stage expert, wasn’t it a little of a stretch for him to fight against the two of them by himself?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRegardless, the current Lin Dong was merely at the advance Profound Death stage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLittle Flame was also taken back by Lin Dong’s words.

In fact, Zhou Yi was not even confident that he could defeat Lin Dong in a one on one fight.

Even though owing to circumstances, they had little choice but to join the Four Titans Palace, it was inevitable for them to have secret designs.

Subsequently, the hurricane began to rotate. Within ten breaths’ time, it transformed into a ten thousand feet large tornado. Meanwhile, that tornado was filled with a terrifying ripping force.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong’s eyes were still tightly shut as he stood in front of that giant.
