If a robot can follow simple orders and do the housework, or run simple machines in a cut-and-dried, repetitive way, we would be perfectly satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstructing a robot is hard because you must fit a very compact computer inside its skull, if it is to have a vaguely human shape. Making a sufficiently complex computer as compact as the human brain is also hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut robots aside, why bother making a computer that compact? The units that make up a computer have been getting smaller and smaller, to be sure-from vacuum tubes to transistors to tiny integrated circuits and silicon chips. Suppose that, in addition to making the units smaller, we also make the whole structure bigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brain that gets too large would eventually begin to lose efficiency because nerve impulses don\u0027t travel very quickly. Even the speediest nerve impulses travel at only about 3.75 miles a minute. A nerve impulse can flash from one end of the brain to the other in one four-hundred-fortieth of a second, but a brain 9 miles long, if we could imagine one, would require 2.4 minutes for a nerve impulse to travel its length. The added complexity made possible by the enormous size would fall apart simply because of the long wait for information to be moved and processed within it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComputers, however, use electric impulses that travel at more than 11 million miles per minute. A computer 400 miles wide would still flash electric impulses from end to end in about one four-hundred-fortieth of a second. In that respect, at least, a computer of that asteroidal size could still process information as quickly as the human brain could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf, therefore, we imagine computers being manufactured with finer and finer components, more and more intricately interrelated, and also imagine those same computers becoming larger and larger, might it not be that the computers would eventually become capable of doing all the things a human brain can do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there a theoretical limit to how intelligent a computer can become?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never heard of any. It seems to me that each time we learn to pack more complexity into a given volume, the computer can do more. Each time we make a computer larger, while keeping each portion as densely complex as before, the computer can do more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, if we learn how to make a computer sufficiently complex and sufficiently large, why should it not achieve a human intelligence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people are sure to be disbelieving and say, \"But how can a computer possibly produce a great symphony, a great work of art, a great new scientific theory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe retort I am usually tempted to make to this question is, \"Can you?\" But, of course, even if the questioner is ordinary, there are extraordinary people who are geniuses. They attain genius, however, only because atoms and molecules within their brains are arranged in some complex order. There\u0027s nothing in their brains but atoms and molecules. If we arrange atoms and molecules in some complex order in a computer, the products of genius should be possible to it; and if the individual parts are not as tiny and delicate as those of the brain, we compensate by making the computer larger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people may say, \"But computers can only do what they\u0027re programmed to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer to that is, \"True. But brains can do only what they\u0027re programmed to do-by their genes. Part of the brain\u0027s programming is the ability to learn, and that will be part of a complex computer\u0027s programming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, if a computer can be built to be as intelligent as a human being, why can\u0027t it be made more intelligent as well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not, indeed? Maybe that\u0027s what evolution is all about. Over the space of three billion years, hit-and-miss development of atoms and molecules has finally produced, through glacially slow improvement, a species intelligent enough to take the next step in a matter of centuries, or even decades. Then things will really move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if computers become more intelligent than human beings, might they not replace us? Well, shouldn\u0027t they? They may be as kind as they are intelligent and just let us dwindle by attrition. They might keep some of us as pets, or on reservations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen too, consider what we\u0027re doing to ourselves right now-to all living things and to the very planet we live on. Maybe it is time we were replaced. Maybe the real danger is that computers won\u0027t be developed to the point of replacing us fast enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI present this view only as something to think about. I consider a quite different view in \"Intelligences Together\" later in this collection. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/robot-visions-robot-0-5/page-23.html","bookId":1742,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:28 AM"}
