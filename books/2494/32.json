I watched as scattered and random holes in the ground opened like mouths and the dead rodents melted into the earth, the holes closing over them like repaired wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met Parker\u0027s eyes. \"It\u0027s a whole new world,\" I noted quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" Jade said, her eyes going from Simone to Paxton, \"what\u0027s this Noah\u0027s Ark thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled but Parker didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine faded and Jade went on, \"I remember this story. God chose three couples to be saved, saved from the flood...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevaeh huffed. \"That\u0027s just a myth, Jade... you know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Then why is it I found it in the tone of his thoughts?\" she asked indicating me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevaeh\u0027s eyes narrowed on Jade and that protective urge sprung to life, our children a pair between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mommy\u0027s mad,\" Pax said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine too,\" Simone agreed, giggling behind her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u0027s eyes widened but I was unsurprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker nodded. \"As you would say, Caleb: they\u0027ve got the whole tamale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think they planned on this happening.\" Parker looked at us while a lone family played at a safe distance on this cool fall day, the leaves skittering across the ground as we faced off, the sky a deep and resolute blue above us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe family remained ignorant, having entered the scene after the dead squirrel episode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost laughed, even though none of these revelations were remotely funny. We had children that had every paranormal ability there\u0027d ever been. Because they\u0027d laid a Trojan horse within our genetic code, freaked out, and injected us with a sterilizing concoction that hadn\u0027t worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker watched my ruminations, then nodded. \"The group that worked to make sure us Randoms were protected made certain the mules could have children. The Helix Complex never thought about Clyde, however.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooseflesh covered my body and I heard Jade gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker grinned. \"By nature\u0027s laws, he should no longer be. Yet... he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew this, hell, Clyde and I got together all the time, his children with Roberta Gale were not only accepted but welcomed. The former prejudice against his undead status was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny how humanity would forgive anything when faced with extinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So there are three pair?\" Jade reiterated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker nodded. \"Clyde\u0027s a wild card but Nevaeh and Caleb, they\u0027re a \u0027known\u0027,\" Parker said with airquotes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a ominous thought. \"Who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker shrugged. \"No one. The people that knew are gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God, I thought. I didn\u0027t want a rinse and repeat with yet another organization trying to lay hands on my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker met my eyes. I could see he didn\u0027t either. He\u0027d scratched and clawed his way to be where he was today. From a life of domestic abuse and murder, to an organization that exploited him for his ability, intelligence and natural gifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, this is what he deserved, wrangling an unlikely happy ending through brute force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s what we both deserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d met me here to tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd warn me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuly noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep in touch,\" Parker said, ending it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed his hand, our flesh squeezing together in a brutal pact of understanding and kinship. Honed through circumstance and alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker and I were in this together, our future uncertain, our present secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him leave the park, a girl in each hand and Nevaeh alongside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tucked Jade against me, unconsciously turning her belly closer to my side, my hand on Pax\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI led my family toward our car and to the security of our home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes that watched us were thoughtful and remained unseen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaxton turned once and looked into the dense trees that bordered the open park. He looked beyond the jungle gym playthings into the dark branches that twined together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, buddy?\" I asked, following his deep gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he said, but a small furrow marred the perfect skin between his brows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ruffled his hair. \"How about some ice cream?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax\u0027s face broke out in a grin, thoughts of dead squirrels and that troubling presence melting away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah!\" he yelled in a voice that had recently lost the sound of babyhood. He jumped in the back seat, I buckled the toddler restraint around him and stepped back, his eyes once again straying to the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked where he did and Jade said, \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" My eyes searched the gloom beyond. Seeing nothing I rounded the front of the car and slid in, my family safely encased inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook off the misgivings of the moment, ice cream on the brain and pulsed on the Camaro, conceding its days were numbered. With another kid on the way, I\u0027d have to get practical in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was always Gramps\u0027 vintage Bronco I could talk him out of. I grinned as Jade slid her arm through mine and I kissed her forehead, flicking my eyes to the rear view mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Paxton\u0027s eyes remained on the deepness of the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pulled away, leaving that gloomy moment behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes that had been watching continued until my car was out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe End \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unrequited-death-death-6/page-32.html","bookId":2494,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:49:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:49:25 PM"}
