I smile and nod, \"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom squeezes my hand again, \"I slept like I haven’t slept in a hundred years.\" She laughs and I know the sound. It\u0027s distant but I remember it. Like wind chimes I once heard but will remember every time I hear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and nod, \"I know that feeling.\" I remember her voice. I like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe eat breakfast and laugh and hug. She pours my coffee and he smiles when he passes me the butter. My brothers bicker and make fun of me with Shell. I feel like I\u0027m at Shell\u0027s but these are mine. I belong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours later, sitting in the car with Stuart driving, I\u0027m lost in what to do. I refused to go back with Eli and he wasn\u0027t bold enough to drag me to his car in front of my Dad and brothers. I have a Dad and brothers. Protection of my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are so awesome.\" Shell smiles at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance up and nod, \"Awesome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart looks at me in the rearview, \"I love them dude. So amazing. Your mom is demanding we all come for Easter. Is that cool?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"It is. I want you guys there too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShell narrows her eyes, \"What did Eli do? You looked ready to murder him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"The usual shit. You know Eli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart nods but Shell shakes her head, \"I don\u0027t actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"Well you\u0027re not missing much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart laughs, \"Oh you\u0027re missing a lot. It\u0027s just whether you want to see what all you\u0027re missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look behind us and see him. He\u0027s so close I can see the cold anger in his eyes. It makes me nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart looks at me, \"He says I have to take you to his place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back and give him the finger. I send a message to Sebastian quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Meet me at front entrance of the Mandarin Oriental building in ten-minutes please.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay. You alright?\u0027 He texts me back too quickly. Like he was waiting for my message. It hurts but I need him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yup.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate what I\u0027m about to do. I\u0027m selfish sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pull up in front of the building. I dash from the SUV and run across the road to the white Porsche parked out front. I jump in and point, \"Just drive, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone rings. I glance at it and sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on? Are you alright?\" Sebastian looks confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No. I needed to talk to you.\" I look at him as the engine revs. \"Can you take me to the dorms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks angry and I don’t blame him. He sighs and turns up a road. \"Are you breaking up with me?\" He glances at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"It\u0027s not that I\u0027m breaking up with you. I\u0027m freeing you from the insanity that is me.\" I turn and face him, \"You told me you didn’t want some other guy\u0027s girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licks his lips and nods. I hate what I about to do to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat and speak softly, \"Fourteen years ago a boy held his hand out for me. He rescued me from my prison. I have never gotten past it. No matter what I do, or where I go, all I see is his hand. His fucked up, bizarre, damaged hand.\" I stop and listen to myself. I shake my head, \"I realize I\u0027m not even making sense. But let me just say this, no matter what happens in this world, I will always be that guy\u0027s girl. I\u0027ve made him so big in my mind that I can\u0027t even move around in there. It\u0027s not that I can even be with him. I just won\u0027t ever be without him. I\u0027ll never be whole without him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns, \"This is insanity. You\u0027re going on the emotions of your family and the feelings that are overwhelming you. You need to distance yourself and find your true feelings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From both of you.\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me with the greenest hazel eyes ever and the most broken look on his face. I force myself to look at him and see every ounce of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops the car and looks down, \"Yesterday was amazing. I don’t even know what to say about it all. But I think I\u0027m out of patience, Sarah. I won\u0027t be back or waiting around. I think I\u0027ve gone as far as I can, waiting for you to get better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" I want to tell him I\u0027ll never be better. This is better. But I don’t want to prolong the conversation. I just want out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me and smiles bitterly, \"I\u0027m leaving Boston. I\u0027m going to Los Angeles for work and I don’t know when I will be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans over and kisses my cheek so softly it barely touches, \"Take care of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. You too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks back at the steering wheel. I climb out, hating myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brain hurts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI storm up the steps to my building and to my room. I open the door and collapse on the bed. I grab the remote and switch on the TV. I don’t think I\u0027ll ever be able to watch Amelie again. I turn on a vampire movie and hang with my people, the stupid girls who always pick the monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day I\u0027m walking across the path to my dorm when my phone vibrates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull it out of my pocket and answer it with anger worthy of the annoyance of him calling every five-minutes. \"WHAT!\" I snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice is desperate. All the anger is gone. \"You have to see this isn’t about you. She wants you and I under her thumb. I haven’t had a session with her since it happened. She isn’t my therapist. It isn’t even a big deal. You slept with that Sebastian fellow on your birthday and I never brought it up. I haven’t been with anyone since I found you. I swear to god. I haven’t slept with anyone since I found you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"YOU LET ME GO THERE! YOU LET HER TREAT ME! YOU TWO FUCKING TORTURED ME IN A CELL! YOU FUCKED A WOMAN YOU LET TORTURE ME!\" I forget I\u0027m in the middle of the path on campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"SHE IS THE BEST, SARAH. FOR FUCK\u0027S SAKE!\" He screams and swears. He\u0027s mad. I hang up, slightly panicking. He is never that mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run to my dorm and pack my bag. I\u0027m opening the door when Shell walks in. She frowns, \"What\u0027s happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to go box. I just need it.\" She sees my face and texts Stuart and grabs her bag too. She loops her arm through mine and walks with me down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell Shell Shell what\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I just need time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you and Eli hash things out?\" She asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her like she is crazy, \"Hash out what? He slept with our therapist and let her treat me. She loves him or is obsessed with him and lied about his feelings for me. She told me he liked me because he\u0027d mentally made me his sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe holds my arm tight and walks me across the campus to the SUV. She stops just shy of it and looks at me, \"You know I\u0027m the biggest Sebastian fan ever. I have long wished you would beat this thing you have with Eli and marry Sebastian. I was thinking senior year, in Chicago. Let your mom and my mom plan everything so we can listen to them bicker about how you\u0027re actually Italian from my side of the family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"I don’t think that anymore. I have never been team Eli, but after watching him with you, I am all team Eli. I am one hundred percent Eli. He is so in love with you. He took care of you and forced you out of survival orphan mode. He has spent his entire life either looking for you or figuring out the way to help you. He has no one, Sarah. No one. His parents are ridiculous and his therapist is a tart. He hasn’t had girlfriends or anything. I have grilled Stuart like a mutha. That boy has literally spent his life devoted to you. All you. Not his sister. Not replacing you with her. Just you. He had the tombstone made for Emalyn. He was the one who started the Emalyn Adams Foundation for victims of child abuse. Stuart said he did that to get closure. There is a whole other Eli we don’t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slump, \"Well shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs, \"I know right. All that badass and tattoos and he\u0027s a fucking score. It\u0027s so not fair.\" She grins. I nudge her and walk to the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk at Stuart, \"Thanks for coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods at Shell, \"I was already here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and climb in. We drive over to the gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look out the window processing everything she said. It sounds true. In my heart, which is blind to his faults, it feels right. He loves me. I know he does. God I hope he does. I hate the control he has, but at the same time I\u0027m so grateful he has it. He has me and everything else taken care of. In a twisted way, loaded with codependency, I love that about him. I trust him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pull into the gym parking lot. I climb out on my own and point at Stuart, \"Stop.\" He backs off and laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoulder my bag and walk up to the doors. I don’t feel like boxing suddenly. I feel like closing up and refusing the entire world so I can sit and ponder the shit I don’t want to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone vibrates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where are you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at it and rub my thumb over the screen where the snow is falling. I shake my head muttering, \"God I hate Boston. I hate snow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShell laughs. \"Oh my god, me too. I just want to go to Cuba for like two weeks and lay on a beach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart smirks, \"Spring break?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins, \"For real?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and pulls her into his embrace. My heart hurts. I walk inside, leaving them making out in the goddamned snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tape up my hands and walk slowly out to the rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Do you have a GPS tracker on me?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs but it doesn’t reach his eyes, \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cross my arms, \"What? What do you want to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns and walks away. I follow. He\u0027s still got the control. He climbs into a ring. I look around and see the gym is empty of other people. I climb into the ring with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brings over gloves and pulls them on to my hands, delicately. More so than he has ever been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe speaks softly, still confidently though, \"She is the best. She was the only one who believed that you could be rescued and I needed you.\" His eyes are wide and filled with tears. \"I needed you.\" His vulnerability scares me. He walks slowly to get his gloves and slides his hands into them. \"No one believed me about you - that I didn’t invent you. No one saw me as a hero. No one but you, and for that belief in me that you had, I let you down. I left you sleeping in that barn, thinking it would be better if you didn’t have to see the police. I was protecting you even then. You have never, nor will you ever, be my sister. I know I\u0027m messed up and I am insane in so many different ways, but the fact you could believe me capable of such a horrific thing…\" He looks at me as a single tear leaks from his icy-blue eye, \"It kills me inside.\" His statement and his face break my heart. Somehow I\u0027m the bad guy again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-41.html","bookId":1888,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM"}
