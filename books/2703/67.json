I had no idea what did what, but I knew I had to do something, so I turned hard on the first lever-looking thing I found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the stupid thing came off in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater spurted out the hole I’d just created and sprayed me right in the face. I gasped and lifted my hands to protect myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way was I going to touch anything else after that. Soaking wet, I sprinted out of the bathroom and pounded on Cora’s door before shoving it open. “Cora! Cora?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light from the hallway splayed over an empty, neatly made bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. She couldn’t be gone now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to calm myself, I blew out a breath, but I could hear the water still drenching the bathroom. Water dripped off my face and coated my clothes as I raced barefoot from the apartment and down the hall to the elevator. I would’ve run the entire eight flights down, because I was in a running mood, but the elevator was faster...even though it felt like it took forever since I had to just stand there and wait for it to take me to the ground floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry, the faithful doorman, was not in his usual spot. I stared wide-eyed and gripped my head, not sure what to do now. I was sure there had to be a super somewhere in the building who could help me, but Cora had never told me who or where to go for emergencies like these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I had to ride the elevator back up to our apartment and find my cell phone in my room to call her. But her phone immediately went to voice mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d told me she was going to spend the evening with Quinn before she’d left earlier, so I didn’t even think. I called him next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, he sounded awake when he answered on the second ring. “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice sent a jolt through me, but I shook it off as quickly as possible. “Hi,” I rushed out. “I’m so sorry for waking you. It’s Zoey. I’m looking for Cora, but her phone’s turned off. Please tell me she’s still there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still...here?” he sounded vaguely confused. “She’s not with me if that’s what you’re asking. I thought she said she was doing something with you tonight. Everything okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy roommate had lied. Again. What a surprise. But I had no time to dwell on that right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um...sure.” I cringed. “No, not really. I broke...something in the bathroom. Water is spraying everywhere, and I don’t know how to turn it off or where the number for our building’s superintendent is. Then Henry wasn’t at the front door. And Cora’s...” Who knew where Cora was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be right there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as my insides leapt with relief and joy, they shuddered with worry. Him, me, alone. Not such a good idea. “No, Quinn. You don’t have to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he’d already hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled at the dead phone, but the sound of rushing water from the bathroom called my attention back to things at hand. So I hustled down the hall and peered in at the disaster. Everything inside was splattered and drenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoping to catch as much of it as possible, I dashed to the kitchen and threw open cupboards, looking for as many bowls and pots and pans as I could find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, I’d devised a system where I held a bowl right over the direct spray and could aim it to pour into a pan on the floor. When that one got full, I aimed it to the next pot in line beside it and tried to wrangle the full bowl into the bathtub with one hand to drain it. My arms were screaming in agony; I wasn’t sure how much longer I could keep this up. So it was a relief to hear someone knock on the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting go of my hold on the main bowl, which let the water spray out again, I hurried to answer the door, hoping the building super had miraculously sensed a problem and was here to rescue me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is the water still on?” he asked, his gaze running over my soaked clothes and hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Miserable and almost in tears, I clutched my wet head. “I have no clue how to turn it off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped into the apartment. “Let’s have a look.” I followed him back, nearly having to skip into a run to keep up with his long-legged stride. He wore a ball cap, tight black T-shirt and jeans that looked...really nice on him, especially when he bent over to reach for something behind the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf a second later, the water stopped spraying him in the chest. He let out a sigh before he sat back on his haunches to glance over at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled and crossed my arms over my wet chest. “Oh, that’s not even right how fast you fixed that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “Sorry.” Then his gaze skipped around the bathroom before he murmured, “Wow.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-67.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
