The car’s not even here,” he confirmed, waving at the empty drive. I relaxed and followed behind Johnny closely, up to the house. I was barely able to breathe. As he opened the front door I gripped hold of the back of his t-shirt. He chuckled. “Amber, there’s no one here,” he assured me, shaking his head as he wrapped his arm around my shoulders, pulling me into the house. The house was gorgeous. “Want a drink?” he offered, leading me into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, sure.” I looked around at all of the expensive ornaments and furniture. “You could fit my whole house into your lounge and kitchen,” I said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “This is house is nice, but it’s too big for just us. I don’t know why they had to buy such an expensive one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does my father do now then?” I asked curiously, as he handed me a can of Pepsi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stocks and shares. He’s some big broker or something, I don’t really understand it. He makes a lot of money though,” he said casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still doing that then, that’s what he did when we were kids. I didn’t want to talk about him anymore; being in his house was freaking me out more than enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you and Kate, huh?” I teased, trying to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blushed and nodded. “She’s nice,” he muttered nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned at his blush, he really was adorable. “She said you kissed her.” I raised my eyebrows excitedly, waiting for details. I’d had her version of the ‘perfect kiss’ now I wanted his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “Yeah, did she say if she liked it?” he asked, blushing harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh hell yeah she did! “Yeah, she liked it a lot,” I confirmed, waggling my eyebrows at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “Well thank goodness for that.” He sounded so relieved that I couldn’t help but laugh too. “I was thinking about asking her out, properly, you know, being exclusive. Do you think she’d go for that?” he asked, looking at me hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned at his worried face. “Hell yeah she’d go for that.” Kate really liked him, she would definitely be exclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and messed up the back of his hair. “Awesome! Thanks, Amber.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go get changed then and let’s go eat. I’m starved,” I instructed, nodding to the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“OK. I’ll be five minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. “You can shower and stuff if you want, I don’t mind waiting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you saying I smell?” he asked, laughing, as he made his way to the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I was trying to be polite,” I joked. He laughed and skipped off up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down at the kitchen counter, happily drinking my Pepsi, playing with his trophy, when I heard the front door open and a lady talking. “No, I just need to give him some medicine and put him to bed,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my breath catch in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, he hasn’t stopped f**king crying,” my father snapped, sounding annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped out of the chair so fast that I nearly fell over. I moved to the other side of the counter, needing to put something between us if he was coming in here. My heart was crashing in my chest. I couldn’t breathe properly. There was a door behind me; I grabbed the handle, desperately wanting to get away before he came in. I couldn’t see him; I couldn’t let him see me. Rattling the handle I quickly realised that the door was locked. I could feel the tears starting to prickle in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Stephen. I’ll put him to bed in a minute, he’ll sleep it off,” the lady said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He f**king better, he’s giving me a headache,” he growled angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rammed my hand into my pocket, grabbing my cellphone. Who I was planning on calling I don’t know. Liam and Jake were too far away, and Johnny was probably in the shower. There was no one, no help; I was alone in my horror. I turned around facing the door, waiting for him to come in. I felt sick. Oh God, was I actually going to throw up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady walked in, carrying a whining little blond boy in her arms, stroking his back soothingly. Her eyes snapped to me and she jumped a mile, obviously not knowing I was in here. “Hi, sorry, I didn’t realise Johnny had friends over,” she said, smiling at me warmly. She was very pretty, brown hair and grey eyes, just like my mom’s and mine. I nodded, unable to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Johnny’s got friends over?” my father asked as he walked through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt dizzy, my legs were weak, he looked almost exactly the same, just a little older, a little less hair and more greys. His eyes were hard and stern like they used to be, not like the photo that Johnny showed me. He hadn’t changed at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me, his eyes raking over every part of my body while I just stood there, unable to move, unable to breathe. I felt like I was a kid again. I was terrified, and this time I had no Jake to protect me. The man that ruined my childhood, my brothers childhood, was standing less than fifteen feet from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amber,” he said quietly. He smiled and I felt bile rise in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amber?” the lady repeated, looking between him and me. “Your daughter, Amber?” she asked, a smile tugging at her lips. My father nodded, his eyes not leaving mine. I felt like a deer trapped in the headlights of an oncoming car, and all I could do was brace myself for the impact. “Well, it’s great to meet you at last. I’ve heard so much about you from Stephen and Johnny that I feel like I already know you,” the lady chirped, smiling warmly at me. I tried to smile back and pretend that everything was fine, that I wasn’t about to pass out any second, that I wasn’t about five seconds from screaming the house down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You too, Ruby,” I replied quietly, dragging my eyes away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here, Amber?” my father asked, raising his eyebrows and smiling a half smile. The sound of his voice sent chills down my spine as I tried desperately not to remember my childhood. I had nightmares about his voice, his eyes, the way he stood so straight, and how his fists were always clenched, just like they were now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I….. I came with Johnny. He’s…. he’s getting changed,” I stuttered. Immediately I was mentally scolding myself because I was stuttering. His old rules were coming back, stand tall, speak clearly, no mumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby smiled. “Well, it’s great that you’re here. Would you like to stay for dinner? I think we’re getting a takeout because there’s not much food in. We weren’t due back until later tonight, but Matt’s been ill all weekend so we came back early,” Ruby explained as she kissed the baby’s head softly. She seemed really nice, too nice for this abusive asshole. I shook my head, I couldn’t speak again. My hands were shaking so I clasped them together tightly, trying to remain in control and not slump into a pile on the floor and sob. “You sure? It’s no trouble. We’d love to have you stay for dinner, wouldn’t we, Stephen?” she continued, smiling at him, completely oblivious that I was living my worst nightmare right now. He nodded, his gaze travelling the length of my body, making me go cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure, thanks,” I said quietly, my voice breaking at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little boy started crying again. Ruby’s eyes went wide as she looked at Stephen. “I’ll just give him some medicine and put him down for a sleep,” she said, heading over to a cupboard pulling out a medicine bottle and spoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father walked a couple of steps towards me and I shrank back against the door, my breathing coming out in shallow gasps. I thumbed my phone open and dialled Johnny - he was the closest person, if I could just call him and somehow tell him to get the hell downstairs, then we could leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How have you been, Amber? I’ve been trying to see you for years but your brother wouldn’t let me,” he stated, sneering on the word brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been trying to see me and Jake didn’t tell me? Why the hell wouldn’t he tell me something like that? Knowing Jake, he probably thought he was protecting me. I looked at Johnny’s mother for help; she was putting the medicine bottle back now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been fine, thank you,” I answered. I glanced down at my phone, it was still trying to connect, Johnny wasn’t answering. Damn it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll just put Matt to bed, then I’ll be back and make some coffee or something,” Ruby suggested, smiling kindly at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“OK, love,” my father replied, his eyes not leaving mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulped; I couldn’t be here with him on my own! “Can I come with you?” I asked desperately. Ruby looked at me a little shocked. “I’d like to see Matt’s room, if that’s OK,” I lied quickly. There was no way I was staying in here with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think that’s a good idea, Amber. Matt’s not well. You can see his room another time,” my father interjected before Ruby could answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby smiled. “I’ll be right back.” She headed out of the room with the little boy clinging around her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped to the side and almost ran out of the room after her. Just as I passed him, he grabbed my wrist, yanking me to a stop, almost making me fall. I felt the scream trying to rip itself out of my throat but I swallowed it back down, I couldn’t show him how much power he had over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look beautiful, Amber. Just like your mother when she was your age. You always were a f**king peach,” he purred, licking his lips as he trailed his hand across my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brought my knee up and kneed him as hard as I could in the groin, yanking my arm from his hold and streaking for the hallway as fast as my legs could carry me. I had no idea where I should go though. I came here in Johnny’s car so I didn’t want to just run out of the house with nowhere to go. So instead, I ran up the stairs, streaking down the hallway until I spotted a door with an ‘Enter at your own risk’ hazard sign hanging on it. That one had to be Johnny’s. I didn’t bother knocking as I burst through the door, slamming it behind me and bursting into hysterical sobs as I leant against it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-boy-who-sneaks-in-my-bedroom-window/page-43.html","bookId":1780,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:44 AM"}
