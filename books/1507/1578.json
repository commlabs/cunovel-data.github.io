In fact, their connections to this place have been almost completely severed. Now they roam the eternally boundless Universe, where they walk the path of that which exists beyond Transcendence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As for you... you are also destined to walk that path. They... are waiting for you out in the Universe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoumen Tai’s body gradually began to fade, transforming into a huge, rumbling vortex that sucked the Li Clan into it before vanishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe starry sky rumbled as a huge rift was torn open into it. Then the Devil Realm Continent went silent. The only things that remained behind were the faint echoes of Choumen Tai’s parting words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the silence that reigned after Choumen Tai’s departure, the forces from the Vast Expanse School looked around in shock at the decay around them. They had their various speculations about what exactly was happening, but they did nothing. One by one, they began to look over at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them. They were profound and deep, to the extent that no one would ever be able to tell what he was thinking. He looked around at the ruins of the Devil Realm, then sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s over,” he said softly. “My hatred for the Immortal God and Devil Realm Continents has come to an end. The hatred which festered for countless years is now resolved.” As of this moment, Meng Hao realized that his hatred for the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm wasn’t even as intense as his hatred toward the 33 Heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had walked a path of slaughter and confusion, and as of this moment, despite having Transcended, his heart was exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My enmity with the Immortal God and the Devil Realm has come to an end, but the true battle has yet to be fought!” His eyes flickered as he looked up at the starry sky. Within his divine sense, he had long since come to detect that out there in the starry sky, there were countless figures speeding in his direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were countless living beings of all sorts, heading in his direction under the control of the will of the Vast Expanse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew full well that he and the will of the Vast Expanse had reached a point where only one would come out alive. The other would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he looked out into the starry sky, the Devil Realm Continent began to shake. Just like the Immortal God Continent, it began to transform into a huge giant that radiated the aura of the will of the Vast Expanse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything here had been defiled. This land mass was not the true Devil Realm; it was merely a doppelgänger made from the will of the Vast Expanse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntense rumbling shook Heaven and Earth as the Devil Realm Continent transformed into a giant. The mountain peaks became spikes that protruded from its skin. The mountain ranges became blood vessels, as did the rivers and the seas. Lands shook, and mountains were rocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntense rumbling could be heard as a face appeared. Two of the land mass’s seas sank down into pitch black holes that were like eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, those eyes opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge arm appeared, and its hand clenched into a fist which rumbled toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that were all there were to it, it might not much to be concerned about, but it was at this point that, off in the distance, countless beams of light appeared. They came from all directions, seemingly endless, charging forward in a murderous attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entities within those beams of light were all very bizarre. The only similarity between all of them was that they were life forms from the starry sky of the Vast Expanse. They had been born here, and thus, had no choice but to heed the commands of the will of the Vast Expanse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the starry sky of the Vast Expanse wanted them to attack and exterminate Meng Hao and everything around him, then they wouldn’t hesitate at all to accomplish that mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling could be heard as they got closer and closer. The old lizard roared as it went on the offensive. Behind the gigantic lizard was the head, then the cultivators of the Vast Expanse School. After all the fighting they had just gone through, their killing intent was no less, and they didn\u0027t hesitate to charge towards the host of entities. Instantly, fierce battles broke out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked around at everything, at the host of living beings, and the giant’s fist, and he began to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Vast Expanse and I cannot exist together. Therefore, I will... topple the Vast Expanse!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Without destruction, there cannot be creation. Allheaven, if you can become the will of the starry sky, then you can also be replaced. Neither the Ghost, the Devil nor the God succeeded in that. But this time... I will!” Meng Hao’s eyes were glowing as brightly as suns. The incoming horde of living creatures was completely shocked by the sight of it, and yet there was a voice in their minds urging them on, telling them to pay any price to unleash slaughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire starry sky was soon shaking. Meng Hao turned, clenching his hand into a fist to meet the incoming fist of the Devil Realm giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was like a bug compared to the giant, completely insignificant. When their fists met, a massive boom echoed out. Meng Hao’s hair rose up a bit, and he shivered slightly. However, the Devil Realm Continent giant immediately began to shake, and then began to fall apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore it could retreat, Meng Hao took a step forward, placing himself at the giant’s abdomen, where he stamped his foot down. Cracks spread out like a spiderweb, whereupon he took a second step, right above the giant\u0027s dantian. Another massive boom echoed out. Then Meng Hao took a third step, a fourth step, and a fifth step....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith every step he took, he stamped his foot down onto the giant’s body. By the time he reached the giant\u0027s chest, he was on his fifth step. The giant was shaking visibly, swaying back and forth, seemingly incapable of holding itself together. It was at that point that Meng Hao took his sixth step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat step placed him onto the giant’s forehead!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCracking sounds echoed out, and more rifts snaked out, spreading from the forehead out across the giant’s entire body. The giant roared as if it were about to fight back, but then Meng Hao snorted coldly and took his final step... the seventh step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat step put him on the crown of the giant\u0027s head!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne final step crushed anything and everything!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-10-chapter-1574\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-10-chapter-1576\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-10-chapter-1575","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
