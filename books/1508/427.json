Jiang Huan had used this method of seclusion in order to delay the embers of his flickering life from fading. He greatly hoped that he would be able to maintain his feeble existence and linger on in the world until the day that Jiang Baoyun made a breakthrough to the extreme Xiantian realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOnly such a super powerhouse like that would be able to guarantee the stability of the Seven Profound Valleys.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTherefore in these past years, regardless of any matter, Jiang Huan rarely left his cave mansion, and that why was rumors had been passed along in the smaller sects that Jiang Huan was in life or death closed door seclusion.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I know…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs Jiang Huan slowly spoke, his voice had a faint dying energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn fact, Jiang Huan had already been made aware of the situation ever since Lin Ming had broken into the Seven Profound Valleys, and was very clear on the entire process of what had happened.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShi Zongtian hesitated and said, “Should I go and speak with Lin Ming?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAlthough the Sword Faction and Acacia Faction had many disagreements, and even many areas in which they were complete and polar opposites, they were still in the same sect. Lin Ming had killed one after another within the Acacia Faction, and this would ruin their Sword Faction’s reputation too. If this spread out, then others would say that the Seven Profound Valleys had been invaded by a 20-something year old baby, and no one dared to even admonish him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJiang Huang said, “There’s no point in you going. Since Lin Ming came to the Seven Profound Valleys, he naturally has something to rely on. If it’s as you said and Lin Ming truly does have a reason to take revenge, then Ouyang Boyan wouldn’t have sat idly by. I thought that he would rely on the Acacia Faction and pay off Lin Ming with some high price, but I never thought that he would underestimate Lin Ming’s strength to this degree. In truth, it wasn’t just him who underestimated Lin Ming, but also me. I never would have dreamed that Lin Ming’s strength was already formidable to this degree!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShi Zongtian listened silently, not speaking. He had a certain understanding of Lin Ming’s personality. Even if he went, he would just lose face in the end no matter what he did. If that was the case, then he might as well not go. Not just that, but Lin Ming also came here riding a Vermillion Bird. The Vermillion Bird represented Divine Phoenix Island and wouldn’t recklessly attack the Seven Profound Valleys, but it was still a form of deterrence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThinking things over, Shi Zongtian sighed. Finally, he decided not to involve himself with this matter.

The Vermillion Bird shot into the sky. Nobody dared to stop Lin Ming. In the view of the surrounding martial artists, Lin Ming had forced his way into the Acacia Faction and killed several of their Great Elders. But, the other six factions of the Seven Profound Valleys hadn’t even appeared, and Lin Ming had cockily sauntered his way out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe banquet naturally couldn’t continue. The martial artists from the small sects quickly excused themselves and left. After the seven Great Elders had been completely wasted by Lin Ming alone, the one with the highest status left on scene was Ouyang Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe martial artists quickly spoke their farewells to Ouyang Ming. Ouyang Ming ruefully smiled, he never thought that the celebratory banquet the Acacia Faction held today would have such a result.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOuyang Ming was no longer inclined to think about Lin Ming. He and Lin Ming were destined to follow different paths and tread on different worlds. He wouldn’t take Lin Ming as his goal in life; instead, he would just believe that Lin Ming no longer existed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe wind howled.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming, Qin Xingxuan, and Qin Ziya all stood atop the Vermillion Bird.

There were already many conflicts between the Zither Faction and the Acacia Faction. Although I have offended the Acacia Faction this time, it won’t affect me much.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Martial House Master Qin, how about switching sects?

He had spent half his life cultivating the zither, it was impossible for him to branch out and practice other cultivation methods again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Then, I must separate with Martial House Master Qin. When I was stranded within the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm, it was all thanks to Martial House Master Qin that Xingxuan remained safe for as long as she did. I, Lin Ming, will engrave this kindness onto my mind.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eQin Ziya laughed and said, “If it wasn’t for you, I would never have stepped into the Xiantian realm. If we are speaking of kindnesses, then yours is greater than mine. This time in helping Miss Qin, the truth is that I didn’t play much of a role, I could only do as much as I could in order to not frustrate my thoughts.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTo those from the Zither Faction and Sword Faction who were mostly honest and held a greater value towards integrity, they would never feel comfortable if they owed anyone anything. Only when they returned the favor would they feel at peace. So in general, these individuals didn’t often owe favors to others.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Lin Ming, this is where we part. I bid you farewell, take care of yourself.” Qin Ziya waved his sleeves, and then leapt down from the Vermillion Bird.

Transferring news was often a very slow and arduous process. In order to activate a sound transmission array once, it required a great amount of true essence stones, and would also wear down the limited integrity of the array formation, shortening its life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn normal circumstances, the current Seven Profound Martial House Master who was also Ouyang Boyan’s disciple would only make a report to Ouyang Boyan once a month.
