To Romy\u0027s horror, she\u0027d had to watch while Betsy cracked open Meerm\u0027s chest and manually compressed her heart. She was still at it, working like a mad woman. \"We\u0027ve still got a chance!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Betsy, she is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy looked at the anesthetist\u0027s black eyes and noticed they were rimmed with tears. Joanna\u0027s too. Romy knew they mirrored her own. They all knew that Meerm wasn\u0027t coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached across and gently gripped Betsy\u0027s forearms. \"She\u0027s right, Betsy. Meerm\u0027s gone. You did your best but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have brought her in sooner!\" Betsy wailed. She leaned forward over Meerm\u0027s inert heart, and sobbed. \"But I was worried about the baby! Damn it, damn it, damn it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did all you could,\" Romy said, touching the back of her sweat-soaked scrubs. \"But she - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero burst through the OR doors. \"We have to go! SIRG just stormed into the lobby, armed to the teeth!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s SIRG?\" Joanna said, gaping at Zero\u0027s mask. \"And who the hell are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend,\" Betsy said, ripping off her bloody gloves. She\u0027d regained some of her composure but seemed exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And SIRG,\" Romy added, feeling her gut clench, \"is a group that wants to kill that baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like hell they will!\" Joanna cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go!\" Betsy said. \"We\u0027ve got a minute, maybe two at the most before they\u0027re here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about Meerm?\" Romy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to leave her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Romy,\" Zero said softly, \"I grieve for her as much as you - more than you - but they won\u0027t be interested in Meerm now; they\u0027ll want her baby, and we can\u0027t let them have her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take her,\" Joanna said. \"Madhuri, Betsy, and me. We\u0027ll put her in an isolette and hide her in a motel or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s an isolette?\" Patrick asked. He was still holding the baby and seemed very protective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an incubator of sorts,\" Madhuri said. \"A special enclosed container we use for preemies. Keeps them safe and warm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea,\" Betsy said. \"Since they probably know my car, we\u0027ll leave it here and take one of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoanna said, \"We\u0027ll rustle up a portable isolette and meet you at the doctor\u0027s entrance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Madhuri bustled off while Betsy and Romy pulled a green sheet over Meerm\u0027s body. As the rest of them hurried out into the hall with the baby, Romy hung back. She rested a hand on the lifeless form beneath the sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never had a chance, did you,\" she whispered. \"But things are going to change. And whenever people talk about the change, they\u0027ll mention your name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmall goddamn consolation, she thought as she hurried away to catch up to the others. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-100.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
