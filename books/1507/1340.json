Everyone who died in the Mountain and Sea Realm would enter the Yellow Springs, which became the river of reincarnation that led to the Fourth Mountain and Sea. There, the newly arrived spirits would be guided into the cycle of reincarnation, where they would eventually find a new home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were many myths and legends regarding the Fourth Mountain and Sea. It was a mysterious place, one that most people could never fully comprehend. The only thing most people knew was that the Mountain and Sea Realm’s peak expert resided there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name was Ksitigarbha!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was the Lord of the Fourth Mountain and Sea. He controlled the underworld, and he controlled reincarnation. Even among Mountain and Sea Lords, he held a preeminent position. And that was because essentially… he controlled the lives of everyone in the Mountain and Sea Realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fourth Mountain and Sea was an important node which allowed the Realm to form a complete cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was Meng Hao’s first time coming to the Fourth Mountain and Sea, and as soon as he entered, he could sense a very faint, and yet very pure, aura of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr perhaps it would be better to say that it was not an aura of death, but an aura of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang#Symbolism_and_importance\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eYin\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first glance, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The starry sky and the vast expanse seemed the same, and yet if you looked closely, you would see that the whole world appeared to be gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked around silently, then sent his divine sense spreading out to cover the entire Fourth Mountain and Sea. However, there was one region in particular in which two powerful beings were fighting bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the location where Ksitigarbha was fighting the Outsider Imperial Lord. Meng Hao’s divine sense immediately provoked a reaction from both of them. As for the Outsider Imperial Lord, he reacted with rage, and he clearly wished to break free from the fight to try to slaughter Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Ksitigarbha prevented that. Furthermore, he spoke in a completely calm tone that brimmed with self-confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you\u0027re Meng Hao!” the Outsider said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fellow Daoist Meng,” came the voice of Ksitigarbha, “I can handle this Outsider!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao smiled. When war descended, flowers would bloom on all parts of the tree, not just on one branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, one person alone could not change the entire war. No, that required a group effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao clasped hands and bowed toward Ksitigarbha, then focused his divine sense on where the cultivators of the Fourth Mountain and Sea were battling the Outsiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMillions of Outsiders could be seen, as well as millions of cultivators from the Fourth Mountain and Sea. What was being fought was a spectacular and unprecedented battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao saw Xu Qing there, surrounded by rings of guards. She hadn’t been injured in the slightest, and in fact, was constantly sending orders out to all parts of the battlefield. Because of that, the cultivators of the Fourth Mountain and Sea occupied the clear advantage on this front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he was a vast distance away from Xu Qing, when Meng Hao looked at her, she could sense it. She turned her head and looked off into the distance, and somehow, her gaze met his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, Meng Hao’s heart trembled. As he looked at Xu Qing, numerous memories rose up within him. There was the time on Mount Daqing, when they had met for the first time. Then the time in the Reliance Sect when he had given her the Cosmetic Cultivation Pill. In the Black Sieve Sect’s ancient Blessed Land, he had found her, trembling and helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside of the Black Lands, where Choumen Tai had descended from the sky, the two of them had killed the Ji Clan Quasi-Array cultivator, and when they parted, tears had welled up in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao would never forget any of those things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Rebirth Cave, when he was dying, Xu Qing took care of him, even sacrificing her own life force for him, all to give him a chance at another life. Even if her own soul dispersed, she was willing to pay that price for him. She even allowed herself to be imprisoned in the Black Sieve Sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring their Red Wedding, Meng Hao held her in his arms, watching her fade away. He cradled her as she passed into death, and the entire time, she only cared about her dream of marrying him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao trembled as the memories flitted through his mind like wind and lightning, causing his whole world to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had come to keep his promise. He had come! [1. Here is a quick breakdown of all the Xu Qing references.

No matter what dangers he faced, he would find her and would once again stand at her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe promised to wait for him. If a life or a lifetime was not enough, then she would wait for him through all lives and lifetimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than his parents and sister, there was no one in his life for whom he would do so much. There was no woman whom he would worry so much about, nor anyone that could occupy such an eternal place within his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he didn\u0027t realize it at the time, back on Mount Daqing, when he saw her, the desire had already been planted within his heart... to be with her forever, through all lives and lifetimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElder Sister Xu....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not spectacularly beautiful, but in Meng Hao’s eyes, in his world, she was the most beautiful thing in Heaven and Earth. She didn\u0027t have a complicated heart, and the source of that was not any lack of intelligence, but rather, the fact that she liked things to be simple. And so did he. When he was most tired, most exhausted, simplicity was a quiet harbor within which to rest his soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile, her voice, her eyes, everything about her, were firmly rooted in his heart, and made him smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know in my heart that the person I fell in love with is not just a fond memory, but you,” he murmured. “The real you. I know... that I love you.” With that, he took a step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbeknownst to him, someone had appeared behind him at some point, a shadowy figure clad in a long black robe. That figure was now watching him make his way off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was none other than Slaughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Slaughter saw how Meng Hao looked at Xu Qing, a flicker of reminiscence appeared in his eyes, as if he were considering some matter from the past. As if he was being reminded... of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meng Hao walked forward, the world vanished. Heaven and Earth faded away. Natural law dispersed. Only one person remained. His wife, Xu Qing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had come from afar, passing through each of the great Mountains and Seas. He had proceeded along through the starry sky, step by step, and was now walking onto the battlefield. There were Outsiders who were in his path, but it wasn’t because they were trying to stop him; rather, he happened upon them as he proceeded toward the heart of the fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA destructive power surrounded him that caused any Outsiders who approached within 30,000 meters of him to scream and explode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao paid them no heed. He proceeded along, surrounded by shouts of astonishment. As the Outsiders fell back from him, a strange scene developed on the battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith every step he took, he was surrounded by empty space, as the Outsiders fled from his presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cultivators of the Fourth Mountain and Sea looked on with vigilance. Even though Meng Hao\u0027s arrival caused the death of the Outsiders around him, they were still cautious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were only two people who had different reactions. One was the Echelon cultivator of the Fourth Mountain and Sea, Lin Cong. The other was, of course, Xu Qing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Cong stood in the crowd, wearing a gray robe. As he thought back to everything that had occurred in the Windswept Realm, he sighed. A wry smile could be seen on his face, and mixed emotions filled his eyes as he sighed. [1. Meng Hao fought and killed Lin Cong in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-7-chapter-1105/\"\u003echapter 1105\u003c/a\u003e. Of course, they reconciled later, and when they parted ways in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-7-chapter-1151/\"\u003echapter 1151\u003c/a\u003e, Meng Hao gave him a Cosmetic Cultivation Pill to deliver to Xu Qing]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, he finally came.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXu Qing was smiling radiantly. She stood there in the army of the Fourth Mountain and Sea, in the command pavilion, watching as Meng Hao approached. She remembered everything that had occurred, just as he did. Those memories could not be wiped away from her because of her reincarnation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had always believed that one day, her beloved companion, her husband, would come from the distant Ninth Mountain and Sea to find her. It didn’t matter how long it took or how far away he was. It wouldn\u0027t even matter if a war was being fought. Nothing would be able to stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would definitely come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXu Qing bit her lip and took a step forward, much to the shock of the surrounding cultivators from the Fourth Mountain and Sea. Some of them wanted to stop her, but as Meng Hao neared, they suddenly lost the ability to control their cultivation bases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battlefield went quiet, and soon only Meng Hao and Xu Qing were there, looking at each other, slowly drawing closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime seemed to slow down. The Outsiders and the cultivators of the Fourth Mountain and Sea both watched as Meng Hao approached. Xu Qing stepped out of the command pavilion, and the two of them... were soon standing together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve come,” he said, reaching out to grasp her hand. This was his wife, and his lifelong love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she replied, her face flushing a bit. It took a bit of courage on her part, but she resisted the urge to look down shyly. Instead, she allowed her joy to radiate out, and she looked into Meng Hao’s eyes and smiled. This was indeed the happiest moment she had experienced since being reincarnated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Meng Hao saw Xu Qing smile, he couldn\u0027t stop himself from smiling. His hands tightened around hers, and hers around his. It was as if neither of them wished to ever let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, they both knew that the time they could spend with each other was short. No matter what they wished inside, they would have to let go. Xu Qing had her duties, and Meng Hao had his mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not the time and place. If only things could go back to how they were before, before the deadly war broke out in the Mountains and Seas....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXu Qing looked around at all of the cultivators from the Fourth Mountain and Sea, and the Outsiders, and slowly loosened her grip. “I can’t go with you right now....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait for me.... If the day ever comes when this war ends, then we... can go home together.” Xu Qing suddenly stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him, resting her head on his chest to hear his heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment passed, she looked up at him and said, “I’ll wait for you, and you wait for me. We’ll both be on the lookout for each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXu Qing bit her lip, then pulled away from Meng Hao’s embrace and returned to the command pavilion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meng Hao looked at Xu Qing, he realized that there was something different about her from before. Much like himself... she had grown up, she had become mature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s heart was calm. Xu Qing had her duties, and he... had his mission. After looking at her deeply one last time, he waved his hand, sending a bit of divine will swirling out to surround her. He took a deep breath, and then looked up into the sky at the vast land mass up above that was the 1st Heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually, the warmth in his eyes faded away, to be replaced by icy coldness!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air around him grew icy, and his aura, sharp and dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s something I have to go do,” he murmured. “Something... that will lift the spirits of everyone in the Mountain and Sea Realm!” Rumbling sounds could be heard as he suddenly shot up into the air, leaving the battlefield. He became a streak of light like a shooting star, passing out of the Fourth Mountain and Sea, up into the vast expanse above. He was now heading toward the 1st Heaven, which had superseded the starry sky of the Mountain and Sea Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to destroy the 1st Heaven!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFew people noticed how he was flying up into the sky. However, it was certain... that a massive, storm would soon shake Heaven and Earth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA storm was coming, a storm which would be caused by none other than...
