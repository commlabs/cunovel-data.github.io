{"id":110310,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Georgina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name came to me from far away, from far down a tunnel without an end. It echoed off the walls of my mind, loud at first and eventually fading to nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Georgina. Look at me, sweetie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her sleep, Hugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I need to talk to her and make sure she doesn\u0027t have a concussion. Georgina, come on. Open your eyes for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough a mist of black fog, my brain parsed the words and slowly found meaning in them. Some basic response in me wanted to comply, but my eyelids felt like they were stuck together. Thinking-let alone answering-was too hard, but more words came to encourage me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go, sweetie. Try it again. You almost had it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith much effort, I finally managed to open my eyes. It was excruciating. My lids felt like they were made of lead. At first, I could only perceive one thing: light. I winced, wanting to sink back into that oblivion I\u0027d been pulled from. And with this slight stirring of consciousness, all the pain I\u0027d escaped from before suddenly returned. My head throbbed. My back burned. The clich¨¦ about breaking every bone in the body seemed like a very real possibility all of a sudden, and I was pretty sure I\u0027d broken a few that weren\u0027t in my body. Sure, that didn\u0027t make sense, but with as bad as I felt, little did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh God.\" At least, that\u0027s what I tried to say. It came out as more of an indistinct moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy there. You don\u0027t have to say anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes again, this time making out a figure leaning over me. I knew his voice so well that I didn\u0027t need to see his face, which was a blur anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh,\" I croaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, ask her what-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" Hugh snapped. The jerky movement of his head made me think he\u0027d glanced behind him, but I couldn\u0027t be certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved his face closer to mine, bringing his features into sharper relief. He was paler than I\u0027d ever seen him, his face filled with lines of worry and fear I\u0027d never thought him capable of. He looked even more upset than when he\u0027d come to tell us about Jerome\u0027s summoning. Reaching out, Hugh held the lids of one of my eyes open and shone a small light into it. I squirmed at the brightness-or at least I tried-but he was fast and did it to the other eye before it caused too much discomfort. When he finished, he moved his finger around in the air and studied my eyes as I followed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your name?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice behind him piped up. \"You already said her name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh sighed and jerked a thumb over his shoulder. \"What\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cody,\" I said. It was getting easier to speak, but the pain was going up the more conscious I became. Cody\u0027s voice was as familiar to me as Hugh\u0027s, and I felt certain Peter was here too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh asked me a few other factual questions, like the current year and the location, and also if I was nauseous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It all hurts,\" I said, voice still slurred. I couldn\u0027t even move, let alone distinguish nausea from the rest of my pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but do you feel like you\u0027re going to throw up? Right here? Right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. My stomach hurt, but it was less of a queasy discomfort and more of a someone-just-kicked-me-with-stilettos discomfort. \"No,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh sat back, and I heard him sigh in relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It all hurts,\" I repeated. \"Can you...make it stop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, and a moment later, Cody appeared beside him. \"What\u0027s the matter? You\u0027ve gotta give her something. Look at her. She\u0027s suffering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understatement,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh\u0027s face was still drawn. \"I\u0027m not gonna knock her out if she\u0027s got a concussion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She passed your tests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are field tests. They\u0027re not one hundred percent accurate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" I said, feeling tears well in my eyes. \"Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know it won\u0027t kill her,\" I heard Peter say. I\u0027d been right about him being here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh hesitated only a little longer. \"Go get some water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody disappeared, and Peter replaced him by Hugh\u0027s side. Hugh\u0027s expression was still grim. \"Sweetie, I\u0027ve got to clean up your back, and it\u0027s going to hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A different kind of hurt. But this has to be cleaned up so you don\u0027t get an infection, and then I need to shift you to check out the rest of you. The drugs\u0027ll help, but it\u0027s all going to hurt at first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go for it,\" I said, steeling myself. At this point, I couldn\u0027t really imagine worse pain. Besides, Hugh was a doctor. Everything was going to be okay now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody returned with a glass of water. Hugh made me drink some first, just to make sure I could keep it down. When I did, he gave me two pills to take with the rest of the water. I nearly choked on them-my throat felt raw and swollen, maybe from screaming-but I got them down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to ask what I\u0027d just taken, but it seemed like too much work. \"Should kick in in about twenty minutes,\" Hugh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see him fumbling with something in his lap. Standing up, he leaned over my back. Something wet touched my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Son of a bitch!\" Again, my words were slightly incoherent, but I think he caught my meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStinging pain-a \"different\" pain, indeed-raced across my skin where he\u0027d touched it. It was electric, sharp where the rest of my body throbbed. My desire to get away from that horrible stinging was so strong that I actually managed to move a little, but all that did was trigger the hurt in the rest of my body. The world blurred once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re making it worse,\" he warned. \"Stay still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy for him to say. I bit my lip as he continued. He was using antiseptic to clean the places Nanette had cut me. Necessary, as he\u0027d said, but God, did it hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk to her,\" Hugh said to no one in particular. \"Distract her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" asked Peter. \"Who did this to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice distraction,\" said Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nanette,\" I said. Saying her name made my stomach turn, and I hoped I wouldn\u0027t have to go back on what I\u0027d said to Hugh about throwing up. \"She was...mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess,\" said Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mad I told Cedric about her...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t this kind of confirm your suspicions, then?\" asked Cody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, if beating up the person who\u0027d ratted out your secret plans didn\u0027t sound suspicious, I didn\u0027t know what did. But if Nanette really was behind Jerome\u0027s summoning, why not just kill me outright and leave no witnesses?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplaining that would take too many words and too much effort, so I just said, \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" said Hugh, straightening. \"That wasn\u0027t so bad, was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to glare, but I don\u0027t think he noticed. He rummaged in his kit once more and then leaned back over to start bandaging up the wounds. With as much as he was piling on me, I had the feeling I was going to look like a mummy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t Dante stick around?\" asked Cody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? Dante?\" The bandage pressure wasn\u0027t as bad as the cleaning, but it was still uncomfortable. I wondered when those goddamned drugs were going to kick in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was here,\" said Cody. \"He called Hugh and told him to come over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the exact details of what had happened with Nanette were foggy, but I felt pretty confident, head trauma or no, that I would have remembered Dante being around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dante wasn\u0027t here,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh paused and looked me in the eye. \"Then who called me? It was a guy, from your cell phone. Said to get over here and bring medical supplies-that you\u0027d been hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, and it came back to me, a shadow in the pain-filled haze of my memory. The strong arms and gentle voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was someone here...\" I began slowly. \"Not Dante. Someone else. He put me to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence fell. A slight fuzziness was starting to tingle the edges of my senses, which I took as a good sign. It was more of a pleasant, dreamlike fuzziness-not the I-can\u0027t-handle-this-pain-anymore kind. There was still a fair amount of that, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys exchanged puzzled looks. \"Are you sure it wasn\u0027t him?\" asked Cody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would Dante leave her, though?\" asked Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh snorted. \"No telling with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop,\" I mumbled. \"It wasn\u0027t him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t remember a face or anything?\" Peter asked. \"Was it even someone you knew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought again, desperately trying to dig out the memory. There was nothing, though. Only that he\u0027d been someone familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew him...\" That pleasant drowsiness was growing stronger. I wished it would hurry up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" said Hugh. \"All bandaged up. Help me move her so I can look at her ribs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was not fun, and the discomfort of the three of them turning me over-no matter how gentle they tried to be-was enough to momentarily break me out of the drug\u0027s soothing embrace. They managed to flip me over, putting moderate pressure on my back when I rested back against the bed, but allowing Hugh to examine the rest of me. He poked and prodded and had me take deep breaths. His final analysis was that I had a couple of broken ribs and a lot of bruising and pain that would just go away with time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" I said. I was so loopy by that point that I didn\u0027t even know if I was being sarcastic or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody was still unable to give up my benefactor. \"But who was here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man...\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t going to get anything else out of her,\" said Hugh wearily. \"Not for a while. She\u0027s going to be in Dreamland any minute now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dreamland. The man...\" I repeated. Suddenly, I giggled. \"The man in the dream...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw them exchange pitying looks, just before my eyelids drooped closed. They thought I was talking nonsense. None of them knew about the story of the man in the dream, of that alluring and improbable alternate life that Nyx had shown me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I drifted off to Dreamland, it wasn\u0027t Nyx\u0027s vision I saw. It was more of that same, painless black...at least, it was until I got jolted by a million volts of electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a small cry of surprise, my eyes popping open. It felt like hundreds of icy needles were dancing along my body, piercing every nerve. The room\u0027s details, as well as my friends, came to me in sharp, crystalline detail. No more fuzziness. Turning my head slightly, I saw a fourth person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood beside my bed, face blank and emotionless, arms crossed across her black silk blouse. \"What happened?\" I asked. My words were still thick, but my speech capabilities had improved by leaps and bounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I healed you,\" she said flatly. \"Inasmuch as I can. You\u0027re still going to hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemons, though once angels, didn\u0027t possess that power to heal that their heavenly counterparts had. They could do it in small bursts, however, and in expanding my senses to assess my body, I could feel how she\u0027d gotten rid of the worst of my pain. I still ached in some places, and even bandaged, my back still stung. I no longer wanted to die, however, so that was definitely an improvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMei didn\u0027t look particularly compassionate or benevolent. Her expression darkened. \"They say Nanette did this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. I\u0027d already gotten in enough trouble with the archdemoness for telling on her. Of course, my friends had undoubtedly already told Mei the truth, and anyway, she was the closest I currently had to a boss. I wasn\u0027t entirely sure if I could trust her, but if I had to place my money on the demon most likely to have my back right now (no pun intended), it was her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I admitted. \"I told Cedric that Nanette had met with Jerome. She\u0027d met with Cedric too, so it seemed kind of like she was manipulating both of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMei\u0027s face grew harder still. Whether she agreed with me or not, she didn\u0027t reveal. \"Nanette won\u0027t bother you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with no more than that, the demoness vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girl fight,\" said Hugh, looking the happiest I\u0027d seen him today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to be in creamed corn or anything like that,\" I remarked dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her sense of humor returns,\" said Peter. \"Definitely on the road to recovery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to sit up and winced. \"Or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t push it,\" warned Hugh. \"Mei can only do so much-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all turned. Dante stood in the doorway to my bedroom. His face was a mixture of incredulity and utter confusion. Without waiting for an answer, he hurried over to the bed and knelt down so that he was at my level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay? What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression was so tender, so full of concern that I was momentarily taken aback. Dante was indeed selfish and arrogant, but he did care about me, no matter what my friends thought. And in dire situations-like now-that bitter fa\u0026amp;ccedil;ade of his fell, revealing someone whose soul hadn\u0027t turned completely black yet. He tried hard to hide this side of himself, but I knew it was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a run-in with a demon,\" I said. I gave him a brief explanation of what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grew more and more incredulous as I spoke. When I finished, he glanced around the room, studying everyone accusatorily. \"How does something like this happen? I thought demons couldn\u0027t go around roughing people up. Aren\u0027t you under some kind of protection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Technically Jerome\u0027s,\" I said. \"But he\u0027s kind of busy right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027re under Grace and Mei\u0027s protection now,\" mused Cody. \"Mei looked pissed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She always looks pissed,\" said Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should hope so,\" snapped Dante. \"Are they going to go kick this other demon\u0027s ass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not likely to smite her, if that\u0027s what you mean,\" said Hugh. \"Grace and Mei are under the same scrutiny as everyone else, but I bet Mei\u0027ll bitch Nanette out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" said Dante. \"A stern talking-to. That\u0027ll show her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s unlikely Nanette\u0027ll do anything else. If she was going to kill Georgina, she would have already.\" There was an almost gentle tone in Peter\u0027s voice. I think Dante\u0027s outrage and concern had convinced the vampire that Dante might not be the complete and total bastard he\u0027d always believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy immortal (or not so immortal) friends finally decided I was in reasonable enough condition to leave me in Dante\u0027s care. Hugh promised to check on me tomorrow, and I thanked him again for his help. He and the others looked like they wanted to hug me, but with my back, they knew better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were gone, Dante went out to the kitchen and came back with a bowl of ice cream. \"Good for what ails you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised to discover I had a considerable appetite. Judging from the time, I\u0027d been out quite awhile before Mei had shown up. It had only felt like a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful,\" I teased. \"People are going to think you\u0027re a nice guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll have to go rob some orphans to save my reputation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lay in bed beside me, curled on his side so that he could gently keep his hand on my arm and talk to me. As the evening passed, our conversation mostly touched on inconsequential things, topics to distract me from Seattle\u0027s increasingly dangerous situation. Finally, when it came time for both of us to sleep, Dante brought up the attack again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Succubus...who was here earlier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew he didn\u0027t mean Hugh and the vampires. I frowned. Even with Mei\u0027s healing, my memories were sketchy. \"I don\u0027t know. But I think...I think it might have been Carter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? I still can\u0027t believe that angel hangs out with you guys. But if it was him, why didn\u0027t he heal you? He could have fixed everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the fog of that ordeal, I recalled my rescuer\u0027s words. I can\u0027t heal you .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he\u0027s not supposed to interfere,\" I said slowly, remembering my earlier rumination on whether blowing up a stove was interference. \"Heaven\u0027s supposed to stay out of this. He probably shouldn\u0027t have even carried me to bed-which is why he would have then gotten out of here and left it to Hugh to patch me up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An angel breaking the rules and a demon healing the sick,\" Dante said. \"You and your associates just get more and more fucked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted slightly, cautious of my back, and rested my head against him. \"That\u0027s for damned sure.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-16.html","bookId":2057,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:00 PM"}
