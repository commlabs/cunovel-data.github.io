I\u0027d been cooped up in the house, with my girlfriend in school with Mr. Sympathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027d be Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy had pulsed and said Brett was licking his wounds all day, making eyes at whatever girl would give him sympathy. It made me want to do a repeat performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade left the car running and I hopped in, throwing my gear bag in the back, my hand glancing the crystal that hung from the mirror as I moved in for a kiss. I didn\u0027t do one of the soft ones either that I could get away with when we were together all the time. I was feeling on edge. Hadn\u0027t seen her since the fight. Even though it had only been yesterday, it felt like weeks to me. I grabbed her behind her neck and with my other hand I wound that against the back of her and dragged her into my body, pressing my mouth over hers, digging my fingers into her hair. She molded her body to mine, moving against me and I gave a little groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess there was a couple ways to take care of the testosterone purge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled back, breathless, her face a soft pink. She giggled. \"Wow, where\u0027d that come from? Not that I\u0027m complaining,\" she said with a whisper and a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"Feeling cranked. Need to get to judo and work some of the stress out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned in her seat and pulsed the truck into reverse. \"I don\u0027t think you were too concerned over being punctual, Caleb,\" she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let my restraint go and semi-tackled her unsafely while she drove, landing a bunch of pecks along her collarbone where the necklace I got her lay. \"Stop! Caleb... I\u0027m driving,\" she laughed, shivering a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah-huh. Whatever, practice multitasking, Jade,\" I said, my words muffled against her flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must\u0027ve pulled up to the dojo but I was still... busy. Doin\u0027 the Jade worship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped my nuzzle of her when there was a sharp rap on the glass of the truck. I whipped around, my lips hot from the assault of her skin and looked into my sensei\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo busted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"K, so this is so beyond embarrassing. I\u0027m just saying... \" Jade whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my eyes forward, on my sensei. Like I\u0027d been taught. You never lost eye contact on the mat. Against an opponent. I\u0027d have drills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027d have more if I broke the gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carefully opened the door and he did an offensive jab before I could escape the confines of the cab. I was awkwardly hoisted, half-in, half-out of the car. No room to maneuver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut of course, that was the beauty of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head moved evasively, the air from his strike pushing against my chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crouched and drove a foot sweep into his tender knee, exposed as it was, and he nailed me in the bread basket. My air squeezed out. If I\u0027d been sloppy he\u0027d have had me, but I\u0027d kept my core tight like he\u0027d taught me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting Jade!\" Sensei screamed at me and my adrenaline surged in a sickening jar, ripping my guts up in a warm slide that felt like vomit in reverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lunged at him, using my momentum without any of the finesse he taught me and Jade let out a scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roll!\" he screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did, my shoulder landing with a bruising impact that made my teeth rattle, my legs following in a compact somersault that had me springing to my feet in a crouch, my hands one after another in defense formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe planted his hands on his hips and smiled. I straightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bad Hart. Hated that lazy superman you just did though. I mention the girlfriend and you go sideways on your training.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was standard lecture mode now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t abandon training that should be automatic because you want to get all emotional,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes flicked behind him and Jade was on her knees, hands gripping the car door that I\u0027d left open before I flew out of there. \"Is this... part of your training?\" she asked, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and shrugged. \"He keeps me on it. You just never know with Sensei.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade looked over at him doubtfully. Taking in his contained strength, his muscular, compact body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoised for violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t real intimidated, but we were close in size. I looked at it from her perspective, he\u0027d be scary for Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensei Anderson must\u0027ve thought so too. He moved forward in a non-threatening way. \"I\u0027m Caleb\u0027s judo instructor. Hunter Anderson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade popped out of the truck and looked like she would shake his hand but he gave a little bow instead. She smiled and bowed back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loved getting out of touching if she could help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to check out a practice?\" he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Sure. I can do the homework later, I guess.\" She looked at me a little uncertainly, did I want her to stay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. Dumb unspoken question, I always wanted her around. I held out my hand and she walked toward me, our hands entangled for the two minutes it took to walk into the dojo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson followed behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade sighed. If she had to go through one more clairvoyance sample she\u0027d scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut looking at Gale and Garcia\u0027s faces, she just couldn\u0027t be selfish. She needed to try and find the DI. Match the sample to the perpetrator. Of course, Jade thought that there was a lot of people she wanted to kill from time to time. It\u0027d been explained to her though. It wasn\u0027t a pissed off, spur-of-the-moment internal monologue of \"I wish I could slay them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a murder that was yet to happen. That\u0027s what had felt like a rotting oil slick in her hand. Someone that would kill. A teen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone she very likely knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t an exact science either. That made her mad. There were no absolutes. She could touch the perp, as the cops called him, and if he wasn\u0027t on the wavelength he was when he wore the sample, she may not get it from skin on skin. It was the proverbial needle in the haystack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jade was tired of looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbi saw her frustration. \"Let\u0027s take a small break, Raul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Jade and nodded, seeing she was a little tired. They sat down at the cafeteria tables that were at K-M. Jade thought about how worried Caleb was that this was the school she was at today. Tulle counted it as extra credit. It was a field trip for high schoolers, Jade thought, remembering her comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just think of all the extra experience you\u0027ll gain from handling all those alien samples, Jade,\" she said. Then added, with a small smirk, \"And all the focus you\u0027ll have available to you without Mr. Hart as a distraction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade had just stared at her. It was Jade\u0027s conviction that Tulle thought entirely too often of she and Caleb. She frowned and the grin faded from Tulle\u0027s face. After all, Jade was emancipated and didn\u0027t really feel like she wasn\u0027t on equal ground with Tulle. She\u0027d gone through all the stupid legal hoops to do it and now... by God, back off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade had left without so much as a backwards glance. Not doing the ass-kissing that Tulle so obviously needed didn\u0027t help Jade out though. Tulle had her nose plugged up her butt every opportunity she could. Even Caleb had noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry Weller came by while she was at the table, enjoying a Granny Smith apple, the cops were talking quietly together until his approach. Her face puckered slightly as the sour tartness filled her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" she smiled at him, pleased to see a familiar person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey Jade. How\u0027s it goin\u0027?\" he asked, eying up the cops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said, giving a significant look to them. He nodded his understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ditching class?\" she asked with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope, senior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s right, Jade remembered, he\u0027d slide by this last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many classes do ya have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up two fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, a slow grin spreading over his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia said, \"Hi, Mr. Weller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded at him. \"Hi Officer Garcia,\" he turned to Gale and nodded to her too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi Bry,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatcha guys doin\u0027?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia stood, his broad shoulders stretching the uniform he wore and Jade wondered if he worked out. She guessed he\u0027d have to just to keep up with their group alone. Lots of rescuing with her friends. She frowned, thinking it be nice if they didn\u0027t always need rescuing. Which of course, made her think of her dad. Not that she wanted to. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know we can\u0027t really talk about ongoing investigations, Bry,\" Garcia stated, his eyes steady on Bry\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry stared back at him, then his gaze shifted to Jade. \"Are you in danger?\" Bry asked, thinking about Caleb. That Caleb wouldn\u0027t be thrilled with Jade working with the cops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not!\" Gale said with too much enthusiasm and Bry\u0027s eyes narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia watched them and said, \"It\u0027s more of a suspicious activity than a real threat, at this time. She\u0027s not in any real danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? Bry wondered, he didn\u0027t think there was fake danger. He didn\u0027t like it. He bet Caleb hated it. Bry didn\u0027t like some of the paranormal bullshit. Bry liked shit he could feel, touch. Annihilate. Yeah, that really worked for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned at Garcia then his face cleared when he took in Jade. Caleb was a lucky dude, he had a gorgeous girlfriend that wasn\u0027t a rager. Nice. He\u0027d be nervous as hell with a chick like that though. He took in her fragile beauty. She was tiny, and beautiful and... unprotected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a thin smile, his feelings of unease at helping the cops there between them. \"K, well, I\u0027ll pulse Hart and we\u0027ll do another hang session,\" he raised his brows in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Jade smiled, that sounded fun. \"Maybe you can get Mia to go too?\" she said slyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh hell, Mia! Bry thought with barely contained anxiety. Now that was a girl, that one. But outta his league for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, sure,\" he said, raking a hand over hair that was almost a skull trim, it was so short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade gave a coy smile. She knew Mia liked him, but she wasn\u0027t an aggressive girl. He\u0027d have to make the first move. Jade thought about letting him off the hook, giving him a subtle hint. Then thought better of it. Shouldn\u0027t interfere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of guys... Jade whipped out her pulse as Bry walked away, collecting her lunch trash in one hand she headed over to the separator as the cops gathered their gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitializing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade thought it was funny that Caleb felt so cool about customizing his contacts. Jade rolled her eyes. She\u0027d had hers customized the day... no, the moment she got her pulse. She had to admit she loved that she was the Hot One. A sexy little smile curled her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey-CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epause in pulse communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou okay? emotive response med.-high- CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esighs stop it! I\u0027m fine, I\u0027m with the power twins.-JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh! And Bry came by at lunch and said he wanted to hang with everybody.-JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eK, cool.-CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow are we going to celebrate you getting your car finally?JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m gonna pick you up and we\u0027ll go somewhere quiet and spend some quality time together emotive response high.-CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought you turned off your detector? JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did. The profanity-block! thing overrode my manual directive.-CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice smiles- JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, for you! CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eK, I\u0027ll see ya after supper? JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enods I want a full report.-CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorough, right? smiles- JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely manual override on emotive detection.-CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade smiled again, he was so sweet. Her heart sped a little at the thought of what quality time meant with Caleb. A subtle blush colored her cheeks before she responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove you.-JLeC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe too.-CH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade swept her thumb over the pad and thought her pulse to hibernate, slipping it in her front pocket of her jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, looking for the cops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia gave her a wave and she walked toward them, thinking about the icky ride back to KPH in the cop car. The back was always so rank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrodie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was concentrating as much as she could, her palms lightly sweating, but realm was the same as always, like a soft cloud of nothing, whiteness... oblivion. There was not a solid thing in the world in there. Her terror of being attacked was draining her of the power to get to her acquisition point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to stay there for at least a full minute. That\u0027s only sixty seconds. If you don\u0027t stay the proper interim, you cannot reach your Point of Acquisition,\" Proctor elaborated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the hundredth time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie knew that, she understood what the hell she had to do. She was scared. Amanda had been attacked. Other girls were talking about a shadow form in their realms. She just knew with her luck that it would happen to her. And she wouldn\u0027t get out of realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wished Buddy was in her AP class. But he was at another time block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer teacher leaned down close to her, his curly hair mingling with hers. \"I won\u0027t let anything happen to you. I got to Amanda too, remember?
