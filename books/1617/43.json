The thought left her hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla had become her home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know someone who can help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Rollo,” she snapped. She snatched up a bit of old wood and used it to stab and scrape deep into the sandy soil. “You don\u0027t know. You have no idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was alone in the past. And Rollo thought he had nobody he could trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes darted to him. Rollo. He\u0027d been a true friend to MacColla. Had ridden to find her. Saved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t give up on MacColla. There must be some way. But first, she had to trust somebody, and the likeliest option, her only option, sat before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, Rollo.” She put her stick down and brushed her hands on her filthy skirts. “This is going to sound crazy, but … ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, what? But… get this, I\u0027m from the future!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nevermind,” she said, deflated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not crazy, lass.” He stared at her over the flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteadfast, sure. “There\u0027s another.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were right, Haley. James Graham lives.” Rollo spared her one of his rare smiles. “And he is wed to one like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Graham was everything Haley had ever imagined him to be. Handsome, chivalrous, strong, gentlemanly, noble, erudite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was also annoying the hell out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to act. And now. But the man insisted on niceties. She knew she needed food and rest, but she\u0027d gotten it into her head that she could save MacColla. And she wanted to figure out a plan immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly, lass,” he said, pulling a chair from the table for her. “You must eat. We offer our assistance, and gladly, but food is the first, best help for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, wrapped haphazardly in a cornflower blue plaid, with bare legs and feet. The sun had risen warm and bright that day, and all the doors and windows to their cottage were open to the breeze, rustling James\u0027s hair gently over his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of a man so casually at home stabbed her. She should have her man there. She should be eating breakfast with MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d arrived well after dark after a day of sailing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough they were on a small, barely inhabited island, it was like paradise, with a sandy beach, lush rolling hills, and strange and dramatic rocky outcroppings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it kindled memories of her time with MacColla on the Mull of Kintyre that were almost too painful to acknowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll not lift a finger for you until you have a decent meal in your belly.” James said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“MacColla would want that.” It was his wife Magda speaking quietly. Haley looked at her, instantly on the defensive. But her face was so open and sincere. Haley couldn\u0027t fault her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” she muttered, sitting to let James guide her chair in. “Just a little.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing herself to chew an oatcake, she stole another glance at James\u0027s wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRollo told her Magda had also come from the future, and Haley had immediately recognized her as a contemporary. She couldn\u0027t put her finger on why or how. Something about her words, the way she carried herself, spoke to a different time and place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley wondered if she stood out that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d felt instantly self-conscious in front of the woman. She was tall and pretty, with long, shining copper hair, and so effortlessly elegant despite her hugely pregnant belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was from Manhattan, of all places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley swallowed hard, quickly taking a sip of water to wash down the dry lump. Only she would travel back in time and land with a damned Yankees fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda caught her staring. Haley felt her cheeks go red and said the first thing that came to her mind. “I have to save him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haley,” Rollo said somberly from across the table. “\u0027Tis too late for MacColla. But not too late to help you find a ”- “No,” Haley said more sharply than she\u0027d intended. “I can\u0027t accept that he\u0027s dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames and his wife stole a glance. “There might be a way,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda said gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Och, hen.” James looked at his wife, concern plain on his face. “It could kill her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What way?” Haley pushed her plate away. “I\u0027ll do anything.” She pinned her gaze on James, telling him, “You more than anyone must understand the need to risk your life for something, or someone you love.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He does.” Magda reached to place her hand over her husband\u0027s to silence him. “As I do, Haley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley stared at her a moment. She felt like a heel. Of course this woman would understand more than anyone what she went through. This woman who gave up everything for the man she loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was different for Haley, who spoke Gaelic, had steeped herself for years in the history of this period. But Magda? Magda, with the fancy parents and fancy job in New York City? Magda wouldn\u0027t know flintlocks from Flintstones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come with me,” Magda said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley followed her to the only other room in the cottage. It was small and sun-drenched, with a desk, two trunks, a humble bed, and a woode n cradle waiting in the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead.” Magda nodded for Haley to sit on the bed. The wooden frame creaked as she sat. The ticked mattress was thin, but more comfortable than it looked, stuffed with what felt like a mixture of feathers and straw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda rifled for a moment in one of the trunks, then came to sit by her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This… ” She lovingly unwrapped a small parcel. “This is a painting of my brother.” Magda held it for a moment in her hands, tenderly tracing its outline with her fingertip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You left your brother?” A glimmer of expectancy mingled with the sympathy in her voice. Did this woman also know what it was to leave a family of brothers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Magda pursed her lips, visibly gathering herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had a brother who left me. He died. About a year before I found James.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I… ” Haley thought of her own brothers. Who\u0027d now lost their sister. “I\u0027m sorry,” she said, her voice hitching, the apology to Magda and even more so to her own family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take it.” Magda thrust the painting toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Why? I couldn\u0027t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” She placed it in Haley\u0027s hands. “You can. It\u0027s… special. A painting was what transported me back in time. I\u0027m told this has the same powers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But… how?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That I don\u0027t know,” Magda admitted. “But I thought… Well, perhaps you could go back in time again. Before MacColla\u0027s death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley sat upright, her gaze pinning Magda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda continued gravely, “Of course, you could also use it to return to your own home. Your own time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women locked eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda broke the silence. “Boston, is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t tell me I have an accent.” She attempted a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Shaking her head, Magda returned the look, an expression of mingled sympathy and understanding. “You mentioned Harvard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, that.” Her world seemed so far away. Things like academic success a distant and empty memory. She studied her hands in her lap. “Yeah… I\u0027m a South Boston girl. Big, Irish Catholic family. You can imagine… ” Her voice drifted off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You miss them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley felt the tears threaten, and furrowed her face in an effort to staunch them. Miss them? She mustered a wordless nod. More than anything. More than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to curl up under her mom\u0027s crocheted afghan, family all around. There\u0027d be good-natured bickering, heated debates, and much, much laughter. Maybe an open bottle of wine shared among the women. Her mom would have a roast chicken going, or maybe a lasagna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething big, to feed the lot of them, filling the house with scents of warmth and comfort and home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss them? Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough to turn her back on MacColla forever?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered an inhale. “But what about you? You must miss your own family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” Magda got a faraway look in her eye. “But I belong here. With James.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t you hate the thought… ” Haley dashed her hands over her eyes. Her throat ached now with the effort of unshed tears. “The thought that you just… vanished?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was a painting,” Magda said in answer. “The painting, of James. The one that transported me back. I tucked it away with a note indicating it belonged at the Met, the museum where I worked. I also tucked a note away, for my parents.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can you know they got it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who knows? My mom was on the Met board of directors… ” Magda shrugged. “Hell, for all I know, they could\u0027ve gotten the note when I was still a kid.” She gave a rueful smile. “But the painting just showed up at work one day. I have to imagine the note came with it. Was delivered with it.” She took a deep breath. “I\u0027ll never know. I can hope, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda took her hand and continued, “What I do know, though, what I\u0027ve learned these past months, is that, despite the wars, despite the bloodshed, people are good. I trust that someone would\u0027ve delivered my message. Maybe even read it themselves, I don\u0027t care. But having witnessed the sacrifice that I have, the devotion and loyalty, honestly Haley, I really think my parents received my letter. And they\u0027d want me to be happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah… ” Haley cleared her throat. Scrubbed her face and tucked her hair back behind her ears. “My family would want that too. For me to be happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of that big, loving family of hers. Her father, who positively adored and doted on her mother. Her brothers, who were beginning to pair off and begin families of their own. And she projected herself into her own future. A future in modern-day America. Empty scholarship, cold weapons, and musty books all around. Would she ever meet her life partner, there in Boston?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment she wondered, she knew. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-43.html","bookId":1617,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM"}
