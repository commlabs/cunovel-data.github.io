Under the circumstances where the difference in strength and cultivation wasn’t too great, one could instantly defeat the other in a single second. But, if one had made early preparations and was aware of the incoming soul attack, then the situation would be different.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, normal martial artists would never practice this sort of martial skill simply because martial artists that used their soul force to launch an attack were too rare. Only when a martial artist has reached the Xiantian realm and began to cultivate their soul and similar techniques would such attacks surface. Before the Xiantian realm, martial artists usually only cultivated their true essence and physical body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hmm, this is a bit interesting. It seems that Wang Mu already has a martial skill prepared to deal with soul force attacks. How will Lin Ming handle this situation?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I don’t think that Lin Ming has many other attack methods. Looking at him, he only appears to be 16 or 17 years old. Soul force attacks are too difficult to learn and master. Just cultivating one is enough to occupy all his time; where would he find the energy to study anything else?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I hear that Lin Ming was also able to control thunder. I wonder what grade his lightning fusion is at. If it’s high, it might be of some use.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs people talked, Lin Ming and Wang Mu had already both risen to prominence. They had attracted many viewers; there were even some audience members and martial artists from other stages that came to watch. It was basically determined that Lin Ming and Wang Mu would both qualify. In the future, they might encounter one of these two, so it was better to come watch in advance and have an \u0026nbsp;understanding of their opponents strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e….\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the arena, the match had already begun. But, Wang Mu actually hadn’t moved yet. Instead, he strengthened his defensive turtle shell.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Now that your soul force attacks no longer work, I wonder how you will fight me!” Wang Mu brutishly spit out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I see you crammed your study time in order to learn a soul defense; you seem quite confident.” Lin Ming still hadn’t taken out his spear. Since everyone had assumed that he was a soul force attack genius, then he would just go with the flow. He had already decided that unless he met a master which soul force was useless against, then he would use the Samsara martial intent as his only attack; this wasn’t just to hide his strength. If he constantly uses his Samsara martial intent, then he would be able to deepen the understanding of his Samsara martial intent and gain a higher realm of comprehension.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was becoming closer and closer to the Houtian and Xiantian realm. Sooner or later, Lin Ming would have to cultivate his soul. If he waited until then to ponder and understand how the Samsara martial intent was related to his soul, then it would be too late. So, if he was given an opportunity to practice his Samsara martial intent, of course he wouldn’t miss it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWang Mu’s faced flushed red. He coldly snorted, “Even if I don’t have a soul defense, I can still crush you with my cultivation. I’m not afraid of you!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs his voice fell, Wang Mu took out two swords from his spatial ring. He gripped a longsword in his right hand and a dagger in his left.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Dual blade user?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe audience’s eyes lit up. They hadn’t thought that Wang Mu would be a dual blade user. Before this, Wang Mu had only fought with his left hand. To use two blades was much more difficult than a single sword, but once one managed to master this power, then they would be a force to be reckoned with.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The two blade styles combine and complement each other!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWang Mu’s true essence began to rapidly revolve within his body. A deep purple color glimmered around the longsword and the dagger, as light glinted off the tip.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWang Mu took a fierce step forwards and his long sword thrust out followed with his dagger, a piercing sound breaking through the air.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeeing Wang Mu’s blades stab out, Lin Ming remained motionless. His eyes suddenly flashed with a black light.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Samsara martial intent had begun.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWang Mu felt as if his body were struck by a powerful force. The sword wind that was twirling around his blades scattered into nothing with the loss of his soul force supporting it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWang Mu paled as he stepped back, his heart filled with a surprised anger. His opponents soul force was simply like a sword light. Although it had managed to penetrate his soul force defense, it had been greatly weakened in the process. Even so, it had caused his spiritual sea to tremble. In that instant, he had seen countless illusions and had almost lost himself in that imaginary vortex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd worst of all, once his spiritual sea was struck then he wouldn’t be able to control his true essence. Any gorgeous or magnificent martial skill that he was using would be wasted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I have to strengthen my soul force defense, but my true essence is limited. If I strengthen my soul force defense, then my attack power will naturally weaken along with it. If I don’t have enough true essence, can I still use that move?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“At this point I don’t have any other choice.” Wang Mu grit his teeth and pushed his true essence to the extreme. The two blades in his hands began to rotate at an astonishing speed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Double Blade Vortex!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTrue essence formed an air current that began to swirl around the blades. A black vortex emerged from between the two swords, recklessly spinning as it grew larger and larger. A foul evil and cold air began to whisper in the wind, constantly emanating from that vortex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, when Wang Mu was about to strike out with this double bladed vortex, he was completely stunned as he watched the audience around him melt into nothingness. The skies evaporated and the ground vanished; he was suddenly a single person standing in an endless empty space. In the sky, there were two massive jet black vortexes that were savagely swirling around. When Wang Mu looked at these vortexes, it was as if he could see the profound void and the endless universe contained within.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCompared to these to titanic black vortexes, his own double sword vortex was absolutely nothing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that moment, a glimmer of dread and anguish appeared in Wang Mu’s mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a battle of soul force, a single momentary flaw in the mind would spell instant defeat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWang Mu’s soul force defense film completely broke apart. Countless shadows and images flooded into Wang Mu’s mind, surging through his spiritual sea, completely cutting off all his contact with the outside world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith the sound of metal hitting stone, both of Wang Mu’s blades fell the to the ground. His eyes dilated, his pupils blurred over, his face whitened, he foamed from the mouth, and a moment later, he slumped to the ground.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this duel, he had been thoroughly defeated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeeing Wang Mu’s defeat, Martial House Master Luo’s expression became extremely ugly. Qin Ziya cupped his hands together and smiled as he sent a true essence sound transmission, saying, “Thank you Martial House Master Luo for so generously gifting us with the Seraphic Pond. It was a good game.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough the words sounded polite they were actually full of sarcasm, grating on Martial House Master Luo’s ears as he heard them. Wang Mu had been defeated with only having used half a skill! But Lin Ming actually hadn’t moved at all, he had only glanced at Wang Mu twice.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHow was this possible? How could a peak Bone Forging boy defeat someone at the middle Pulse Condensation period? Not only that, but Wang Mu wasn’t any ordinary middle Pulse Condensation martial artist. \u0026nbsp;Even in the entire Seven Profound Valleys there weren’t many people that could do this.

After defeating Wang Mu, Lin Ming was already at the front of his group. He was only behind Jiang Lanjian and Bi Tinghua.

After all, he is a soul force attack expert. It simply isn’t the right path to walk to use such skills. Although it has a great effect now, later it will create a very big bottleneck, especially after the Xiantian realm when everyone begins to cultivate their soul. At that time, others’ soul force won’t be much weaker, rendering his soul attacks useless.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“They would have to reach the Xiantian realm first.
