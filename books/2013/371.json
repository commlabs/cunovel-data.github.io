I’m going to make him mine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yours?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. Did you know he’s saving himself for a woman of royal blood?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s not what the men inclined that way are saying.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where’d you hear that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Besides, you’re hardly royal blood, Smiles. Queen of shell-shuckers won’t cut it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s why I need you to lie for me. I was a Kanese princess-sent into the Malazan Army to keep the Claw from finding me-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, for Hood’s sake!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Shh! Listen, the rest in the squad said they’d be happy to lie for me. What’s wrong with you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Happy… ha, that’s good. Very good.’ He then turned to study her. ‘You’re eager for Skulldeath to take one of those flying leaps straight between your legs? You want to get pregnant with some prince from some Seven Cities flying squirrel tribe?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Pregnant? Aye, when dolphins walk and fish nest in trees. I won’t get pregnant,’ she pronounced. ‘Bottle’s giving me some herbs to take care of that. My beloved Skulldeath can empty gallons of his seed into me for Hood-damned ever and there won’t be any little jackrabbits jumping round.’;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He’s got the face of a girl,’ Koryk said. ‘And the men say he kisses like one, too.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who’s telling you all this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Saving his seed, that’s a laugh.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Listen, those men, they don’t mean nothing. Now, am I a Kanese princess or not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, aye. Rival to the empire’s throne, in fact. Be the fly-ing fish to the flying squirrel and make your nest in some tree, Smiles. When all’s done what’s needed doing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe surprised him with a bright smile. ‘Thanks, Koryk. You’re a true friend.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared after her as she hurried off. Poor lass. The squirrel’s saving his seed because he doesn’t know what to do with it, is my guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure walked past in the gloom and Koryk squinted until he recognized the man’s gait. ‘Hey, Bottle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young mage halted, looked over, then, feet dragging, approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoryk said, ‘You’re supposed to be asleep.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Thanks.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So you’re giving Smiles special herbs, are you. Why do you-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Herbs. So she won’t get pregnant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Look, if she doesn’t want to get pregnant, she should just stop straddling every-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hold on, Bottle! Wait. I thought she’d talked to you. About herbs which you promised to give her-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, those herbs. No, you got it all wrong, Koryk. Those aren’t to keep her from getting pregnant. In fact, it’s some concoction of my grandmother’s and I’ve no idea if it even works, but anyway, it’s got nothing to do with not getting pregnant. Why, if she’d asked me about that kind of stuff, sure, there’s some very reliable-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stop! What-what does this concoction you’re giving her do to her, then?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She’d better not be taking it! It’s for a man-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For Skulldeath?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Skulldeath? What…’ Bottle stared down for a long moment. ‘Do you know what skulldeath is, Koryk? It’s a plant that grows on Malaz Island and maybe Geni, too. You see, normally there’s male plants and there’s female plants and that’s how you get fruit and the like, right? Anyway, not so with the sweet little skulldeath. There’s only males-no females at all. Skulldeaths loose their-well, they spill it all out into the air, and it ends up somehow getting into the seeds of other plants and just riding along, hiding, until that seed sprouts, then it takes over and suddenly, another nice skulldeath with that grey flower that’s not really a flower at all, just a thin sack filled with-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So, that concoction Smiles asked for-what does it do?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Supposed to change a man who prefers other men into one who prefers women. Does it work? I have no idea.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Skulldeath may be a plant,’ Koryk said, ‘but it’s also the name for a soldier in Primly’s squad. A pretty one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, and that name…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is obviously very appropriate, Bottle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh. Poor Smiles.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Factor’s house might have looked nice, but it might as well have been made of straw, the way it fell down. Astonishing that no-one had died beneath all that wreckage. Urb at the least was certainly relieved by that, though his mood wilted somewhat after Hellian was through yelling at him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-371.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
