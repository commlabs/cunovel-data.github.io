{"id":8056,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"1750 Hours, November 27, 2525 (Military Calendar) / UNSC frigateCommonwealth en route to theUNSC Damascus Materials Testing Facility, planet Chi Ceti 4The view screen in the bunkroom of the UNSC frigateCommonwealth clicked on as the ship enterednormal space. Ice particles showered the external camera and gave the distant yellow sun, Chi Ceti, aghostly ring.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John watched and continued to ponder the wordMjolnir as they sped in-system. He had looked it up inthe education database. Mjolnir was the hammer used by the Norse god of thunder. Project MJOLNIRhad to be some kind of weapon. At least he hoped it was; they neededsomething to fight the Covenant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If it was a weapon, though, why was it here at the Damascus testing facility, on the very edge of UNSCcontrolledspace? He had only even heard of this system twenty-four hours ago.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned and surveyed the squad. Although this bunkroom had one hundred beds, the Spartans stillclustered together, playing cards, polishing boots, reading, exercising. Sam sparred with Kelly—although she had to slow herself down considerably to give him a chance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John was reminded that he didn’t like being on starships. The lack of control was disturbing. If hewasn’t stuck in “the freezer”—the starship’s cramped, unpleasant cryo chamber—he was left waitingand wondering what their next mission would be.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e During the last three weeks the Spartans had handled a variety of minor missions for Dr. Halsey. “Tyingup loose ends,” she had called it. Putting down rebel factions on Jericho VII. Removing a black-marketbazaar near the Roosevelt military base. Each mission had brought them closer to the Chi Ceti System.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John had made sure every member of his squad had participated in these missions. They had performedflawlessly. There had been no losses. Chief Mendez would have been proud of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Spartan-117,”Dr. Halsey’s voice blared over the loudspeaker.“Report to the bridge immediately.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John snapped to attention and keyed the intercom. “Yes, ma’am!” He turned to Sam. “Get everyoneready, in case we’re needed. On the double.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Affirmative,” Sam said. “You heard the Petty Officer. Dog those cards. Get into uniform, soldier!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John double-timed it to the elevator and punched the code for the bridge. Gravity faded out and thenback again as the elevator passed between rotating sections of the ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The doors parted and he stepped onto the bridge. Every wall had a screen. Some showed stars and thedistant red smear of a nebula. Other screens displayed the fusion reactor status and spectrums ofmicrowave broadcasts in the system.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A brass railing ringed the center of the bridge, and within sat four Junior Lieutenants at their stations:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e navigation, weapons, communications, and ship operations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John halted and saluted Captain Wallace, then nodded to Dr. Halsey.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Wallace stood with his right arm crooked behind his back. His left arm was missing from theelbow down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John remained saluting until the Captain returned the gesture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Over here, please,” Dr. Halsey said. “I want you to see this.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John walked across the rubberized deck and gave his full attention to the screen Dr. Halsey and CaptainWallace were scrutinizing. It displayed deconvoluted radar signals. It looked like tangled yarn to John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There—” Dr. Halsey pointed to a blip on the screen. “It’s there again.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Wallace stroked his dark beard, thinking, then said, “That puts our ghost at eighty millionkilometers. Even if it were a ship, it would take a full hour to get within weapons range. And besides—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He waved at the screen. “—it’s gone again.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “May I suggest that we go to battle stations, Captain,” Dr. Halsey told him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t see the point,” he said condescendingly; the Captain was clearly less than pleased about havinga civilian on his bridge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We haven’t let this be widely known,” she said, “but when the aliens were first detected at Harvest,they appeared at extreme range . . . and then they were suddenly much closer.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “An intrasystem jump?” John asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey smiled at him. “Correctly surmised, Spartan.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s not possible,” Captain Wallace remarked. “Slipstream space can’t be navigated that accurately.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You meanwe cannot navigate with that kind of accuracy,” she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Captain clenched and unclenched his jaw. He clicked the intercom. “General quarters: all hands tobattle stations. Seal bulkheads. I repeat: all hands, battle stations. This is not a drill. Reactors to ninetypercent. Come about to course one two five.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bridge lights darkened to a red hue. The deck rumbled beneath John’s boots and the entire ship tiltedas it changed heading. Pressure doors slammed shut and sealed John on the bridge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e TheCommonwealth stabilized on her new heading, and Dr. Halsey crossed her arms. She leaned overand whispered to John, “We’ll be using theCommonwealth ’s dropship to go to the testing facility on ChiCeti Four. We have to get to Project MJOLNIR.” She turned back and watched the radar screen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Beforethey do. So get the others ready.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, ma’am.” John keyed the intercom. “Sam, muster the squad in Bay Alpha. I want that Pelicanloaded and ready for drop in fifteen minutes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We’ll have it done in ten,”Sam replied.“Faster if those Longsword interceptor pilots get out of ourway.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John would have given anything to be belowdecks with the others. He felt as if he were being left behind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The radar screen flashed with blobs of eerie green light . . . almost as if the space aroundtheCommonwealth were boiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The collision alarm sounded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Brace for impact!” Captain Wallace said. He laced his arm around the brass railing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John grabbed an emergency handhold on the wall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Something appeared three thousand kilometers off theCommonwealth ’s prow. It was a sleek oval with asingle seam running along its lateral edge from stem to stern. Tiny lights winked on and off along itshull. A faint purple-tinged glow emitted from the tail. The ship was only a third the size oftheCommonwealth .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A Covenant ship,” Dr. Halsey said, and she involuntarily backed away from the view screens.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Wallace scowled. “COM officer: send a signal to Chi Ceti—see if they can send us somereinforcements.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Blue flashes flickered along the hull of the alien ship—so bright that even filtered through the externalcamera, they still made John’s eyes water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The outer hull of theCommonwealth sizzled and popped. Three screens filled with static.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Pulse lasers!” the lieutenant at the ops station screamed. “Communication dish destroyed. Armor insections three and four at twenty-five percent. Hull breach in section three. Sealing now.” TheLieutenant swiveled in his seat, sweat beaded on his forehead. “Ship AI core memory overloaded,” hesaid.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With the AI offline, the ship could still fire weapons and navigate through Slipstream space, but Johnknew it would take more time to make jump calculations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Come to heading zero three zero, declination one eight zero,” Caption Wallace ordered. “Arm Archermissile pods A through F. And give me a firing solution.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye aye,” the navigation and weapons officers said. “A through F pods armed.” They furiously tappedaway on their keypads. Seconds ticked by. “Firing solution ready, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Fire.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Pods A through F firing!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e TheCommonwealth had twenty-six pods, each loaded with thirty Archer high-explosive missiles. Onscreen, pods A through F opened, and launched—180 plumes of rocket exhaust that traced a path fromtheCommonwealth to the alien ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The enemy changed course, rotated so that the top of the ship faced the incoming missiles. It then movedstraight up at an alarming speed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Archer missiles altered their trajectory to track the ship, but half their number streaked past thetarget, clean misses.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The others impacted. Fire covered the skin of the alien ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good work, Lieutenant,” Captain Wallace said, and he clapped the young officer on the shoulder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey frowned and stared at the screen. “No,” she whispered. “Wait.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fire flared, then dimmed. The skin of the alien ship rippled like heat wavering off a hot road in thesummer. It fluttered with a metallic silver sheen, then brilliant white—and the fire faded, revealing theship beneath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was completely undamaged.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Energy shields,” Dr. Halsey muttered. She tapped her lower lip, thinking. “Even ships this small haveenergy shielding.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Lieutenant,” the Captain barked at the nav officer. “Cut main engines and fire maneuvering thrusters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rotate and track so that we’re pointing at that thing.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye aye, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The distant rumbling of theCommonwealth ’s main engines dimmed and stopped and she turned about.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her inertia kept the ship speeding toward the testing facility—now flying backward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What are you doing, Captain?” Dr. Halsey asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Arm the MAC,” Captain Wallace told the weapons officer. “A heavy round.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John understood: Turning your back to an enemy only gave them an advantage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The MAC—Magnetic Accelerator Cannon—was theCommonwealth ’s main weapon. It fired a superdenseferric tungsten shell. The tremendous mass and velocity of the projectile obliterated most ships onimpact. Unlike the Archer missiles, a MAC round was an unguided projectile; the firing solution had tobe perfect in order to hit the target—not an easy thing to do when both ships were moving rapidly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “MAC capacitors charging,” the weapons officer announced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Covenant ship turned its side toward theCommonwealth .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” the Captain murmured. “Give me a bigger target.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pinpoints of blue light glowed and then flared along the alien hull.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The tactical view screens on the nose of theCommonwealth went dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John heard sizzling overhead—then the muffled thumps of explosive decompressions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “More pulse laser hits,” the ops officer reported. “Armor in section three through seven down to fourcentimeters. Navigation dish destroyed. Hull breaches on decks two, five, and nine. We have a leak inthe port fuel tanks.” The Lieutenant’s hand shakily danced over the controls. “Pumping fuel to starboardreverse tanks. Sealing sections.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John shifted on his feet. He had to move. Act. Standing here—unable to get to his squad, not doinganything—was counter to every fiber of his being.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “MAC at one hundred percent,” the weapons officer shouted. “Ready to fire!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Fire!” Captain Wallace ordered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The lights on the bridge dimmed and theCommonwealth shuddered. The MAC bolt launched throughspace—a red-hot metal slug moving at thirty thousand meters per second.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Covenant ship’s engines flared to life and the ship veered away——Too late. The heavy round closed and slammed into the target’s prow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Covenant ship reeled backward through space. Its energy shields shimmered and glowed lightningbright. . . then flickered, dimmed, and went out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bridge crew let out a victory cheer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Except Dr. Halsey. John watched the view screen as she adjusted the camera controls and zoomed in onthe Covenant ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The vessel’s erratic spinning slowed and it came to a stop. The ship’s nose was crumpled andatmosphere vented into vacuum. Tiny fires flickered inside. The ship slowly came about and startedback toward them—gaining speed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It should have been destroyed,” she whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tiny red blobs appeared on the hull of the Covenant ship. They glowed and intensified and driftedtogether, collecting along the lateral line of the craft.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Wallace said, “Make ready another heavy round.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye aye,” the weapons officer said. “Charge at thirty percent. Firing solution online, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” Dr. Halsey said. “Evasive maneuvers, Captain. Now!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I won’t have my command second-guessed, ma’am.” The Captain turned to face her. “And with respect,Doctor , second-guessed by someone with no combat experience.” He stiffened and placed his handbehind his back. “I cannot have you removed from the bridge because the bulkheads are sealed . . . butanother outburst like that, Doctor, and Iwill have you gagged.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John shot a quick glance to Dr. Halsey. Her face flushed—he couldn’t tell from shame or rage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “MAC at fifty percent charge.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The red light continued to collect along the lateral line of the Covenant ship until it was a solid band. Itbrightened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Eighty percent charge.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They’re turning, sir,” the nav officer announced. “She’s coming to starboard.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ninety-five percent charge—one hundred,” the weapons officer announced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Send them to Hades, Lieutenant. Fire.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The lights dimmed again. TheCommonwealth shuddered and a bolt of thunder and fire tore through theblackness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Covenant ship stood its ground. The bloodred light that had pooled on its lateral line burst forth—streaked toward theCommonwealth , passing the MAC round a mere kilometer away. The red lightglowed and pulsed almost as if it were liquid; its edges roiled and fluttered. It elongated into a teardropof ruby light five meters long.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Evasive maneuvers,” Captain Wallace cried. “Emergency thrusters to port!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e TheCommonwealth slowly moved out of the trajectory path of the Covenant’s energy weapon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The MAC round struck the Covenant vessel amidships. Its shield shimmered and bubbled . . . thendisappeared. The MAC round punched through the craft and sent it spinning out of control.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The inbound ball of light moved, too. It started tracking the Commonwealth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Engines—full power astern,” the Captain ordered. TheCommonwealth rumbled and slowed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The light should have sped past them; instead, it sharply arced and struck her port amidships.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The air filled with a popping and sizzling. TheCommonwealth listed to starboard, then rolled completelyover and continued to tumble.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Stabilize,” the Captain cried. “Starboard thrusters.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Fire reported in sections one through twenty,” the ops officer said, panic creeping into his voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Decks two through seven in section one . . . have melted, sir. They’re gone.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It grew noticeably hotter on the bridge. Sweat beaded on John’s back and trickled down his spine. Hehad never felt so helpless. Were his teammates below decks alive or dead?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All port armor destroyed. Decks two through five in sections three, four, and five, are now out ofcontact, sir. It’s burning through us!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Wallace stood without saying a word. He stared at their one remaining view screen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey stepped forward. “Respectfully, Captain, I suggest that you alert the crew to get on respiratorpacks. Give them thirty seconds then vent the atmosphere on all decks, except the bridge.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The COM officer looked to the Captain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Do it,” the Captain said. “Sound the alert.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Deck thirteen destroyed,” the ops officer announced. “Fire is getting close the reactor. Hull structurestarting to buckle.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Vent atmosphere now,” Captain Wallance ordered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye aye,” the ops officer replied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was the sound of thumping through the hull . . . then nothing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Fire is dying out,” the ops officer said. “Hull temperature cooling—stabilizing.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What the hell did they hit us with?” Captain Wallace demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Plasma,” Dr. Halsey replied. “But not any plasma we know . . . they can actually guide its trajectorythrough space, without any detectable mechanism. Amazing.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Captain,” the navigator said. “Alien ship is pursuing.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Covenant vessel—a red-rimmed hole punched through its center—turned and started towardtheCommonwealth .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How . . . ?” Captain Wallace said unbelievingly. He quickly regained his wits. “Ready another MACheavy round.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The weapons officer slowly said, “MAC system destroyed, Captain.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We’re sitting ducks, then,” the Captain murmured.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey leaned against the brass railing. “Not quite. TheCommonwealth carries three nuclear missiles,correct, Captain?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A detonation this close would destroy us as well.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She frowned and cupped her hand to her chin, thinking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Excuse me, sir,” John said. “The alien’s tactics thus far have been unnecessarily vicious—like those ofan animal. They didn’t have to take that second MAC round while they fired at us. But they wanted toposition themselves to fire. In my opinion sir, they would stop and engageanything that challengedthem.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Captain looked to Dr. Halsey.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She shrugged and then nodded. “The Longsword interceptors?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Wallace turned his back to them and covered his face with his one hand. He sighed, nodded, andclicked on the intercom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Longsword Squadron Delta, this is the Captain. Get your ships into the black, boys, and engage theenemy ship. I need you to need to buy us some time.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Roger that, sir. We’re ready to launch. On our way.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Turn us around,” the Captain told the nav officer. “Give me best speed on a vector toward Chi CetiFour orbit.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Coolant leaks in the reactor, sir,” the ops officer said. “We can push the engines to thirty percent. Nomore.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Give me fifty percent,” he said. He turned to the weapons officer. “Arm one of our Shiva warheads. Setproximity fuse to one hundred meters.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e TheCommonwealth spun about. John felt the change in his stomach and he tightened his grip on therailing. The spinning slowed, stopped, then the ship accelerated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Reactor red-lining,” the ops officer reported. “Meltdown in twenty-five seconds.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Over the speakers, there was a crackle, a hiss of static, then:“Longsword interceptors engaging theenemy, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the remaining aft camera, there were flickers of light—the cold blue strobes of Covenant energyweapons, and the red-orange fireballs of the Longswords’ missiles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Launch the missile,” the Captain said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Meltdown in ten seconds.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Missile away.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A plume of exhaust divided the darkness of space.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Five seconds to meltdown,” the ops officer said. “Four, three, two—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Shunt drive plasma to space,” the Captain ordered. “Cut power to all systems.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Covenant ship was silhouetted for a split second by pure white—then the view screen snapped off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bridge lights went dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John could see everything, though. The bridge officers, Dr. Halsey as she clutched onto the railing, andCaptain Wallace as he stood and saluted the pilots he had just sent to die.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The hull of theCommonwealth rumbled and pinged as the shock wave enveloped them. It grew louder, asubsonic roar that shook John to his bones.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The noise seemed to go on forever in the darkness. It faded . . . then it was completely silent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Power us back up,” the Captain said. “Slowly. Give me ten percent from the reactors if we canmanage.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bridge lights came on, dimly, but they worked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Report,” the Captain ordered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All sensors offline,” the op officer said. “Resetting backup computer. Hang on. Scanning now. Lots ofdebris. It’s hot back there. All Longsword interceptors vaporized.” He looked up, the color drained fromhis face. “Covenant ship . . . intact, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” the Captain said, and made a fist.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s moving off, though,” the op officer said with a visible sigh of relief. “Very slowly.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What does it take to destroy one of those things?” the Captain whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We don’t know if our weaponscan destroy them,” Dr. Halsey said. “But at least we know we can slowthem down.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Captain stood straighter. “Best speed to the Damascus testing facility. We will execute a flyby orbit,and then proceed to a point twenty million kilometers distant to make repairs.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Captain?” Dr. Halsey said. “A flyby?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have orders to get you to the facility and retrieve whatever Section Three has stowed there, ma’am.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As we fly by, a dropship will take you and your—” He glanced at John. “—crew planet side. If theCovenant ship returns, we will be the bait to lure them away.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I understand, Captain.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We’ll rendezvous in orbit no later than 1900 hours.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey turned to John. “We need to hurry. We don’t have much time—and there is a great deal Ineed to show the Spartans.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, ma’am,” John said. He took a long look at the bridge, and hoped he never had to return.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/975/29425.html","bookId":266,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:12:10 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:12:10 AM"}
