Inside there were wounded people lying on the floor, with doctors and others attending them. Peter was marched down the corridor, and into a room where sat or stood several other men, more or less in a state of collapse like himself; people who had failed to satisfy the police, and were being held under guard. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Peter’s two policemen backed him against the wall and proceeded to go thru his pockets, producing the shameful contents—a soiled rag, and two cigarette butts picked up on the street, and a broken pipe, and a watch which had once cost a dollar, but was now out of order, and too badly damaged to be pawned. That was all they had any right to find, so far as Peter knew. But there came forth one thing more—the printed circular which Peter had thrust into his pocket. The policeman who pulled it out took a glance at it, and then cried, “Good God!” He stared at Peter, then he stared at the other policeman and handed him the paper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At that moment the man not in uniform entered the room. “Mr. Guffey!” cried the policeman. “See this!” The man took the paper, and glanced at it, and Peter, watching with bewildered and fascinated eyes, saw a most terrifying sight. It was as if the man went suddenly out of his mind. He glared at Peter, and under his black eyebrows the big staring eyes seemed ready to jump out of his head.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Aha!” he exclaimed; and then, “So I’ve got you!” The hand that held the paper was trembling, and the other hand reached out like a great claw, and fastened itself in the neck of Peter’s coat, and drew it together until Peter was squeezed tight. “You threw that bomb!” hissed the man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Wh-what?” gasped Peter, his voice almost fainting. “B-b-bomb?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Out with it!” cried the man, and his face came close to Peter’s, his teeth gleaming as if he were going to bite off Peter’s nose. “Out with it! Quick! Who helped you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My G-God!” said Peter. “I d-dunno what you mean.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You dare lie to me?” roared the man; and he shook Peter as if he meant to jar his teeth out. “No nonsense now! Who helped you make that bomb?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Peter’s voice rose to a scream of terror: “I never saw no bomb! I dunno what you’re talkin’ about!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You, come this way,” said the man, and started suddenly toward the door. It might have been more convenient if he had turned Peter around, and got him by the back of his coat-collar; but he evidently held Peter’s physical being as a thing too slight for consideration—he just kept his grip in the bosom of Peter’s jacket, and half lifted him and half shoved him back out of the room, and down a long passage to the back part of the building. And all the time he was hissing into Peter’s face: “I’ll have it out of you! Don’t think you can lie to me! Make up your mind to it, you’re going to come thru!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man opened a door. It was some kind of storeroom, and he walked Peter inside and slammed the door behind him. “Now, out with it!” he said. The man thrust into his pocket the printed circular, or whatever it was—Peter never saw it again, and never found out what was printed on it. With his free hand the man grabbed one of Peter’s hands, or rather one finger of Peter’s hand, and bent it suddenly backward with terrible violence. “Oh!” screamed Peter. “Stop!” And then, with a wild shriek, “You’ll break it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I mean to break it! mean to break every bone in your body! I’ll tear your finger-nails out; I’ll tear the eyes out of your head, if I have to! You tell me who helped you make that bomb!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Peter broke out in a storm of agonized protest; he had never heard of any bomb, he didn’t know what the man was talking about; he writhed and twisted and doubled himself over backward, trying to evade the frightful pain of that pressure on his finger.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You’re lying!” insisted Guffey. “I know you’re lying. You’re one of that crowd.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What crowd? Ouch! I dunno what you mean!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You’re one of them Reds, aint you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Reds? What are Reds?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You want to tell me you don’t know what a Red is? Aint you been giving out them circulars on the street?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I never seen the circular!” repeated Peter. “I never seen a word in it; I dunno what it is.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You try to stuff me with that?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Some woman gimme that circular on the street! Ouch! Stop! Jesus! I tell you I never looked at the circular!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You dare go on lying?” shouted the man, with fresh access of rage. “And when I seen you with them Reds? I know about your plots, I’m going to get it out of you.” He grabbed Peter’s wrist and began to twist it, and Peter half turned over in the effort to save himself, and shrieked again, in more piercing tones, “I dunno! I dunno!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What’s them fellows done for you that you protect them?” demanded the other. “What good’ll it do you if we hang you and let them escape?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But Peter only screamed and wept the louder.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They’ll have time to get out of town,” persisted the other. “If you speak quick we can nab them all, and then I’ll let you go. You understand, we won’t do a thing to you, if you’ll come thru and tell us who put you up to this. We know it wasn’t you that planned it; it’s the big fellows we want.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He began to wheedle and coax Peter; but then, when Peter answered again with his provoking “I dunno,” he would give another twist to Peter’s wrist, and Peter would yell, almost incoherent with terror and pain—but still declaring that he could tell nothing, he knew nothing about any bomb.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So at last Guffey wearied of this futile inquisition; or perhaps it occurred to him that this was too public a place for the prosecution of a “third degree”—there might be some one listening outside the door. He stopped twisting Peter’s wrist, and tilted back Peter’s head so that Peter’s frightened eyes were staring into his.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now, young fellow,” he said, “look here. I got no time for you just now, but you’re going to jail, you’re my prisoner, and make up your mind to it, sooner or later I’m going to get it out of you. It may take a day, or it may take a month, but you’re going to tell me about this bomb plot, and who printed this here circular opposed to Preparedness, and all about these Reds you work with. I’m telling you now—so you think it over; and meantime, you hold your mouth, don’t say a word to a living soul, or if you do I’ll tear your tongue out of your throat.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then, paying no attention to Peter’s wailings, he took him by the back of the collar and marched him down the hall again, and turned him over to one of the policemen. “Take this man to the city jail,” he said, “and put him in the hole, and keep him there until I come, and don’t let him speak a word to anybody. If he tries it, mash his mouth for him.” So the policeman took poor sobbing Peter by the arm and marched him out of the building.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3225/87990.html","bookId":701,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:08:10 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:08:10 AM"}
