Their sandals were too thin to protect their feet against the stony ground, and their habits caught on everything. Sister Teresa found she could not even say her rosary. She needed both hands to keep the branches from snapping in her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the light of day, freedom seemed even more terrifying than before. God had cast the sisters out of Eden into a strange, frightening world, and His guidance which they had leaned on for so long was gone. They found themselves in an uncharted country with no map and no compass. The walls that had protected them from harm for so long had vanished and they felt naked and exposed. Danger was everywhere, and they no longer had a place of refuge. They were aliens. The unaccustomed sights and sounds of the country were dazzling. There were insects and bird songs and hot, blue skies assaulting their senses. And there was something else that was disturbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had first fled the convent, Teresa, Graciela, and Megan had carefully avoided looking at one another, instinctively keeping to the rules. But now, each found herself avidly studying the faces of the others. Also, after all the years of silence, they found it difficult to speak, and when they did speak, their words were halting, as though they were learning a strange new skill. Their voices sounded strange in their ears. Only Lucia seemed uninhibited and sure of herself, and the others automatically turned to her for leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We might as well introduce ourselves,\" Lucia said. \"I\u0027m Sister Lucia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an awkward pause, and Graciela said shyly, \"I\u0027m Sister Graciela.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark-haired, arrestingly beautiful one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Sister Megan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young blonde with the striking blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Sister Teresa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eldest of the group. Fifty? Sixty?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they lay in the woods resting outside the village, Lucia thought: They\u0027re like newborn birds fallen out of their nests. They won\u0027t last five minutes on their own. Well, too bad for them. I\u0027ll be on my way to Switzerland with the cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia walked to the edge of the clearing they were in and peered through the trees toward the little village below. A few people were walking along the street, but there was no sign of the men who had raided the convent. Now, Lucia thought. Here\u0027s my chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to the others. \"I\u0027m going down to the village to try to get us some food. You wait here.\" She nodded toward Sister Teresa. \"You come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Teresa was confused. For thirty years she had obeyed only the orders of the Reverend Mother Betina, and now suddenly this sister had taken charge. But what is happening is God\u0027s will, Sister Teresa thought. He has appointed her to help us, so she speaks with His voice. \"I must get this cross to the convent at Mendavia as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. When we get down there, we\u0027ll ask for directions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them started down the hill toward the town, Lucia keeping a careful lookout for trouble. There was none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is going to be easy, Lucia thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the outskirts of the little town. A sign said VILLACASTiN. Ahead of them was the main street. To the left was a small, deserted street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood, Lucia thought. There would be no one to witness what was about to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia turned into the side street. \"Let\u0027s go this way. There\u0027s less chance of being seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Teresa nodded and obediently followed. The question now was how to get the cross away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could grab it and run, Lucia thought, but she\u0027d probably scream and attract a lot of attention. No, I\u0027ll have to make sure she stays quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small limb of a tree had fallen to the ground in front of her, and Lucia paused, then stooped to pick it up. It was heavy. Perfect. She waited for Sister Teresa to catch up to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister Teresa...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun turned to look at her, and as Lucia started to raise the club, a male voice from out of nowhere said, \"God be with you, Sisters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia spun around, ready to run. A man was standing there, dressed in the long brown robe and cowl of a friar. He was tall and thin, with an aquiline face and the saintliest expression Lucia had ever seen. His eyes seemed to glow with a warm inner light, and his voice was soft and gentle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Friar Miguel Carrillo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia\u0027s mind was racing. Her first plan had been interrupted. But now, suddenly, she had a better one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God you found us,\" Lucia said. This man was going to be her escape. He would know the easiest way for her to get out of Spain. \"We come from the Cistercian convent near avila,\" she explained. \"Last night some men raided it. All the nuns were taken. Four of us managed to escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the friar replied, his voice was filled with anger. \"I come from the monastery at San Generro, where I have been for the past twenty years. We were attacked the night before last.\" He sighed. \"I know that God has some plan for all His children, but I must confess that at this moment I don\u0027t understand what it might be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These men are searching for us,\" Lucia said. \"It is important that we get out of Spain as fast as possible. Do you know how that can be done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Carrillo smiled gently. \"I think I can help you, Sister. God has brought us together. Take me to the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin a few minutes Lucia had brought the friar to the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Friar Carrillo,\" she said. \"He\u0027s been in a monastery for the last twenty years. He\u0027s come to help us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir reactions to the friar were mixed. Graciela dared not look directly at him; Megan studied him with quick, interested glances; and Sister Teresa regarded him as a messenger sent by God who would lead them to the convent at Mendavia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Carrillo said, \"The men who attacked the convent will undoubtedly keep searching for you. But they will be looking for four nuns. The first thing you must do is change your clothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan reminded him, \"We have no clothes to change into.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Carrillo gave her a beatific smile. \"Our Lord has a very large wardrobe. Do not worry, my child. He will provide. Let us go back into town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was two o\u0027clock in the afternoon, siesta time, and Friar Carrillo and the four sisters walked down the main street of the village, alert for any signs of their pursuers. The shops were closed, but the restaurants and bars were open and from them they could hear strange music issuing, hard, dissonant, and raucous-sounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Carrillo saw the look on Sister Teresa\u0027s face. \"That\u0027s rock and roll,\" he said. \"Very popular with the young these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of young women standing in front of one of the bars stared at the nuns as they passed. The nuns stared back, wide-eyed, at the strange clothing the pair wore. One wore a skirt so short it barely covered her thighs, and the other wore a longer skirt that was split up to the sides of her thighs. Both wore tight knitted bodices with no sleeves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey might as well be naked, Sister Teresa thought, horrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the doorway stood a man who wore a turtleneck sweater, a strange-looking jacket without a collar, and a jeweled pendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfamiliar odors greeted the nuns as they passed a bodega. Nicotine and whiskey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan was staring at something across the street. She stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Carrillo said, \"What is it? What\u0027s the matter?\" He turned to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan was watching a woman carrying a baby. How many years had it been since she had seen a baby, or even a small child? Not since the orphanage, fourteen years ago. The sudden shock made Megan realize how far her life had been removed from the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Teresa was staring at the baby too, but she was thinking of something else. It\u0027s Monique\u0027s baby. The baby across the street was screaming. It\u0027s screaming because I deserted it. But no, that\u0027s impossible. That was thirty years ago. Sister Teresa turned away, the baby\u0027s cries ringing in her ears. They moved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed a motion-picture theater. The marquee read Three Lovers, and the photographs displayed showed skimpily clad women embracing a bare-chested man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, they\u0027re - they\u0027re almost naked!\" Sister Teresa exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Carrillo frowned. \"Yes. It\u0027s disgraceful what the cinema is permitted to show these days. That movie is pure pornography. The most personal and private acts are there for everyone to see. They turn God\u0027s children into animals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed a hardware store, a hairdressing salon, a flower shop, a candy store, all closed for the siesta, and at each shop the sisters stopped and stared at the windows, filled with once-familiar, faintly remembered artifacts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they came to a women\u0027s dress shop, Friar Carrillo said, \"Stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shades were pulled down over the front windows and a sign on the front door said CLOSED.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait here for me, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four women watched as he walked to the corner and turned out of sight. They looked at one another blankly. Where was he going, and what if he did not return?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, they heard the sound of the front door of the shop opening, and Friar Carrillo stood in the doorway, beaming. He motioned them inside. \"Hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were all in the store and the friar had locked the door, Lucia asked, \"How did you - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God provides a back door as well as a front door,\" the friar said gravely. But there was an impish edge to his voice that made Megan smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sisters looked around the shop in awe. The store was a multicolored cornucopia of dresses and sweaters, bras and stockings, high-heeled shoes and boleros. Objects they had not seen in years. And the styles seemed so strange. There were purses and scarves and compacts and blouses. It was all too much to absorb. The women stood there, gaping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must move quickly,\" Friar Carrillo warned them, \"and leave before siesta is over and the store reopens. Help yourselves. Choose whatever fits you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia thought: Thank God I can finally dress like a woman again. She walked over to a rack of dresses and began to sort through them. She found a beige skirt and a tan silk blouse to go with it. It\u0027s not Balenciaga, but it will do for now. She picked out panties and a bra and a pair of soft boots, then stepped behind a clothes rack, stripped, and in a matter of minutes was dressed and ready to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others were slowly selecting their outfits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraciela chose a white cotton dress that set off her black hair and dark complexion, and a pair of sandals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan chose a patterned blue cotton dress that fell below the knees and low-heeled shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Teresa had the most difficult time choosing something to wear. The array of choices was too dazzling. There were silks and flannels and tweeds and leather. There were cottons and twills and corduroys, and there were plaids and checks and stripes of every color. And they all seemed - skimpy was the word that came to Sister Teresa\u0027s mind. For the past thirty years she had been decently covered by the heavy robes of her calling. And now she was being asked to shed them and put on these indecent creations. She finally selected the longest skirt she could find, and a long-sleeved, high-collared cotton blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Carrillo urged, \"Hurry, Sisters. Get undressed and change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked at one another in embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"I\u0027ll wait in the office, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to the back of the store and entered the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sisters began to undress, painfully self-conscious in front of one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the office, Friar Carrillo had pulled a chair up to the transom and was looking out through it, watching the sisters strip. He was thinking: Which one am I going to screw first?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguel Carrillo had begun his career as a thief when he was only ten years old. He was born with curly blond hair and an angelic face, which had proved to be of inestimable value in his chosen profession. He started at the bottom, snatching purses and shoplifting, and as he got older, his career expanded and he began to roll drunks and prey on wealthy women. Because of his enormous appeal, he was very successful. He devised several original swindles, each more ingenious than the last. Unfortunately, his latest swindle had proved to be his undoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePosing as a friar from a distant monastery, Carrillo traveled from church to church begging sanctuary for the night. It was always granted, and in the morning when the priest came to open the church doors, all the valuable artifacts would be missing, along with the good friar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, fate had double-crossed him. Two nights earlier in Bejar, a small town near avila, the priest had returned unexpectedly and Miguel Carrillo had been caught in the act of pilfering the church treasury. The priest was a beefy, heavyset man, and he had wrestled Carrillo to the ground and announced that he was going to turn him over to the police. A heavy silver chalice had fallen to the floor, and Carrillo had picked it up and hit the priest with it. Either the chalice was too heavy or the priest\u0027s skull was too thin, but in any case the priest lay dead on the floor. Miguel Carrillo had fled, panicky, anxious to put himself as far away from the scene of the crime as possible. He had passed through avila and heard the story of the attack on the convent by Colonel Acoca and the secret GOE. It was fate that Carrillo had chanced upon the four escaped nuns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, eager with anticipation, he studied their naked bodies and thought: There\u0027s another interesting possibility. Since Colonel Acoca and his men are looking for the sisters, there is probably a nice, fat reward on their heads. I\u0027ll lay them first, and then turn them over to Acoca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women, except for Lucia, who was already dressed, were totally naked. Carrillo watched as they awkwardly put on the new underclothes. Then they finished dressing, clumsily buttoning unaccustomed buttons and fastening zippers, hurrying to get away before they were caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to get to work, Carrillo thought happily. He got down from the chair and walked out into the store. He approached the women, studied them approvingly, and said, \"Excellent. No one in the world would ever take you for nuns. I might suggest scarves for your heads.\" He selected one for each of them and watched them put them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguel Carrillo had made his decision. Graciela was going to be the first. She was undoubtedly one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. And that body! How could she have wasted it on God? I\u0027ll show her what to do with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to Lucia, Teresa, and Megan, \"You must all be hungry. I want you to go to the cafe we passed and wait for us there. I\u0027ll go to the church and borrow some money from the priest so we can eat.\" He turned to Graciela. \"I want you to come with me, Sister, to explain to the priest what happened at the convent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - very well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrillo said to the others, \"We\u0027ll be along in a little while. I would suggest you use the back door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched as Lucia, Teresa, and Megan left. When he heard the door close behind them, he turned to Graciela. She\u0027s fantastic, he thought. Maybe I\u0027ll keep her with me, break her in to some cons. She could be a big help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraciela was watching him. \"I\u0027m ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\" Carrillo pretended to study her for a moment. \"No, I\u0027m afraid it won\u0027t do. That dress is all wrong for you. Take it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t fit properly,\" Carrillo said glibly. \"People will notice, and you don\u0027t want to attract attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, then moved behind a rack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry, now. We have very little time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwkwardly, Graciela slipped the dress over her head. She was in her panties and brassiere when Carrillo suddenly appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take everything off.\" His voice was husky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraciela stared at him. \"What? No!\" she cried. \"I - I can\u0027t. Please - I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrillo moved closer to her. \"I\u0027ll help you, Sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands reached out and he ripped off her brassiere and tore at her panties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" she screamed. \"You mustn\u0027t! Stop it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrillo grinned. \"Carita, we\u0027re just getting started. You\u0027re going to love this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis strong arms were around her. He forced her to the floor and lifted his robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as though a curtain in Graciela\u0027s mind suddenly descended. It was the Moor trying to thrust himself inside her, tearing into the depths of her, and her mother\u0027s shrill voice was screaming. And Graciela thought, terrified, No, not again. No, please - not again...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was struggling fiercely now, fighting Carrillo off, trying to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamn you,\" he cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed his fist into her face, and Graciela fell back, stunned and dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found herself spinning back in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack...Back... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-6.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
