His voice was neither angry nor fatuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe added shortly, \"Elena is dying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last three words seemed to affect Stefan particularly, although Elena couldn\u0027t parse them. Stefan wasn\u0027t moving, just breathing hard, his eyes wide. \"Bonnie and I have been gathering hay and fuel and we\u0027re All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been exercising - moving about - wearing clothes that kept you warm. She\u0027s been dunked in ice water and sitting Still - high up in the wind. I got the other thurg to break off wood from the dead trees around here and try it on the fire. Now get the hel in, Stefan, and give her some body warmth, or I\u0027m going to make her a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nnn,\"Elena tried to say, but Stefan didn\u0027t seem to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon, however, said, \"Don\u0027t worry. He\u0027s going to warm you up from the other side. You won\u0027t have to become a vampire just yet. For God\u0027s sake,\"he added suddenly, explosively,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"some prince you picked!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan\u0027s voice was quiet and tense. \"You tried putting her in a thermal envelope?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I tried, you idiot! No magic works beyond the Mirror except telepathy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena had no sense of time going by, but suddenly there was a familiar body pressed against hers from the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd somewhere directly in her mind: Elena? Elena? You\u0027re All right, aren\u0027t you, Elena? I don\u0027t care whether you\u0027re playing a joke on me. But you\u0027re real y All right, aren\u0027t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust tell me that, love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena wasn\u0027t able to answer at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimly, fragments of sound came to her ears: \"Bonnie...on top of her and...pack ourselves back on either side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd dul feelings stirred her sense of touch: a smal body, almost weightless, like a thick blanket, pressing down on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone sobbing, tears dripping on her neck from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd warmth on either side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m asleep with the other kittens, she thought, dozing. Maybe we\u0027l have a nice dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish we could know how they\u0027re doing,\"Meredith said, on a pause from one of her pacing bouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish they knew how we\u0027re doing,\"Matt said wearily as he taped another note card amulet onto a window. And another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know, my dears, I kept hearing a child crying last night in my dreams,\"Mrs. Flowers said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith turned, startled. \"So did I! Right out on the front porch, it sounded like. But I was too tired to get up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might mean something - or nothing at all.\"Mrs. Flowers frowned. She was boiling tap water for tea. The electricity was sporadic. Matt and Saber had driven back to the boardinghouse earlier that day so that Matt could gather Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlowers\u0027s most important instruments - her herbs for teas, compresses, and poultices. He hadn\u0027t had the heart to tel her about the state of the boardinghouse, or what those maggot malach had done to it. He\u0027d had to find a loose board from the garage to get from the hal to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no third floor anymore and very little second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least he hadn\u0027t run into Shinichi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I\u0027m saying is that maybe there\u0027s some real kid out there,\"Meredith said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At night alone? Sounds like a Shinichi zombie,\"Matt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. But maybe not. Mrs. Flowers, do you have any idea of when you hear the crying? Early in the night or late?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me think, dear. It seems to me that I hear it whenever I wake up - and old people wake up quite frequently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I usual y hear it toward the morning - but I usual y sleep without dreaming for the first few hours and wake up early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Flowers turned to Matt. \"What about you, Matt, dear?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you ever hear a sound like crying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt, who deliberately overworked himself these days to try to get a solid six hours of sleep at night, said, \"I\u0027ve heard the wind kind of moaning and sobbing around midnight, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds as if we have an al -night ghost, my dears,\"Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlowers said calmly and poured them each a mug of tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt saw Meredith glance at him uneasily - but Meredith didn\u0027t know Mrs. Flowers as well as he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t real y think it\u0027s a ghost,\"he said now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t. Ma ma hasn\u0027t said a word about it, and then it\u0027s your house, Matt, dear. No gruesome murders or hideous secrets in its past, I should think. Let me see...\"She shut her eyes and let Matt and Meredith go on with their tea. Then she opened her eyes and gave them a puzzled smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma ma says \u0027search the house for your ghost. Then listen well to what it has to say.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\"Matt said poker-faced. \"Since it\u0027s my house, I guess I\u0027d better search for it. But when? Should I set an alarm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the best way would be to arrange a watch rota,\" Mrs. Flowers said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\"Meredith agreed promptly. \"I\u0027l take the middle watch, from midnight to four; Matt can have the first one; and Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlowers, you can have the early-morning one, and get a nap in the afternoon if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt felt uneasy. \"Why don\u0027t we just break it up into two watches and the two of you can share one? I\u0027l take the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, dear Matt,\"Meredith said, \"we don\u0027t want to be treated like \u0027ladies.\u0027And don\u0027t argue\" - she hefted the fighting stave - \"because I\u0027m the one with the heavy equipment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was shaking the room. Shaking Matt with it. Stillhalf-asleep, he put his hand under his pil ow and pul ed out the revolver. A hand grabbed it and he heard a voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt! It\u0027s me, Meredith! Wake up, wil you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroggily, Matt reached for the lamp switch. Again, strong, slim cold fingers prevented him from doing what he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No light,\"Meredith whispered. \"It\u0027s very faint, but if you come with me quietly, you can hear it. The crying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat woke Matt up the rest of the way. \"Right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoing his best to walk quietly through the dark hal s, Matt fol owed Meredith to the downstairs living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sh!\"Meredith warned. \"Listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt listened. He could hear some sobbing All right, and maybe some words, but they didn\u0027t sound al that ghostly to him. He put his ear to the wal and listened. The crying was louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we have a flashlight?\"Matt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have two, my dears. But this is a very dangerous time of night.\"Mrs. Flowers was a shadow against darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please give the flashlights to us,\"said Matt. \"I don\u0027t think our ghost is very supernatural. What time is it, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About twelve forty A.M.,\"Meredith answered. \"But why do you think it isn\u0027t supernatural?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I think it\u0027s living in our basement,\"Matt said. \"I think it\u0027s Cole Reece. The kid who ate his guinea pig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, with the stave, two flashlights, and Saber, they had caught their ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean anything bad,\"Cole sobbed, when they had lured him upstairs with promises of candy and \"magic\"tea that would let him sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t hurt anything, honest,\"he choked, wolfing down Hershey bar after Hershey bar from their emergency rations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m scared that he\u0027s onto me. Because after you hit me with that sticky note, I haven\u0027t been able to hear him in my head anymore. And then you came here\" - he gestured around Matt\u0027s house - \"and you had amulets and I figured it would be better to stay inside them. Or it could be my Last Midnight too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was babbling. But something about the last words made Matt say, \"What do you mean...\u0027your Last Midnight too\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole looked at him in terror. The rim of melted Hershey bar around his lips made Matt remember the last time he\u0027d seen the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, don\u0027t you?\"Cole faltered. \"About the midnights?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe countdown? Twelve days til the Last Midnight? Eleven days til the Last Midnight? And now...tonight is one day til the Last Midnight...\"He began to sob again, even while cramming chocolate into his mouth. It was clear that he was starving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what happens on the Last Midnight?\"Meredith asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, don\u0027t you? That that\u0027s the time when... you know.\"Maddeningly Cole seemed to think they were testing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt put his hands on Cole\u0027s shoulders, and to his horror felt bones under his fingers. The kid really was starving, he thought, forgiving him al the Hershey bars. His eyes met Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlowers\u0027s eyes and she immediately went to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Cole wasn\u0027t answering; he was mumbling incoherently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt forced himself to apply pressure to those bony shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cole, talk louder! What\u0027s this Last Midnight about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know. That\u0027s when...al the kids... you know, they wait up and at midnight...they get knives or guns. You know. And we go into our parents\u0027room while they\u0027re asleep and...\"Cole broke down again, but Matt noticed he had slipped into saying \"we\"and \"our\"by the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith spoke in her calm, steady voice. \"The children are going to kil their parents, is that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He showed us where to slash or stab. Or if there\u0027s a gun - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt had heard enough. \"You can stay - in the basement,\"he said. \"And here are some amulets. Put them on you if you feel like you\u0027re in danger.\"He gave Cole a whole packet of Post-it Notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just don\u0027t be afraid,\"Meredith added, as Mrs. Flowers came in with a plate of sausages and fried potatoes for Cole. At any other time the smel would have made Matt hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just like that island in Japan,\"he said. \"Shinichi and Misao made it happen there, and they\u0027re going to do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say time\u0027s running out. Actual y it\u0027s already the Last Midnight day - it\u0027s nearly one thirty in the morning,\"Meredith said. \"We have less than twenty-four hours. We should either get out of Fel \u0027s Church or do something to arrange a confrontation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A confrontation? Without Elena or Damon or Stefan?\"Matt said. \"We\u0027l be murdered. Don\u0027t forget Sheriff Mossberg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t have this.\"Meredith tossed the fighting stave into the air, caught it neatly, and put it at her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt shook his head. \"Shinichi wil Stillkil you. Or some little kid wil , with the semi-automatic from Daddy\u0027s closet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt thought. His head was pounding. Final y he said, head lowered, \"When I got the herbs I got Misao\u0027s star bal , too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re kidding. Shinichi still didn\u0027t find it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. And maybe we could do something with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt looked at Meredith, who looked at Mrs. Flowers. Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlowers said, \"What about pouring out the liquid in different places in Fel \u0027s Church? Just a drop here and a drop there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could ask the Power in it to protect the town. Maybe it would listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith said, \"That was the exact reason we wanted to get Shinichi\u0027s and Misao\u0027s star bal s in the first place. The star bal s control their owners, according to legend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt said, \"It may be old-ways thinking, but I agree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith said, \"Then let\u0027s do it right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the other two waited, Matt got Misao\u0027s star bal . It had a very, very little liquid on the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After the Last Midnight she plans to fil it to the top with the energy of the new lives that get taken,\"Meredith said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she\u0027s not going to get a chance to do that,\"Matt said flatly. \"When we\u0027re done we\u0027l destroy the container.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we probably should hurry,\"Meredith added. \"Let\u0027s get some weapons together: something silver, something long and heavy, like a fire iron.
