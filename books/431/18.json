But Mr. Paine knew that Robert would be mortified by such an offer, and he answered:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you, Robert; I will accept your gift with thanks on one condition.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is it, Mr. Paine?\" inquired our hero, a little puzzled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That you will take tea with us to-morrow evening, and help us do justice to them.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you,\" said Robert, not a little pleased at the invitation, \"but I shouldn\u0027t like to leave my mother at home alone.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, we must have your mother, too.

Besides, he was led to value it more on account of the persistent efforts of Halbert to injure him in the general estimation. Then, too, it was pleasant to think that he was to sit down to the same table with Hester, as her father\u0027s guest, and to receive a call from her at his own house. Nothing that Mr. Paine could have done would have afforded him an equal amount of gratification.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There is one other matter I wanted to speak to you about, Mr. Paine,\" he said. \"Will you take care of some money for me until I get a chance to deposit it in the savings bank?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly, Robert,\" was the reply, but the lawyer\u0027s manner showed some surprise. He knew the circumstances of the Rushtons, and he had not supposed they had any money on hand. \"How much is it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Six hundred and thirty-five dollars,\" answered Robert, producing it. \"Will you count it, and see if it is all right?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is this your money?\" asked the lawyer, laying down his pen and gazing at Robert in astonishment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Robert, enjoying his surprise. \"I will tell you how I got it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So the story was told, with a modest reserve as to his own courage, but still showing, without his intending it, how nobly he had behaved.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Give me your hand, Robert,\" said Mr. Paine, cordially. \"You have shown yourself a hero.

He had the approval of his own conscience, the good opinion of those whom he most respected and a provision against want sufficient to avert all present anxiety.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There is one thing more, Mr. Paine,\" he added. \"It\u0027s about the boat Will was kind enough to lend me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you seen the carpenter about repairing it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir, and he will attend to it as soon as he can spare the time. But that was not what I wanted to say. I think I ought to bear the expense of repairing it. I would have spoken about it at first, but then I had no money, and didn\u0027t know when I should have any. Will you be kind enough to take as much of my money as will be needed to pay Mr. Plane\u0027s bill when it comes in?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly not, Robert.

I am able and willing to pay it. It is very honorable in you to make the offer, and I like you the better for having made it. Won\u0027t you need any of this money for present expenses?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps I had better take the thirty-five dollars.

He sprang to his feet and opened the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good-evening, Robert,\" she said. \"Is your mother at home?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Hester.

That can be imagined, as well as Halbert\u0027s chagrin when he heard of the attention his rival was receiving in a quarter where he himself so earnestly desired to stand well.
