He didn’t let go, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayrd fished a few things out from beside his bedroll. After that, he nodded to the others, and they joined him—eight men of Lord Jarid’s personal guard, dragging the sputtering lord himself through the remnants of camp. They passed smoldering fires and fallen tents, abandoned by men who were trailing out into the darkness in greater numbers now, heading north. Into the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the edge of camp, Bayrd selected a nice, stout tree. He waved to the others, and they took the rope he’d fetched and tied Lord Jarid to the tree. The man sputtered until Morear gagged him with a handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayrd stepped in close. He tucked a waterskin into the crook of Jarid\u0027s arm. \"Don’t struggle too much or you’ll drop that, my Lord. You should be able to push the gag off—it doesn’t look too tight—and angle the waterskin up to drink. Here, I’ll take out the cork\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarid stared thunder at Bayrd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s not about you, my Lord\", Bayrd said. \"You always treated my family well. But, here, we can’t have you following along and making life difficult. There’s just something that we need to do, and you’re stopping everyone from doing it. Maybe someone should have said something earlier. Well, that’s done. Sometimes, you let the meat hang too long, and the entire haunch has to go\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded to the others, who ran off to gather bedrolls. He pointed Rosse toward the slate outcropping nearby and told him what to look for in good spearhead stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayrd turned back to the struggling Lord Jarid. \"This isn’t witches, my Lord. This isn’t Elayne . . . I suppose I should call her the Queen. Funny, thinking of a pretty young thing like that as queen. I’d rather have bounced her on my knee at an inn than bow to her, but Andor will need a ruler to follow to the Last Battle, and it isn’t your wife. I’m sorry\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarid sagged in his bonds, the anger seeming to bleed from him. He was weeping now. Odd thing to see, that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’ll tell people we pass—if we pass any—where you are\", Bayrd promised, \"and that you probably have some jewels on you. They might come for you. They might\". He hesitated. \"You shouldn’t have stood in the way. Everyone seems to know what is coming but you. The Dragon is reborn, old bonds are broken, old oaths done away with... and I’ll be hanged before I let Andor march to the Last Battle without me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayrd left, walking into the night, raising his new spear onto his shoulder. I have an oath older than the one to your family, anyway. An oath the Dragon himself couldn’t undo. It was an oath to the land. The stones were in his blood, and his blood in the stones of this Andor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayrd gathered the others and they left for the north. Behind them in the night, their lord whimpered, alone, as the ghosts began to move through camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes tugged on Selfar’s reins, making the horse dance and shake his head. The roan seemed eager. Perhaps Selfar sensed his master’s anxious mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night air was thick with smoke. Smoke and screams. Talmanes marched the Band alongside a road clogged with refugees smudged with soot. They moved like flotsam in a muddy river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men of the Band eyed the refugees with worry. \"Steady!\" Talmanes shouted to them. \"We can’t sprint all the way to Caemlyn. Steady!\" He marched the men as quickly as he dared, nearly at a jog. Their armor clanked. Elayne had taken half of the Band with her to the Field of Merrilor, including Estean and most of the cavalry. Perhaps she had anticipated needing to withdraw quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Talmanes wouldn’t have much use for cavalry in the streets, which were no doubt as clogged as this roadway. Selfar snorted and shook his head. They were close now; the city walls just ahead—black in the night—held in an angry light. It was as if the city were a firepit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy grace and banners fallen, Talmanes thought with a shiver. Enormous clouds of smoke billowed over the city. This was bad. Far worse than when the Aiel had come for Cairhien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes finally gave Selfar his head. The roan galloped along the side of the road for a time; then Talmanes reluctantly forced his way across, ignoring pleas for help. Time he’d spent with Mat made him wish there were more he could offer these people. It was downright strange, the effect Mat-rim Cauthon had on a person. Talmanes looked at common folk in a very different light now. Perhaps it was because he still didn’t rightly know whether to think of Mat as a lord or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side of the road, he surveyed the burning city, waiting for his men to catch up. He could have mounted all of them—though they weren’t trained cavalry, every man in the Band had a horse for long-distance travel. Tonight, he didn’t dare. With Trollocs and Myrddraal lurking in the streets, Talmanes needed his men in immediate fighting shape. Crossbowmen marched with loaded weapons at the flanks of deep columns of pike-men. He would not leave his soldiers open to a Trolloc charge, no matter how urgent their mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if they lost those dragons . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight illumine us, Talmanes thought. The city seemed to be boiling, with all that smoke churning above. Yet some parts of the Inner City—rising high on the hill and visible over the walls—were not yet aflame. The Palace wasn’t on fire yet. Could the soldiers there be holding?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo word had come from the Queen, and from what Talmanes could see, no help had arrived for the city. The Queen must still be unaware, and that was bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery, very bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, Talmanes spotted Sandip with some of the Band’s scouts. The slender man was trying to extricate himself from a group of refugees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, good master\", one young woman was crying. \"My child, my daughter, in the heights of the northern march...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must reach my shop!\" a stout man bellowed. \"My glasswares—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My good people\", Talmanes said, forcing his horse among them, \"I should think that if you want us to help, you might wish to back away and allow us to reach the bloody city\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe refugees reluctantly pulled back, and Sandip nodded to Talmanes in thanks. Tan-skinned and dark-haired, Sandip was one of the Band’s commanders and an accomplished hedge-doctor. The affable man wore a grim expression today, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sandip\", Talmanes said, pointing, \"there\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the near distance, a large group of fighting men cluste \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-3.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
