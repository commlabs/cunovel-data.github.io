Some emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough most NSA departments were fully staffed seven days a week, Crypto was generally quiet on Saturdays. Cryptographic mathematicians were by nature high-strung workaholics, and there existed an unwritten rule that they take Saturdays off except in emergencies. Code-breakers were too valuable a commodity at the NSA to risk losing them to burnout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Susan traversed the floor, TRANSLTR loomed to her right. The sound of the generators eight stories below sounded oddly ominous today. Susan never liked being in Crypto during off hours. It was like being trapped alone in a cage with some grand, futuristic beast. She quickly made her way toward the commander\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore\u0027s glass-walled workstation, nicknamed \"the fishbowl\" for its appearance when the drapes were open, stood high atop a set of catwalk stairs on the back wall of Crypto. As Susan climbed the grated steps, she gazed upward at Strathmore\u0027s thick, oak door. It bore the NSA seal-a bald eagle fiercely clutching an ancient skeleton key. Behind that door sat one of the greatest men she\u0027d ever met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Strathmore, the fifty-six-year-old deputy director of operations, was like a father to Susan. He was the one who\u0027d hired her, and he was the one who\u0027d made the NSA her home. When Susan joined the NSA over a decade ago, Strathmore was heading the Crypto Development Division-a training ground for new cryptographers-new male cryptographers. Although Strathmore never tolerated the hazing of anyone, he was especially protective of his sole female staff member. When accused of favoritism, he simply replied with the truth: Susan Fletcher was one of the brightest young recruits he\u0027d ever seen, and he had no intention of losing her to sexual harassment. One of the cryptographers foolishly decided to test Strathmore\u0027s resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning during her first year, Susan dropped by the new cryptographers\u0027 lounge to get some paperwork. As she left, she noticed a picture of herself on the bulletin board. She almost fainted in embarrassment. There she was, reclining on a bed and wearing only panties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turned out, one of the cryptographers had digitally scanned a photo from a pornographic magazine and edited Susan\u0027s head onto someone else\u0027s body. The effect had been quite convincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately for the cryptographer responsible, Commander Strathmore did not find the stunt even remotely amusing. Two hours later, a landmark memo went out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEMPLOYEE CARL AUSTIN TERMINATED FOR INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that day on, nobody messed with her; Susan Fletcher was Commander Strathmore\u0027s golden girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Strathmore\u0027s young cryptographers were not the only ones who learned to respect him; early in his career Strathmore made his presence known to his superiors by proposing a number of unorthodox and highly successful intelligence operations. As he moved up the ranks, Trevor Strathmore became known for his cogent, reductive analyses of highly complex situations. He seemed to have an uncanny ability to see past the moral perplexities surrounding the NSA\u0027s difficult decisions and to act without remorse in the interest of the common good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no doubt in anyone\u0027s mind that Strathmore loved his country. He was known to his colleagues as a patriot and a visionary... a decent man in a world of lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the years since Susan\u0027s arrival at the NSA, Strathmore had skyrocketed from head of Crypto Development to second-in-command of the entire NSA. Now only one man outranked Commander Strathmore there-Director Leland Fontaine, the mythical overlord of the Puzzle Palace-never seen, occasionally heard, and eternally feared. He and Strathmore seldom saw eye to eye, and when they met, it was like the clash of the titans. Fontaine was a giant among giants, but Strathmore didn\u0027t seem to care. He argued his ideas to the director with all the restraint of an impassioned boxer. Not even the President of the United States dared challenge Fontaine the way Strathmore did. One needed political immunity to do that-or, in Strathmore\u0027s case, political indifference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan arrived at the top of the stairs. Before she could knock, Strathmore\u0027s electronic door lock buzzed. The door swung open, and the commander waved her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for coming, Susan. I owe you one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all.\" She smiled as she sat opposite his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore was a rangy, thick-fleshed man whose muted features somehow disguised his hard-nosed efficiency and demand for perfection. His gray eyes usually suggested a confidence and discretion born from experience, but today they looked wild and unsettled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look beat,\" Susan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been better.\" Strathmore sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll say, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore looked as bad as Susan had ever seen him. His thinning gray hair was disheveled, and even in the room\u0027s crisp air-conditioning, his forehead was beaded with sweat. He looked like he\u0027d slept in his suit. He was sitting behind a modern desk with two recessed keypads and a computer monitor at one end. It was strewn with computer printouts and looked like some sort of alien cockpit propped there in the center of his curtained chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tough week?\" she inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore shrugged. \"The usual. The EFF\u0027s all over me about civilian privacy rights again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan chuckled. The EFF, or Electronics Frontier Foundation, was a worldwide coalition of computer users who had founded a powerful civil liberties coalition aimed at supporting free speech on-line and educating others to the realities and dangers of living in an electronic world. They were constantly lobbying against what they called \"the Orwellian eavesdropping capabilities of government agencies\"-particularly the NSA. The EFF was a perpetual thorn in Strathmore\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like business as usual,\" she said. \"So what\u0027s this big emergency you got me out of the tub for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore sat a moment, absently fingering the computer trackball embedded in his desktop. After a long silence, he caught Susan\u0027s gaze and held it. \"What\u0027s the longest you\u0027ve ever seen TRANSLTR take to break a code?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question caught Susan entirely off guard. It seemed meaningless. This is what he called me in for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" She hesitated. \"We hit a COMINT intercept a few months ago that took about an hour, but it had a ridiculously long key-ten thousand bits or something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore grunted. \"An hour, huh? What about some of the boundary probes we\u0027ve run?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan shrugged. \"Well, if you include diagnostics, it\u0027s obviously longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much longer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan couldn\u0027t imagine what Strathmore was getting at. \"Well, sir, I tried an algorithm last March with a segmented million-bit key. Illegal looping functions, cellular automata, the works. TRANSLTR still broke it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore arched his eyebrows. \"Three hours? That long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan frowned, mildly offended. Her job for the last three years had been to fine-tune the most secret computer in the world; most of the programming that made TRANSLTR so fast was hers. A million-bit key was hardly a realistic scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Strathmore said. \"So even in extreme conditions, the longest a code has ever survived inside TRANSLTR is about three hours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan nodded. \"Yeah. More or less.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore paused as if afraid to say something he might regret. Finally he looked up. \"TRANSLTR\u0027s hit something...\" He stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan waited. \"More than three hours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked unconcerned. \"A new diagnostic? Something from the Sys-Sec Department?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore shook his head. \"It\u0027s an outside file.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan waited for the punch line, but it never came. \"An outside file? You\u0027re joking, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish. I queued it last night around eleven thirty. It hasn\u0027t broken yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan\u0027s jaw dropped. She looked at her watch and then back at Strathmore. \"It\u0027s still going? Over fifteen hours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore leaned forward and rotated his monitor toward Susan. The screen was black except for a small, yellow text box blinking in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME ELAPSED: 15:09:33\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAWAITING KEY: ________\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan stared in amazement. It appeared TRANSLTR had been working on one code for over fifteen hours. She knew the computer\u0027s processors auditioned thirty million keys per second-one hundred billion per hour. If TRANSLTR was still counting, that meant the key had to be enormous-over ten billion digits long. It was absolute insanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s impossible!\" she declared. \"Have you checked for error flags? Maybe TRANSLTR hit a glitch and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The run\u0027s clean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the pass-key must be huge!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore shook his head. \"Standard commercial algorithm. I\u0027m guessing a sixty-four-bit key.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMystified, Susan looked out the window at TRANSLTR below. She knew from experience that it could locate a sixty-four-bit key in under ten minutes. \"There\u0027s got to be some explanation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore nodded. \"There is. You\u0027re not going to like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan looked uneasy. \"Is TRANSLTR malfunctioning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"TRANSLTR\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have we got a virus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore shook his head. \"No virus. Just hear me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan was flabbergasted. TRANSLTR had never hit a code it couldn\u0027t break in under an hour. Usually the cleartext was delivered to Strathmore\u0027s printout module within minutes. She glanced at the high-speed printer behind his desk. It was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan,\" Strathmore said quietly. \"This is going to be hard to accept at first, but just listen a minute.\" He chewed his lip. \"This code that TRANSLTR\u0027s working on-it\u0027s unique. It\u0027s like nothing we\u0027ve ever seen before.\" Strathmore paused, as if the words were hard for him to say. \"This code is unbreakable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan stared at him and almost laughed. Unbreakable? What was THAT supposed to mean? There was no such thing as an unbreakable code-some took longer than others, but every code was breakable. It was mathematically guaranteed that sooner or later TRANSLTR would guess the right key. \"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The code\u0027s unbreakable,\" he repeated flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbreakable? Susan couldn\u0027t believe the word had been uttered by a man with twenty-seven years of code analysis experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unbreakable, sir?\" she said uneasily. \"What about the Bergofsky Principle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan had learned about the Bergofsky Principle early in her career. It was a cornerstone of brute-force technology. It was also Strathmore\u0027s inspiration for building TRANSLTR. The principle clearly stated that if a computer tried enough keys, it was mathematically guaranteed to find the right one. A code\u0027s security was not that its pass-key was unfindable but rather that most people didn\u0027t have the time or equipment to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore shook his head. \"This code\u0027s different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different?\" Susan eyed him askance. An unbreakable code is a mathematical impossibility! He knows that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore ran a hand across his sweaty scalp. \"This code is the product of a brand-new encryption algorithm-one we\u0027ve never seen before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Susan was even more doubtful. Encryption algorithms were just mathematical formulas, recipes for scrambling text into code. Mathematicians and programmers created new algorithms every day. There were hundreds of them on the market-PGP, Diffie-Hellman, ZIP, IDEA, El Gamal. TRANSLTR broke all of their codes every day, no problem. To TRANSLTR all codes looked identical, regardless of which algorithm wrote them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" she argued. \"We\u0027re not talking about reverse-engineering some complex function, we\u0027re talking brute force. PGP, Lucifer, DSA-it doesn\u0027t matter. The algorithm generates a key it thinks is secure, and TRANSLTR keeps guessing until it finds it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore\u0027s reply had the controlled patience of a good teacher. \"Yes, Susan, TRANSLTR will always find the key-even if it\u0027s huge.\" He paused a long moment. \"Unless...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan wanted to speak, but it was clear Strathmore was about to drop his bomb. Unless what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless the computer doesn\u0027t know when it\u0027s broken the code.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan almost fell out of her chair. \"What!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless the computer guesses the correct key but just keeps guessing because it doesn\u0027t realize it found the right key.\" Strathmore looked bleak. \"I think this algorithm has got a rotating cleartext.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan gaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe notion of a rotating cleartext function was first put forth in an obscure, 1987 paper by a Hungarian mathematician, Josef Harne. Because brute-force computers broke codes by examining cleartext for identifiable word patterns, Harne proposed an encryption algorithm that, in addition to encrypting, shifted decrypted cleartext over a time variant. In theory, the perpetual mutation would ensure that the attacking computer would never locate recognizable word patterns and thus never know when it had found the proper key. The concept was somewhat like the idea of colonizing Mars-fathomable on an intellectual level, but, at present, well beyond human ability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you get this thing?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander\u0027s response was slow. \"A public sector programmer wrote it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Susan collapsed back in her chair. \"We\u0027ve got the best programmers in the world downstairs! All of us working together have never even come close to writing a rotating cleartext function. Are you trying to tell me some punk with a PC figured out how to do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore lowered his voice in an apparent effort to calm her. \"I wouldn\u0027t call this guy a punk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan wasn\u0027t listening. She was convinced there had to be some other explanation: A glitch. A virus. Anything was more likely than an unbreakable code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore eyed her sternly. \"One of the most brilliant cryptographic minds of all time wrote this algorithm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan was more doubtful than ever; the most brilliant cryptographic minds of all time were in her department, and she certainly would have heard about an algorithm like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you can guess.\" Strathmore said. \"He\u0027s not too fond of the NSA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that narrows it down!\" she snapped sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He worked on the TRANSLTR project. He broke the rules. Almost caused an intelligence nightmare. I deported him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan\u0027s face was blank only an instant before going white. \"Oh my God...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore nodded. \"He\u0027s been bragging all year about his work on a brute-force-resistant algorithm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B-but...\" Susan stammered. \"I thought he was bluffing. He actually did it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did. The ultimate unbreakable code-writer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan was silent a long moment. \"But... that means...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore looked her dead in the eye. \"Yes. Ensei Tankado just made TRANSLTR obsolete.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-6.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM"}
