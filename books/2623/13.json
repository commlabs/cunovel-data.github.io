Only vampires need an invitation to enter someone\u0027s home, that\u0027s the price they pay for their strength and their gastronomic approach to humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to lock a door in the Twilight, you had at least to know how to enter it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Fear,\u0027 said Olga. \u0027Yesterday the boy was in a state of terror. And he\u0027d just been in the Twilight world. He locked the door behind him, and without knowing it, he locked it in both worlds at the same time. Come deeper. Follow me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my shoulder – there was no one there. Summoning the Twilight while you\u0027re in the Twilight is no simple trick. I had to raise my shadow from the floor several times before it acquired volume and hung there, quivering in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come on, come on, you\u0027re doing fine,\u0027 whispered Olga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI entered the shadow, and the Twilight grew thicker. Space was filled with a dense fog. Colours disappeared completely. The only sound left was the beating of my heart, slow and heavy, rumbling like a drum being beaten at the bottom of a ravine. And there was a whistling wind – that was the air seeping into my lungs, slowly stretching out the bronchi. The owl appeared on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I won\u0027t be able to stand this for long,\u0027 I whispered, opening the door. At this level, of course, it wasn\u0027t locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark grey cat flitted past my feet. For cats there is no ordinary world or Twilight – they live in all the worlds at once. It\u0027s a good thing they don\u0027t have any real intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Kss-kss-kss,\u0027 I whispered. \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid, puss . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly to test my own powers, I locked the door behind me. There, kid, now you\u0027re a little bit better protected. But will it do any good when you hear the Call?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Move up,\u0027 said Olga. \u0027You\u0027re losing strength very fast. This level of the Twilight is a strain even for an experienced magician. I think I\u0027ll move up a level too.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a relief to step out of it. No, I\u0027m not an operational agent who can stroll around all three levels of the Twilight just as he likes. But I don\u0027t normally need to do that kind of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world turned a little brighter. I glanced around. It was a cosy apartment, not too polluted by the products of the Twilight world. A few streaks of blue moss beside the door . . . nothing to worry about, they\u0027d die, now that the main colony had been exterminated. I heard sounds too, from the direction of the kitchen. I glanced in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was standing by the table, eating garlic and washing it down with hot tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Light and Dark,\u0027 I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked even younger and more helpless than the day before. Thin and awkward, but you couldn\u0027t call him weak, he obviously played sport. He was wearing faded jeans and a blue sweatshirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The poor soul,\u0027 I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Very touching,\u0027 Olga agreed. \u0027It was a clever move of the vampires to spread that rumour about the magical properties of garlic. They say it was Bram Stoker himself who thought it up . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy spat into his hand and started rubbing garlic on to his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Garlic\u0027s good for you,\u0027 I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh yes. It protects you. Against flu viruses,\u0027 Olga added. \u0027How easily the truth is lost, and how persistent lies are . . . But the boy really is strong. The Night Watch could do with another agent.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But is he ours?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He\u0027s not anyone\u0027s yet. His destiny\u0027s still not been determined, you can see for yourself.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But which way does he lean?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s no way to tell, not yet. He\u0027s too frightened. Right now he\u0027d do absolutely anything to escape from the vampires. He\u0027s equally ready to turn to the Dark or the Light.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I can\u0027t blame him for that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, of course. Come on.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe owl fluttered into the air and flew along the corridor. I walked after her. We were moving three times faster than humans now: one of the fundamental features of the Twilight is the way it affects the passage of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ll wait here,\u0027 Olga announced, when we were in the lounge. \u0027It\u0027s warm, light and comfortable.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in a soft armchair beside a low table and glanced at the newspaper lying there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s nothing more amusing than reading the press through the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Profits on loans down\u0027, said the headline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the real world the phrase was different: \u0027Tension mounts in the Caucasus\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could pick up the newspaper now and read the truth. The real truth. What the journalist was thinking when he wrote on the topic he\u0027d been assigned. Those crumbs of information that he\u0027d received from unofficial sources. The truth about life and the truth about death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly what for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d stopped giving a damn about the human world a long time ago. It\u0027s our basis. Our cradle. But we are Others. We walk through closed doors and we maintain the balance of Good and Evil. There are pitifully few of us, and we can\u0027t reproduce – it doesn\u0027t follow that a magician\u0027s daughter automatically becomes an enchantress, and a werewolf\u0027s son won\u0027t necessarily be able to change his form on moonlit nights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re not obliged to like the ordinary, everyday world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe only guard it because we\u0027re its parasites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate parasites!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are you thinking about now?\u0027 asked Olga. The boy appeared in the lounge. He raced across into the bedroom – very quickly, bearing in mind that he was in the everyday world. He started rummaging in the wardrobe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nothing much. Just feeling sad.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It happens. During the first few years it happens to everyone.\u0027 Olga\u0027s voice sounded completely human now. \u0027Then you get used to it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s what I\u0027m feeling sad about.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You should be glad we\u0027re still alive. At the beginning of the twentieth century the population of Others fell to a critical threshold. Did you know there were debates about uniting the Dark Ones and the Light Ones? That programmes of eugenics were developed?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, I know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Science came close to killing us off. They didn\u0027t believe in us, they wouldn\u0027t believe. That is, while they still believed science could change the world for the better.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy came back into the lounge. He sat down on the sofa and started adjusting the silver chain round his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What is better?\u0027 I asked. \u0027We were people once, but we\u0027ve learned to enter the Twilight, we\u0027ve learned to change the nature of things and other people. And what\u0027s changed, Olga?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027At least vampires don\u0027t hunt without a licence.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tell that to the person whose blood they drink.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cat appeared in the doorway and fixed his gaze on us. He howled, glaring angrily at the owl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s you he doesn\u0027t like, Olga,\u0027 I said. \u0027Move deeper into the Twilight.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Too late,\u0027 Olga replied. \u0027Sorry, I let my guard down.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy sprang up off the sofa. Far faster than is possible in the human world. Clumsily, without even knowing what was happening to him, he entered his shadow and immediately fell on the floor, looking up at me. Through the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m leaving . . .\u0027 the owl whispered as she disappeared. Her claws dug painfully into my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No!\u0027 shouted the boy. \u0027I know! I know you\u0027re here!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to get up, spreading my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I can see you! Don\u0027t touch me!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in the Twilight. He\u0027d done it, just like that. Without any help from anyone, without any courses or stimulants, without any magician to tutor him, the boy had crossed the boundary between the ordinary and the Twilight worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way you first enter the Twilight, what you see and what you feel there goes a long way to determine who you\u0027ll become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Dark One or a Light One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027 We have no right to let him go over to the Dark Side, the balance of power in Moscow would completely collapse.\u0027 The boss\u0027s words came back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, kid, you\u0027re right on the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was more terrifying than any inexperienced vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoris Ignatievich was entitled to have the boy taken out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t be afraid,\u0027 I said, not moving from the spot. \u0027I\u0027m your friend and I won\u0027t do you any harm.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy crawled as far as the corner and froze there, never once taking his eyes off me. He clearly didn\u0027t understand that he\u0027d shifted into the Twilight. It looked to him as if the room had suddenly turned dark, a silence had fallen and I\u0027d appeared out of nowhere . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t be afraid,\u0027 I repeated. \u0027My name\u0027s Anton. What\u0027s your name?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t say anything. He kept gulping, over and over again. Then he pressed his hand against his neck, felt for the chain and seemed to calm down a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m not a vampire,\u0027 I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who are you?\u0027 the boy yelled. It was a good thing that piercing shriek couldn\u0027t be heard in the everyday world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anton. A Night Watch agent.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes opened wide, as if he were in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s my job to protect people against vampires and all sorts of vermin.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re lying . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. Good. He was trying to assess his actions so far and explain his reasons. That meant the fear hadn\u0027t completely paralysed his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s your name?\u0027 I asked again. I could have influenced the boy and removed his fear. But that would have been an intervention, and a forbidden one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Egor.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A good name. My name\u0027s Anton. Do you understand? I\u0027m Anton Sergeevich Gorodetsky. A Night Watch agent. Yesterday I killed a vampire who was attacking you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just one?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcellent. Now we had the makings of a conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. The girl got away. We\u0027re searching for her now. Don\u0027t be afraid, I\u0027m here to guard you ... to destroy the vampire.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why is everything so grey?\u0027 Egor suddenly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood boy. That\u0027s really good going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll explain. Only first let\u0027s agree that I\u0027m not your enemy. All right?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ll see.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held on to his absurd little chain, as if it could save him from anything. Oh, kid, if only everything in this world was that easy. Silver won\u0027t save you, or poplar wood, or crucifixes. It\u0027s life against death, love against hate . . . and power against power, because power has no moral categories. That\u0027s how simple it is. In the last couple of years I\u0027ve come to realise that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Egor,\u0027 I said, walking slowly across to him. \u0027Listen, I want to tell you something.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Stop!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouted the command as sharply as if he were holding a weapon in his hands. I sighed and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All right. Now listen. Apart from the ordinary world that the human eye can see, there is also a shadow world, the Twilight world.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought. Despite his fear – and he was terribly afraid, I could feel the waves of his suffocating horror washing over me – the boy was trying to understand. There are some people who are paralysed by fear. And there are some whom it only makes stronger. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-13.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
