They had two middle Empyreans in their ranks and they were also skilled in tracking techniques. Xiao Moxian with her vast number of disciples as well as her fleet of spirit ships was ultimately unable to rid herself of this tracking. So, after bringing the fleet of the saints to a desolate part of space that was quintillions of miles away and leaving the Hidden Dragon Galaxy, her forces suddenly turned around and engaged the saints in a life or death battle!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis battle had been cruel and tragic. The two saint race Empyreans were completely killed off and their fleets were almost completely annihilated, but her Demon Fairy Celestial Palace also paid a deep price.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThose brave warriors of Demon Fairy Celestial Palace who died in that battle were Xiao Moxian’s most loyal followers who had served her before New Ming Planet was even established…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, they died in the battlefield of the starry skies, their ashes forever interred in space…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRegarding this, Xiao Moxian grieved in her sorrow.

This was because she knew that her followers all hoped to see a stronger her. So, she would carry their dying wishes upon her shoulders and continue leading the battle to protect New Ming Planet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, good fortune never came in pairs and misfortune never came alone.

Finally, she cleaned out the battlefield. Xiao Moxian thought that her own identity hadn’t been leaked, but the arrival of the Good Fortune Saint Son meant that her whereabouts had likely been made known to him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSome matters were impossible to explain. Xiao Moxian didn’t know how the Good Fortune Saint Son had discovered her.
