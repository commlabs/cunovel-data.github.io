Her hands scraped, her skull hit the asphalt with a loud crack, the skin ripping off her cheek. Burning pain screamed through her face and everything on the darkened street seemed to turn upside down. Overhead the light was still shining, but there was darkness beyond, the thrum of traffic on the freeway somewhere in the far distance. She heard her own breathing and her heart pumping as she tried to fight the blackness overcoming her and climb to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer legs wouldn’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep inside she was cold, so very cold, yet she felt a warmth oozing from her. In a distant part of her brain she realized it was blood and wondered vaguely if anyone would come to help her, if she would survive. Then she remembered Lucinda Rinaldi lying on this same street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelp me, she thought desperately, and tried to yell, to scream over the sound of footsteps rapidly approaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assassin!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, oh, no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith all her strength, she managed to get her feet beneath her and push, scooting backward on the asphalt, hoping to find some kind of cover or that, please God, someone would come to her rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBam!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoulder rammed into a parking meter, jarring her. But she didn’t give up. Wrapping her fingers around the cold metal pole she attempted to pull herself to her feet, over the curb and out of the gutter where water was gurgling in a rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wobbly, her hands slick and unable to do what her brain commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God,” she gasped, tasting salty blood on her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the would-be killer was there. Standing in front of her. The woman who had leaped from the shadows to attack her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie Kramer with her weird face. No. Now that her stalker was close she realized the disfigured face with the black eyeholes wasn’t Allie Kramer at all, but the twisted face of Jenna Hughes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi’s eyes rolled back in her head and as she passed out, she felt her head being lifted, something slick and cool being placed over her face and then there was nothing but blessed, silent darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eACT IV\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pocketed the gun and ran, afraid that someone had seen her. Adrenaline fueled her, spurred her on. She spied a woman looking out the window and turned quickly down an alley. Without the mask she could be recognized, identified. No way could she let that happen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot here. Not now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was thick, rain pummeling down from the starless sky. Her legs ached and her lungs felt as if they were on fire, but she needed distance, more distance, so she pressed on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep moving!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust one more block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing was damn near impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rounded a corner and finally, gratefully slowed. Taking in huge gulps of air, she felt sweat slide down her back and prickle in her hair, but she was far enough away from the killing ground to avoid suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hoped. Prayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, a little more distance wouldn’t hurt. As fast as her painful legs allowed, she walked, down two blocks, around another corner, getting ever closer to downtown Portland, where the city sprawled along the shores of the Willamette. There were more people out, the segment of the population who preferred night to day. She kept her head turned away and in the ghostly glow of streetlights in the rain, no one seemed to recognize her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was heading to her car when she spied the Vintner’s House, a cozy little bar Allie Kramer had been known to haunt. Discreet lighting. Private booths. Even a gas fireplace. No televisions, just soft, eclectic music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slow smile twisted over her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes, she remembered the place, had spent many hours within its walls and knew its idiosyncrasies. First though, she checked her reflection in a storefront window and though she was pale, she didn’t notice any dark spots staining her sweater, no blood spatter visible. Finger-combing her hair, she tossed it a bit, then slipped into her cool persona, the one most people who knew her would recognize. The other side of her personality, the hysterical, freaked-out portion, she managed to, once again, tuck deep inside. She only let it free when it suited her purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatisfied, she walked into the bar and reflected upon what she’d done, how, once again, she’d outwitted them all. She could almost taste the reaction and ummm, the taste was sweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe surveyed the small dining area. All good. Taking a seat at the bar, she inwardly smiled as she ordered a glass of Allie’s favorite wine. From the corner of her eye, she thought the bartender did a subtle double take. That was fine. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-124.html","bookId":2675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM"}
