Couldn\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood near the window shaking my head, unreasonably spooked by a flower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, maybe not unreasonably. I hadn\u0027t brought it here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze flicked around the room. There wasn\u0027t anywhere to hide, except -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the floor, and the breath I\u0027d been holding streamed out in relief. The wooden bed frame ended at the carpet. There was no \"under the bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly I crept toward the bathroom. Why I didn\u0027t just call security I\u0027m still not sure. Perhaps I couldn\u0027t bring myself to say, \"I found a flower. Save me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d left on the bathroom light as I always did when sleeping in a strange place. I hated walking into walls half-asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reflection in the vanity mirror revealed there was no one inside. Just as there was nothing in the closet. Which meant -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned toward the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe curtains, meant to block the sun so Mardi Gras partiers could sleep away the day, also blocked everything else. Unable to bear not knowing, I strode across the room and whipped them back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen stared past the empty balcony, studying the flickering neon across the street My room was on the fifth floor. How could anyone scale the hotel without being seen from below?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut would the drunks even notice? If they had, would they care or merely cheer? However, if they\u0027d cheered, I\u0027d have heard them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had been here. But who? How? Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll questions for a time when the sun was shining. Too bad they kept me up for the rest of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn found me dressed and swilling coffee from the complimentary urn in the lobby. If I could have positioned my mouth directly beneath the spigot without undue notice, I would have. I was so tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI showed the concierge the address on my handy dandy sheet of paper. Contrary to the opinion of the sexy-voiced Cajun with an attitude, the concierge confirmed it as the location of a trustworthy guide service - CW Swamp Tours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI retraced my route to the dock where a man waited on an airboat. \"Deanna Malone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess he was waiting for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diana,\" I corrected, and he grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished that he hadn\u0027t His teeth were nothing to write home about. They\u0027d make a short letter, since there were so few left. A shame. He didn\u0027t appear a day over twenty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Tallient sent me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe accent was Deep South - not a hint of France, and I missed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was here yesterday,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face, which resembled both Howdy Doody and Richie Cunningham, despite the bright white hair that shone beneath the morning sun like a reflector, crumpled with the effort of thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was I supposed to come yeste\u0027day? I get confused.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell. I hoped he didn\u0027t get confused in the middle of the swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met someone - \" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one but me comes to this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tall, dark.\" I left out \"handsome,\" fearing I\u0027d sound too much like Snow White. \"Long hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy guide shrugged. \"Don\u0027t bring no one to mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Frank - Mr. Tallient - tell you what I need ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if he was Adam Ruelle, except Ruelle was mysteriously missing. Besides, I doubted a man who had been raised in a mansion, however broken down, would let his teeth rot out of his head. Then again, I could be wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie Wagner. Tallient said you wanted to look for the wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s gaze slid from mine. \"Can\u0027t say as I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found his choice of words interesting. He couldn\u0027t say. Didn\u0027t mean he hadn\u0027t seen it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna meet me here at dusk?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dusk?\" The last time I\u0027d come at dusk I\u0027d nearly been eaten by an alligator, and that had been the best part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered the voice, the scent of smoke, his breath in my hair, and his arm cradling my breasts. A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elong, long time had passed since a man\u0027s anything had been near them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe the alligator hadn\u0027t been the best part, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolves don\u0027t come out in the light,\" Charlie explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that \"All right,\" I said. \"Dusk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made no move to leave. After several silent moments, I asked the only question I still had: \"Do you know Adam Ruelle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie had been peering into my face, and now he glanced away. \"Never met him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know where he lives?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the Ruelle place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie pointed to the far side of the water and the waving grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had nothing else to do Tallient had already hired Charlie. And I was curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take me there,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s boat was a smooth, fast ride. I probably should have been wary. Airboats flipped in the swamp all the time. But the whip of the wind in my hair, the sun on my face, was too enjoyable to ruin with what-ifs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the daylight, the swamp was beautiful. A riot of colors, hardly any alligators, not a nutria rat to be had. I doubted the area would be as appealing tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red, stalklike flower grew everywhere. I jabbed my finger at a clump as we scooted past, but since we both wore earphones to drown out the blare of the boat, Charlie wasn\u0027t going to be answering my questions anytime soon. He merely flashed me his un-teeth and kept driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ruelle Mansion became visible as we slid wide around a small island. The place would fit perfectly on a Halloween card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boards had gone gray; the windows were broken; the porch listed to one side. Despite its condition and obvious age, the word stately came to mind. In days past, music, laughter, life, had filled the rooms. If I concentrated very hard, I could imagine the Ruelle Mansion coming alive again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost plantations in this part of Louisiana were located on the Great River Road, which ran from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. Finding one here was as mysterious as it was fascinating. I felt as if I\u0027d stepped through a time warp and into another century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie cut the engine, and we bumped against the decaying dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long since someone lived here?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Used to be a lot of transients in and out. But no one lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People got spooked. Ha\u0027nts and such. Heard tell a few folks disappeared and no one ever saw \u0027em again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the building. If any place looked haunted, the Ruelle Mansion did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027d think the walls would have rotted in the damp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Made of cypress wood from the swamp. Never rots. House\u0027ll stand until the end of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I should have been reassured that the structure was sound, instead I was a bit creeped out that the house would be standing here when the rest of the world had passed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with me,\" I ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t afraid of ghosts, but I had a hard time believing every homeless person in the area had been scared off by the rumors. I didn\u0027t relish running into a transient as I wandered through the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie shrugged, tied up the boat, and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re those flowers?\" I indicated a patch that seemed to mark the end of the yard and the beginning of the swamp. \"The tall red ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fire iris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty.\" I took a step in their direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch \u0027em!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had visions of hives, rashes, swamp warts. Hell. The thing had been on my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of bad luck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hoodoo and such.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoodoo was an old-time, backwoods version of -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Voodoo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis only answer was another shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the second time voodoo had entered the conversation since I\u0027d gotten here. Of course I was in New Orleans, the voodoo capital of America. I shouldn\u0027t be surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t. However, I decided it might behoove me to make a visit to Priestess Cassandra after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie climbed the steps, his boots thunking against the worn wood like distant thunder. The sun threatened to cook everything well done, yet he wore jeans, a long-sleeved shirt, and work boots. I suspected the latter had something to do with snakes. Glancing at my sneakers, I made a mental note to buy heavier shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door, and I followed him in. Someone had stayed here once. Several hundred someones, by the size of the garbage pile. The smell didn\u0027t help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld food, new dirt, and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have sworn I smelled blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. The place was dim, dusty, dirty, but there wasn\u0027t any blood. Why would there be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there\u0027d ever been any furniture, it was gone now, either stolen or maybe used as kindling - although I couldn\u0027t imagine the weather ever being cold enough to warrant a bonfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere weren\u0027t any holes in the roof or the floor, only the windows. With some elbow grease and a few pounds of soap and water, the place could be habitable again. Hey, I\u0027d seen worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA board creaked overhead, as if someone had accidentally stepped on a crack, then frozen at the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" Charlie called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked my head toward the stairs and together we climbed them, splitting up on the second floor. Charlie took the right side; I took the left. I didn\u0027t find anything but dirt until I reached the last room near the back of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t anyone there - at least no one alive. Ha-ha. But there was a picture on the wall. A very old, very interesting picture. I was still looking at it five minutes later, trying not to hyperventilate, when Charlie found me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is that?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ruelle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d never met him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie cut me a quick glance. \"Not Adam. That there\u0027s his granddaddy, several generations back.\" He tapped the corner of the photo where a tiny notation read: 1857. I\u0027d been too flipped out to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name\u0027s Henri.\" Charlie spoke the name with a French twist, dropping the h, putting the accent on the second syllable. \"He\u0027s been dead nearly a hundred and fifty years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s words reached me from a long way off. I couldn\u0027t stop staring at the photo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face was that of the man in my dream. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-4.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
