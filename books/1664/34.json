There may be some hot water left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne side of his lips curved up. “Know what date it is?” I shook my head, and he gestured at the desk. “There’s one of the day calendars on it, the kind where you tear off the pages each day. If it’s up to date, it’s August eighteenth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My God,” I whispered, deeply unsettled. “I’ve been gone…we’ve been gone for practically four months.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew it had been awhile, but time was so strange there. I just didn’t think it was that long. Four months…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Feels like forever ago, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it does.” I inched closer to the bed. “Four months. Mom probably thinks I’m dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to the window, his shoulders tensed. Several moments passed before he spoke. “I got you some clean clothes. They’re in the bag. I think you’ll appreciate the shirt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s no biggie, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit down on my lip. “Daemon…?” He turned to me, his eyes unnaturally bright. Two beautiful green eyes. “Thank you for everything. I wouldn’t be out of there if it—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was suddenly in front of me, clasping my cheeks. I sucked in a startled breath as he lowered his forehead to mine. “You do not need to thank me for any of this. You would’ve never been in this situation if it weren’t for me. And you don’t need to thank me for something I wanted and needed to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This wasn’t your fault,” I told him, meaning it. “You know that, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed a kiss to my forehead. “I’m going to clean up. There’s food in the bag, too, if you’re hungry. If not, you should try to get some rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daemon—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, Kitten. I know.” He dropped his hands and gave me that cocky smile of his. “If anyone shows up while I’m in the shower, even Archer, you don’t let him in, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I doubt a door would stop him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what the gun is for. I don’t think he’s going to screw us, but I’d rather be safe than sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a good point, but as I watched him grab a pair of sweats and then disappear into the fogged-over bathroom, I loathed the idea of picking up that gun again. I would if I had to. I just hoped I’d never have to again, which was silly because, more than likely, the violence of my recent everyday life was nowhere near over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicking up the bag, I brought it over to the bed. I sat down and started rummaging through it as the water kicked on in the bathroom. I looked up, my gaze falling to the closed door. A warm flush crept over my cheeks. Daemon was in the shower. Completely naked. I was in a towel. We were alone, for the first time in four months, in a shady motel room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach dipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flush heated up, and I groaned in exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was I doing even thinking about that kind of stuff right now? Over the course of the last couple of months, I’d heard Daemon in the shower a million times over. This wasn’t a romantic getaway at the Ritz, unless running for your lives counted as foreplay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking my head, I refocused on the bag. Inside I found a wide selection of sugary goodness, which caused me to blink back tears because I knew he’d bought that for me. God, he was considerate when I didn’t even know he was trying, when it mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out the bottles of soda and got up, placing them with the chips and sugar on the desk. The tote bag brought a smile to my face. The shirt made the smile stretch in a way that felt unfamiliar, like it would crack my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the alien doll. “DB…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing back to the bed, I found flip-flops in the bag. Perfect. I never wanted to see those bloody shoes again. I reached the bottom of the bag, and my fingers brushed over a square box. I pulled out the last item.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat swept my face, and my eyes popped out. “Oh…oh, wow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water shut off, and a second later Daemon came out with the sweats hanging low on his hips, and his skin was dewy, glistening. My eyes were fixated on his stomach and the drops of water running over the dips, disappearing under the band of the sweats. I was still only in a towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was holding a box of condoms in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face was red as a ladybug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne dark eyebrow went up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze fell to the box and then went back to him. “Confident, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d like to call it being prepared for any occasion.” He sauntered over to the bed in a way only Daemon could without looking like a complete douche. “Although, I am disappointed they don’t have little alien faces on them like everything else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choked on my next breath. “What kind of motel sells condoms?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My favorite kind of motel?” He took the box from my boneless fingers. “You’ve spent this entire time looking at this instead of eating something, haven’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA laugh burst from me—a real, normal laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s eyes widened, and the hue flared. The box fell from his fingers, landing with a soft thud against the carpet. “Do that again,” he said, his voice gruff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound sent a shiver down my spine. “Do what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laugh.” He bent over me, the tips of his fingers grazing my cheeks. “I want to hear you laugh again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to laugh again for him, but all the humor had dried up under the raw intensity of his stare. Emotion swelled inside me like a balloon tethered by a fine string. I opened my mouth, but I didn’t know what to say. Muscles tensed throughout my body. My belly felt like a nest of butterflies was about to take flight. I raised a hand, placing it on his cheek. The slight stubble tickled my palm and caused my heart to jump. I slid my hand over the curve of his jaw and then down the cords of his neck to his shoulder. He jerked under my touch, and his chest rose sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat.” He breathed my name; he took it into himself, said it like it was some kind of prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t look away, and for a moment I was frozen, then I stretched up, placing my mouth against his. The slight touch sent a shock through my system. I moved my lips, familiarizing myself with the feel of him. Strange, but it was like we were kissing for the first time. My pulse was pounding, and my thoughts were in a heady, dizzy swirl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped a hand through my hair, his fingers curling along the back of my skull. The kiss deepened until his taste was everywhere, and there was nothing but us—only us. The rest of the world fell away. None of our problems vanished, but they were put on hold as my mouth opened for him. We kissed like we were famished for each other, and we were. Those kisses intoxicated me, and his fingers moved over my jaw and down my throat, delicately tracing a path. But my hands were greedy and rushed as they slipped over his chest, and I followed the lines of his hard stomach. The way my touch affected him was marveling to me. He made a throaty sound, and I melted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased me back, positioning his body over mine and supporting his weight on one arm, but only our mouths touched in the sweetest torture. We’d been intimate before, twice, but right now it felt like the first time. Excited nervousness hummed through me while my blood heated up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon lifted his head. Between the narrowed slits of his eyes, his pupils were like polished diamonds following the movement of his hand. My insides tightened as his fingers moved dangerously close to the edge of the towel. Each slow pass along the fabric had my pulse pounding. My gaze traced over his broad cheekbones and then got hung up on the perfection of his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand stilled around the knot I had made in the towel, his eyes flicking up to mine. “We don’t have to,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really didn’t buy the condoms thinking that we’d do this tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped into a grin. “So…you weren’t overly confident?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m always overly confident.” He swooped down, kissing me softly. “But I don’t know if this is too much right now. I don’t want—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI silenced him by slipping my hands to the band of his pants, hooking my fingers under it. “You’re perfect. I want this—with you. It’s not too much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA breath shuddered through him. “God, I was hoping you’d say that. Does that make me a terrible person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little laugh came out. “No. It just makes you a dude.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? Is that it?” He captured my mouth again, then pulled back with a slight nip. “Just makes me a dude?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” I gasped. My back arched as he moved his hand down my front and then back up to the knot. “Okay. You’re more than just a dude.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled deep in his throat. “Thought so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath was warm against my swollen lips, scorching hot as it trailed down my neck. He pressed a kiss to where my pulse pounded in my throat. I closed my eyes, happily swept away in the rush of sensations. I needed this—we needed this. A moment of normalcy, of just him and me, together like we were supposed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me as his fingers worked the knot loose, distracting me as he parted the towel. Goose bumps followed the cool air rushing over my body. He murmured something in that lyrical language of his, a language I wished I could understand because his words sounded beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he lifted up, his gaze chased away the tiny bumps, searing me from the inside out. The edges of his body blurred into a faint whitish light. “You’re beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every part,” he said, as if he read my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he had, because when I tugged him closer by the band of his pants, he obliged, fitting his body to mine. Bare chest to bare chest. I tangled my hands in his hair as I wrapped a leg around his hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a sharp breath. “You drive me insane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Feeling’s mutual,” I rasped out, tilting my hips up against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muscles in his arms bulged as he made a sound deep in his throat. The set to his jaw was hard, the lines of his mouth tense as he slipped a hand between us. Those clever fingers went from soothing to breath-stealing in a second, and I felt the coiling deep—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bright yellow light suddenly flooded the room, shattering the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon was off me so quickly, he stirred the hair around my temples as he shot toward the window and peeled back a small section of the curtain. I scrambled up, smacking the mattress until I found the towel, covering myself as I darted off the bed, grabbing the pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerror climbed up my throat. Had they found us already? I twisted to where he stood, as I still clutched the towel around me. My hand shook so badly the pistol rattled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon let out a long breath. “It’s just headlights—some ass with his high beams on pulling out of the parking lot.” Letting the curtain fall back into place, he turned. “That’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand tightened around the gun. “Headlights?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze dropped to what I held. “Yeah, that’s all, Annie Oakley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gun felt glued to my hand. My heart was still pumping fast with residual terror, and that horror was slow to drain from my veins. It hit me then, in startling clarity, that this was what our lives had been reduced to. Flying into defense and panic mode every time headlights came through a window or someone knocked on our door or a stranger approached us. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/origin-lux-4/page-34.html","bookId":1664,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:47 PM"}
