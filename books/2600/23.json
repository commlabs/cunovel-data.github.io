What did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Vysehrad,\" Zabel said. \"That\u0027s where Roderick is buried. There\u0027s a cemetery there. I imagine that\u0027s where he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the Vysehrad?\" Allen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"South,\" Amy said. \"It\u0027s a fort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us the rest,\" Allen said. \"What else did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with me.\" Zabel headed for the hatch in the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen hesitated. \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is important,\" Zabel said. \"Hurry.\" He disappeared down the hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed Zabel down the spiral stairs and then down to the first floor. Zabel glanced over his shoulder to make sure they were still following. He led them through a cramped kitchen. Another door. More stairs. Down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the basement. Allen glanced around. A cupboard. A chair. Shelves with bottles and jars of who-knew-what. A small table with a dirty tablecloth. It was a small room, dimly lit. \"What are we doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" Zabel said. \"Stand over by that wall.\" He pointed to the only wall bare of shelves or other furnishings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy and Allen stood against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold out your hands,\" Zabel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy and Allen looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn impatient sigh from Zabel. \"Come on, come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy and Allen each held out their right hand. Zabel placed a smooth chunk of quartz into each upturned palm, muttered a smattering of unintelligible words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen felt himself go rock-solid stiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to turn his head, blink his eyes. No go. He was a statue. He couldn\u0027t even glance sideways to see if the same thing had happened to Amy, although he assumed it had. He couldn\u0027t even feel himself breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re both okay,\" Zabel said. \"But I need to keep you on ice while I check this out. It\u0027s still hard to believe. The philosopher\u0027s stone. But if it is true... well, that\u0027s the wizard\u0027s jackpot, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen thought, Eat shit, cocksucker as loud as he could on the off chance wizards could read minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might have more questions for you,\" Zabel said. \"So I\u0027m keeping you until I can confirm or deny this fairy tale. I\u0027ll need to go up to my office, gather some things, look up a few spells. Then I suppose I\u0027m off to the cemetery. Now, don\u0027t go anywhere, you two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen tried to move any part of his body-finger, toe, tongue, eyebrow. He might as well have been carved from marble. How many minutes slipped by? Thirty? Forty? An hour? It was amazingly difficult to measure the passage of time when one was forced to remain utterly motionless. No windows. No sounds. This could drive him mad in no time flat. He could not stop trying to look at Amy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen heard something, almost like a faint scratching. He would have whipped his head around to look if he hadn\u0027t been frozen. The door creaked open. Footfalls came down the steps, a strange clicking. Oh, hell. What was coming for them? Maybe Zabel had decided he didn\u0027t need them after all and had come to tie up loose ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen tried one more time to move any part of his body. Stone still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf\u0027s head came into view. There was still an instinctual moment of fear before relief flooded him. Penny. Thank God. He tried to will the wolf to action. Come on, knock the quartz out of my hand. You can do it. Come on, figure it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf looked back and forth between Allen and Amy, pacing anxiously. Penny emitted a questioned sound halfway between a whine and a growl, then sat in front of Allen, head cocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet the quartz. Come on. Fetch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny pawed at the air, edged forward, and put her paw on Allen\u0027s leg. The wolf snorted. When Allen didn\u0027t reply, she got up on her hind legs, put her paws on his chest. Her full enormous wolf weight knocked him back into the wall. His whole body shifted, and the quartz slipped out of his hand, rattled on the stone floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling flooded back into Allen\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHot needles scorched his knees and the elbow of the arm he\u0027d used to hold up the stone. He collapsed to the floor, moaned, rubbed the circulation back into his elbow. Who knew standing still could be so grueling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolf Penny licked his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn back into a girl before you do that, okay?\" Allen moaned again, rolled over and looked up at the wolf. \"Did he see you come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen looked at Amy. She still stared straight ahead at nothing, mouth slightly open, hand outstretched, the chunk of quartz still in the center of her palm. \"The rock in her hand,\" Allen said. \"Get rid of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny bumped the bottom of Amy\u0027s hand with her head, and the quartz went flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Motherfucker.\" Amy fell back against the wall, slid into a sitting position, rubbed her elbow, and stretched out her legs. \"I need to start doing yoga or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen looked at the wolf. \"You going to change back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t have any clothes,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy stood, stomped her feet trying to get the feeling back. \"We\u0027ve got to get out of here. Maybe we can sneak back up the front stairs without Zabel hearing. Run out the front door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Allen said. \"He still has the Kelley diary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving without it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you get all action hero all of a sudden?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s information in it,\" Allen said. \"We\u0027ve come too far just to let it go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s look around.\" Amy headed for a cupboard against the far wall. \"Maybe there\u0027s something we can use for a weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the cupboard, her hand going to her mouth to stifle a scream. She jumped back. Penny growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen\u0027s eyes went big and round, his mouth falling open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn, that light\u0027s bright,\" said one of the severed heads in the cupboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix heads. Three on the top shelf, another three on the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It talked,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf whined, hid behind Allen\u0027s legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What day is it?\" asked one of the top-shelf heads, who had a thick black moustache and eyebrows. \"Can you take me outside? I haven\u0027t seen the sun in so long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop complaining,\" said the head next to him. \"I\u0027ve been in here longer than any of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to excuse us, miss,\" said a bald, bottom-shelf head. \"It gets a little tedious in here. Hard to pass the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could start the choir again,\" suggested the moustache head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All you know are fucking Journey songs,\" said baldy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Allen said. \"Close the cupboard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" all the heads said together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just leave,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" said the freshest-looking head. \"I know you, don\u0027t I? London, about two weeks ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy squinted at the head. \"Pascal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027ve forgotten your name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen said, \"You know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a Society official,\" she told him. \"What happened to you, Pascal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story,\" Pascal said. \"You\u0027ve got to get me out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Us too,\" said one of the other heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" Pascal snapped. \"I\u0027m talking to somebody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t leave yet,\" Allen told the head. \"Zabel has something of ours, and we need to get it back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Zabel now?\" Pascal asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he was going to his office,\" Amy said. \"Maybe he\u0027s still there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go to his office,\" Pascal said. \"He\u0027s got it rigged with subliminal messages. You\u0027ll be helpless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen looked at the wolf. \"How did you get in here, anyway? The front door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you find an open window?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you get on the roof?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen scratched his chin, thought for a moment. \"Okay, people, here\u0027s the plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy raised an eyebrow, the hint of a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. \"You\u0027re making plans now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just huddle up and listen,\" Allen said. \"Amy, I want you on the street. At least one of us needs to get away clean. Head, you\u0027re with me. I need inside information. Now pay attention. Here\u0027s how it\u0027s going to go down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey eased up the stairs from the basement. When they reached the ground floor, they split up. The wolf padded back to the kitchen to the open window she\u0027d come through in the first place. Amy slipped out the front door, closed it behind her as gently as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, head, it\u0027s just me and you now,\" Allen whispered. \"Where\u0027s Zabel\u0027s office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you stop calling me head? My name\u0027s Pascal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does your voice sound weird?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a stone in my mouth,\" Pascal said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you spit it out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027ll die,\" Pascal said. \"The office is upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen started up the stairs with the head under his arm. He stopped every few steps to listen. Had Zabel already gone? If so, maybe he\u0027d left the diary behind. Allen could do with a bit of good luck. They reached the second floor. Allen paused again but didn\u0027t hear anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn right,\" Pascal whispered. \"The office is all the way at the end of the hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said there was a window that faced the street?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and a small balcony beyond, or maybe it was just a large flowerbox. I didn\u0027t get a good look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Allen said. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tiptoed down the hall to the office, pressed his ear against the door but heard nothing. He knelt, looked through the keyhole. He couldn\u0027t see much. No movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s in there,\" Allen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me have a look,\" Pascal said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen held the head up to the keyhole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re right,\" Pascal said. \"His desk is right across from the door, and I don\u0027t see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen tucked the head back under his arm, tried the doorknob. Unlocked. He pushed it open slowly, stuck his head inside. Nobody there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kelley diary sat in plain sight in the center of the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet,\" Allen said. \"Let\u0027s grab it and get the hell out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so fast,\" came a voice from behind Allen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. Allen\u0027s heart sank. He turned very slowly. Zabel stood there, an automatic pistol trained on Allen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn your eyes,\" Pascal said. \"That\u0027s my gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw no reason to throw it out,\" Zabel said. \"Looks like it came in handy. Pull the trigger on this end, and the bullet comes out the other end, right? Pretty simple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a giant douche,\" Pascal said. \"Just look at me. This isn\u0027t over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I might take you up on the roof after this, Pascal. See what the crows make of you.\" Zabel waved the gun at Allen. \"Stand back. We\u0027re going to have a little talk. For starters, I\u0027d like to know how you got out of the basement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen sighed. \"I\u0027m sorry, Pascal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry for what?\" asked the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen tossed the head into the air. It went nearly as high as the ceiling, then arced toward Zabel, who titled his head back to see Pascal\u0027s face screaming down at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen leaped on Zabel, a hand going to his gun wrist. They twisted, went to the ground. The head came down and bounced off Zabel\u0027s skull. Zabel winced, let go of the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen grabbed it and stood, pointed it at Zabel. \"Hold it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel didn\u0027t hold it. He stood slowly, rubbing the top of his head. \"That hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be taking that diary now,\" Allen said. \"Nobody has to get shot here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen lifted the pistol. \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027ll do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel stomped his foot, pretended to jump at Allen. \"Boo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen yelped, thrust the gun at Zabel, and tried to pull the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the gun, incredulous, pointed it at Zabel again. No matter how hard he tried to pull the trigger, Allen couldn\u0027t make his finger obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel laughed. \"You didn\u0027t think it would be that easy, did you? I have protections all over my house to keep people like you from doing me any harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you!\" Pascal was on the floor, facing a corner. \"Damn it, what\u0027s happening? Turn me around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lars, come here,\" called Zabel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shit,\" said the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen was still trying to pull the trigger. He couldn\u0027t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Christ\u0027s sake,\" Zabel said. \"Give me that gun before you hurt yourself. You can\u0027t harm me, but you\u0027ll shoot your own foot off if you keep-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe window exploded behind him, the wolf leaping onto the desk amid a glittering rain of glass. Penny wore a torn strip of tablecloth around her eyes to protect herself from the subliminal spells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen, who\u0027d known it was going to happen, screamed anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see,\" yelled the head. \"What\u0027s happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf zeroed in on Zabel, snapping its jaws, growling. Zabel tried to retreat, but Penny\u0027s powerful jaws clamped down on his upper arm. He screamed again, hit the wolf on the side of the head with his free hand. \"Lars!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen tossed the gun aside, leaped forward, and grabbed the Kelley diary off the desk. As he turned, he bounced off the chest of a gigantic wooden monster. He sat down hard on the floor, then looked up at the thing made of patchwork bits of wood, like some kind of murderous arts and crafts project gone horribly wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster reached out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to die, Allen thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster grabbed the wolf by the scruff of the neck, flung it against the far wall. The wolf crashed with a pained yelp, knocked pictures off the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen crawled past the golem\u0027s legs, the diary tucked under one arm. \"Everybody out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How am I supposed to do that?\" shouted the head. \"I have no legs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen scooped him up by the hair and dashed from the room. He took the stairs three at a time, hit the ground floor hard, and sprinted for the front door. He opened it, ran through, didn\u0027t bother closing it behind him. He hit the middle of the street, searching for Amy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced back at Zabel\u0027s second-floor window. Had Penny made it out? The plan had been to scatter after Allen got his hands on the diary, but if Penny needed help then-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire exploded from the second-floor window, shook the street, chunks of brick and mortar pelting Allen and the sidewalk and street. Tourists screamed and scattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother blast of fire, and the wolf flew through the window, fell limply, changing in midair, fur melting back to flesh. By the time Penny hit the street she was human again, naked and smoking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen rushed to her, knelt, set Pascal\u0027s head aside and scooped her into his arms. She was unconscious but alive, hair and eyebrows singed, covered with scrapes and bruises. \"It\u0027s okay, Penny. I\u0027m here. You\u0027re fine. You\u0027re okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy appeared at his shoulder. \"Oh, my God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were getting a taxi,\" Allen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did.\" She gestured at the smoking window. \"He took off when the world exploded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head faced Zabel\u0027s house. \"Ha. Burn, baby, burn. Take that you son of a-ack!\" The head choked, coughed, and spit out the bloodstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh sh-\" Pascal\u0027s eyes rolled up, and he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen cradled Penny to his chest. \"She should never have come for us. She should have called for help instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She did,\" came a voice from behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen whipped his head around, saw Father Paul standing there with another big priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got a van around the corner,\" Father Paul said. \"Bring her and hurry. In about two minutes this place will be a logjam of police and firemen.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-a-go-go/page-23.html","bookId":2600,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM"}
