How should we deal with this incredible experience called sexuality?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot with shame, that’s for sure. And not with guilt, and not with fear.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor shame is not virtue, and guilt is not goodness, and fear is not honor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd not with lust, for lust is not passion; and not with abandon, for abandon is not freedom; and not with aggressiveness, for aggressiveness is not eager-ness.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd, obviously, not with ideas of control or power or domination, for these have nothing to do with Love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut . . . may sex be used for purposes of simple personal gratification? The surprising answer is yes—be-cause “personal gratification” is just another word for Self Love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePersonal gratification has gotten a bad rap through the years, which is the main reason so much guilt is attached to sex.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are told you are not to use for personal gratifi-cation something which is intensely personally gratify-ing! This obvious contradiction is apparent to you, but you don’t know where to go with the conclusion! So you decide that if you feel guilty about how good you feel during and after sex, that will at least make it all right.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not unlike the famous singer you all know, whom I will not name here, who receives millions of dollars for singing her songs. Asked to comment on her incredible success and the riches it has brought her, she said, “I feel almost guilty because I love doing this so much.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe implication is clear. If it’s something you love doing, you should not also be rewarded additionally with money. Most people earn money by doing some-thing they hate-or something that is at least hard work, not endless joy!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo the world’s message is: If you feel negatively about it, then you can enjoy it!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGuilt is often used by you in your attempt to feel bad about something you feel good about—and thus recon-cile yourself with God...who you think does not want you to feel good about anything!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are especially not to feel good about joys of the body. And absolutely not about (as your grandmother used to whisper) “S-E-X . . .”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, the good news is it’s all right to love sex!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt’s also all right to love your Self!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, it’s mandatory.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat does not serve you is to become addicted to sex (or anything else). But it is “okay” to fall in love with it!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePractice saying this ten times each day:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI LOVE SEX\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePractice saying this ten times:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI LOVE MONEY\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, you want a really tough one?

All through your life you have been made to feel guilty about\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTHE THINGS YOU WANT MOST.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet I tell you this: love, love, love the things you desire—for your love of them draws them to you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThese things are the stuff of life. When you love them, you love life! When you declare that you desire them, you announce that you choose all the good that life has to offer!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo choose sex—all the sex you can get! And choose power—all the power you can muster! And choose fame—all the fame you can attain! And choose suc-cess—all the success you can achieve! And choose winning—all the winning you can experience!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet do not choose sex instead of love, but as a celebration of it. And do not choose power over, but power with. And do not choose fame as an end in itself, but as a means to a larger end. And do not choose success at the expense of others, but as a tool with which to assist others. And do not choose winning at any cost, but winning that costs others nothing, and even brings them gain as well.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGo ahead and choose the adulation of others—but see all others as beings upon which you can shower adulation, and do it!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGo ahead and choose being better—but not better than others; rather, better than you were before.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGo ahead and choose having more, but only so that you have more to give.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd yes, choose “knowing how” and “knowing why”—so that you can share all knowledge with others.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd by all means choose to KNOW GOD. In fact, CHOOSE THIS FIRST, and all else will follow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of your life you have been taught that it is better to give than to receive. Yet you cannot give what you do not have.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is why self-gratification is so important—and why it is so unfortunate that it has come to sound so ugly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eObviously, self-gratification at the expense of others is not what we’re talking about here. This is not about ignoring the needs of others. Yet life should also not have to be about ignoring your own needs.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGive yourself abundant pleasure, and you will have abundant pleasure to give others.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe masters of Tantric sex know this. That’s why they encourage masturbation, which some of you actu-ally call a sin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMasturbation? Oh, boy—You have really stretched the limit here. How can You bring up something like that—how can You even say it—in a message that’s supposed to be coming from God?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI see. You have a judgment about masturbation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, I don’t, but a lot of readers might. And I thought You said we were producing this book for others to read.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen why are You deliberately offending them?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI am not “deliberately offending” anyone. People are free to be “offended” or not, as they choose. Yet do you really think it is going to be possible for us to candidly and openly talk about human sexuality with-out someone choosing to be “offended”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo, but there’s such a thing as going too far. I don’t think most people are ready to hear God talk about masturbation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf this book is to be limited to what “most people” are ready to hear God talk about, it’s going to be a very small book. Most people are never ready to hear what God talks about when God is talking about it. They usually wait 2,000 years.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll right, go ahead. We’ve all gotten over our initial shock.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGood. I was merely using this life experience (in which you’ve all engaged, by the way, but of which no one wants to speak) to illustrate a larger point.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe larger point, restated: Give yourself abundant pleasure, and you will have abundant pleasure to give to others.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTeachers of what you call Tantric sex—which is a very high form of sexual expression, inciden-tally—know that if you come to sex with hunger for sex, your ability to pleasure your partner and to experience a prolonged and joyful union of souls and bod-ies—which is a very high reason to experience sexuality, by the way—is greatly diminished.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTantric lovers, therefore, often self-pleasure before they pleasure each other. This is frequently done in the presence of each other, and usually with the encour-agement and help and loving guidance of each other. Then, when initial hungers have been satisfied, the deeper thirst of the two—the thirst for ecstasy through prolonged union—can be gloriously satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe mutual self-pleasuring is all part of the joyful-ness, the playfulness, the lovingness of sexuality fully expressed. It is one of several parts. The experience you call coitus, or intercourse, might come at the end of a 2-hour encounter of love. Or it might not. For most of you it is very nearly the only point of a 20-minute exercise. That is, 20 minutes if you’re lucky!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea this was going to turn into a sex manual.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not. But it wouldn’t be so bad if it did. Most people have a lot to learn about sexuality, and its most wondrous, beneficial expression.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI was nevertheless still seeking to illustrate the larger point. The more pleasure you give yourself, the more pleasure you can give to another. Likewise, if you give yourself the pleasure of power, you have more power to share with others. The same is true of fame, wealth, glory, success, or anything else which makes you feel good.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd by the way, I think it’s time we looked at why a certain thing does make you “feel good.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOkay—I give up. Why?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Feeling good” is the soul’s way of shouting “This is who I am!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHave you ever been in a classroom where the teacher was taking attendance-calling the roll—and when your name was called you had to say “here”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, “feeling good” is the soul’s way of saying “here!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow a lot of people are ridiculing this whole idea of “doing what feels good.” They say this is the road to hell. Yet I say it is the road to heaven!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMuch depends, of course, on what you say “feels good.” In other words, what kinds of experiences feel good to you? Yet I tell you this—no kind of evolution ever took place through denial. If you are to evolve, it will not be because you’ve been able to successfully deny yourself the things that you know “feel good,” but because you’ve granted yourself these pleasures—and found something even greater. For how can you know that something is “greater” if you’ve never tasted the “lesser”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eReligion would have you take its word for it. That is why all religions ultimately fail.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSpirituality, on the other hand, will always succeed. Religion asks you to learn from the experience of others. Spirituality urges you to seek your own.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eReligion cannot stand Spirituality. It cannot abide it. For Spirituality may bring you to a different conclusion than a particular religion—and this no known religion can tolerate.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eReligion encourages you to explore the thoughts of others and accept them as your own. Spirituality invites you to toss away the thoughts of others and come up with your own.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Feeling good” is your way of telling yourself that your last thought was truth, that your last word was wisdom, that your last action was love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTo notice how far you have progressed, to measure how highly you have evolved, simply look to see what makes you “feel good.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet don’t seek to force your evolution—to evolve further, faster—by denying what feels good, or stepping away from it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSelf-denial is self-destruction.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet also know this—self-regulation is not self-denial. Regulating one’s behavior is an active choice to do or not do something based on one’s decision regarding who they are. If you declare that you are a person who respects the rights of others, a decision not to steal or rob from them, not to rape and plunder, is hardly “self-denial.” It is self-declaration. That is why it is said that the measure of how far one has evolved is what makes one feel good.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf acting irresponsibly, if behaving in a way which you know might damage others or cause hardship or pain, is what makes you “feel good,” then you have not evolved very far.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAwareness is the key here. And it is the task of the elders in your families and communities to create and spread this awareness among the young. It is likewise the job of God’s messengers to increase awareness among all peoples, so that they may understand that what is done to or for one is done to or for all—because we are all One.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen you come from “we are all One,” it is virtually impossible to find that hurting another “feels good.” So-called “irresponsible behavior” vanishes. It is within these parameters that evolving beings seek to experience life. It is within these parameters that I say grant yourself permis-sion to have all that life has to offer—and you will discover it has more to offer than you’ve ever imagined.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are what you experience. You experience what you express. You express what you have to express. You have what you grant yourself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI love this—but can we get back to the original question?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes. I created two sexes for the same reason I put the “yin” and “yang” in everything—in the whole uni-verse! They are part of the yin and the yang, this male and this female. They are the highest living expression of it in your world.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey are the yin and the yang... . in form. In one of many physical forms.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe yin and yang, the here and the there.... the this and the that... the up and the down, the hot and the cold, the big and the small, the fast and the slow—the matter and the anti-matter...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of it is necessary for you to experience life as you know it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow may we best express this thing called sexual energy?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLovingly. Openly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePlayfully. Joyfully.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOutrageously. Passionately. Sacredly. Romantically.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHumorously. Spontaneously. Touchingly. Crea-tively. Unabashedly. Sensually.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, Frequently.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are those who say that the only legitimate purpose of human sexuality is procreation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRubbish. Procreation is the happy aftereffect, not the logical forethought, of most human sexual experi-ence. The idea that sex is only to make babies is naive, and the corollary thought that sex should therefore stop when the last child is conceived is worse than naive. It violates human nature—and that is the nature I gave you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSexual expression is the inevitable result of an eter-nal process of attraction and rhythmic energy flow which fuels all of life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have built into all things an energy that transmits its signal throughout the universe. Every person, animal, plant, rock, tree—every physical thing—sends out en-ergy, like a radio transmitter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are sending off energy—emitting energy—right now, from the center of your being in all directions. This energy—which is you—moves outward in wave pat-terns. The energy leaves you, moves through walls, over mountains, past the moon, and into Forever. It never, ever stops.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEvery thought you’ve ever had colors this energy. (When you think of someone, if that person is sensitive enough, he or she can feel it.) Every word you’ve ever spoken shapes it. Everything you’ve ever done affects it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe vibration, the rate of speed, the wavelength, the frequency of your emanations shift and change con-stantly with your thoughts, moods, feelings, words, and actions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve heard the saying “sending off good vibes,” and it’s true. That’s very accurate!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, every other person is, naturally, doing the same thing. And so the ether—the “air” between you—is filled with energy; a Matrix of intertwining, interwoven personal “vibes” that form a tapestry more complex than you could ever imagine.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis weave is the combined energy field within which you live. It is powerful, and affects everything. Including you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou then send out newly created “vibes,” impacted as you are by the incoming vibes to which you are being subjected, and these, in turn, add to and shift the Matrix—which in turn affects the energy field of every-body else, which impacts the vibes they send off, which impacts the Matrix—which impacts you . . . and so forth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow you may think this is all just fanciful illu-sion—but have you ever walked into a room where the “air was so thick you could cut it with a knife”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOr have you ever heard of two scientists working on the same problem at the same time—on opposite sides of the globe—each working on the problem without the other’s knowledge, and each suddenly coming up with the same solution simultaneously—and independently?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThese are common occurrences, and some of the more obvious manifestations of The Matrix.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Matrix—the combined current energy field within any given parameter—is a powerful vibe.

Everything and everyone else is touching you. But now an interesting thing happens. At some point mid-way between you and everything else—those energies meet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTo make a more vivid description, let’s imagine two people in a room. They are on the far sides of the room from each other. We’ll call them Tom and Mary.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow Tom’s personal energy is transmitting signals about Tom in a 360-degree circle out in the universe. Some of that energy wave hits Mary.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMary, meanwhile, is emitting her own en-ergy—some of which hits Tom.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut these energies meet each other in a way you may not have thought of. They meet midway between Tom and Mary.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHere, the energies unite (remember now, these energies are physical phenomena; they can be meas-ured, felt) and combine to form a new energy unit we’ll call “Tomary.” It is the energy of Tom and Mary com-bined.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom and Mary could very well call this energy The Body Between Us—for it is just that: a body of energy to which both are connected, which both are feeding the continuing energies which flow to it, and which is sending energies back to its two “sponsors” along the thread, or cord, or pipeline that always exists within the Matrix. (Indeed, this “pipeline” is the Matrix.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is this experience of “Tomary” which is the truth of Tom and Mary. It is to this Holy Communion that both are drawn. For they feel, along the pipeline, the sublime joy of the Body Between, of the joined One, of the Blessed Union.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom and Mary, standing off at a distance, can feel—in a physical way—what is going on in the Matrix. Both are urgently drawn toward this experience. They want to move toward each other! At once!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow their “training” sets in. The world has trained them to slow down, to mistrust the feeling, to guard against “hurt,” to hold back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut the soul . . . wants to know “Tomary”—now!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf the two are lucky, they will be free enough to set aside their fears and trust that love is all there is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey are irrevocably drawn now, these two, to the Body Between Them. TOMARY is already being expe-rienced metaphysically, and Tom and Mary will want to experience it physically. So they’ll move closer to-gether. Not to get to each other. It looks that way to the casual observer. But they are each trying to get to TOMARY. They are trying to reach that place of Divine Union which already exists between them. The place where they already know they are One—and what it is like to Be One.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo they move toward this “feeling” they are experi-encing, and, as they close the gap between them, as they “shorten the cord,” the energy they are both sending to TOMARY travels a shorter distance and is thus more intense.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey move closer still. The shorter the distance, the greater the intensity. They move closer still. Once more the intensity increases.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow they stand just a few feet apart. The Body Between them is glowing hot. Vibrating with terrific speed. The “connection” to and from TOMARY is thicker, wider, brighter, burning with the transfer of incredible energy. The two are said to be “burning with desire.” They are!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey move closer still.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, they touch.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe sensation is almost unbearable. Exquisite. They feel, at the point of their touch, all the energy of TOMARY—all the compacted, intensely unified sub-stance of their Combined Being.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf you open yourself to your greatest sensitivity, you’ll be able to feel this subtle, sublime energy as a tingling when you touch—sometimes the “tingling” will run right through you—or as heat at the point of your touch—heat which you may also suddenly feel through-out your body—but concentrated deeply within your lower chakra, or energy center.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt will “burn” there especially intensely—and Tom and Mary will now be said to have the “hots” for each other!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow the two embrace, and they close the gap even further, with Tom, Mary, and Tomary all filling nearly the same space. Tom and Mary can feel Tomary be-tween them—and they want to get even closer—to literally meld with Tomary. To become Tomary in physi-cal form.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have created in the male and female bodies a way to do that. At this moment, Tom and Mary’s bodies are ready to do that. Tom’s body is now ready to literally enter Mary. Mary’s body is ready to literally receive Tom within her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe tingling, the burning, is now beyond intense. It is... indescribable. The two physical bodies join. Tom, Mary, and Tomary become One. In the flesh.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStill the energies flow between them. Urgently. Passionately.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey heave. They move. They can’t get enough of each other, can’t get close enough together. They strive to get close. Close. CLOSER.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey explode—literally—and their entire physical bodies convulse. The vibration sends ripples to their fingertips. In the explosion of their oneness they have known the God and the Goddess, the Alpha and the Omega, the All and the Nothing—the Essence of life—the Experience of That Which Is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are physical chemistries as well. The two have become One—and a third entity often is created of the two, in physical form.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThus, an outpicturing of TOMARY is created. Flesh of their flesh. Blood of their blood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey have literally created life!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHave I not said that ye are Gods?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is the most beautiful description of human sexuality I have ever heard.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou see beauty where you desire to see it. You see ugliness where you are afraid to see beauty.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt would amaze you to know how many people see what I’ve just said as ugly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo, it wouldn’t.

The closer you are, the more intense the energy. The further away, the more subtle. Yet you are never totally disconnected from anything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is a point between You and every other person, place, or thing which exists. It is here that two energies meet, forming a third, much less dense, but no less real, energy unit.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEveryone and everything on the planet—and in the universe—is emitting energy in every direction. This energy mixes with all other energies, criss-crossing in patterns of complexity beyond the ability of your most powerful computers to analyze.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe criss-crossing, intermingling, intertwining ener-gies racing between everything that you can call physi-cal is what holds physicality together.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the Matrix, of which I have spoken. It is along this Matrix that you send signals to each other—mes-sages, meanings, healings, and other physical ef-fects—created sometimes by individuals but mostly by mass consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThese innumerable energies are, as I have ex-plained, attracted to each other. This is called the Law of Attraction. In this Law, Like attracts Like.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLike Thoughts attract Like Thoughts along the Ma-trix—and when enough of these similar energies “clump together,” so to speak, their vibrations become heavier, they slow down—and some become Matter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThoughts do create physical form—and when many people are thinking the same thing, there is a very high likelihood their thoughts will form a Reality.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e(That is why “We’ll pray for you” is such a powerful statement.

It is also not surprising that this nation is gradually losing all that it has worked so hard to create—for this nation seems to have lost its vision.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe terms “under God, indivisible,” meant just that—they expressed the Universal Truth of Unity; Oneness: a Matrix very difficult to destroy. But the Matrix has been weakened. Religious freedom has become religious righteousness bordering on religious intolerance. Individual freedom has all but vanished as individual responsibility has disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe notion of individual responsibility has been distorted to mean “every man for himself.” This is the new philosophy that imagines itself to be harkening back to the Early American tradition of rugged individu-alism.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut the original sense of individual responsibility upon which the American vision and the American dream was based found its deepest meaning and its highest expression in the concept of Brotherly Love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat made America great was not that every man struggled for his own survival, but that every man ac-cepted individual responsibility for the survival of all.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAmerica was a nation that would not turn its back on the hungry, would never say no to the needy, would open its arms to the weary and the homeless, and would share its abundance with the world.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet as America became great, Americans became greedy. Not all, but many. And, as time went on, more and more.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs Americans saw how good it was possible to have it, they sought to have it even better. Yet there was only one way to have more and more and more. Someone else had to have less and less and less.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs greed replaced greatness in the American char-acter, there was less room for compassion for the least among the people. The less fortunate were told it was their “own damned fault” if they didn’t have more. After all, America was the Land of Opportunity, was it not? No one except the less fortunate found it possible to admit that America’s opportunity was limited, institu-tionally, to those already on the inside track. In general, these have not included many minorities, such as those of certain skin color or gender.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAmericans became arrogant internationally as well. As millions starved across the globe, Americans threw away enough food each day to feed entire nations. America was generous with some, yes—but increasingly her foreign policy came to be an extension of her own vested interests. America helped others when it served America to do so. (That is, when it served America’s power structure, America’s richest elite, or the military ma-chine that protected those elite-and their collective assets.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAmerica’s founding ideal—Brotherly Love—had been eroded. Now, any talk of being “your brother’s keeper” is met with a new brand of Americanism—a sharp mind toward what it takes to hold on to one’s own, and a sharp word to any among the less fortunate who would dare ask for their fair share, for their griev-ances to be redressed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEach person must take responsibility for herself or himself—that is undeniably true. But America—and your world—can truly work only when every person is willing to stand responsible for all of you as a Whole.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo Collective Consciousness produces collective results.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eExactly—and this has been demonstrated time and time again throughout all of your recorded history.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Matrix draws itself into itself—exactly as your scientists describe the so-called Black Hole phenome-non. It pulls like-energy to like-energy, even drawing physical objects toward each other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThose objects must then repel each other—move away—or they will merge forever—in effect, disappear-ing in their present form and taking on a new form.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll beings of consciousness intuitively know this, so all beings of consciousness move away from the Perma-nent Melding in order to maintain their relationship to all other beings.

This is sex—the Synergistic Energy Exchange.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are constantly being attracted, compelled to-ward union with one another (and with all that is in the Matrix), then, at the Moment of Unity, being repelled by conscious choice away from that Unity. Your choice is to remain free of It, so that you can experience it. For once you become part of that Unity and remain there, you cannot know it as Unity, since you no longer know Separation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePut another way: for God to know Itself as the All of It, God must know Itself as not the All of It.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn you—and in every other energy unit of the uni-verse—God knows Itself as the Parts of All—and thus gives Itself the possibility of knowing Itself as the All in All in Its Own Experience.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI can only experience what I am by experiencing what I am not. Yet I am what I am not—and so you see the Divine Dichotomy. Hence, the statement: I Am that I Am.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow as I said, this natural ebb and flow, this natural rhythm of the universe, typifies all of life—including the very movements that create life in your reality.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eToward each other you are compelled, as if by some urgent force, only to pull away and separate, only to urgently push toward each other again, once more to separate, and again to hungrily, passionately, urgently seek total union.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTogether-apart, together-apart, together-apart your bodies dance, in a movement so basic, so instinctual, that you have very little conscious awareness of delib-erate action. At some point you shift into automatic. No one needs to tell your bodies what to do. They simply do it—with the urgency of all of life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is life itself, expressing itself as life itself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is life itself producing new life in the bosom of its own experience.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of life works on such a rhythm; all of life IS the rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, all of life is imbued with the gentle rhythm of God—what you call the cycles of life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFood grows in such cycles.
