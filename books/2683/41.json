In my basket: Trey Lewd, Rancid, Cece Pensiton, Yo La Tengo, Alex Chilton, Machines of Loving Grace, Jellyfish, the 6th\u0027s, Teenage Fanclub. I\u0027ve also snuck my modeling portfolio in and I spot this cute Oriental girl wearing white jeans with a silver chain-link belt, a V-neck jersey tunic and flat black sandals looking at the back of an ELO CD and I \"accidentally\" drop the portfolio, bathing suit shots scattering around her feet. I pause before I bend down to pick them up, pretending to be mortified, hoping that she\u0027ll check it out, but she just gives me a why-bother? look and walks away and then this cute-as-a-button little g*y guy starts helping me. \"It\u0027s okay, it\u0027s okay,\" I keep saying, pulling a thong shot out of his hand, and then I see the hottest-looking girl in Tower Records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s standing by a listening station, headphones on, pressing buttons, swaying, wearing a pair of tight melon-colored Capri pants that meld into small black boots and an opened violet-beige Todd Oldham overcoat, and as I move closer I can see she\u0027s holding Blur, Suede, Oasis, Sleeper CDs. I\u0027m right behind her as she pulls the headphones off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the coolest record,\" I say, pointing at the Oasis CD. \"Tracks three, four, five and ten are all excellent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns around, startled, sees my face, and what can only be described as a strange expression-one-third worried, one-third smiling, maybe one-third something else-creases her features and then she asks, \"Do you know me?\" but it\u0027s in this teasing way that I\u0027m accustomed to and so I\u0027m able to answer confidently, \"Yeah-L.A. or Miami, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she says, her eyes hardening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you\"-I have a small flash-\"go to Camden?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re getting less cold,\" she says simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait-are you a model?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she sighs. \"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Camden is near the target?\" I ask hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is.\" She sighs again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, foliage is definitely coming my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good.\" She crosses her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you did go to Camden?\" I ask and then, to make sure, \"The one in New Hampshire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there another one?\" she says impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey baby, whoa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" she says, tapping the Oasis CD, \"thanks for the record review, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh man, you know me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slings a red suede zip-top circular purse over her shoulder and lowers Matsuda sunglasses-blue eyes-and pouts, \"Victor Johnson? I mean, that\u0027s if you are Victor Johnson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yeah,\" I admit sheepishly. \"Actually it\u0027s Victor Ward now but, um, it\u0027s still the same me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s just great,\" she says. \"So you got married? Who\u0027s the lucky guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The little pinhead over there with the strawberry strudel on his head.\" I point to the g*y guy who I\u0027m just noticing has kept one of the bathing suit shots. He smiles, then scampers away. \"He\u0027s, uh, shy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I realize that I actually know this girl. \"Oh man, I\u0027m so bad with names,\" I apologize. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead,\" she says, holding something in, \"be a big boy-take a guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027m gonna have a psychic moment.\" I bring my hands to my temples and close my eyes. \"Karen...
