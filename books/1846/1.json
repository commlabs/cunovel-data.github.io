I got you,\" I said real soft, the helicopter lifting off the ground as Duke grabbed Snake Eyes\u0027 hand. I was trying to play as quiet as I could–my mama was banged up again and I didn\u0027t want to wake her where she was sleeping up in her room. She\u0027d told me to watch cartoons up in bed with her and I had for a while, but when I saw she was asleep, I\u0027d come downstairs to play with my G.I. Joe toys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe helicopter landed and my guys jumped out and ran under the chair that I had put a towel over to make into part of an underground bunker. I picked the helicopter up and lifted it off the ground again with a whop, whop, whop sound. I wished I could snap my fingers and make this a real helicopter. Then I\u0027d pull my mama onto it and we\u0027d fly away from here–away from him, away from the black eyes and my mama\u0027s tears. I didn\u0027t care where we\u0027d end up as long as it was far, far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crawled back into my bunker and a few minutes later, I heard the front door open and close, and then heavy footsteps walking through our foyer and down the hall toward where I was playing. I peeked out and saw a pair of shiny black shoes and the cuffs of what I knew were uniform pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crawled out as fast as I could saying, \"Uncle Connor!\" as he kneeled down and I threw myself into his arms, making sure to stay clear of the side where he kept his gun and police flashlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, little man,\" he said, hugging me to him. \"How\u0027s my rescue hero?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. See the underground fortress I built?\" I said, leaning away and proudly pointing back over my shoulder at the fort I had made under the table using blankets and towels. It was pretty cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Connor smiled and glanced behind me. \"I sure do. You did a good job there, Archer. I\u0027ve never seen a fortress quite as impenetrable-looking as that one.\" He winked and smiled bigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned. \"Wanna play with me?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe messed my hair, smiling. \"Not right now, buddy. Later, okay? Where\u0027s your mama?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my own face fall. \"Um, she\u0027s not feeling real good. She\u0027s laying down.\" I looked into Uncle Connor\u0027s face and golden brown eyes. The picture that popped into my head right away was the sky before a storm–dark and sort of scary. I moved back slightly, but as quick as that, Uncle Connor\u0027s eyes cleared and he pulled me into him again, squeezing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Archer, okay,\" he said. He set me back from him and held onto my arms as his eyes moved over my face. I smiled at him and he smiled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have your mama\u0027s smile, you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled bigger. I loved my mama\u0027s smile–it was warm and beautiful and it made me feel loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I look like my daddy,\" I said, looking down. Everyone said I had the Hale look about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just stared at me for a minute, looking like maybe he wanted to say something, but then changed his mind. \"Well, that\u0027s a good thing, buddy. Your daddy\u0027s a handsome devil.\" He smiled at me, but it didn\u0027t move up into his eyes. I looked at him, wishing I looked like Uncle Connor. My mama told me once that he was the most handsome man she\u0027d seen in her whole life. But then she\u0027d looked guilty like she shouldn\u0027t have said that. Probably because he wasn’t my daddy, I guessed. Also, Uncle Connor was a police officer–a hero. When I grew up, I was gonna be just like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Connor stood up. \"I\u0027m gonna go see if your mama\u0027s awake. You play with your action figures and I\u0027ll be down in a minute, okay, buddy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" I nodded. He messed my hair again and then walked toward the steps. I waited a couple minutes and then I followed him up silently. I stepped around every squeak, holding on to the banister to move me forward. I knew how to be quiet in this house. It was important that I knew how to be quiet in this house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got to the top of the stairs, I stood just outside the door to my mama\u0027s room, listening. The door was just open a crack, but it was enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay, Connor, really,\" my mama\u0027s soft voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not okay, Alyssa,\" he hissed, his voice breaking at the end in a way that scared me. \"Jesus. I want to kill him. I\u0027m done with this, Lys. I\u0027m done with the martyr routine. You might think you deserve this, but Archer. Does. Not,\" he said, spitting out the last three words in a way that let me know that his jaw was tight like I\u0027d seen it before. Usually, when my daddy was around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard nothing but my mama\u0027s soft crying for a few minutes before Uncle Connor spoke again. This time his voice sounded strange, no expression in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanna know where he is right now? He left the bar and went home with Patty Nelson. He\u0027s screwing her three ways from Sunday in her trailer. I drove by and could hear it from inside my car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, Connor,\" my mama\u0027s voice choked out. \"Are you trying to make this worse–\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" his voice roared and I jumped slightly. \"No,\" he said more quietly now. \"I\u0027m trying to make you see that it\u0027s enough. It\u0027s enough. If you think you needed to pay a penance, it\u0027s paid. Don\u0027t you see that? You were never right in that belief, but for the sake of argument, let\u0027s say you were–it\u0027s paid up, Lys. It\u0027s long since paid up. Now we\u0027re all paying. Christ, do you wanna know what I felt when I heard the sounds coming out of that trailer? I wanted to bust in there and beat the shit out of him for humiliating you, disrespecting you that way. And the f*ck of it all is that I should be happy that he\u0027s with someone other than you, anyone other than the woman that is so f*cking deep under my skin, I couldn\u0027t dig you out with a jackhammer. But instead, I felt sick about it. Sick, Lys. Sick that he wasn\u0027t treating you right, even though him treating you right might mean I could never have you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quiet from inside the room for a couple minutes and I wanted to peek inside, but I didn\u0027t. All I heard was my mama\u0027s soft crying and some slight rustling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Uncle Connor went on, his voice quiet now, gentle, \"Let me take you away from here, baby, please, Lys. Let me protect you and Archer. Please.\" His voice was filled with something I didn\u0027t know the name for. I sucked in a quiet breath. He wanted to take us away from here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Tori?\" my mama asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a couple seconds before Uncle Connor answered, \"I\u0027d tell Tori I was leaving. She\u0027d have to know. We haven\u0027t had any kind of real marriage for years anyway. She\u0027d have to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She won\u0027t Connor,\" my mama said, sounding scared. \"She won\u0027t understand. She\u0027ll do something to get even with us. She\u0027s always hated me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alyssa, we\u0027re not kids anymore. This isn\u0027t about some stupid competition shit. This is about real life. This is about me loving you. This is about us deserving to have a life together. This is about me, you and Archer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Travis?\" she asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. \"I\u0027ll work something out with Tori,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t need to worry about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more silence, and then my mama said, \"Your job, the town…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alyssa,\" Uncle Connor said, his voice gentle, \"I don\u0027t care about any of that. If there\u0027s no you, nothing else matters. Don\u0027t you know that by now? I\u0027ll resign from my job, sell the land. We\u0027ll live a life, baby. We\u0027ll find some happiness. Away from here–away from this place. Somewhere we can call our own. Baby, don\u0027t you want that? Tell me you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more silence, only I heard soft sounds like maybe they were kissing. I had seen them kissing before when my mama didn\u0027t know I was spying, like I was doing now. I knew it was wrong–mamas weren\u0027t supposed to kiss men who weren\u0027t their husbands. But I also knew that daddies weren\u0027t supposed to come home drunk all the time and slap their wives in the face, and that mamas weren\u0027t supposed to look at uncles with the soft look my mama always got on her face when Uncle Connor came around. It was all mixed up and confused and I wasn\u0027t sure how to sort it all. That\u0027s why I spied on them, trying to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, after what seemed like a long time, my mama whispered, so I could barely hear, \"Yes, Connor, take us away from here. Take us far, far away. Me and you and Archer. Let\u0027s find some happiness. I want that. I want you. You\u0027re the only one I\u0027ve ever wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lys… Lys… My Lys…\" I heard Uncle Connor saying between heavy breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuck away, making my way back down the stairs, in between the noisy spots, not making a sound, moving in silence. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/archer-s-voice/page-1.html","bookId":1846,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:56 PM"}
