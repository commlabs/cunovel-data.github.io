{"id":84573,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eThere’s a definition of irony for you, Mrs. Harbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe foreshadowing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnically you need a special pass signed by your parents and the administration to leave campus during the school day. This wasn’t always true. For a long time one of the perks to being a senior was getting to leave campus whenever you wanted, as long as you had a free period. That was twenty years ago, though, a few years before Thomas Jefferson got the reputation for one of the highest teen suicide rates in the country. We looked up the article online once: the Connecticut Post called us Suicide High.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then one day a bunch of kids left campus and drove off a bridge—a suicide pact, I guess. Anyway, after that the school forbade anyone from leaving school during the day without special permission. It’s kind of stupid if you think about it. That’s like finding out that kids are bringing vodka to school in water bottles and forbidding anyone to drink water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, there’s another way to get off campus: through a hole in the fence beyond the gym by the tennis court, which we call the Smokers’ Lounge, since that’s where all the smokers hang out. No one’s around, though, when Lindsay and I slip through the fence and get started across the woods. In a little while we’ll come on to Route 120. Everything is still and frozen. Twigs and black leaves crack under our shoes, and our breath rises in solid white puffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas Jefferson is about three miles outside of downtown Ridgeview—or what you can call the downtown—but only about a half mile from a small strip of dingy stores we’ve named the Row. There’s a gas station, a TCBY, a Chinese restaurant that once made Elody sick for two days, and a random Hallmark store where you can buy pink glittery ballerina figurines and snow globes and crap like that. That’s where we head. I know we must look like total freaks, stomping along the road in our skirts and tights, our jackets flapping open to show off our fur-trimmed tank tops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pass Hunan Kitchen on our way to TCBY. Through the grime-coated windows we spot Alex Liment and Anna Cartullo bent over a bowl of something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ooo, scandal,” Lindsay says, raising her eyebrows, although it’s really only a half scandal. Everyone knows that Alex has been cheating on Bridget McGuire with Anna for the past three months. Everyone except Bridget, obviously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget’s family is super-Catholic. She’s pretty and really clean-looking, like every time you see her she’s just scrubbed her face really hard. Apparently she’s saving herself for marriage. That’s what she says, anyway, although Elody thinks Bridget might be a closet lesbo. Anna Cartullo is only a junior, but if the rumors are true she’s already had sex with at least four people. She’s one of the few kids in Ridgeview who doesn’t come from any money. Her mom’s a hairdresser, and I don’t even know if she has a dad. She lives in one of the shitty rental condos right off the Row. I once heard Andrew Singer saying her bedroom always smelled like General Tso’s chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go in and say hi,” Lindsay says, reaching for my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hang back. “I’m going through sugar withdrawal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here. Take these.” She pulls a pack of SweeTarts from the waistband of her skirt. Lindsay always carries candy on her, 24/7, like she’s packing drugs. I guess she kind of is. “Just for a second, I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let myself be dragged inside. A bell tinkles as we come through the door. There’s a woman flipping through Us Weekly behind the counter. She looks at us, then looks down again when she realizes we’re not going to order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay slides right up to Alex and Anna’s booth, leaning against the table. She’s kinda, sorta friends with Alex. Alex is kinda, sorta friends with a lot of people, since he deals pot out of a shoe box in his bedroom. He and I have a head-nod friendship, since that’s pretty much the limit of our interaction. He’s actually in English with me, though he shows even less than I do. I guess the rest of the time he’s with Anna. Every so often he’ll say something like, “That essay assignment blows, huh?” but other than that we don’t talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, hey,” Lindsay says. “You going to Kent’s party tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex’s face is red and splotchy. At least he’s embarrassed to be caught out with Anna so blatantly. Or maybe he’s just having a reaction to the food. I wouldn’t be surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um…I don’t know. Maybe. Gotta see….” He trails off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s gonna be super fun.” Lindsay makes her voice extra perky. “Are you going to bring Bridget? She’s such a sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, we both think Bridget is annoying—she’s always really cheerful and she wears T-shirts with lame slogans like Unless You’re the Lead Dog the View Never Changes (no lie)—but Lindsay despises Anna and once wrote AC\u003dWT all over the bathroom right across from the cafeteria—the one everyone uses. WT stands for white trash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe situation is beyond awkward, so I blurt out, “Sesame chicken?” I point at the meat congealing in a grayish sauce in a bowl on the table, next to two fortune cookies and a sad-looking orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Orange beef,” Alex says. He seems relieved by the change of topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay gives me a look, annoyed, but I keep rattling on. “You should be careful about eating here. The chicken once poisoned Elody. She threw up for, like, two days straight. If it was chicken. She swears she found a fur ball in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I say this Anna picks up her chopsticks and takes an enormous bite, looking up and smiling at me as she chews so I can see the food in her mouth. I’m not sure whether she’s doing it deliberately to gross me out, but it seems like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s nasty, Kingston,” Alex says, but he’s smiling now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay rolls her eyes, like Alex and Anna are both a total waste of our time. “Come on, Sam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pockets a fortune cookie and breaks it open when we get outside. “Happiness is found when one is not looking,” she reads, and I crack up when she makes a face. She balls up the little slip of paper and lets it flutter to the ground. “Useless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath. “The smell in there always makes me sick.” It does, too: that smell of old meat and cheap oil and garlic. The clouds on the horizon are slowly taking over the sky, turning everything gray and blurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me about it.” Lindsay puts a hand on her stomach. “You know what I need?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A jumbo cup of The Country’s Best Yogurt!” I say, smiling. TCBY is another thing we can’t bring ourselves to abbreviate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely a jumbo cup of The Country’s Best Yogurt,” Lindsay echoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though we’re both freezing, we order double-chocolate soft-serve with sprinkles and crushed peanut butter cups on top, which we eat on our way back to school, blowing on our fingers to keep them warm. Alex and Anna are gone from Hunan Kitchen when we pass, but we run into them again at the Smokers’ Lounge. We have exactly seven minutes left until the bell for eighth period, and Lindsay pulls me behind the tennis courts so she can have a cigarette without listening to Alex and Anna argue. That’s what it looks like they’re doing, anyway. Anna’s head is bent and Alex is grabbing her shoulders, whispering to her. The cigarette in his hand burns so close to her dull brown hair I’m positive it’s going to catch fire, and I picture her whole head just going up like that, like a match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay finishes her smoke and we dump our yogurt cups right there, on top of the frozen black leaves and trampled cigarette packs and plastic bags half filled with rainwater. I’m feeling anxious about tonight—half dread and half excitement—like when you hear thunder and know that any second you’ll see lightning tearing across the sky, nipping at the clouds with its teeth. I shouldn’t have skipped out on English. It has given me too much time to think. And thinking never did anybody any good, no matter what your teachers and parents and the science-club freaks tell you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe skirt the perimeter of the tennis courts and go up along Senior Alley. Alex and Anna are still standing half concealed behind the gym. Alex is on his second cigarette at least. Definitely an argument. I feel a momentary rush of satisfaction: Rob and I hardly ever fight, at least not about anything serious. That must mean something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trouble in paradise,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More like trouble in the trailer park,” Lindsay says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe start cutting across the teachers’ lot when we see Ms. Winters, the vice principal, threading between cars, trying to rout out the smokers who don’t have time or are too lazy to walk all the way down to the Lounge and instead try to hide out between the teachers’ old Volvos and Chevrolets. Ms. Winters has some crazy vendetta against people who smoke. I heard that her mom died of lung cancer or emphysema or something. If you get caught smoking by Ms. Winters you get three Friday detentions, no questions asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay frantically rifles in her bag for her Trident and pops two pieces in her mouth. “Shit, shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t get busted just for smelling like smoke,” I say, even though Lindsay knows this. She likes the drama, though. Funny how you can know your friends so well, but you still end up playing the same games with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignores me. “How’s my breath?” She breathes on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like a friggin’ menthol factory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Winters hasn’t spotted us yet. She’s making her way down the rows, sometimes stooping to peer underneath the cars as though someone might be sandwiched against the ground, trying to light up. There’s a reason everyone calls her the Nicotine Nazi behind her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitate, looking back toward the gym. I don’t especially like Alex and I don’t like Anna, but anyone who’s ever been through high school understands you have to stick together against parents, teachers, and cops. It’s one of those invisible lines: us against them. You just know this, like you know where to sit and who to talk to and what to eat in the cafeteria, without even knowing how you know. If that makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should we go back and warn them?” I ask Lindsay, and she pauses too and squints at the sky like she’s thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Screw it,” she says finally. “They can take care of themselves.” As if to reinforce her point, the bell for final period rings and she gives me a shove. “Come on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s right, as usual. After all, it’s not like they’ve ever done anything for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFRIENDSHIP: A HISTORY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay and I became friends in seventh grade. Lindsay picked me out. I’m still not sure why. After years of trying, I had only just clawed my way up from the social bottom to the social middle. Lindsay’s been popular since first grade, when she moved here. In the class circus that year she was the ringleader; when we did a production of The Wizard of Oz the next year she was Dorothy. And in third grade, when we all performed Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, she got to play Charlie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think that pretty much gives you an idea. She’s the kind of person who makes you feel drunk just by being around her, like suddenly the world’s edges are dulled and all of the colors are spinning together. I’ve never told her that, obviously. She’d make fun of me for lezzing out on her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/before-i-fall/page-6.html","bookId":2757,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:26 PM"}
