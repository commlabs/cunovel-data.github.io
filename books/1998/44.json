And the loitering has obviously brought some attention, and well … now the crowd has grown because people know it’s me in here.” He sounds really uncomfortable and embarrassed saying this to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The staff here are trying to clear the parking lot, but Dave has called Stuart and he’s on his way to come collect us now in the other car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so sorry about this, Tru.” He puts his hand on my face, but I can’t even enjoy the feel of his skin on mine, because I’m so conscious of the fact that people are staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I’m in a zoo and I\u0027m truly on the wrong side of the fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay,” I say trying to keep my voice even. “It’s not your fault. This is just how things are. I understand. Come on let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take hold of Jake’s hand, and we start to walk through the Louvre following Dave. Ben is behind us, the museum’s staff with us too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople are following us, and stopping to stare as we pass by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, it makes me want to break out into a sprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these beautiful things here in the Louvre and all people seem to want to do is stare at Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get he’s beautiful. I want to stare at him all day long too, but it’s just plain rude to stare so blatantly, and to follow him … us … when we are clearly out together for the day, without any recrimination whatsoever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold on a little tighter to Jake’s hand. He squeezes it, giving me a small, uneasy small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s feeling bad that we’re having to leave, and I know he’s worried as to how I feel about it, especially after what we talked about in the car just before we arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do I feel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStressed, a bit panicky, annoyed that we can’t even go on a simple day out together without attracting the crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs this how it’s always going to be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know if I’m cut out for this. It’s scary as to the level of attention Jake receives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reach the main door and Dave pushes it open, then I’m hit with some camera flashes. There are paparazzi out here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought they were in the parking lot? How the hell did they know we’d be coming out this way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you two are together then? Are you finally settling down Jake? Is Trudy the one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices are coming from left, right and centre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus Christ, this is insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep my head down. Jake’s arm is around me now, tight, holding me to him. Dave is on Jake’s right, arm on him guiding us over to Stuart’s waiting car. Ben is at my side, staying close to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trudy! Look this way gorgeous, let us see your face!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to get out of here. I don’t think I’ve ever felt as uneasy in all my life as I do right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilt my head further down, practically tucking my chin into my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing I know, we’re at the car. Dave has the door open and Jake is guiding me in. I shuffle along sitting behind the passenger seat, and then Jake quickly climbs in behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave shuts the door, pushing some paps out of the way in the process. Ben climbs in the passenger seat and then Stuart’s driving us away, pretty quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is bumping around my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn in my seat looking out the back window, worrying the paparazzi might be following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t see any suspicious looking cars, but then there’s plenty around. And I’m thankful in this moment that the windows are so heavily tinted in this car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake takes hold of my hand, pulling my attention to him, and it’s only then I realise my hand is shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, are you okay?” His voice is soft and soothing. He takes hold of my chin, forcing my eyes to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine.” My mouth’s dry. I moisten my lips with my tongue. “That was just … um … a little crazy.” I take a deep breath. “Is it always like that when you go out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not always, no,” he shakes his head. “That was a little more hectic than normal, but I’m guessing it’s because you’re with me, and the press will be after a picture of us together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the ones on Twitter weren’t enough?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Apparently not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t get it though, Jake. You’ve been out with women before, that’s not exactly a rarity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sounded a little shittier than I intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me a look. “No, Tru. I’ve fallen out of clubs with women before. I’ve never taken anyone out on date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did they even know we were on a date?” My voice is shrill again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, baby.” He tucks my hair behind my ear, and I’m relieved to his touch. “Anyone who took one look at us together could have easily worked that out – figured out that I’m crazy about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we only started seeing each other properly yesterday!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so I’m freaking out a little – a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t take them long, Tru. You’re in this business, you know how it works.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I might be a journo, but I am nothing like them!” I say with indignation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not what I meant, and you know it.” He gives me a look. “I’m just saying, you work at a magazine, you see how things are with celebrities. My life is not private in a lot of ways, no matter how much I try to keep it as such. And this is their job – the paps. They make their living off the shit going on in my life, and the lives of other celebs. It’s just how things are. Not all the time, but a lot of it, and if something happens in my life – like me being out on a date … the possibility of me having a girlfriend, well then the media becomes interested … interested in you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’m no one special.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are to me.” His voice is intense. “You’re everything to me,” he adds in a lower tone. “And I’m sorry this hasn’t been a first date, like a first date should be.” He cups my cheek with his hand. “I will make it up to you, I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen looking at Jake here, before me, him staring back at me in earnest, filled with love for me, I feel suddenly overwhelmed by my feelings for him, and at the depth of those feelings. And momentarily forgetting that Stuart and Ben are in the front of the car, only a few feet away, I lean forward and kiss him, hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParting my lips under his, I let his tongue move into my mouth, and then I feel it pass between us. The energy, the desire, and I start to feel that stirring in my body that only he can create.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want him, right here and now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know he feels it too as he groans a little sound in my mouth. Jake grabs a firm hold of my hair, kissing me even harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes a long moment, but I do eventually become very aware of the fact that Stuart and Ben are in the front of the car, especially when Jake’s hand goes to my leg, and starts to move higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing for sure they don’t want a Jake and Tru, porn show, I pull back from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake looks at me disappointed. I flick my eyes in the direction of the front of the car. I’m really glad the radio is on fairly loud, which will have drowned out the sound of our kissing. But even so, my cheeks have flamed with embarrassment at my loss of control over Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles and leans close again, running his nose up the sensitive skin on my neck, he reaches my ear and whispers, “I can’t wait to get you back to the hotel … I am going to undress you, slowly … and I’m going to kiss you, everywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel his words, down there, and that heat rises again in my belly. I love how he makes me feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Te quiero,” I whisper back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus Christ, Tru,” he groans quietly in my ear, his breath hot on my skin. “You know what that does to me. If you keep talking like that I don’t give a shit who is in this car with us, I’ll take you right here and now, on the back seat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words do crazy things to me and I’m feeling turned on and suddenly reckless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it’s because I’m still pumped up with adrenaline after what just happened at the Louvre, or because of how much I do love him, but I suddenly have the urge to turn him on, to challenge him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Joder, Jake … that’s what I want to do with you, now,” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knows exactly what I’m saying to him. That is one Spanish word he does know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel him stiffen beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flicker a glance in Stuart’s direction, seeing his eyes are on the road. Ben is talking on his phone, speaking to Dave presumably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo shifting back in my seat, I move closer to the door, turning my body toward him, and run my fingers up my thigh, lifting my skirt up, ever so slightly, I part my legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake sharps in a breath. His eyes are on me and they\u0027re glowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love this sense of power I have over him right now. It’s exhilarating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him, meeting his hot gaze and moisten my lips with my tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling seductively at Jake, I lower my skirt back down, pressing my legs together, feeling proud of my little wanton moment thinking, my work here is done, well until the hotel that is, but Jake shakes his head, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy legs start to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moves closer, positioning himself beside me, and puts his foot up on the rest between the front seats, covering any possible view of my legs with his. Jake rests his hand on my lap, then very gently pushes my legs apart with his hand and I let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is thudding in my chest and my mouth suddenly dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake slides his hand under my skirt, reaching my panties he hooks his fingers into them, moving them aside, giving him the access he wants, he starts to touch me. Then very gently, he slips his finger inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy whole body nearly explodes. I have to bite my lip, hard, to stop myself from making a noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my face to his. He stares back at me. His eyes daring, pooling and heated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have never in all my life done anything like this. And I know I should care there are other people in the car with us, but it’s hard to right now. All I care about is Jake and the way he’s making me feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts to move his finger, in and out, in a rhythmic motion, his thumb rubbing over me, and my heart is beating so hard, my legs shaking uncontrollably, and I know what’s going to happen if he doesn’t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jake, stop, or I’m going to come,” I mouth to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins, and rubs his thumb a little firmer over my hot spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body shudders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” I mouth again, pressing my legs together, onto his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins again, seemingly satisfied with himself and the effect he’s had on me, and slips his hand out from under my skirt, then rearranges his very noticeable erection in his pants, with his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m relieved and disappointed at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I have a good mind to do the same to him, work him up to the point of near combustion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart pulls up out front of the hotel a few minutes later and I’m still struggling to gather my cloudy, but very horny thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so worked up and desperate to relieve the ache Jake has left me with, that I’m just about ready to do it anywhere with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we’re out of the car, Jake grabs hold of my hand leading me straight into the hotel, practically dragging me through the lobby and into a waiting lift. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-mighty-storm-the-storm-1/page-44.html","bookId":1998,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:44 PM"}
