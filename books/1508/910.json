Behind him, everyone else – including even the Steppes Master – were left dumbfounded.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis old Imp had a three-star Demon Emperor cultivation. In the entire Holy Demon Continent, his strength belonged to the upper echelon, and in terms of soul attacks, the Imp race far surpassed all others. But even in this case, the old Imp’s chaos demon spirit life incarnation was actually crushed by Lin Ming’s battle spirit in a single exchange!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Steppes Master was stunned for a moment before suddenly recovering. He threw out the array disc in his hands, “10,000 ghosts kill together, Crimson Blood Extermination!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHu hu hu - !\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCountless grieving spirits shot towards Lin Ming. At the same time, the Steppes Master extracted a war lance from his spatial ring. As this lance appeared, countless blood lights appeared in the air like innumerable fireworks setting off at once. With the sound of billowing thunder, he stabbed at Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor a time, blood fog filled the skies!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis strike contained the infinite resentment of the 10,000 Ghost Soul Devouring Array Formation. It could be said to be the absolute advantage of location!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Steppes Master was only a two-star Demon Emperor; he was inferior to the old Imp in terms of strength. But, with the might of the 10,000 Ghost Soul Devouring Array supporting his attacks, the power of this strike could actually compare with that of a three-star Demon Emperor to a certain extent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMost importantly, this was a physical and energy attack, not a soul force and will attack. It would not be suppressed by Lin Ming’s battle spirit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn other words, for Lin Ming to face the Steppes Master’s attack was much more difficult than facing the old Imp’s chaos demon spirit. After all, he was only at the fourth stage of Life Destruction – this was a disadvantage that was difficult to make up for.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs this monstrous spear that filled the air with a blood fog thrust at Lin Ming, behind him, a crimson lotus began to bloom. The traces of red lights formed a divine red lotus that began to slowly bloom.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis red lotus seemed to contain the power of the Great Dao’s Laws. At the same time, it contained an indescribable sense of suppression, as if the center of the lotus passed straight into the depths of hell.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the red lotus appeared, even a faint red mist appeared around it, as if it had become a completely different world. It was an unfathomable feeling that contained the breath of the Great Dao itself. One flower, one world; one petal, one divine god!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe last portion of the Heavenly Demon martial intent – the Prime Emperor Lotus Flower!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the red lotus appeared, it was like another world of Laws appeared around Lin Ming. All Laws, all principles, and even all energy became difficult to use! It was like the Laws of Time and Space were completely controlled here. The red lotus was the master of this space. A divine god – that was the Prime Emperor!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Lin Ming truly comprehended the Prime Emperor martial intent, he discovered that his previous speculations that the Prime Emperor martial intent was aimed at the world of will had been partially wrong. The Prime Emperor martial intent was in truth the formation of a side world. Whether it was the physical world or the world of will, both of them were pieces included in the Prime Emperor martial intent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn truth, the Prime Emperor Lotus Flower’s essence was the grandmist chaos space before all matter and energy had been formed. Before yin and yang had divided, before the five main elements had come into reality, everything in the universe had been in the form of grandmist energy. There wasn’t even heaven and earth origin energy or true essence. Here, the Laws of Metal, Wood, Water, Earth, Fire, Wind, Thunder, the Concepts of Life and Death, the Concept of Vibration, the Concept of Starlight, all martial skills, battle spirits, divine souls, everything lost their function in the presence of this grandmist chaos space.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, the premise of all this was that Lin Ming was strong enough so that the enemy couldn’t break through this grandmist space. Otherwise, none of that would matter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the legends, when Empyrean Primordius summoned the Prime Emperor Lotus Flower, he could transform this entire part of the boundless universe into grandmist space, reproducing the true scene of when the universe first formed. After a long period of refining, all matter and energy within the grandmist space could also be reduced into grandmist energy. This was a boundary that Lin Ming couldn’t even fathom.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut as for Lin Ming’s Prime Emperor martial intent, he could only cover 100 feet of space around him. Although this was a mere 100 feet, if the Steppes Master were to rush into this space, he would find it endless and infinite!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What is this!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Steppes Master’s eyes widened. He suddenly felt as if all the heaven and earth origin energy around him had been sucked out and could no longer be used. At the same time, the power of blood began rapidly fading from his spear. Before his attack had even reached Lin Ming, it had weakened by over 50%.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe power of blood was also the Concept of Blood; it was a branch of the Concept of Life. In the chaos space when the universe was just forming, the heavens and earth hadn’t even been formed yet, so how could there possibly have been life?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Lin Ming’s boundary were to increase some more, he could absolutely cause the Steppes Master’s attacks to vanish. At that point, he wouldn’t even need to fight. Once the Steppes Master entered into his side world, he would lose all combat strength, allowing Lin Ming to freely slaughter him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng peng peng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a thought from Lin Ming, all of the grieving spirits burst apart in the space covered by the Prime Emperor Flower Lotus, turning into nihility. If there was no life, then how could there possibly be spirits?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the moment that the Steppes Master reached Lin Ming, Lin Ming also attacked. His strength was not weakened by the Prime Emperor Lotus Flower. This was because he was the master of this side world. To a certain degree, he had refined grandmist energy and had touched upon the Chaos Laws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA halberd thrust out and a halberd light violently swept forwards. A silver gray spear-shaped battle spirit fused with the halberd, turning the entire Great Desolate Blood Halberd a silver gray color from its original blood red. Its weight became far more terrifying and its attack power rose by a large degree.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter being tempered in grandmist energy, Lin Ming’s battle spirit had gradually transformed from a purely abstract existence and had even taken on some tangible material properties.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Great Desolate Blood Halberd collided with the Steppes Master’s war lance!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere was no fancy explosion. Silver gray light shot out into the air, forming lights like swirling galaxies that came crashing down. An overwhelming momentum followed, magnificent and blinding. A devastating and ruinous energy scattered in all directions as if it would tear apart all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut compared to this light, the Steppes Master’s blood light was much weaker. It melted like pure snow underneath the blazing summer sun and then was completely submerged by Lin Ming’s halberd light.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that moment, all sound in the world seemed to be swallowed up. There was no medium for sound to travel in the grandmist space, thus all sounds vanished into it. There was nothing left but a terrifying energy that rolled up into a storm, sweeping up everyone watching. If this weren’t the Skysplit Tower, but rather an ordinary structure, then the entire place would have been reduced to powder already.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Steppes Master painfully coughed and flew backwards, directly ejected out of the grandmist space. With a faint \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘ka ka ka’ \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003esound, cracks appeared in the war lance he held.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA high-grade heaven-step treasure had broken apart like this!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the Steppes Master looked at his shattered weapon, he felt incredulous. A single attack had ruined his treasure weapon!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Great Desolate Blood Halberd was a Saint artifact rank weapon to begin with; it was far superior to the Steppes Master’s own treasure weapon. With Lin Ming’s battle spirit that had been tempered by grandmist energy fused into the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, it had become incomparably sharp. For it to destroy a treasure weapon in a single blow was no surprise at all!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Steppes Master!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe several Tower Masters and High Lords present paled as they saw the Steppes Master sent flying backwards and his weapon cracking apart. If the Steppes Master were to be defeated here then their fates could be imagined!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut they also didn’t have the courage to escape now. What if the Steppes Master survived and punished them for running?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJust as these thoughts appeared in their minds, the situation on the battlefield had taken a sharp turn from what they originally anticipated would happen. Lin Ming took a step forwards, directly shooting towards the Steppes Master.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBehind Lin Ming, a red lotus bloomed. The majesty and glory of an emperor exuded outwards, causing all the Tower Masters, High Lords, and supervisory deacons to feel like their souls left their bodies in fear!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNobody dared believe that Lin Ming would leave the Blood Slaughter Steppes with an early Revolving Core cultivation, and in just a mere six years, would actually grow to such a degree. He directly faced a two-star and three-star Demon Emperor together and even managed to resist the 10,000 Ghost Soul Devouring Array, beating them all into the ground!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Steppes Master’s pupils shrank as he saw Lin Ming rush towards him. He reached out a hand to grasp the 10,000 Ghost Soul Devouring Array’s array disc. To his horror and dismay, he discovered that the array disc had already lost a great deal of its spiritual power. As for the 10,000 ghosts sealed within it, a single attack from Lin Ming had left a third of them ruined!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e10,000 ghosts did not seem like a high number, but these 10,000 ghosts were completely refined from extreme Emperor level talents that were at the Xiantian realm, Revolving Core realm, Demon King realm, or Fey King realm! Before their deaths, all of the sacrifices for this array disc had been great elites of their era, and after their deaths they were terrifying ghosts. Even a Holy Land could not produce a 10,000 Ghost Soul Devouring Array like this; there was simply no way for them to produce such a great number of talents. But, this was actually not a problem for the Steppes Master. To control the 12 Skysplit Towers was the same as controlling 12 graveyards of geniuses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, such a 10,000 Ghost Soul Devouring Array had been one-third ruined by Lin Ming in a single strike!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“10,000 ghosts, perish forever, explode for me!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Steppes Master crumbled the array disc in his hands, a demented light in his eyes. The remaining several thousand ghosts in the array disc all rushed into Lin Ming’s grandmist space. But, before the ghosts were even able to enter the grandmist space, all of them exploded!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang bang bang bang bang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTerrifying energy currents swept the world. As the present martial artists saw the Steppes Master exterminate the remainder of the 10,000 ghosts, all of them tried to run away. But, there was not enough time!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this enclosed space, a terrifying energy wave overtook them.

Once this move was used, the entire 10,000 Ghost Soul Devouring Array would immediately be destroyed!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng peng peng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e360 array flags began to collapse in unison. Under the control of the Steppes Master, all of that energy fell upon Lin Ming’s grandmist space like a torrential storm. The grandmist space violently trembled, and within that side world, Lin Ming also had to withstand a tremendous pressure.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe grandmist space could wipe away Laws and true essence, but it actually couldn’t withstand an infinite barrage of energy. In that moment, Lin Ming felt that his Prime Emperor Force Field was like a boat in a storm, capable of capsizing at any moment.
