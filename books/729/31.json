{"id":23659,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXX","content":"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; How the men of Chile came forth from the lodging of Don Diego de Almagro, of the death they inflicted on the Marquis Den Francisco Pizarro, and of the valorous spirit he showed before his death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e THERE was much perturbation among the men of Chile when they learnt that the Marquis had suspicions of their secret plotting. They did not know whether any of those whom they reckoned as friends, to curry favour with the Marquis and obtain his goodwill, had betrayed them; and their consultations did not cease. Some were for sallying out to murder the Marquis; others for retiring to the Indians\u0027 villages until the Judge should arrive. Others said that the Marquis suspected them, and that he was seeking some pretext for putting them to a cruel death. Juan de Herrada told them to bring all their arms, and that when the time came he would tell them what to do. The Marquis was in his house in bed, and before he got up a page came to him, and said, \"Sir, all the town says, and it is publicly discussed among the Indians, that the men of Chile will come this morning to[100] murder you!\" The Marquis replied very angrily, \"Be off, you silly boy!\"[56]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I am perfectly astounded, and with very good reason, at the little care and great remissness of the Marquis. He is told that they are coming to murder him in the morning, and he treats it as a joke, as if there were nothing in it. When I think of past events in those kingdoms, as those who may read my books will see, I am astonished, and it seems to me that God, for the sins of the Marquis, weakened his understanding, and willed that he should die a death so cruel as the one he did. I will say that one of the causes that have given rise to troubles and dissensions in this Empire of the Indies, has been the promotion by his Majesty and the high Council of the Indies of illiterate men to the government of provinces, many without the tact or prestige needful for the administration of justice. In ancient times the Romans, who ruled the whole world with their wisdom, did not, on any account, give charge of a government to those who were not learned or acquainted with the laws; for he who has to govern, if he be not prudent, is apt to count everything as nought. I have wished to say this because if the Marquis had been as wise as he was valiant, and as well educated as he was resolute, he would have paid careful attention to the reports that were brought to him, and have known that ten determined men may succeed in an undertaking, although it may require great intrepidity. We read how Philip, King of Macedon, being in his palace, surrounded by his knights and attendants, was stabbed by a principal noble named Pausanias because, in a certain case, he would not do justice. So one can see that, although Philip believed that his death was in question, and had himself guarded in a[101] manner different from the Marquis, yet it happened after all. He knew that the oracle of Apollo at Delphi had given a reply, through the devil, that he would die by reason of a cart, so he gave an order, that throughout his kingdom there should be no waggon or cart, and no vehicle having that name was to be seen in any town in his dominions. In spite of all this care there was a cart engraved upon the sword with which Pausanias killed him. The great Julius Caesar, who ruled the larger part of the world, and had a guard of ten thousand men, was well beloved by all the Roman soldiery, and had the cohorts and urban and preatorian legions on his side; yet was he not murdered in a temple by Brutus, Cassius, and about thirty more, who gave him twenty-three stabs? Besides these, many princes and great lords have been murdered by the hand of some audacious man. These things are certain. How, then, could the Marquis think he was secure and that they were not conspiring to kill him? By my faith! I believe his sins blinded him, and God permitted it, for He wills that His justice shall be clear, and at certain times and in some cases manifests it to men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next day, which was Sunday, the Marquis was spoken to again about the men of Chile being watched, because it was said that they intended to murder him on that very day. Very lukewarmly he told the Doctor Juan Blázquez to arrest the principals among them, and to take precautions. Some want to say that the priest Domingo Ruiz, and Perucho de Aguirre, told this to Juan de Herrada. The Doctor having come to the Marquis, declared that while he held the wand in his hand, the Marquis might rest assured that he would receive no annoyance nor disservice, and that, for his part, he would see to it that the informations were made out that same day. Having said this, the doctor and all the rest who were present went to hear mass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [102]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Those of Chile being assembled in the lodging of Don Diego, one of them named San Millán came in panting for breath and much excited and went up to Juan de Herrada, who had no intention then of carrying out their design on that day. He said, \"What are you doing, when in two hours we shall all be quartered? The Treasurer Alonso de Riquelme has told me this.\" This was a lie, for the Treasurer had said nothing. San Millán invented it, to drive Juan de Herrada into immediate action. The latter rose from his couch, picked up his arms, and there joined in with him the following company:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Juan de Herrada.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Martín de Bilbao.[57]\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Baltasar Gómez.[57]\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Diego de Hoces.[57]\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Juan de Guzmán.[57]\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Pedro de San Millán.[57]\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Juan Sajo (Navarrese).\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Narváez (killed by Pizarro).\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Francisco Nú?ez (of Granada), deserted them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Juan Rodríguez Barragán.[57]\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Porras (of Ciudad-Rodrigo).\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Pedro Cabezas.[57]\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Velázquez.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Bartolomé de Enciso.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Arbolancha[57] (killed Chaves).\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Jerónimo de Almagro.[57]\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Enrique Losa.[57]\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Pineda (Page to Almagro).\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Diego Méndez (murderer of the Inca Manco).\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [103]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e United and brave, these men came forth publicly and openly determined to murder the Marquis or perish in the attempt, believing that he intended to execute justice upon them on that very day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They told off Pedro Picón,[58] a native of Mérida, and Marchena, and Francisco de Chaves to station themselves in the plaza, mounted on horseback. The warlike youth García de Alvarado y Sosa,[59] Martín Carrillo,[58] Peces, Martel,[58] Francisco Coronado[58] of Badajoz, Juan Asturiano, Pedro Navarro, Diego Becerra,[60] and Juan Diente[58] were also in the plot. These were to be on the watch and help the party when they came out. Before the latter started they sent a spy to find out what the Doctor was doing, and how many people had gone to the house of the Marquis, for they already knew that he had not gone to mass. It is even said that the Doctor sent a spy, and that when he entered they all hid themselves inside so that he could not see them. Then, as Montenegro, a resident of Lima, was passing, they hustled him inside by force. He found out what they wanted to do and tried to hinder them, but his words had no effect.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56444.html","bookId":729,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 8:23:30 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 8:23:30 PM"}
