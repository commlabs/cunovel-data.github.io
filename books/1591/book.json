On the run for a murder he didn’t commit, he tries to hide out by selling himself at an auction for love slaves. When a handsome Lycan wolf-shifter, Blayde Balenescu buys him, Ryan thinks his prayers have been answered—only to find out he’s jumped from the frying pan into the fire! Blayde is an intergalactic bounty hunter who’s only after the money Ryan will bring in. When Ryan gets off the transport bringing him to Blayde, however, he’s startled at Blayde’s violent reaction once he touches him. Dominant Blayde has recognized Ryan as his mate, and now Blayde has to figure out not only how he can possibly convince the young man to stay with him, and allow him to teach him proper behavior, but also how he’ll manage to keep Ryan alive long enough to save him from his powerful enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/most-wanted-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-1.jpg","author":"Shannon West","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/most-wanted-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:45 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:22:57 AM"}
