{"id":5028,"no":208,"title":"Chapter 25","content":"\"See there, Stettin,\" Seldon said as the two were taking an early evening stroll in one of Trantor\u0027s residential sectors near Streeling. The older man pointed to debris-assorted refuse jettisoned from passing groundcars or dropped by careless pedestrians-strewn along the walkway. \"In the old days,\" Seldon continued, \"you would never see litter like this. The security officers were vigilant and municipal maintenance crews provided round-the-clock upkeep of all public areas. But, most important, no one would even think of dumping his trash in such a manner. Trantor was our home; we took pride in aa. Now\"-Seldon shook his head sadly, resignedly, and sighed-\"it\u0027s-\" He broke off abruptly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You there, young man!\" Seldon shouted at a ill-kempt fellow who had moments before passed them, going in the opposite direction. He was munching a treat just popped into his mouth; the wrapper had been tossed to the ground without so much as a downward glance. \"Pick that up and dispose of it properly,\" Seldon admonished as the young man eyed him sullenly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Pick it up yourself,\" the boy snarled and then he turned and walked away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"It\u0027s another sign of society\u0027s breakdown, as predicted by your psychohistory, Professor Seldon,\" Palver said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Yes, Stettin. All around us the Empire is falling apart, piece by piece. In fact, it\u0027s already smashed-there\u0027s no turning back now. Apathy, decay, and greed have all played their parts in destroying the once-glorious Empire. And what will take its place? Why-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Here Seldon broke off at the sight of Palver\u0027s face. The younger man seemed to be listening intently-but not to Seldon\u0027s voice. His head was cocked to one side and his face had a far-off look. It was as if Palver were straining to hear some sound inaudible to everyone but himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Suddenly he snapped back to the here and now. With an urgent glance around them, Palver took hold of Seldon\u0027s arm. \"Hari, quick, we must get away. They\u0027re coming .\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \" And then the still evening was broken by the harsh sound of rapidly approaching footsteps. Seldon and Palver spun around, but it was too late; a band of attackers was upon them. This time, however, Hari Seldon was prepared. He immediately swung his cane in a wide arc around Palver and himself. At this, the three attackers-two boys and a girl, all teenage ruffians-laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"So, you\u0027re not goin\u0027 to make it easy, are you, old man?\" snorted the boy who appeared to be the group\u0027s ringleader. \"Why, me and my buddies, we\u0027ll take you out in two seconds flat. We\u0027ll-\" All of a sudden, the ringleader was down, the victim of a perfectly placed Twist-kick to his abdomen. The two ruffians who were still standing quickly dropped to a crouch in preparation for attack. But Palver was quicker. They, too, were felled almost before they knew what hit them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; And then it was over-almost as soon as it started. Seldon stood off to the side, leaning heavily on his cane, shaking at the thought of his narrow escape. Palver, panting slightly from exertion, surveyed the scene. The three attackers were out cold on the deserted walkway under the darkening dome.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Come on, let\u0027s get out of here quickly!\" Palver urged again, only this time it was not the attackers they would be fleeing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Stettin, we can\u0027t leave,\" protested Seldon. He gestured toward the unconscious would-be muggers. \"They\u0027re really nothing more than children. They may be dying. How can we just walk away? It\u0027s inhumane-thatæŠ¯ what it is-and humanity is exactly what I\u0027ve been working all these years to protect \" Seldon struck the ground with his cane for emphasis and his eyes gleamed with conviction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Nonsense,\" retorted Palver. \"What\u0027s inhumane is the way muggers like that prey on innocent citizens like you. Do you think they\u0027d have given you a second thought? They\u0027d just as soon stick a knife in your gut to steal your last credit-and then kick you as they ran! They\u0027ll come to soon enough and slink away to lick their wounds. Or someone will find them and call the central office.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"But, Hari, you must think. After what happened last time, you stand to lose everything if you\u0027re linked to another beating. Please, Hari, we must run!\" With this, Palver grabbed Seldon\u0027s arm and Seldon after a List backward glance, allowed himself to be led away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; As the footsteps of the rapidly departing Seldon and Palver diminished in the distance, another figure emerged from his hiding place behind some trees. Chuckling to himself, the sullen-eyed youth muttered,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re a fine one to tell me what\u0027s right and what\u0027s wrong, Professor \" With that, he spun on his heel and headed off to summon the security officers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46936.html","bookId":169,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:49:58 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:49:58 AM"}
