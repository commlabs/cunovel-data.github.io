But you are not sure?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am not. I dare not.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Am I to travel alone?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For you to decide, Bruthen Trana. But before all else, you must get something-an item-from the Letherii slave. Feather Witch-she hides beneath the Old Palace-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know those tunnels, Warlock King. What is this item?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannan Mosag told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied the twisted warlock for a moment longer-the avid gleam in Hannan Mosag’s eyes bright as fever-then spun round and strode from the chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBearing lanterns, the squad of guards formed a pool of lurid yellow light that glimmered along the waters of Quillas Canal as they trudged, amidst clanking weapons and desultory muttering, across the bridge. Once on the other side, the squad turned right to follow the main avenue towards the Creeper district.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the glow trundled away, Tehol nudged Ublala and they hurried onto the bridge. Glancing back at the half-blood, Tehol scowled, then hissed, ‘Watch me, you fool! See? I’m skulking. No-hunch down, look about suspiciously, skitter this way and that. Duck down, Ublala!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But then I can’t see.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Quiet!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sorry. Can we get off this bridge?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘First, let me see you skulk. Go on, you need to practise.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrumbling, Ublala Pung hunched low, his beetled brow rippling as he looked first one way, then the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nice,’ Tehol said. ‘Now, hurry up and skulk after me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right, Tehol. It’s just that there’s the curfew, and I don’t want trouble.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the other side and Tehol led the way, thirty paces into the wake of the guards, then an abrupt cut to the left, coming within sight of the Tolls Repository. Into an alley, where he crouched, then gestured frantically for Ublala to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right,’ he whispered, ‘do you know which wing?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala blinked in the gloom. ‘What?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you know where this Tarthenal is quartered?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. With all the other champions.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good. Where is that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, it must be somewhere.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good thinking, Ublala. Now, stay close to me. I am, after all, a master of this thieving skulduggery.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Really? But Bugg said-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What? What did my miserable manservant say? About me? Behind my back?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala shrugged. ‘Lots of things. I mean, nothing. Oh, you misheard me, Tehol. I didn’t say anything. You’re not a clumsy oaf with a head full of grander delusions, or anything. Like that.’ He brightened. ‘You want me to box him about the ears again?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Later. Here’s what I think. Near the Imperial Barracks, but a wing of the Eternal Domicile. Or between the Eternal Domicile and the Old Palace.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala was nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So,’ Tehol continued, ‘shall we get going?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Somehow I don’t think this night is going to go well. Never mind, just stay with me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick peek into the street, up one way, down the other, then Tehol moved out, keeping low against the near wall. As they drew closer to the Eternal Domicile, the shadows diminished-lantern poles at intersections, broader streets, and there soldiers positioned at postern gates, outside corner blockhouses, soldiers, in fact, everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol tugged Ublala into the last usable alley, where they crouched once more in gloom. ‘This looks bad,’ he whispered. ‘There’s people, Ublala. Well, listen, it was a good try. But we’ve been bested by superior security and that’s that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They’re all standing in their own light,’ Ublala said. ‘They can’t see nothing, Tehol. Besides, 1 got in mind a diversion.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A diversion like your usual diversions, Ublala? Forget it. Shurq Elalle’s told me about that last time-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, like that. It worked, didn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But that was to get her inside the Gerrun Estate-her, not you. Aren’t you the one who wants to talk to this champion?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s why you’re doing the diversion, Tehol.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Me? Are you mad?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s the only way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard the scuff of boots from the street, then a loud voice: ‘There! Who’s skulking in that alley?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala flinched down. ‘How did he know?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We better run!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey bolted, as a spear of lantern-light lanced across the alley mouth; then, pursued by shouting soldiers, the two fugitives reached the far end of the alley. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-162.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
