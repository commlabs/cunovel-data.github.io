Check it,\" she said, kicking a thumb in the direction of who was fast closing in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker whipped his face toward his fellow assassins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he\u0027d jumped ship; he knew it... and so did they.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker didn\u0027t even flinch, he did what any self-respecting five-point AFTD would do: he called in the undead troops. The ones that he and Nevaeh had inadvertently called when their energy had come together like a bomb of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey poured out from behind every building that was standing, every tree trunk, shed, garage and separator receptacle. They came to his call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Graysheets or, as they were formally known, the Helix Complex assassins, surged forward, the civilians backing away in confusion and various stages of consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operatives saw what waited for them and switched out their guns for handheld flamethrowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Jonesy had been here he could have deactivated their weaponry as it was pulse operated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, he was not and the zombies began to burn. They lost the battle as they won the war through sheer numbers, pushing the front fiery line of the Helix Complex operatives back as the horde surrounded them. A few fell on the assassins as they burned, catching them on fire as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of burning flesh, both living and dead, singed the nose hairs of the gathered, gagging and retching beginning in earnest as the firebomb of combined zombies and operatives roared unabated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZombies were zealots in their rotting hearts. They believed in The Directive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a very handy attack. And unlike Caleb, Parker was pragmatic with his zombies. They were for his use, if they became charred husks... well- there were always more dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed Nevaeh and took off after Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was more advanced than any other AFTD and followed Caleb\u0027s signal of death like a beacon in the deepest part of night, that single sweeping light swinging to pierce Nevaeh and him like a well-timed strobe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the smell of burning flesh behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth living and dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevaeh leaned over, putting her hands on her knees, breathing in high, whistling breaths. \"Parker,\" she called out softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and looked at Nevaeh. Really looked at her, she was pale as a ghost. Parker walked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" she pleaded with him for what was the first time in her life. If she didn\u0027t get some fuel she was gonna die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hungry,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker felt that strange emotion again. It was the second time she\u0027d brought it forward inside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to shake it off. They needed to find Caleb, but he had to take care of her. The woman he had been tasked with murdering. Who might be crazy, though she didn\u0027t seem insane to him. Lonely, scared, defensive... smart. But not a freak. Certainly the Zondoraes wouldn\u0027t be up front with any fact or detail, saying only what suited them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made Jeffrey Parker buzz with life. It was like an electric current with her around. Nevaeh energized him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her face, pinched and pale from strain, thin and angular, a soft triangle surrounded by black hair and striking eyes that were so light they appeared gray, translucent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed again and dropped his gaze, busying himself with opening his small backpack. Parker noticed the fine tremble in his hands when he found the water bottle and two energy bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker hoped she didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevaeh slid down the trunk of a nearby tree, landing on her ass and silently took the water bottle from Parker, along with the bar and tore off a chunk, taking a swig of water that was still cool because of the ambient outdoor temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some chewing and swallowing, devouring the first bar, Nevaeh worked on the second. As she did, she looked around and saw that they had paused in a small valley of cedar trees, the cold snow layering all the areas around them with a drippy white canopy, her breath pluming in front of her in icy puffs. But the seven meter diameter area they rested in was so thick with the intersecting ceiling of treetops that it lay bare and dry, evergreen needles littering the ground in a fragrant blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice here, Parker,\" she said absently, feeling better, trying desperately to distract herself from the magnetic connection between herself and Parker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResisting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he didn\u0027t respond, Nevaeh looked up from her last bite and what she saw there made her drop the water, the remnants gurgling out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnmistakable heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never noticed until that moment that the green of his eyes flickered like banked coals of emerald fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer own desire answered his and before she could stand he was on her, wrapping her in such a tight embrace she didn\u0027t know whether to escape or succumb. She couldn\u0027t think, move or decide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker kissed her like he would eat her soul through her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tasted like oatmeal, cinnamon and female. He breathed her in, sucking at her lips in a tasting contest of time and frantic consumption to which she responded instinctively, her body and soul deciding for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey slid to the ground in a tangle of limbs, hands and seeking mouths and parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir clothes became tossed and strewn about them in seconds, bright swaths of color against the forest floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker held her against him, finding Nevaeh\u0027s heat easily. He stayed suspended above her for a moment, her bare thighs pressed against the outside of his hips in a silken grip of flesh. He slowed above her, his eyes asking a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it, Parker... I want you,\" Nevaeh said with vulnerable surprise in her voice, just as desperate to connect with him as he was with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker entered her and she drove her hips up to meet him in a unity more perfect than death, eclipsing their past in a single sweeping moment of contact that neither anticipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat neither wished to have end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker held her afterward, their heated flesh married from head to hip, her body fitting against his as if by unique design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed the back of her head and felt like crying for the first time in a decade; from joy, which he felt was a shade away from agony in his experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d just complicated shit six ways to Sunday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker was in lust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith love hovering overhead like a vulture over the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, it would find the carrion and when it did, it would devastate them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for now, with the forest their only witness, they clung to each other in hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen none was there to cleave to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too much of a coincidence. That Hamilton or Frazier would be anywhere near any place I would have gone, it was too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde looked around, knowing the past, seeing it through my eyes. It was what he was good at, beyond fighting, speaking and doing, Clyde could vicariously be the other person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hunted, his senses online. He turned to me. \"I do not sense anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would he? Why would I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, we weren\u0027t Empaths, I was AFTD with a dash of Precog. It simply wasn\u0027t enough. I slammed my fist onto the top of a headstone and the granite crumbled, biting into my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be a dumbass, Hart,\" Jonesy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes at that, I needed to find Jade, I couldn\u0027t find her and I knew time was running out. A clock of doom was ticking backwards and I heard every click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when something began to tingle, like the old tales of static electricity, my hair felt like it was actually rising off my nape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade!

You feel me?\" Then he actually did a hip thrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde cuffed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Clyde. \"Can you do that again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy was howling. \"Fuck me, that hurts!
