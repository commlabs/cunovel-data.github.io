I place my hands on her cheeks and force her to look at me. “Layken Cooper, I love you. I’ve loved you since the second I laid eyes on you and I haven’t stopped loving you for a second since. The entire time I was out with Taylor, all I was thinking about was you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crinkles up her nose. “Taylor? I didn’t need to know her name, Will. Now I’ll have a distaste for Taylors for the rest of my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I have distaste for Javiers and Nicks?” I say. She grins, but quickly forces the smile away, still trying to punish me with her ineffective scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re so cute when you’re jealous, babe.” I lean forward and softly press my lips to hers. She sighs a quiet, defeated sigh into my mouth and relents, parting her lips for me. I run my hands down her arms and to her waist, then pull her out of the chair and on top of me as I lean back onto the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI place one hand on the small of her back, pressing her against me, and my other hand I run through her hair, grabbing the back of her head. I kiss her hard as I roll her onto her back, proving to her she has absolutely nothing to be jealous of. As soon as I’m on top of her, she places her hands on my cheeks and forces my face away from hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So your lips touched someone else’s lips? After our first kiss?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fall back onto the bed beside her. “Lake, stop it. Stop thinking about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t, Will.” She turns to me and makes that damn pouty face she knows I can’t refuse. “I have to know details. In my head all I can picture is you taking some girl out on this perfect date and making her grilled cheese sandwiches and playing “would you rather” with her and sharing seriously intense moments with her, then kissing the hell out of her at the end of the night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer description of our first date makes me laugh. I lean over and press my lips to her ear and whisper, “Is that what I did to you? I kissed the hell out of you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls her neck away and shoots me a glare, letting me know she isn’t backing down until she gets her way. “Fine,” I groan, pulling back. “If I tell you all about it will you promise to let me kiss the hell out of you again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Promise,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe other date\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN THE DISMISSAL bell rings, Lake is the first out of the classroom again. The tension in the air between us is so thick, it’s like she has to run outside just to breathe. I walk to my desk and take a seat while the rest of the students file out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Saturday night. Seven o’clock good for you?” Gavin says. I look up at him and he’s staring at me, waiting for a response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For Taylor. We’re going on a double date and Eddie won’t take no for an answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin stares at me for a few seconds, finding it difficult to comprehend my answer. It was a pretty clear no, so I’m not sure what the problem is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please?” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Puppy dog eyes only work on your girlfriend, Gavin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slumps his shoulders and lands in the desk in front of me. “She’s not gonna let it go, Will. Once Eddie gets something in her head, it’s way less painful to just go along with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “No. I’m not going,” I say firmly. “Besides, you’re the one who put this idea in her head. You should have to suffer the consequences, not me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin leans back in his chair and runs his hands over his face, defeated. As soon as I feel victorious, he shoots forward in his seat. “If you don’t go, I’ll tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean back in my chair and glare at him. “You’ll tell what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glances at the door, then back at me, ensuring our privacy. “I’ll go to Principal Murphy and I’ll tell him you went out with a student. I’m sorry it has to come to blackmail, Will, but you don’t know Eddie when she gets an idea in her head. You have to do this for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he really just threaten to blackmail me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up my pen and pull my lesson plan in front of me, breaking eye contact with him. “Gavin, you won’t tell,” I say, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groans at my response, because he knows he would never stoop that low. “You’re right. I’d never tell. But don’t you think you owe it to me for being so trustworthy?” he says. “It’s just one date. One tiny favor. What difference can one date make?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Depending on who it’s with, it can make a huge difference,” I say. One date with Lake was enough to send my life into a tailspin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it helps, you won’t have to do much talking. Taylor and Eddie will completely monopolize the conversation. We can eat our steaks and grunt every few minutes and they’ll be none the wiser. Then it’ll be over. I swear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do owe him a favor. A huge favor. He’s the only one who knows about my situation with Lake and he’s never once given me flak about it. I don’t know how Eddie can get her way when she’s not even in the room, but I finally relent. I slap my pen down on the desk and sigh, giving him a stern look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” I say. “Under one condition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want this to get back to Lake. Tell Eddie I’ll go, but give her an excuse to keep her quiet. Tell her I’m not supposed to be hanging out with you two after hours or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin stands and gathers his things. “Thank you, Will,” he says. “You’re a lifesaver. And hey, you might even like Taylor. Keep an open mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI WALK INTO the restaurant and spot the three of them in a booth in the far corner. I take a deep breath, then grudgingly walk toward them. I can’t believe I’m going on a date. A date that’s not with Lake, the only girl I want to be on a date with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl I can’t be on a date with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin’s words, “keep an open mind,” linger in my head. I’ve been completely consumed by thoughts of Lake since I met her almost three weeks ago. I’ve made the right choice by not continuing something that could ruin my career, but now I just need to figure out how to accept that choice and get her out of my head. Maybe Gavin’s right. Maybe I do need to try to move on. It could be better for both of us this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Gavin spots me, he waves and stands up, prompting Taylor to turn around. She’s . . . cute. Really cute. Her hair is darker than Lake’s and shorter, but it fits her well. She’s not as tall as Lake, either. She’s got a great smile; one of those that seems to be permanently affixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach the table and smile back at her. Might as well give this a shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will, Taylor. Taylor, Will,” Gavin says, gesturing between us. She smiles and stands up, then gives me a quick hug. General greetings pass around the table and we take our seats. It’s odd sitting on the same side of the booth with her. I don’t know if I should turn toward her or give my attention to Eddie and Gavin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” she says. “Gavin says you’re a teacher?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “Student teacher. Until December graduation, anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re graduating in December?” she asks, taking a sip of her soda. “How? Isn’t that a semester early?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress walks up to the table and hands me a menu, interrupting the short conversation. “What can I get you to drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll have a sweet tea,” I say. The waitress nods and walks away, then Eddie nudges Gavin and pushes his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, guys, but . . . something just came up,” Eddie says. Gavin stands up and pulls his wallet out of his pocket, throwing some cash down on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This should cover our drinks. You can take Taylor home, right?” he says to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something came up, huh?” I ask, glaring at both of them. I can’t believe they’re doing this. I’m so going to fail them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, yeah,” Eddie says, taking Gavin’s hand. “So sorry we can’t stay. You two have fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they’re gone. Just like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor laughs. “Wow. That wasn’t obvious,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn back to her and she’s grinning, shaking her head. Now it really feels odd sitting in the same side of the booth with her. “Well,” I say. “This is . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both say “awkward” at the same time, which causes us to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you mind if . . .” I point to the other side of the booth and she shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, please. I’ve never been a same-side-of-the-booth girl. It’s weird.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I agree,” I say, scooting into the seat across from her. The waitress brings my drink and takes our order. It gives us about thirty seconds of distraction before she walks away again, leaving us to fend for ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor lifts her glass up, motioning to mine. “To awkward first dates,” she says. I pick my glass up and clink it against hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, before all that,” she says, waving her hand in the air. “We were talking about how you were graduating a semester early?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah . . .” I pause. I don’t really feel like going into detail about the real reasons I’m graduating early. I lean back in the booth and shrug. “When I want something, I guess I just focus until I get it. Tunnel vision,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods. “Impressive. I’ve still got a year left, but I’m going into teaching, too. Primary. I like kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur conversation begins to flow better. We talk about college for a while, then when the food comes we talk about that. Then when we run out of things to talk about, she brings up her family. I let her talk about them, but I don’t divulge. By the time the bill comes, the conversation is far from awkward. I’ve only thought about Lake ten times. Maybe fifteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything seems okay until we’re in the car, backing out of the parking lot. Seeing her sitting in the passenger seat, staring out the window; it’s reminiscent of just a few weeks ago when Lake was doing the exact same thing, in this exact same spot. But it doesn’t feel anything like that. That night with Lake I couldn’t keep my eyes off of her while we drove and she slept, her hand still locked with mine. I’m not one to believe that there is only one person right for me in the world. But the tug and pull Lake has on me, even when she isn’t in my presence, it makes it feel like she’s the most right for me. As much as I think Taylor and I would hit it off on a second date, I’m not so sure I’ll ever be able to settle for anything less than what I feel for Lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe make more small talk and she directs me toward her house. When we pull up into the driveway, the awkwardness immediately sets in. I don’t want to lead her on at all, but I also don’t want her to think she did anything wrong to turn me off. She was great. The date was great. It’s just that my date with Lake was so much more, and now I want nothing less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the car in park and, as awkward as this is going to be, I offer to walk her to her door. When we reach the patio, she turns around and looks up at me with an inviting and welcoming look on her face. This is the point where I need to be honest with her. I don’t want to get her hopes up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/this-girl-slammed-3/page-16.html","bookId":2781,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:24:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:24:07 PM"}
