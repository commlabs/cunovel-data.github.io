Even before the echoes of breaking glass had died, figures in black uniforms were swarming through the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark ninjas, Keller thought. An elite group made up of vampires and shapeshifters, the Night World experts at sneaking and killing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller\u0027s mind, which had been roiling in clouds of stifled anger, was suddenly crystal clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nissa, take her!\" she shouted. It was all she needed to say. Nissa grabbed Diana. It didn\u0027t matter that Iliana was screaming breathlessly and too shocked to want to go anywhere. Nissa was a vampire and stronger than a human Olympic weight lifter. She simply picked Iliana up and ran with her toward the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout being told, Winfrith followed close behind, orange energy already sizzling between her palms. Keller knew she would provide good cover-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinnie was a fighting witch. She made full use of the new powers that all the Night People were developing as the millennium got closer. As one of the ninjas lunged after them, she let loose with a blast of poppy-colored energy that knocked him sideways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you!\" Keller shouted to Galen, trying to hustle him into the hallway without turning from the ninjas. She hadn\u0027t changed and didn\u0027t want to if she could avoid it. Changing took time, left you vulnerable for the few seconds that you were between forms. Right now seconds counted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen got a few steps down the hall, then stopped. \"Grandma Harman!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it, Keller thought. He\u0027s a liability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman was still in the living room, standing with her feet braced apart, cane ready. Her apprentice, Toby, was in front of her, working up some witch incantation and tossing energy. They were right in the flow of the ninjas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was as it ought to be. Keller\u0027s mind had clicked through the possibilities right at the beginning and had come to the only reasonable conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to leave her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen turned to her, his face lit by the multicolored energy that was flying around them. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s too slow! We have to protect you and Hiana. Get moving!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis features were etched in shock. \"You\u0027re joking. Just wait here-I\u0027ll bring her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Galen-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already running back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller cursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on!\" she yelled to Nissa and Winnie, who were at the entrance to the kitchen, where the back door was. \"Take the limo if you can get to it. Don\u0027t wait for us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she turned and plunged into the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen was trying to shield Grandma Harman from the worst of the energy being exchanged. Keller gritted her teeth. This group of ninjas was only the first wave. They were here to breach the wards and make an opening for whatever was going to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich could be a dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ninjas hadn\u0027t finished their job, though. Most of the wards were holding, and the one that had fallen was on a small window. The dark figures could only squirm in one at a time. The house shook as whoever was outside slammed power at it, trying to break a bigger entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaintly, Keller heard an engine rev up outside. She hoped it was the limo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen was pulling at Grandma Harman. Toby was grappling hand-to-hand with a ninja.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller batted a couple of the sneaks out of her way. She wasn\u0027t trying to kill them, just put them out of commission. She had almost reached Galen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she heard the rumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly her panther ears could have picked it up. Just as the first time when she\u0027d heard it, it was so deep that it seemed both soft and frighteningly loud. It shook her to her bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flash, she knew what was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was no time to think about what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen seemed to have sensed it, too. Keller saw him looking at the roof just above the door. Then he turned toward Grandma Harman, shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, everything happened at once. Galen knocked the old woman down and fell on top of her. At the same time, Keller sprang and landed on top of both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was changing even as she did it. Changing and spreading herself out, trying to make herself as wide and flat as possible. A panther rug to cover them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brick wall exploded just as the window had, only louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShattered with Power, Keller thought. The dragon had recovered... fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it was raining bricks. One hit Keller in the leg, and she lashed her tail in fury. Another struck her back, and she felt a deep pain. Then one got her in the head, and she saw white light. She could hear Galen shouting under her. It seemed to be her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething wet touched her face. Keller hissed automatically, pawing at it in annoyance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lemme lone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boss, wake up. Come on, it\u0027s morning already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller opened heavy eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was dreaming. She had to be. Either that, or the afterlife was full of teenage girls. Winnie was bending over her with a dripping washcloth, and Nissa was peering critically over her shoulder. Behind Nissa was Iliana\u0027s anxious little heart-shaped face, her hair falling like two shimmering curtains of silvery-starlight gold on either side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller blinked. \"I was sure I was dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you got close,\" Winnie said cheerfully. \"Me and Toby and Grandma Harman have been working on you most of the night. You\u0027re going to be kind of stiff, but I guess your skull was too thick to crack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller sat up and was rewarded with a stabbing pain in her temples. \"What happened? Where\u0027s Galen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, golly gee, Boss, I didn\u0027t know you cared-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop fooling around, Winnie! Where\u0027s the guy who\u0027s got to be alive if the shapeshifters are going to join Circle Daybreak?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinnie sobered. Nissa said calmly, \"He\u0027s fine, Keller. This is Iliana\u0027s house. Everybody\u0027s okay. We got you guys out-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller frowned, struck by a new worry. \"You did? Why? I told you to take the girl and go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNissa raised an eyebrow wryly. \"Yes, well, but the girl didn\u0027t want to go. She made us stop and turn back for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Galen,\" Keller said. She looked at Diana, who was wearing a pink nightgown with puffy sleeves and looked about seven. She tried to make her voice patient. \u0027It was good to think of him, but you should have followed the plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, it worked out,\" Nissa said. \"Apparently, the dragon blew the house down on top of you, but then he walked right over you trying to get to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I was kind of hoping he wouldn\u0027t realize\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen was there,\" Keller said. \"Or wouldn\u0027t realize he was important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, when he found we\u0027d already gotten away in the limo, he and his buddies took after us in cars,\" Winnie said. \"But Nissa lost them. And then Iliana... insisted, and so we circled back. And there you were. Galen and Toby were digging you out. We helped them and brought you here.\" \"What about Grandma Harman?\" \"She came out of it without a scratch. She\u0027s tougher than she looks,\" Winnie said. \"She talked to Iliana\u0027s mom last night,\" Nissa added. \"She fixed everything up so we can stay here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re supposed to be a distant cousin, and the rest of us are your friends. We\u0027re from Canada. We graduated last year, and we\u0027re touring the U.S. by bus. We ran into Iliana last night, and that\u0027s why she was late. It\u0027s all covered, nice and neat.\" \"It\u0027s all ludicrous,\" Keller said. She looked at Iliana. \"And it\u0027s time to stop. Haven\u0027t you seen enough yet? That\u0027s twice you\u0027ve been attacked by a monster. Do you really want to try your luck for a third time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a mistake. Iliana\u0027s face had been sweet and anxious, but now Keller could see the walls slam down. The violet eyes hazed over and sparked at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody attacked me until you guys came!\" Iliana flared. \"In fact, nobody\u0027s attacked me so far at all. I think it\u0027s you people they\u0027re after-or maybe Galen. I keep telling you that I\u0027m not the one you\u0027re looking for.\" This was the time for diplomacy, but Keller was too exasperated to think. \"You don\u0027t really believe that. Unless you practice being stupid-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop calling me stupid!\" The last word was a piercing shriek. At the same time, Diana threw something at Keller. She batted it out of the air automatically before it could hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not stupid! And I\u0027m not your Witch Child or whatever you call it! I\u0027m just a normal kid, and I like my life. And if I can\u0027t live my life, then I don\u0027t want to-to do anything.\" She whirled around and stalked out, her nightgown billowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller stared at the missile she\u0027d caught. It was a stuffed lamb with outrageously long eyelashes and a pink ribbon tied around its white neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNissa folded her arms. \"Well, you sure handled that one, Boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a break.\" Keller tossed the lamb onto the window seat. \"And just how did she make you two turn around and come back for us, by the way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinnie pursed her lips. \"You heard it. Volume control. She kept screaming like-well, I don\u0027t know what screams like that. You\u0027d be surprised how effective it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re agents of Circle Daybreak; you\u0027re supposed to be immune to torture.\" But Keller dropped the subject. \"What are you still hanging around for?\" she added, as she swung her feet out of bed and carefully tried her legs. \"You\u0027re supposed to stick with her, even when she\u0027s in the house. Don\u0027t stand here staring at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome for putting you back together again,\" Winnie said, her eyes on the ceiling. In the doorway, she turned and added, \"And, you know, it wasn\u0027t Galen she kept screaming we had to go back and get last night. It was you, Keller.\" Keller stared at the door as it shut, bewildered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t go to school,\" Keller hissed. \"Do you hear me? You cannot go to school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all sitting around the kitchen table. Iliana\u0027s mother, a lovely woman with a knot of platinum hair coiled on her neck, was making breakfast. She seemed slightly anxious about her four new houseguests, but in a pleasantly excited way. She certainly wasn\u0027t suspicious. Grandma Harman had done a good job of brainwashing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to have a wonderful Christmas,\" she said now, and her angelic smile grew brighter. \"We can go into Winston-Salem for a Christmas and Candle Tea. Have you ever had a Moravian sugar-cake? I just wish Great-aunt Edgith had been able to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandma Harman was gone. Keller didn\u0027t know whether to be relieved or frustrated. Despite what she kept saying, as long as the old woman was around, Keller would worry about her. But with her gone, there was nobody to appeal to, nobody who could order Iliana into safekeeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now they were sitting and having this argument. It looked like such a normal breakfast scene, Keller thought dryly. Iliana\u0027s father had already left for work. Her mother was bustling around cheerfully. Her little brother was in a high chair making a mess with Cheerios. Too bad that the four nicely dressed teenagers at the table were actually two shapeshifters, a witch, and a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen was directly opposite Keller. There were shadows under his eyes-had anyone gotten any sleep last night?-and he seemed subdued but relaxed. Keller hadn\u0027t had a chance to speak to him since the dragon\u0027s attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that she had anything to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orange juice, Kelly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you, Mrs. Dominick.\" That was what this family thought their last name was. They didn\u0027t realize that witches trace their heritage through the female line and that both Iliana and her mother were therefore Harmans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, please, call me Aunt Anna,\" the woman said. She had her daughter\u0027s violet eyes and the smile of an angel. She was also pouring Keller juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I see where Iliana gets her scintillating intelligence, Keller thought. \"Oh-thanks, Aunt Anna. And, actually, it\u0027s Keller, not Kelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How unusual. But it\u0027s nice, so modern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my last name, but that\u0027s what everybody calls me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really? What\u0027s your first name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller broke off a piece of toast, feeling uncomfortable. \"Raksha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s beautiful! Why don\u0027t you use it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller shrugged. \"I just don\u0027t.\" She could see Galen looking at her. Shapeshifters usually were named for their animal forms, but neither Keller nor Raksha fit the pattern. \"I was abandoned as a kid,\" she said in a clipped voice, looking back at Galen. Diana\u0027s mother wouldn\u0027t be able to make anything of this, but she might as well satisfy the princeling\u0027s curiosity. \"So I don\u0027t know my real last name. But my first name means \u0027demon.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s mother paused with the juice carton over Nissa\u0027s glass. \"Oh. How... nice. Well, then, I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked a couple of times and walked off without pouring Nissa any juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what does Galen mean?\" Keller said, holding his gaze challengingly and handing her full glass to Nissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled-a little wryly-for the first time since sitting down. \" \u0027Calm.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller snorted. \"It figures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like Raksha better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller didn\u0027t answer. With \"Aunt Anna\" safely in the kitchen, she could speak again to Diana. \"You understood before, right? That you can\u0027t go to school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go to school.\" For somebody who looked as if she were made of spun glass, Diana ate a lot. She spoke around a mouthful of microwave pancake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s out of the question. How can we go with you? What are we supposed to be, for Goddess\u0027s sake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My long-lost cousin from Canada and her friends,\" Diana said indistinctly. \"Or you can all be exchange students who\u0027re here to study our American educational system.\" Before Keller could say anything, she added, \"Hey, how come you guys aren\u0027t at school? Don\u0027t you have schools?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got the same ones you do,\" Winnie said. \"Except Nissa-she graduated last year. But Keller and I are seniors like you. We just take time off for this stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet your grades are as bad as mine,\" Diana said unemotionally. \"Anyway, I have to go to school this week. There are all sorts of class parties and things. You can come. It\u0027ll be fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller wanted to hit her with the pot of grits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a problem, though. Iliana\u0027s little brother Alex had escaped from his high chair and was climbing up her leg. She looked down at him uneasily. She wasn\u0027t good with family-type things, and she especially wasn\u0027t good with children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said. \"Go on back and sit down.\" She peeled him off and tried to start him in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around and put his arms up. \"Kee-kee. Kee-kee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s his word for \u0027kitty,\u0027\" Iliana\u0027s mother said, coming in with a plate of sausages. She ruffled his white-blond hair. \"You mean Kelly, Kelly,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Keller, Keller!\" Winnie corrected helpfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex climbed into Keller\u0027s lap, grabbed her hair, and hoisted himself into a standing position. She found herself looking into huge violet baby eyes. Witch eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kee-kee,\" he said flatly, and gave her a sloppy kiss on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinnie grinned. \"Having trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid had two chubby arms around Keller\u0027s neck now and was nudging her chin with his head like a kitten looking for pets. He had a good grip, too. This time, she couldn\u0027t peel him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just-distracting,\" she said, giving up and petting him awkwardly. It was ridiculous. How could she argue with baby giggles in her ears?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look kind of sweet together,\" Iliana observed. Tm getting dressed for school now. You guys can do whatever you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe floated off while Keller was trying to think of a reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNissa and Winnie hastily followed her. Galen got up to help Iliana\u0027s mother with the dishes. Keller tugged at the baby, who clung like a sloth. Maybe there was shapeshifter blood in this family. \"Kee-kee... pui!\" That was what it sounded like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pwee?\" Keller glanced nervously at his diaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He means \u0027pretty\" Iliana\u0027s mother said, coming back in. \"It\u0027s funny. He doesn\u0027t usually take to people like that. He likes animals better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Well, he has good taste,\" Keller said. She finally succeeded in detaching him and gave him back to his mother. Then she started down the hallway after Iliana, muttering, \"Too bad about his eyesight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think his eyesight\u0027s just fine,\" Galen said, right behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller turned, realizing they were alone in the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis faint smile faded. \"I really wanted to talk to you,\" he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-witchlight-night-world-9/page-6.html","bookId":2082,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:28 PM"}
