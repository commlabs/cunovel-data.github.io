Live a little Connor, take that girl to bed and show her your sexiness.” I wanted to die right there, in the leather seat of Connors range rover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unexpectedly shouted, “I already did and she was amazing, she made me do things to her that even shocked me.” I hit him on the arm and shot him a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Woo, you go girl, we’ll swap notes when you get back. I have to go, Dr. Hottie is summoning me back to bed,” she giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up and shook my head at him, “How could you tell her that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh please love, like you haven’t embarrassed me before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t argue with that, especially with the bartender at the restaurant and then the bellhop. I laughed and looked out the window at the all too familiar place I was heading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pulled into the funeral home and instantly, my stomach felt sick. I got out of the car and took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the same funeral home we had for my mother and father,” I said as I stood in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor put his arm around me. “You don’t have to do this; you can call your cousin and tell her you got sick or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, that’s the coward’s way out. I can’t escape reality. Besides, I have you with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked through the doors. My cousin Debbie saw me and swiftly walked towards me as we hugged each other tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so sorry for your loss Debbie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to cry on my shoulder. “I know and I’m sorry for you to; I know they were like your surrogate parents growing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened?” She asked as she pointed to my stitches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s no big deal; I just fell and hit my head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over at Connor, “Debbie this is my friend Connor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook his hand and then whispered to me, “I heard you and Kyle broke up, I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, “I’m not, but thank you anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led us to the room where my aunt and uncle laid in their beautiful wooden caskets. I walked over and kneeled down in front of them, praying to god to keep them safe. Connor stood behind me with his hands clutching my shoulders. I stood up and made my way through the crowd, saying hi to old friends and making small conversation with distant family. I could hear the whispers of people talking about my attempted suicide seven years ago. I could hear the pity in their voices. The whispers went on about my dad; how he was an alcoholic and couldn’t stop drinking enough to raise his only daughter. They went on to say that if my mother was alive I would not have tried to take my life. I had become the center of attention at someone’s funeral, and I was starting to get pissed. Connor overheard the soft talks as he put his arm around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t listen to them; they don’t know what they’re talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took in a deep breath, but couldn’t control myself any longer when I heard a woman say, “She’s the one who tried to commit suicide to save herself from her alcoholic father. He was too wrapped up in the death of her mother to even realize she existed. She should have been taken away from him and then she wouldn’t have tried to…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could finish her sentence, I rudely interrupted her, “Who the f**k do you think you are talking about my father and family like that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed my wrists in her face, “Here, see the scars. That’s right, take a good look at them, it wouldn’t have mattered if they took me away or not, they would still be there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole room was standing in silence staring at me. Connor grabbed my hand, “Come on baby let’s go. It’s not worth it.” I turned as he led me out of the funeral home. The cold air cooled my burning skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I must say, you can put on quite a show,” Connor smiled to lighten my mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, I just couldn’t take anymore; I knew this was going to happen if I came back here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held me and whispered, “Its ok, you’ve said your goodbyes to your aunt and uncle, you told off a few people, and now we can go; unless you want to stay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “No, let’s get out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hopped back into the Range Rover as Connor searched for hotels on his GPS. “If you’re looking for luxury then I suggest the Athenuem Suite Hotel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at me and smiled, “Funny; that’s what my phone is telling me. I can reserve the Presidential Suite right here online.” He did just that and then took my hand. “Where do you want to go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brought his hand to my lips and gently kissed it. “I need to go visit my mom and dad’s grave; it’s not too far.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe punched the address in his GPS as we headed toward the cemetery. I asked if we could make a quick stop at the flower shop so I could pick up some flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrived at the cemetery. I directed Connor where to park to make it easier to get to their graves. We got out of the car. I took his hand and led him to where my parents were buried. The air was brisk for the end of September. I remembered warmer days this time of year. We walked to the graves for my mother and father that sat side by side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My father made sure to buy the plot next to where my mother was buried because that way they could be together forever. He loved my mother very much and he considered her his soul mate; that’s why when she died, a part of him died with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor knelt beside me and kissed me on the head, “That’s beautiful.” I put the flowers on my mother’s grave first and then my fathers. Connor got up, “I’m going to give you some privacy,” he said as he walked a few feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down on the grass and placed the flowers on each grave. “Hi mom, hi dad, I cannot believe it’s been over a year since I’ve visited you last. A lot has changed in the past year. I moved to New York and started selling my paintings in a small art gallery. I met an incredible guy there; in fact he’s here with me now. I know you’d like him daddy. He’s sweet, charming, kind, really sexy, and I believe he would do anything for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned in closer to their graves and whispered; I love him mom and dad, for the first time in my life I’m truly in love. We’re leaving Michigan tomorrow, so I wanted to stop by and say hi and let you know I’m doing well.” Tears swelled in my eyes. Connor walked over and put his hands on my shoulders. “I love both of you very much, and I miss you.” He helped me up as I took in a deep breath and composed myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor took me in his arms and held me. “You’re far too young to have experienced so much death Ellery; it hurts me to know what you’ve been through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest started to tighten, and panic started to settle in. I needed to tell him my secret, but I was too scared about how he was going to react. I couldn’t lose him, not now, I loved him too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood with me and stared at my parent’s grave. “I can’t even imagine losing my parents, especially at such a young age. You amaze me Ellery with your strength because I don’t know if I could have made it through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let go of him and bent down to pull some weeds that were surrounding the grave area. “That’s something you decide whether or not you’re going to do. You can move on and try to live your life as normal as possible, or you can make the decision to let go of life and let sorrow consume you. I’m a big believer of fate, and I believe god took my dad so his pain and suffering could stop, and he could be with my mother again.” He stroked my hair and ran his finger along my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re amazing, and I don’t know what I did to deserve to have you in my life.” I kissed his cool lips and smiled as we walked back to the Range Rover and headed for the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrived at the hotel and took the elevator up to the Grand Room. I was getting use to this Presidential Suite thing. Connor went to the fireplace and turned it on. I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his waist. “You feel so good,” I said as I took in his scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not as good as you feel baby,” he whispered as he buried his nose in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dance with me,” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beautiful smile graced his face. “I would love to dance with you, but let me put on some music first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked over to the small stereo that sat on a table by the window. He walked back to me and wrapped his arms around my waist. We held each other and slowly moved to the soft melody coming from the radio. He stared into my eyes as he leaned in and brushed my lips with his. My hands moved up and down his back as our soft kiss turned passionate and we gently made love by the fire. We laid there, staring into each other; our nak*d bodies wrapped in a blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you hungry?” He asked as he kissed my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For you, yes,” I smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled as he stroked my cheek with his soft fingers, “I am always hungry for you, but we will eventually have to eat real food. I hate to break it to you baby, but we can’t survive on sex alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to tickle me as I laughed and tried to grab his hands. He finally stopped when I said ouch because my eye started to hurt. He softly kissed my stitches before getting up and ordering room service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t too long before room service was delivered as we got up and got dressed. “Are you feeling ok Elle? You look a little pale?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine sweetie; I’m just tired, and I think I have you to blame for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed me his sexy smile. “If I recall, you were the one who did all the work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed as I got up from my seat and held out my hand, “Would you care to join me for a hot bath Mr. Black?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would love to Miss Lane, just not too hot; I don’t want you passing out.” I snickered as we walked to the large marbled bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathtub was large enough for 4 people. Connor started the water and got in as I removed my robe and twisted my hair up so it didn’t get wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn you are so sexy,” he smiled as I walked towards the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not as sexy as you are,” I smiled as I slid in the tub and leaned my back against his firm chest. He put his arms around me and we laid there, taking in the warmth of the water and the softness of our wet skin. He softly kissed my neck. “I love it when you wear your hair up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that so?” I smiled as he continued to plant small delicate kisses down my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no idea how bad I wanted you that night of the charity. I did everything I could to restrain myself and not take you in the bathroom and have my way with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lightly rubbed his arm with my fingers, “I wish you would have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you don’t, I would have been too rough, and I might have scared you off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can never scare me off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my head, so I was facing him, “Infinity is forever, and that is what you are to me, you are my forever Mr. Black.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed my lips, “There\u0027s no limit to what I wouldn\u0027t do for you. Just ask and it will be done, no matter the sacrifice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI traced his lips with my fingers, “Those are the most beautiful words anyone has ever said to me.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-black-forever-1/page-17.html","bookId":1821,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:11 PM"}
