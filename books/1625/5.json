He\u0027s killed him! And right up there in front of everyone!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagrat held on desperately to her colleague\u0027s arm as she struggled to get to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027He\u0027s not dead!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you calling me a liar, my girl?\u0027 snapped Granny. \u0027I saw it all!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Look, Granny, it\u0027s not really real, d\u0027you see?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny Weatherwax subsided a little, but still grumbled under her breath. She was beginning to feel that things were trying to make a fool of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp on the stage a man in a sheet was giving a spirited monologue. Granny listened intently for some minutes, and then nudged Magrat in the ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s he on about now?\u0027 she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He\u0027s saying how sorry he was that the other man\u0027s dead,\u0027 said Magrat, and in an attempt to change the subject added hurriedly, \u0027There\u0027s a lot of crowns, isn\u0027t there?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny was not to be distracted. \u0027What\u0027d he go and kill him for, then?\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, it\u0027s a bit complicatedâ€”\u0027 said Magrat, weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s shameful!\u0027 snapped Granny. \u0027And the poor dead thing still lying there!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagrat gave an imploring look to Nanny Ogg, who was masticating an apple and studying the stage with the glare of a research scientist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I reckon,\u0027 she said slowly, \u0027I reckon it\u0027s all just pretendin\u0027. Look, he\u0027s still breathing.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the audience, who by now had already decided that this commentary was all part of the play, stared as one man at the corpse. It blushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And look at his boots, too,\u0027 said Nanny critically. \u0027A real king\u0027d be ashamed of boots like that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corpse tried to shuffle its feet behind a cardboard bush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny, feeling in some obscure way that they had scored a minor triumph over the purveyors of untruth and artifice, helped herself to an apple from the bag and began to take a fresh interest. Magrat\u0027s nerves started to unknot, and she began to settle down to enjoy the play. But not, as it turned out, for very long. Her willing suspension of disbelief was interrupted by a voice saying:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s this bit?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagrat sighed. \u0027Well,\u0027 she hazarded, \u0027he thinks that he is the prince, but he\u0027s really the other king\u0027s daughter, dressed up as a man.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny subjected the actor to a long analytical stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He is a man,\u0027 she said. \u0027In a straw wig. Making his voice squeaky.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagrat shuddered. She knew a little about the conventions of the theatre. She had been dreading this bit. Granny Weatherwax had Views.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, but,\u0027 she said wretchedly, \u0027it\u0027s the Theatre, see. All the women are played by men.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They don\u0027t allow no women on the stage,\u0027 said Magrat in a small voice. She shut her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, there was no outburst from the seat on her left. She risked a quick glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny was quietly chewing the same bit of apple over and over again, her eyes never leaving the action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t make a fuss, Esme,\u0027 said Nanny, who also knew about Granny\u0027s Views. \u0027This is a good bit. I reckon I\u0027m getting the hang of it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone tapped Granny on the shoulder and a voice said, \u0027Madam, will you kindly remove your hat?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny turned around very slowly on her stool, as though propelled by hidden motors, and subjected the interrupter to a hundred kilowatt diamond-blue stare. The man wilted under it and sagged back on to his stool, her face following him all the way down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered the options. \u0027All right,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny turned back and nodded to the actors, who had paused to watch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re staring at,\u0027 she growled. \u0027Get on with it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanny Ogg passed her another bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have a humbug,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence again filled the makeshift theatre except for the hesitant voices of the actors, who kept glancing at the bristling figure of Granny Weatherwax, and the sucking sounds of a couple of boiled humbugs being relentlessly churned from cheek to cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Granny said, in a piercing voice that made one actor drop his wooden sword, \u0027There\u0027s a man over on the side there whispering to them!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He\u0027s a prompter,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027He tells them what to say.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t they know?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I think they\u0027re forgetting,\u0027 said Magrat sourly. \u0027For some reason.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny nudged Nanny Ogg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s going on now?\u0027 she said. \u0027Why\u0027re all them kings and people up there?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s a banquet, see,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg authoritatively. \u0027Because of the dead king, him in the boots, as was, only now if you look, you\u0027ll see he\u0027s pretending to be a soldier, and everyone\u0027s making speeches about how good he was and wondering who killed him.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are they?\u0027 said Granny, grimly. She cast her eyes along the cast, looking for the murderer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was making up her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer black shawl billowed around her like the wings of an avenging angel, come to rid the world of all that was foolishness and pretence and artifice and sham. She seemed somehow a lot bigger than normal. She pointed an angry finger at the guilty party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He done it!\u0027 she shouted triumphantly. \u0027We all seed \u0027im! He done it with a dagger!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe audience filed out, contented. It had been a good play on the whole, they decided, although not very easy to follow. But it had been a jolly good laugh when all the kings had run off, and the woman in black had jumped up and did all the shouting. That alone had been well worth the ha\u0027penny admission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three witches sat alone on the edge of the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I wonder how they get all them kings and lords to come here and do this?\u0027 said Granny, totally unabashed. \u0027I\u0027d have thought they\u0027d been too busy. Ruling and similar.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No,\u0027 said Magrat, wearily. \u0027I still don\u0027t think you quite understand.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, I\u0027m going to get to the bottom of it,\u0027 snapped Granny. She got back on to the stage and pulled aside the sacking curtains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You!\u0027 she shouted. \u0027You\u0027re dead!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe luckless former corpse, who was eating a ham sandwich to calm his nerves, fell backwards off his stool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny kicked a bush. Her boot went right through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027See?\u0027 she said to the world in general in a strangely satisfied voice. \u0027Nothing\u0027s real! It\u0027s all just paint, and sticks and paper at the back.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027May I assist you, good ladies?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a rich and wonderful voice, with every diphthong gliding beautifully into place. It was a golden brown voice. If the Creator of the multiverse had a voice, it was a voice such as this. If it had a drawback, it was that it wasn\u0027t a voice you could use, for example, for ordering coal. Coal ordered by this voice would become diamonds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt apparently belonged to a large fat man who had been badly savaged by a moustache. Pink veins made a map of quite a large city on his cheeks; his nose could have hidden successfully in a bowl of strawberries. He wore a ragged jerkin and holey tights with an aplomb that nearly convinced you that his velvet-and-vermine robes were in the wash just at the moment. In one hand he held a towel, with which he had clearly been removing the make-up that still greased his features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know you,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027You done the murder.\u0027 She looked sideways at Magrat, and admitted, grudgingly, \u0027Leastways, it looked like it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So glad. It is always a pleasure to meet a true connoisseur. Olwyn Vitoller, at your service. Manager of this band of vagabonds,\u0027 said the man and, removing his moth-eaten hat, he treated her to a low bow. It was less an obeisance than an exercise in advanced topology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hat swerved and jerked through a series of complex arcs, ending up at the end of an arm which was now pointing in the direction of the sky. One of his legs, meanwhile, had wandered off behind him. The rest of his body sagged politely until his head was level with Granny\u0027s knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, well,\u0027 said Granny. She felt that her clothes had grown a bit larger and much hotter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I thought you was very good, too,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027The way you shouted all them words so graciously. I could tell you was a king.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I hope we didn\u0027t upset things,\u0027 said Magrat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My dear lady,\u0027 said Vitoller. \u0027Could I begin to tell you how gratifying it is for a mere mummer to learn that his audience has seen behind the mere shell of greasepaint to the spirit beneath?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I expect you could,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027I expect you could say anything, Mr Vitoller.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe replaced his hat and their eyes met in the long and calculating stare of one professional weighing up another. Vitoller broke first, and tried to pretend he hadn\u0027t been competing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And now,\u0027 he said, \u0027to what do I owe this visit from three such charming ladies?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact he\u0027d won. Granny\u0027s mouth fell open. She would not have described herself as anything much above \u0027handsome, considering\u0027. Nanny, on the other hand, was as gummy as a baby and had a face like a small dried raisin. The best you could say for Magrat was that she was decently plain and well-scrubbed and as flat-chested as an ironing board with a couple of peas on it, even if her head was too well stuffed with fancies. Granny could feel something, some sort of magic at work. But not the kind she was used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Vitoller\u0027s voice. By the mere process of articulation it transformed everything it talked about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook at the two of them, she told herself, primping away like a couple of ninnies. Granny stopped her hand in the process of patting her own iron-hard bun, and cleared her throat meaningfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027d like to talk to you, Mr Vitoller.\u0027 She indicated the actors, who were dismantling the set and staying well out of her way, and added in a conspiratorial whisper, \u0027Somewhere private.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Dear lady, but of a certain,\u0027 he said. \u0027Currently I have lodgings in yonder esteemed watering hole.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witches looked around. Eventually Magrat risked, \u0027You mean in the pub?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was cold and draughty in the Great Hall of Lancre Castle, and the new chamberlain\u0027s bladder wasn\u0027t getting any younger. He stood and squirmed under the gaze of Lady Felmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ve got them all right. Lots.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And people don\u0027t do anything about them?\u0027 said the duchess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chamberlain blinked. \u0027I\u0027m sorry?\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027People tolerate them?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, indeed,\u0027 said the chamberlain happily. \u0027It\u0027s considered good luck to have a witch living in your village. My word, yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chamberlain hesitated. The last time he had resorted to a witch it had been because certain rectal problems had turned the privy into a daily torture chamber, and the jar of ointment she had prepared had turned the world into a nicer place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They smooth out life\u0027s little humps and bumps,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where I come from, we don\u0027t allow witches,\u0027 said the duchess sternly. \u0027And we don\u0027t propose to allow them here. You will furnish us with their addresses.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Addresses, ladyship?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where they live. I trust your tax gatherers know where to find them?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ah,\u0027 said the chamberlain, miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe duke leaned forward on his throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I trust,\u0027 he said, \u0027that they do pay taxes?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not, exactly pay taxes, my lord,\u0027 said the chamberlain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence. Finally the duke prompted, \u0027Go on, man.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, it\u0027s more that they don\u0027t pay, you see. We never felt, that is, the old king didn\u0027t think . . . Well, they just don\u0027t.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe duke laid a hand on his wife\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I see,\u0027 he said coldly. \u0027Very well. You may go.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chamberlain gave him a brief nod of relief and scuttled crabwise from the hall. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-5.html","bookId":1625,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:49 PM"}
