What failures?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The latest shipment of poor quality war materiel failed to arrive this side of the mountains, Atri-Preda. Furthermore, brigands struck a major fortress in the pass, routing the Letherii company stationed there.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What? I have heard nothing of this! An entire company routed?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So it seems. Alas, that was the extent of the information provided me. Apart from the weapons, I was unsure what other items the Factor lost in that shipment. If, as you tell me, there was nothing more of consequence to fall into the hands of the brigands, then I am somewhat relieved.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither spoke for a time. Brohl Handar was aware that the Atri-Preda’s thoughts were racing, perhaps drawn into a tumult of confusion-uncertainty at how much Brohl knew, and by extension the Tiste Edur, regarding Letherii illegalities; and perhaps greater unease at the degree to which she herself had remained ignorant of recent events in Bluerose. That she’d been shaken told him she was not as much an agent of Letur Anict as he had feared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided he had waited long enough. Atri-Preda, this imminent war with the Awl. Tell me, have you determined the complement of forces you feel will be necessary to effect victory?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, visibly shifting the path of her thinking to address his question. ‘More or less, Overseer. We believe that the Awl could, at best, field perhaps eight or nine thousand warriors. Certainly not more than that. As an army, they are undisciplined, divisive due to old feuds and rivalries, and their style of combat is unsuited to fighting as a unit. So, easily broken, unprepared as they are for any engagement taking longer than perhaps a bell. Generally, they prefer to raid and ambush, keeping to small troops and striving to remain elusive. At the same time, their almost absolute dependency on their herds, and the vulnerability of their main camps, will, inevitably, force them to stand and fight-whereupon we annihilate them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A succinct preface,’ Brohl Handar said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To answer you, we possess six companies of the Bluerose Battalion and near full complement of the reformed Artisan Battalion, along with detachments from the Drene Garrison and four companies from the Harridict Brigade. To ensure substantial numerical superiority, I will request the Crimson Rampant Brigade and at least half of the Merchants’ Battalion.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do yau anticipate that this Redmask will in any way modify the tactics employed by the Awl?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. He did not do so the first time. The threat he represents lies in his genius for superior ambushes and appallingly effective raids, especially on our supply lines. The sooner he is killed, the swifter the end of the war. If he succeeds in evading our grasp, then we can anticipate a long and bloody conflict.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Atri-Preda, I intend to request three K’risnan and four thousand Edur warriors.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Victory will be quick, then, Overseer, for Redmask will not be able to hide for long from your K’risnan.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Precisely. I want this war over as soon as possible, and with minimal loss of life-on both sides. Accordingly, we must kill Redmask at the first opportunity. And shatter the Awl army, such as it is.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You wish to force the Awl to capitulate and seek terms?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Overseer, I will accept capitulation. As for terms, the only ones I will demand are complete surrender. The Awl will be enslaved, one and all. They will be scattered throughout the empire but nowhere near their traditional homelands. As slaves, they will be booty, and the right to pick first will be the reward I grant my soldiers.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The fate of the Nerek and the Fent and the Tarthenal.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Even so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The notion does not sit well with me, Atri-Preda. Nor will it with any Tiste Edur, including the Emperor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Let us argue this point once we have killed Redmask, Overseer.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grimaced, then nodded. ‘Agreed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrohl Handar silently cursed this Redmask, who had single-handedly torn through his hopes for a cessation of hostilities, for an equitable peace. Instead, Letur Anict now possessed all the justification he needed to exterminate the Awl, and no amount of tactical genius in ambushes and raids would, in the end, make any difference at all. It is the curse of leaders to believe they can truly change the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA curse that has even afflicted me, it seems. Am I too now a slave to Letur Anict and those like him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rage within him was the breath of ice, held deep and overlong, until its searing touch burned in his chest. Upon hearing the copper-face Natarkas’s last words, he rose in silent fury and stalked from the hut, then stood, eyes narrowed, until his vision could adjust to the moonless, cloud-covered night. Nearby, motionless as carved sentinels of stone, stood his K’Chain Che’Malle guardians, their eyes faintly glowing smudges in the darkness. As Redmask pushed himself into motion, their heads turned in unison to watch as he set off through the encampment. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-76.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
