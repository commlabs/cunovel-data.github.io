Moiraine reached over and gently squeezed Tam’s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTam looked at the corpse, gazing down into his son’s face by the fire’s light. He did not wipe the tears from his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou did well. My boy . . . you did so well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lit the pyre with a reverent hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin stood at the front of the crowd. She watched Tam, with slumped shoulders, bow his head before the flames. Eventually the man walked back to join the Two Rivers folk. Abell Cauthon embraced him, whispering softly to his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeads in the night, shadows, turned toward Min, Aviendha and Elayne. They expected something from the three of them. A show of some sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolemnly, Min stepped forward with the other two; Aviendha needed the help of two Maidens to walk, though she was able to stand by leaning on Elayne. The Maidens withdrew to leave the three of them alone before the pyre. Elayne and Min stood with her, watching the fire burn, consuming Rand’s corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’ve seen this\", Min said. \"I knew it would come the day I first met him. We three, together, here\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne nodded. \"So now what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now . . \". Aviendha said. \"Now we make sure that everyone well and truly believes he is gone\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin nodded, feeling the pulsing throb of the bond in the back of her mind. It grew stronger each moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand al’Thor—just Rand al’Thor—woke in a dark tent by himself. Someone had left a candle burning beside his pallet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe breathed deeply, stretching. He felt as if he’d just slept long and deep. Shouldn’t he be hurting? Stiff? Aching? He felt none of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached to his side and felt no wounds there. No wounds. For the first time in a long while, there was no pain. He almost didn’t know what to make of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he looked down and saw that the hand prodding his side was his own left hand. He laughed, holding it up before him. A mirror, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need a mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found one beyond the next partition of the tent. Apparently, he’d been left completely alone. He held up the candle, looking into the small mirror. Moridin’s face looked back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand touched his face, feeling it. In his right eye hung a single saa, black, shaped like the dragon’s fang. It didn’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand slipped back into the portion of the tent where he’d awakened. Laman’s sword was there, sitting atop a neat pile of mixed clothing. Alivia apparently hadn’t known what he would want to wear. She had been the one to leave these things, of course, along with a bag of coins from a variety of nations. She hadn’t ever cared much for either clothing or coin, but she had known he’d need both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe will help you die. Rand shook his head, dressing and gathering the coins and the sword, then slipping out of the tent. Someone had left a good horse, a dappled gelding, tied not far away. That would do him well. From Dragon Reborn to horsethief. He chuckled to himself. Bareback would have to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. Nearby, in the darkness, people were singing. This was Shayol Ghul, but not as he remembered it. A blooming Shayol Ghul, full of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe song they sang was a Borderlander funeral song. Rand led the horse through the night to get a little closer. He peered between the tents to where three women stood around a funeral pyre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoridin, he thought. He’s being cremated with full honors as the Dragon Reborn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand backed away, then mounted the dapple. As he did so, he noticed one figure who was not standing by the fire. A solitary figure, who looked toward him when all other eyes were turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadsuane. She looked him up and down, eyes reflecting firelight from the glow of Rand\u0027s pyre. Rand nodded, waited for a moment, then turned the horse and heeled it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadsuane watched him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, she thought. Those eyes had confirmed her suspicions. That would be information she could use. No need to keep watching this sham of a funeral, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked away through the camp, and there strolled directly into an ambush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saerin\", she said as the women fell in around her. \"Yukiri, Lyrelle, Rubinde. What is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would like direction\", Rubinde said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Direction?\" Cadsuane snorted. \"Ask the new Amyrlin, once you find some poor woman to put into the position\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other women continued to walk with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it hit her, Cadsuane stopped in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, blood and ashes, no!\" Cadsuane said, spinning on them. \"No, no, no\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women smiled in an almost predatory way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always talked so wisely to the Dragon Reborn of responsibility\", Yukiri said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak of how the women of this Age need better training\", Saerin added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a new Age\", Lyrelle said. \"We have many challenges ahead of us . . . and we will need a strong Amyrlin to lead us\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadsuane closed her eyes, groaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand breathed a sigh of relief as he left Cadsuane behind. She did not raise an alarm, though she had continued to study him as he put distance between them. Glancing over his shoulder, he noticed her walking off with some other Aes Sedai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe worried him; she probably suspected something he wished she did not. It was better than her raising an alarm, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, fishing in his pocket, where he found a pipe. Thank you, Alivia, for that, he thought, packing it with tabac from a pouch he found in the other pocket. By instinct, he reached for the One Power to light it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found nothing. No saidin in the void, nothing. He paused, then smiled and felt an enormous relief. He could not channel. Just to be certain, he tentatively reached for the True Power. Nothing there either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe regarded his pipe, riding up a little incline to the side of Thakan dar, now covered in plants. No way to light the tabac. He inspected it for a moment in the darkness, then thought of the pipe being lit. And it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand smiled and turned south. He glanced over his shoulder. All three women at the pyre had turned from it to look directly at him. He could make them out, though not much else, by the light of the burning body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder which of them will follow me, he thought, then smiled deeper. Rand al’Thor, you’ve built up quite a swelled head, haven’t you? Assuming that one, or more, would follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe none of them would. Or maybe all of them would, in their own time. He found himself chuckling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich would he pick? Min . . . but no, to leave Aviendha? Elayne. No. He laughed. He couldn’t pick. He had three women in love with him, and didn’t know which he would like to have follow him. Any of them. All of them. Light, man. You’re hopeless. Hopelessly in love with all three, and ther \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-309.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
