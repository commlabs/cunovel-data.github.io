Robert Neville\u0027s footsteps thudded hollowly up the marble steps of the Los Angeles Public Library. It was April 7, 1976.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt had come to him, after a half week of drinking, disgust, and desultory investigation, that he was wasting his time. Isolated experiments were yielding nothing, that was clear. If there was a rational answer to the problem (and he had to believe that there was), he could only find it by careful research.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTentatively, for want of better knowledge, he had set up a possible basis, and that was blood. It provided, at least, a starting point. Step number one, then, was reading about blood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe silence of the library was complete save for the thudding of his shoes as he walked along the second-floor hallway. Outside, there were birds sometimes and, even lacking that, there seemed to be a sort of sound outside.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eInexplicable, perhaps, but it never seemed as deathly still in the open as it did inside. a building.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEspecially here in this giant, gray-stoned building that housed the literature of a world\u0027s dead. Probably it was being surrounded by walls, he thought, something purely psychological. But knowing that didn\u0027t make it any easier. There were no psychiatrists left to murmur of groundless neuroses and auditory hallucinations. The last man in the world was irretrievably stuck with his delusions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe entered the Science Room.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was a high-ceilinged room with tall, large-paned windows. Across from the doorway was the desk where books had been checked out in days when books were still being checked out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there for a moment looking around the silent room, shaking his head slowly. All these books, he thought, the residue of a planet\u0027s intellect, the scrapings of futile minds, the leftovers, the potpourri of artifacts that had no power to save men from perishing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis shoes clicked across the dark tiles as he walked to the beginning of the shelves on his left. His eyes moved to the cards between the shelf sections. \"Astronomy,\" he read; books about the heavens. He moved by them. It was not the heavens he was concerned about. Man\u0027s lust for the stars had died with the others. \"Physics,\" \"Chemistry,\" \"Engineering.\" He passed them by and entered the main reading section of the Science Room.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and looked up at the high ceiling. There were two banks of dead lights overhead and the ceiling was divided into great sunken squares, each square decorated with what looked like Indian mosaics. Morning sunlight filtered through the dusty windows and he saw motes floating gently on the current of its beams.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down the row of long wooden tables with chairs lined up before them. Someone had put them in place very neatly. The day the library was shut down, he thought, some maiden librarian had moved down the room, pushing each chair against its table. Carefully, with a plodding precision that was the cachet of herself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about that visionary lady. To die, he thought, never knowing the fierce joy and attendant comfort of a loved one\u0027s embrace. To sink into that hideous coma, to sink then into death and, perhaps, return to sterile, awful wanderings. All without knowing what it was to love and be loved.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat was a tragedy more terrible than becoming a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. All right, that\u0027s enough, he told himself, you haven\u0027t got the time for maudlin reveries.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe bypassed books until he came to \"Medicine.\" That was what he wanted. He looked through the titles. Books on hygiene, on anatomy, on physiology (general and specialized), on curative practices. Farther down, on bacteriology.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out five books on general physiology and several works on blood. These he stacked on one of the dust-surfaced tables. Should he get any of the books on bacteriology? He stood a minute, looking indecisively at the buckram backs.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFinally he shrugged. Well, what\u0027s the difference? he thought. They can\u0027t do any harm. He pulled out several of them at random and added them to the pile. He now had nine books on the table. That was enough for a start. He expected he\u0027d be coming back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs he left the Science Room, he looked up at the clock over the door.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe red hands had stopped at four-twenty-seven. He wondered what day they had stopped. As he descended the stairs with his armful of books, he wondered at just what moment the clock had stopped. Had it been morning or night? Was it raining or shining? Was anyone there when it stopped?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe twisted his shoulders irritably. For God\u0027s sake, what\u0027s the difference? he asked himself. He was getting disgusted at this increasing nostalgic preoccupation with the past. It was a weakness, he knew, a weakness he could scarcely afford if he intended to go on. And yet he kept discovering himself drifting into extensive meditation on aspects of the past. It was almost more than he could control, and it was making him furious with himself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t get the huge front doors open from the inside, either; they were too well locked. He had to go out through the broken window again, first dropping the books to the sidewalk one at .a time, then himself. He took the books to his car and got in.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs he started the car, he saw that he was parked along a red-painted curb, facing in the wrong direction on a one-way street. He looked up and down the street.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Policeman!\" he found himself calling. \"Oh, police- man!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed for a mile without stopping, wondering just what was so funny about it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe put down the book. He\u0027d been reading again about the lymphatic system. He vaguely remembered reading about it months before, during the time he now called his \"frenzied period.\" But what he\u0027d read had made no impression on him then because he\u0027d had nothing to apply it to.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere seemed to be something there now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe thin walls of the blood capillaries permitted blood plasma to escape into the tissue spaces along with the red and colorless cells. These escaped materials eventually returned to the blood system through the lymphatic vessels, carried back by the thin fluid called lymph.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDuring this return flow, the lymph trickled through lymph nodes, which interrupted the flow and filtered out the solid particles of body waste, thus preventing them from entering the blood system.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere were two things that activated the lymphatic system: (1) breathing, which caused the diaphragm to compress the abdominal contents, thus forcing blood and lymph up against gravity; (2) physical movement, which caused skeletal muscles to compress lymph vessels, thus moving the lymph. An intricate valve system prevented any backing up of the flow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut the vampires didn\u0027t breathe; not the dead ones, anyway. That meant, roughly, that half of their lymph flow was cut off. This meant, further, that a considerable amount of waste products would be left in the vampire\u0027s system.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRobert Neville was thinking particularly of the fetid odor of the vampire.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe read on.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The bacteria passes into the blood stream, where...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"... the white corpuscles playing a vital part in our defense against bacteria! attack.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Strong sunlight kills many germs rapidly and\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Many bacterial diseases of man can be disseminated by the mechanical agency of flies, mosquitoes\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"... where, under the stimulus of bacterial attack, the phagocytic factories rush extra cells into the blood stream.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe let the book drop forward into his lap and it slipped off, his legs and thumped down on the rug.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was getting harder and harder to fight, because no matter what he read, there was always the relationship between bacteria and blood affliction.. Yet, all this time, he\u0027d been letting contempt fall freely on all those in the past who had died proclaiming the truth of the germ theory and scoffing at vampires.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and made himself a drink. But it sat untouched as he stood before the bar. Slowly, rhythmically, he thudded his right fist down on the top of the bar while his eyes stared bleakly at the wall.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGerms.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe grimaced. Well, for God\u0027s sake, he snapped jadedly at himself, the word hasn\u0027t got thorns, you know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath. All right, he ordered himself, is there any reason why it couldn\u0027t be germs?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away from the bar as if he could leave the question there. But questions had no location; they could follow him around.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe sat in the kitchen staring into a steaming cup of coffee. Germs. Bacteria. Viruses. Vampires. Why am I so against it? he thought. Was it just reactionary stubbornness, or was it that the task would loom as too tremendous for him if it were germs?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know. He started out on a new course, the course of compromise. Why throw out either theory? One didn\u0027t necessarily negate the other. Dual acceptance and correlation, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBacteria could be the answer to the vampire.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEverything seemed to flood over him then.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was as though he\u0027d been the little Dutch boy with his finger in the dike, refusing to let the sea of reason in. There he\u0027d been, crouching and content with his iron-bound theory. Now he\u0027d straightened up and taken his finger out. The sea of answers was already beginning to wash in.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe plague had spread so quickly. Could it have done that if only vampires had spread it?. Could their nightly marauding have propelled it on so quickly?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe felt himself jolted by the sudden answer. Only if you accepted bacteria could you explain the fantastic rapidity of the plague, the geometrical mounting of victims.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved aside the coffee cup, his brain pulsing with a dozen different ideas.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe flies and mosquitoes had been a part of it. Spreading the disease, causing it to race through the world.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, bacteria explained a lot of things; the staying in by day, the coma enforced by the germ to protect itself from sun radiation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA new idea: What if the bacteria were the strength of the true vampire?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a shudder run down his back. Was it possible that the same germ that killed the living provided the energy for the dead?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe had to know! He jumped up and almost ran out of the house. Then, at the last moment, he jerked back from the door with a nervous laugh. God\u0027s sake, he thought, am I going out of my mind? It was nighttime.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned and walked restlessly around the living room.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCould it explain the other things? The stake? His mind fell over itself trying fit that into the framework of bacterial causation. Come on! he shouted impatiently in his mind. But all he could think of was hemorrhage, and that didn\u0027t explain that woman. And it wasn\u0027t the heart....\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe skipped it, afraid that his new-found theory would start to collapse before he\u0027d established it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe cross, then. No, bacteria couldn\u0027t explain that. The soil; no, that was no help. Running water, the mirror, garlic...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe felt himself trembling without control and he wanted to cry cut loudly to stop the runaway horse of his brain. He had to find something! Goddamn it! he raged in his mind. I won\u0027t let it go!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe made himself sit down. Trembling and rigid, he sat there and blanked his mind until calm took over. Good Lord, he thought finally, what\u0027s the matter with me? I get an idea, and when it doesn\u0027t explain everything in the first minute, I panic. I must be going crazy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe took that drink now; he needed it. He held up his it shaking. All right, little boy, he tried kidding himself, calm down now. Santa Claus is coming to town with all the nice answers. No longer will you be a weird Robinson Crusoe, imprisoned on an island of night surrounded by oceans of death.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe snickered at that, and it relaxed him. Colorful, he thought, tasty. The last man in the world is Edgar Guest.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll right, then, he ordered himself, you\u0027re going to bed. You\u0027re not going to go flying off in twenty different directions. You can\u0027t take that any more; you\u0027re an emotional misfit.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe first step was to get a microscope. That is the first step, he kept repeating forcefully to himself as he undressed for bed, ignoring the tight ball of indecision in his stomach, the almost painful craving to plunge directly into investigation without any priming.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe almost felt ill, lying there in the darkness and planning just one step ahead. He knew it had to be that way, though. That is the, first step, that is the first step. Goddamn your bones, that is the first step.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned in the darkness, feeling good about the definite work ahead.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne thought on the problem he allowed himself before sleeping. The bitings, the insects, the transmission from person to person—were even these enough to explain the horrible speed with which the plague spread?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe went to sleep with the question in his mind. And, about three in the morning, he woke up to find the house buffeted by another dust storm. And suddenly, in the flash of a second, he made the connection.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/376/988.html","bookId":308,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:57:56 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:57:56 AM"}
