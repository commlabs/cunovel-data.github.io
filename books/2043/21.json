Maybe Master Jameson had a twin who wasn\u0027t a fanatic who hated vampires. No. The video didn\u0027t lie. Only the Alchemists did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t ignore this. I couldn\u0027t wait. I needed to resolve this immediately. If not sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sent Marcus a text as soon as my plane was on the ground: We meet tonight. No games. No runaround. TONIGHT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no response from him by the time I got back to my dorm. What was he doing? Reading Catcher in the Rye again? If I\u0027d known what dive he was holed up in, I would\u0027ve marched over there right then. There was nothing I could do but wait, so I called Ms. Terwilliger both as a distraction and to buy some freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing to report,\" she told me when she answered. \"We\u0027re still just watching and waiting - although, your extra charm is almost complete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not why I\u0027m calling,\" I said. \"I need you to get me a curfew extension tonight.\" I felt bad using her for something totally unrelated, but I had to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? Are you paying me an unexpected visit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er - no. This is for something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clearly thought that was funny. \"Now you use my assistance for personal matters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think I\u0027ve earned it?\" I countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, something I hadn\u0027t heard from her in a while. She agreed to my request and promised to call the dorm\u0027s front desk right away. As soon as we hung up, my phone chimed with the expected message from Marcus. All the text contained was an address that was a half hour away. Assuming he was ready for me now, I grabbed my messenger bag and got on the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn light of my past meetings with Marcus, I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised if he\u0027d led me to a department store or karaoke bar. Instead, I arrived at a vintage music shop, the kind that sold vinyl records. A large CLOSED sign hung on the door, emphasized by dark windows and an empty parking lot. I got out of my car and double-checked the address, wondering if my GPS had led me astray. My earlier zeal gave way to nervousness. How careless was this? One of Wolfe\u0027s first lessons was to avoid sketchy situations, yet here I was, exposing myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, from the shadows, I heard my name whispered. I turned toward the sound and saw Sabrina materialize out of the darkness, carrying a gun as usual. Maybe if I showed her the one in my glove compartment, we could have a bonding moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go around back,\" she said. \"Knock on the door.\" Without another word, she returned to the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back of the building looked like the kind of place that screamed mugging, and I wondered if Sabrina would come to my aid if needed. I knocked on the door, half expecting some kind of speakeasy situation where I\u0027d be asked for a password like \"rusted iguana.\" Instead, Marcus opened the door, ready with one of those smiles he kept hoping would win me over. Strangely, tonight it put me at ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, gorgeous, come on in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped past him and found we were in the store\u0027s back room, which was filled with tables, shelves, and boxes of records and cassette tapes. Wade and Amelia stood against a wall in mirrored stances, their arms crossed over their chests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus shut the door behind me and locked it. \"Glad to see you back in one piece. Judging from your text - and your face - you found something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the rage I\u0027d been holding in since my discovery came bursting out. I retrieved my laptop from my bag and had to resist the urge to slam it against a table. \"Yes! I can\u0027t believe it. You were right. Your insane, far-fetched theory was right. The Alchemists have been lying! Or, well, some of them. I don\u0027t know. Half of them don\u0027t know what the other half\u0027s doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expected some smug remark from Marcus or at least an \"I told you so.\" But that handsome face was drawn and sad, reminding me of the picture I\u0027d seen of him and Clarence. \"Damn,\" he said softly. \"I was kind of hoping you\u0027d come back with a bunch of boring video. Amelia, go swap with Sabrina. I want her to see this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia looked disappointed to be sent away, but she didn\u0027t hesitate to obey his order. By the time Sabrina came back in, I had the video cued up to the correct time. They gathered around me. \"Ready?\" I asked. They nodded, and I could see a mix of emotions in all of them. Here it was, the conspiracy theory they\u0027d all been waiting to prove. At the same time, the implications were staggering, and the three of them were well aware of how dangerous what they were about to see could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI played the video. It was only a few seconds long, but they were powerful ones as that bearded figure appeared on the screen. I heard an intake of breath from Sabrina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s him. Master Jameson.\" She looked between all our faces. \"That\u0027s really the Alchemist place? He\u0027s really there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Wade. \"And that\u0027s Dale Hawthorne with him, one of the directors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat triggered a memory. \"I know that name. He\u0027s one of Stanton\u0027s peers, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it possible she wouldn\u0027t know about a visit like this?\" I asked. \"Even at her level?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Marcus who answered. \"Maybe. Although, walking him right in there - even to the secure level - is pretty ballsy. Even if she doesn\u0027t know about the meeting, it\u0027s a safe bet others do. If it were completely shady, Hawthorne would\u0027ve met him off-site. Of course, the secure list means this wasn\u0027t out in the open either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, it was possible Stanton hadn\u0027t lied to me - well, at least not about the Alchemists being in contact with the Warriors. She\u0027d certainly lied about the Alchemists knowing about Marcus since he\u0027d said he was a notorious figure to most higher-ups. Even if she was ignorant about Master Jameson, it didn\u0027t change the fact that other Alchemists - important ones - were keeping some dangerous company. Maybe I didn\u0027t always like their procedures, but I\u0027d desperately wanted to believe they were doing good in the world. Maybe they were. Maybe they weren\u0027t. I just didn\u0027t know anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I dragged my eyes from the frozen frame of Master Jameson, I found Marcus watching me. \"Are you ready?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked over to another table and returned with a small case. When he opened it, I saw a small vial of silver liquid and a syringe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is - oh.\" Realization hit me. \"That\u0027s the blood that\u0027ll break the tattoo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Pulling the elements out creates a reaction that turns it silver. It takes a few years, but eventually, the gold in your skin will fade to silver too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of them were looking at me expectantly, and I took a step back. \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m ready for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wait?\" asked Marcus. He pointed at the laptop. \"You\u0027ve seen this. You know what they\u0027re capable of. Can you keep lying to yourself? Don\u0027t you want to go forward with your eyes open?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well . . . yes, but I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m ready to have some strange substance injected into me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus filled the syringe with the silver liquid. \"I can demonstrate on my tattoo if it\u0027ll make you feel better. It won\u0027t hurt me, and you can see that there aren\u0027t any dire side effects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know for sure that they\u0027ve done anything to me,\" I protested. He had a logical argument, but I was still terrified of taking this step. I could feel my hands shaking. \"This could be a waste. There may be no group loyalty compulsion in me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you also don\u0027t know for sure,\" he countered. \"And there\u0027s always a little loyalty put in the initial tattoo. I mean, not enough to make you some slave robot, but still. Wouldn\u0027t you feel better knowing everything\u0027s gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t take my eyes off the needle. \"Will I feel any different?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Although you could walk up to someone on the street and start telling them about vampires.\" I couldn\u0027t tell if he was joking or not. \"Then you\u0027d just get thrown into a psych ward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I ready for this? Was I really going to take the next step into becoming part of Marcus\u0027s Merry Men? I\u0027d passed his test - which he\u0027d been right about. Clearly, this group wasn\u0027t useless. They had eyes on the Alchemists and the Warriors. They also seemingly had the Moroi\u0027s best interests at heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Moroi - or, more specifically, Jill. I hadn\u0027t forgotten Sabrina\u0027s offhand remark about the Warriors being interested in a missing girl. Who else could it be but Jill? And did this Hawthorne guy have access to her location? Had he passed it on to Master Jameson? And would this information put those around her at risk, like Adrian?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were questions I didn\u0027t have the answers to, but I had to uncover them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. \"Do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus didn\u0027t waste any time. I think he was afraid I\u0027d change my mind - which, perhaps, was not an unfounded fear. I sat down in one of the chairs and tipped my head to the side so that he\u0027d have access to my cheek. Wade gently held my head with his hands. \"Just to make sure you stay still,\" he told me apologetically\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Marcus started, I asked, \"Where\u0027d you learn to do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face had been solemn with the task ahead, but my question made him smile again. \"I\u0027m not technically tattooing you, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re worried about,\" he said. I was actually worried about a lot of things. \"These are just some small injections, just like being re-inked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the process itself? How\u0027d you find out about it?\" It was probably a question I should have asked before I sat down in this chair. But I hadn\u0027t expected to be doing this so soon - or suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Moroi friend of mine theorized about it. I volunteered to be a guinea pig, and it worked.\" He switched to business mode again and held up the needle. \"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, feeling like I was standing on the edge of a precipice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurt about as much as re-inking did, just a number of small pricks on my skin. Uncomfortable, but not really painful. In truth, it wasn\u0027t a long process, but it felt like it took forever. All the while, I kept asking myself, What are you doing? What are you doing? At last, Marcus stepped back and regarded me with shining eyes. Sabrina and Wade smiled too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go,\" Marcus said. \"Welcome to the ranks, Sydney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took my compact out of my purse to check the tattoo. My skin was pink from the needle\u0027s piercing, but if this process continued to be like re-inking, that irritation would fade soon. Otherwise, the lily looked unchanged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also didn\u0027t feel that changed on the inside. I didn\u0027t want to storm the Alchemist facility and demand justice or anything like that. Taking him up on his dare to tell an outsider about vampires was probably my best bet to see if my tattoo had been altered, but I didn\u0027t really feel like doing that either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" Marcus said. \"Once we get it sealed, you won\u0027t have to worry about - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not getting it sealed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll those smiles vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus looked confused, as though he might have misheard. \"You have to. We\u0027re going to Mexico next weekend. Once that\u0027s done, the Alchemists won\u0027t ever be able to get to you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not getting it sealed,\" I repeated. \"And I\u0027m not going to Mexico.\" I gestured toward my laptop. \"Look what I was able to pull off! If I stay where I\u0027m at, I can keep finding out more. I can find out what else the Alchemists and Warriors are doing together.\" I can find out if Jill is in danger. \"Getting permanently marked and becoming an outcast kills all those opportunities for me. There\u0027s no going back after that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Marcus almost always got his way, and this new development totally threw him off. Wade took up the argument. \"There\u0027s no going back now. You\u0027re leaving a trail of bread crumbs. Look at what you\u0027ve done. You already made inquiries about Marcus. Even if you haven\u0027t gotten super-friendly with the Moroi, the Alchemists still know you spend a lot of time with them. And one day, someone may realize you were there when the data was stolen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one knows it was stolen,\" I said promptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hope they don\u0027t,\" corrected Wade. \"These little things are enough to raise red flags. Keep doing more, and you\u0027ll make it worse. They\u0027ll finally notice you, and that\u0027s when it\u0027ll be over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus had recovered from his initial shock. \"Exactly. Look, if you want to stay where you\u0027re at until we go to Mexico, that\u0027s fine. Make your peace with it or whatever. After that, you need to escape. We\u0027ll keep working from the outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do whatever you want.\" I began packing up my laptop. \"I\u0027m going to work from the inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus caught hold of my arm. \"You\u0027re setting yourself up for a fall, Sydney!\" he said sternly. \"You\u0027re going to get caught.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled away from him. \"I\u0027ll be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone makes mistakes,\" said Sabrina, speaking up for the first time in a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take that risk.\" I slung my bag over my shoulder. \"Unless you guys are going to forcibly stop me?\" None of them answered. \"Then I\u0027m going. I\u0027m not afraid of the Alchemists. Thank you for everything you\u0027ve done. I really do appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" said Marcus at last. He shook his head at Wade, who looked like he wanted to protest. \"For getting the data. I honestly didn\u0027t think you\u0027d be able to pull it off. I figured you\u0027d return empty-handed, though I still would\u0027ve broken the tattoo for you. A for effort, you know. Instead, you just proved what I\u0027d thought before: you\u0027re remarkable. We could really use you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you know how to get in touch with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you know how to get in touch with us,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll be here all week if you change your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the door. \"I won\u0027t. I\u0027m not running away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia called goodbye to me when I got into my car, oblivious to the fact that I\u0027d just defied her beloved leader. As I drove back to Amberwood, I was amazed at how free I felt - and it had nothing to do with the tattoo. It was the knowledge that I had defied everyone - the Alchemists, the Warriors, the Merry Men. I didn\u0027t answer to anyone, no matter the cause. I was my own person, able to take my own actions. It wasn\u0027t something I had a lot of experience with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was about to do something drastic. I hadn\u0027t told Marcus and the gang because I\u0027d been afraid they really would stop me. When I got back to Amberwood, I went straight to my room and dialed Stanton. She answered on the first ring, which I took as a divine sign that I was doing the right thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Sage, this is unexpected. Did you enjoy the services?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"They were very enlightening. But that\u0027s not why I\u0027m calling. We have a situation. The Warriors of Light are looking for Jill.\" I wasn\u0027t going to waste any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why on earth would they do that?\" She sounded legitimately surprised, but if there was one thing in all of this that I believed wholeheartedly, it was that the Alchemists were exceptional liars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they know if Jill\u0027s whereabouts got out, it could throw the Moroi into chaos. Their focus is still on the Strigoi, but they wouldn\u0027t mind seeing thing go bad for the Moroi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" I always wondered if she paused to gather her thoughts or if it was simply for effect. \"And how exactly did you learn this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That guy I know who used to be with the Warriors. We\u0027re still friendly, and he\u0027s been having doubts about them. He mentioned hearing them talk about finding a missing girl that could cause all sorts of trouble.\" Maybe it was wrong to drag Trey into this lie, but I seriously doubted Stanton would interrogate him anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you assume this is Miss Dragomir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" I exclaimed. \"Who else would it be? Do you know any other Moroi girls? Of course it\u0027s her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, Miss Sage.\" Her voice was flat and untroubled. \"There\u0027s no need for theatrics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a need for action! If they might be on to her, then we need to get out of Palm Springs immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That,\" she said crisply, \"is not an option. A lot of planning went into getting her to her current location.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t believe that argument for a second. Half our job was doing damage control and adapting to rapidly changing situations. \"Yeah? Well, did you also plan on those psycho vampire hunters finding her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanton ignored the jab. \"Do you have any evidence at all that the Warriors actually have concrete data about her? Did your friend supply you with details?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I admitted. \"But we still need to do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no \u0027we\u0027 here.\" Her voice had gone from flat to icy. \"You do not decide what we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly protested and then caught myself. Horror set in. What had I just done? My initial intent had been to either get Stanton to take legitimate action or else find out if she might accidentally reveal knowledge of a Warrior connection. I\u0027d thought mentioning Trey would give me valid backup since I could hardly tell her the real reason I feared for Jill. Yet, somehow, I\u0027d gone from a request to a demand. I\u0027d practically yelled an order at her. That wasn\u0027t typical Sydney behavior. That wasn\u0027t typical Alchemist behavior. What had Wade said? You\u0027re leaving a trail of bread crumbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this because I\u0027d broken the tattoo?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was no crumb. This was a full loaf. I was on the verge of insubordination, and my mind could suddenly imagine that list Marcus kept warning about, the one that kept track of every suspicious thing I did. Was Stanton already updating that list right now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to fix this, but how? How on earth did I take this back? My mind was racing frantically, and it took several moments for me to calm down and start thinking logically. The mission. Focus on the mission. Stanton would understand that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, ma\u0027am,\" I said at last. Be calm. Be deferential. \"I\u0027m just . . . I\u0027m just so worried about this mission. I saw my dad at the services, you know.\" That would be a fact she could check on. \"You had to have seen how it was that night I left. How bad things are between us. I . . . I have to make him proud. If things fall apart here, he\u0027ll never forgive me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t respond, so I prayed that meant she was listening intently . . . and believing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to do a good job here. I want to fulfill our goals and keep Jill hidden. But there have already been so many complications no one predicted - first Keith and then the Warriors. I just never feel like she\u0027s fully safe now, even with Eddie and Angeline. It eats at me. And - \" I was no actress who could muster tears, but I did my best to make my voice crack. \"And I never feel safe. I told you, when I asked to go to the services, how overwhelming it is with the Moroi. They\u0027re everywhere - and the dhampirs too. I eat with them. I\u0027m in class with them. Being with other Alchemists this last weekend was a lifesaver. I mean, I\u0027m not trying to dodge my duties, ma\u0027am. I understand we have to make sacrifices. And I\u0027ve gotten better around them, but sometimes the stress is just unbearable - and then when I heard this thing about the Warriors, I cracked. All I could think about was that I might fail. I\u0027m sorry, ma\u0027am. I shouldn\u0027t have flipped out on you. I was out of control, and it was unacceptable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut off my rant and tensed as I waited for her response. Hopefully I\u0027d given her enough to dismiss any thoughts of me being a dissident. Of course, I might have just come off as a totally weak and unstable Alchemist who needed to be pulled from this mission. If that happened . . . well, maybe I\u0027d have to take Marcus up on Mexico.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer characteristic pause was especially painful this time. \"I see,\" she said. \"Well, I\u0027ll take this all into consideration. This mission is of the utmost importance, believe me. My earlier questioning of your information was not some weakening of our resolve. Your concerns have been heard, and I will decide the best course of action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t exactly what I wanted, but hopefully she would be true to her word. I really, really wanted to believe she was on the up-and-up. \"Thank you, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything else, Miss Sage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am. And . . . and I\u0027m sorry ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your apology is noted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d paced while I\u0027d talked and now stood staring at the phone. A gut instinct told me I really had driven Stanton to take some sort of action. The mystery was whether that action would prove beneficial or catastrophic for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalling asleep was difficult after that, and it had nothing to do with Veronica for a change. I was too keyed up, too anxious about what had happened with Marcus and Stanton. I tried to seize that feeling of freedom again, using it to strengthen me. It was only a spark this time, flickering with my new uncertainties, but it was better than nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell asleep sometime around three. I had a vague sense of a couple hours passing before I was swept into one of Adrian\u0027s dreams, back in the reception hall. \"Finally,\" he said. \"I almost gave up checking in. I thought you were going to pull an all-nighter.\" He\u0027d stopped wearing his suit in these dreams, probably because I always showed up in jeans. Tonight he wore jeans also, along with a plain black T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too.\" I wrung my hands and began pacing here as well. The nervous energy from my waking self had carried over into the dream. \"A lot of stuff\u0027s kind of happened tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dream felt real, solid. Adrian was sober. \"Didn\u0027t you just get back? How much could\u0027ve happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I told him, he shook his head in amazement. \"Man, Sage. It\u0027s all or nothing with you. Never a dull moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came to a halt in front of him and leaned against a table. \"I know, I know. Do you think I just made a huge mistake? God, maybe Marcus was right, and there was some compulsion forcing me to be loyal in the tattoo. I\u0027m free for one hour and completely go over the edge with my superior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds like you covered your tracks,\" he said, though a small frown appeared on his face. \"But I would be disappointed if they sent you somewhere less stressful. That seems like it might be the worst-case scenario from everything you said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started laughing, but it was the hysterical kind. \"What in the world\u0027s happened to me? I was doing crazy stuff way before Marcus broke the tattoo tonight. Meeting with rebels, chasing evil sorceresses, even buying that dress! Yelling at Stanton is just one more thing on a long list of insanity. It\u0027s just like I said at Pies and Stuff: I don\u0027t know who I am anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian smiled and clasped my hands, taking a few steps toward me. \"Well, first off, I\u0027m the expert in insanity, and this is nothing. And as for who you are, you\u0027re the same beautiful, brave, and ridiculously smart caffeinated fighter you\u0027ve been since the day I met you.\" Finally, he put \"beautiful\" at the top of his list of adjectives. Not that I should have cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet talker,\" I scoffed. \"You didn\u0027t know anything about me the first time we met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you were beautiful,\" he said. \"I just hoped for the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe always got this glint in his eyes when he complimented my looks, like he was seeing so much more than just my actual appearance. It was disorienting and heady . . . but I didn\u0027t mind. And that wasn\u0027t the only thing I suddenly found overwhelming. How had he gotten so close to me without me even realizing it? It was like he had secret stealth abilities. His hands were warm on mine, our fingers locked together. I still had remnants of that earlier joy within me, and being connected to him amplified those feelings. The green of his eyes was as lovely as usual, and I wondered if mine had the same effect on him. There was a little amber mixed with the brown that he had once said looked like gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s the only one who never tells me to do anything, I realized. Oh, sure, he asked me to do lots of things, often with cajoling and fast talking. But he made no demands on me, not like the Alchemists or Marcus. Even Jill and Angeline tended to preface their requests with, \"You have to . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of that dress,\" he added, \"I still haven\u0027t seen it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed softly. \"You couldn\u0027t handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised an eyebrow at that. \"Is that a challenge, Sage? I can handle a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if our history is any indication. Each time I wear some moderately attractive dress, you lose it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not exactly true,\" he said. \"I lose it no matter what you\u0027re wearing. And that red dress was not \u0027moderately attractive.\u0027 It was like a piece of heaven here on earth. A red, silky piece of heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should\u0027ve rolled my eyes. I should\u0027ve told him I wasn\u0027t here for his personal entertainment. But there was something in the way he was looking at me and something in the way I felt tonight that made me want to see his reaction. Breaking the tattoo hadn\u0027t affected anything between us, but it - and the deeds I\u0027d done this weekend - had left me feeling bold. For the first time, I wanted to take a risk with him, despite my usual set of logical arguments. Besides, there was nothing dangerous in letting him look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI manipulated the dream the way he\u0027d taught me. A few moments later, the lacy minidress replaced my jeans and blouse. I even summoned the heels, which bumped my height up. I was still nowhere near as tall as him, but the small boost brought our faces closer together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened. Still holding my hands, he took a step back so that he could take in the whole look. There was almost something tangible to the way his gaze swept my body. I could practically feel every place it touched. By the time his eyes reached mine again, my breathing was heavy, and I was acutely aware that there really wasn\u0027t that much clothing between the two of us. Maybe there was something dangerous in letting him look after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A piece of heaven?\" I managed to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly shook his head. \"No. The other place. The one I\u0027m going to burn in for thinking what I\u0027m thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d moved toward me again. His hands released mine and moved to my waist, and I noticed I wasn\u0027t the only one breathing heavily. He pulled me to him, bringing our bodies together. The world was all heat and electricity, thick with tension that was only one spark away from exploding around us. I was balancing on another precipice, which wasn\u0027t easy to do in heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my arms around his neck, and this time I was the one who drew him closer. \"Damn,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked, never taking my eyes off his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his hands over my hips. \"I\u0027m not supposed to kiss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay if I kiss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian Ivashkov wasn\u0027t easy to surprise, but I surprised him then when I brought his mouth toward mine. I kissed him, and for a moment, he was too stunned to respond. That lasted for, oh, about a second. Then the intensity I\u0027d come to know so well in him returned. He pushed me backward, lifting me so that I sat on the table. The tablecloth bunched up, knocking over some of the glasses. I heard what sounded like a china plate crash against the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever logic and reason I normally possessed had melted away. There was nothing but flesh and fire left, and I wasn\u0027t going to lie to myself - at least not tonight. I wanted him. I arched my back, fully aware of how vulnerable that made me and that I was giving him an invitation. He accepted it and laid me back against the table, bringing his body down on top of mine. That crushing kiss of his moved from my mouth to the nape of my neck. He pushed down the edge of my dress and the bra strap underneath, exposing my shoulder and giving his lips more skin to conquer. A glass rolled off and smashed, soon followed by another. Adrian broke off his kissing, and I opened my eyes. He had an exasperated look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A table,\" he said. \"A goddamned table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few moments later, the table was gone. I was in his apartment, on his bed, and was glad that I no longer had silverware underneath me. With the venue change complete, his lips found mine again. The urgency in the way I responded surprised even me. I never would\u0027ve thought myself capable of a feeling so primal, so removed from the reason that usually governed my actions. My nails dug into his back, and he trailed his lips down the edge of my chin, down the center of my neck. He kept going until he reached the bottom of the dress\u0027s V-neck. I let out a small gasp, and he kissed all around the neckline, just enough to tease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" he murmured. \"The dress stays on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? Is that your decision to make?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said. \"You\u0027re not losing your virginity in a dream. If that\u0027s even possible. I don\u0027t want to deal with the philosophical side of it. And besides, there\u0027s no need to rush anyway. Sometimes it\u0027s worth lingering on the journey for a while before getting to the destination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMetaphors. This was the cost of making out with an artist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly said as much. Then his hand slid up my bare leg, and I was lost again. Maybe the dress was staying on, but he didn\u0027t mind taking liberties with it. That hand slipped under my dress, running along the side of my leg and up to my hip. I burned where he touched me, and everything within me became focused on that hand. It was moving far too slowly, and I grabbed it, ready to urge it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian chuckled and caught hold of my wrist, pulling my hand away and pinning it down against the covers. \"Never thought I\u0027d be the one slowing you down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes and met his. \"I\u0027m a quick study.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that burning and animal need within me must have shone through because he caught his breath and lost the smile. He released my wrist and cupped my face in his hands, bringing his face down only a whisper away from mine. \"Good God, Sydney. You are - \" The passion in his eyes turned to surprise, and he suddenly looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked, wondering if this was some weird part of \"the journey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grimaced and began to fade away before my eyes. \"You\u0027re being woken up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-21.html","bookId":2043,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:40:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:40:55 PM"}
