{"id":44710,"no":44,"title":"25th August","content":"Well, Daddy, Master Jervie\u0027s here. And such a nice time as\n\u003cbr\u003e we\u0027re having! At least I am, and I think he is, too--he has been\n\u003cbr\u003e here ten days and he doesn\u0027t show any signs of going. The way\n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Semple pampers that man is scandalous. If she indulged him\n\u003cbr\u003e as much when he was a baby, I don\u0027t know how he ever turned out so well.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He and I eat at a little table set on the side porch, or sometimes\n\u003cbr\u003e under the trees, or--when it rains or is cold--in the best parlour. \n\u003cbr\u003e He just picks out the spot he wants to eat in and Carrie trots\n\u003cbr\u003e after him with the table. Then if it has been an awful nuisance,\n\u003cbr\u003e and she has had to carry the dishes very far, she finds a dollar\n\u003cbr\u003e under the sugar bowl.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He is an awfully companionable sort of man, though you would never\n\u003cbr\u003e believe it to see him casually; he looks at first glance like a\n\u003cbr\u003e true Pendleton, but he isn\u0027t in the least. He is just as simple\n\u003cbr\u003e and unaffected and sweet as he can be--that seems a funny way\n\u003cbr\u003e to describe a man, but it\u0027s true. He\u0027s extremely nice with the\n\u003cbr\u003e farmers around here; he meets them in a sort of man-to-man fashion\n\u003cbr\u003e that disarms them immediately. They were very suspicious at first. \n\u003cbr\u003e They didn\u0027t care for his clothes! And I will say that his clothes\n\u003cbr\u003e are rather amazing. He wears knickerbockers and pleated jackets\n\u003cbr\u003e and white flannels and riding clothes with puffed trousers. \n\u003cbr\u003e Whenever he comes down in anything new, Mrs. Semple, beaming with pride,\n\u003cbr\u003e walks around and views him from every angle, and urges him to be careful\n\u003cbr\u003e where he sits down; she is so afraid he will pick up some dust. \n\u003cbr\u003e It bores him dreadfully. He\u0027s always saying to her:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Run along, Lizzie, and tend to your work. You can\u0027t boss me\n\u003cbr\u003e any longer. I\u0027ve grown up.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s awfully funny to think of that great big, long-legged man (he\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e nearly as long-legged as you, Daddy) ever sitting in Mrs. Semple\u0027s lap\n\u003cbr\u003e and having his face washed. Particularly funny when you see her lap! \n\u003cbr\u003e She has two laps now, and three chins. But he says that once she\n\u003cbr\u003e was thin and wiry and spry and could run faster than he.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Such a lot of adventures we\u0027re having! We\u0027ve explored the country\n\u003cbr\u003e for miles, and I\u0027ve learned to fish with funny little flies made\n\u003cbr\u003e of feathers. Also to shoot with a rifle and a revolver. Also to\n\u003cbr\u003e ride horseback--there\u0027s an astonishing amount of life in old Grove. \n\u003cbr\u003e We fed him on oats for three days, and he shied at a calf and almost\n\u003cbr\u003e ran away with me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wednesday\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We climbed Sky Hill Monday afternoon. That\u0027s a mountain near here;\n\u003cbr\u003e not an awfully high mountain, perhaps--no snow on the summit--but at\n\u003cbr\u003e least you are pretty breathless when you reach the top. The lower slopes\n\u003cbr\u003e are covered with woods, but the top is just piled rocks and open moor. \n\u003cbr\u003e We stayed up for the sunset and built a fire and cooked our supper. \n\u003cbr\u003e Master Jervie did the cooking; he said he knew how better than me\n\u003cbr\u003e and he did, too, because he\u0027s used to camping. Then we came down\n\u003cbr\u003e by moonlight, and, when we reached the wood trail where it was dark,\n\u003cbr\u003e by the light of an electric bulb that he had in his pocket. \n\u003cbr\u003e It was such fun! He laughed and joked all the way and talked\n\u003cbr\u003e about interesting things. He\u0027s read all the books I\u0027ve ever read,\n\u003cbr\u003e and a lot of others besides. It\u0027s astonishing how many different\n\u003cbr\u003e things he knows.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We went for a long tramp this morning and got caught in a storm. \n\u003cbr\u003e Our clothes were drenched before we reached home but our spirits not\n\u003cbr\u003e even damp. You should have seen Mrs. Semple\u0027s face when we dripped\n\u003cbr\u003e into her kitchen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Oh, Master Jervie--Miss Judy! You are soaked through. Dear! Dear! \n\u003cbr\u003e What shall I do? That nice new coat is perfectly ruined.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was awfully funny; you would have thought that we were ten\n\u003cbr\u003e years old, and she a distracted mother. I was afraid for a while\n\u003cbr\u003e that we weren\u0027t going to get any jam for tea.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Saturday\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I started this letter ages ago, but I haven\u0027t had a second to finish it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Isn\u0027t this a nice thought from Stevenson?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The world is so full of a number of things,\n\u003cbr\u003e I am sure we should all be as happy as kings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s true, you know. The world is full of happiness, and plenty\n\u003cbr\u003e to go round, if you are only willing to take the kind that comes\n\u003cbr\u003e your way. The whole secret is in being PLIABLE. In the country,\n\u003cbr\u003e especially, there are such a lot of entertaining things. \n\u003cbr\u003e I can walk over everybody\u0027s land, and look at everybody\u0027s view,\n\u003cbr\u003e and dabble in everybody\u0027s brook; and enjoy it just as much\n\u003cbr\u003e as though I owned the land--and with no taxes to pay!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s Sunday night now, about eleven o\u0027clock,\n\u003cbr\u003e and I am supposed to be getting some beauty\n\u003cbr\u003e sleep, but I had black coffee for dinner, so--no beauty sleep for me!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This morning, said Mrs. Semple to Mr. Pendleton, with a very\n\u003cbr\u003e determined accent:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `We have to leave here at a quarter past ten in order to get\n\u003cbr\u003e to church by eleven.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Very well, Lizzie,\u0027 said Master Jervie, `you have the buggy ready,\n\u003cbr\u003e and if I\u0027m not dressed, just go on without waiting.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll wait,\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e said she.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `As you please,\u0027 said he, `only don\u0027t keep the horses standing\n\u003cbr\u003e too long.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then while she was dressing, he told Carrie to pack up a lunch,\n\u003cbr\u003e and he told me to scramble into my walking clothes; and we slipped\n\u003cbr\u003e out the back way and went fishing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It discommoded the household dreadfully, because Lock Willow of\n\u003cbr\u003e a Sunday dines at two. But he ordered dinner at seven--he orders meals\n\u003cbr\u003e whenever he chooses; you would think the place were a restaurant--\n\u003cbr\u003e and that kept Carrie and Amasai from going driving. But he said it\n\u003cbr\u003e was all the better because it wasn\u0027t proper for them to go driving\n\u003cbr\u003e without a chaperon; and anyway, he wanted the horses himself to take\n\u003cbr\u003e me driving. Did you ever hear anything so funny?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And poor Mrs. Semple believes that people who go fishing on Sundays go\n\u003cbr\u003e afterwards to a sizzling hot hell! She is awfully troubled to think\n\u003cbr\u003e that she didn\u0027t train him better when he was small and helpless\n\u003cbr\u003e and she had the chance. Besides--she wished to show him off in church.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, we had our fishing (he caught four little ones) and we cooked\n\u003cbr\u003e them on a camp-fire for lunch. They kept falling off our spiked\n\u003cbr\u003e sticks into the fire, so they tasted a little ashy, but we ate them. \n\u003cbr\u003e We got home at four and went driving at five and had dinner at seven,\n\u003cbr\u003e and at ten I was sent to bed and here I am, writing to you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I am getting a little sleepy, though.\n\u003cbr\u003e Good night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here is a picture of the one fish I caught.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ship Ahoy, Cap\u0027n Long-Legs!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Avast! Belay! Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum. Guess what I\u0027m reading? \n\u003cbr\u003e Our conversation these past two days has been nautical and piratical. \n\u003cbr\u003e Isn\u0027t Treasure Island fun? Did you ever read it, or wasn\u0027t it\n\u003cbr\u003e written when you were a boy? Stevenson only got thirty pounds for\n\u003cbr\u003e the serial rights--I don\u0027t believe it pays to be a great author. \n\u003cbr\u003e Maybe I\u0027ll be a school-teacher.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Excuse me for filling my letters so full of Stevenson; my mind\n\u003cbr\u003e is very much engaged with him at present. He comprises Lock\n\u003cbr\u003e Willow\u0027s library.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve been writing this letter for two weeks, and I think it\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e about long enough. Never say, Daddy, that I don\u0027t give details. \n\u003cbr\u003e I wish you were here, too; we\u0027d all have such a jolly time together. \n\u003cbr\u003e I like my different friends to know each other. I wanted to ask\n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Pendleton if he knew you in New York--I should think he might;\n\u003cbr\u003e you must move in about the same exalted social circles, and you are\n\u003cbr\u003e both interested in reforms and things--but I couldn\u0027t, for I don\u0027t know\n\u003cbr\u003e your real name.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s the silliest thing I ever heard of, not to know your name. \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Lippett warned me that you were eccentric. I should think so!\n\u003cbr\u003e Affectionately,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. On reading this over, I find that it isn\u0027t all Stevenson. \n\u003cbr\u003e There are one or two glancing references to Master Jervie.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59766.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
