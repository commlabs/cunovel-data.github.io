get rid of the morphine hangover; then he picked up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst he called Lieutenant Hesse, who was staying in a less grand room at the same

ever met her, and Dieter believed him: the house was a security cut-out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncoming agents knew nothing more than where to contact the woman: if caught, they could not reveal

room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMademoiselle Lemas might be alone but, on the other hand, the house could be crawling with Allied agents, all armed to the teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed some backup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe consulted his notebook and gave the hotel operator Rommel\u0027s number in La Roche-Guyon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Germans had first occupied the country, the French telephone system had been swamped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince then, the Germans had improved the equipment, adding thousands of kilometers of cable and installing automatic exchanges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe system was still overloaded, but it was better than it had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked for Rommel\u0027s aide Major

\"But I could use some assistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m doing all this with one lieutenant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m so desperate, I\u0027m using my French girlfriend to help me.\" \"That seems unwise.\" \"Oh, she\u0027s trustworthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she won\u0027t be much use against trained terrorists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you get me half a

this is-he\u0027s given me the job of making sure the Resistance can\u0027t hamper our mobility.\" \"Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Field Marshal expects you to do it without depriving him of combat troops.\" \"I\u0027m not sure I can.\" \"For God\u0027s sake, man!\" Goedel raised his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re trying to defend the entire Atlantic coastline with a handful of soldiers, and you\u0027re surrounded by able-bodied men who have nothing better to do than track down scared old Jews hiding in barns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet on with the job and

his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, he jiggled the rest and placed a call to the chateau at Sainte-Cecile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached Willi Weber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to raid a Resistance house,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may need some of your heavyweights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill you send four men and a car to the Hotel Frankfort? Or do I need to speak to Rommel again?\" The threat was unnecessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeber was keen to have his men along on the operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat way, the Gestapo could claim the credit for any success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe promised a car in half an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter was worried about working with the Gestapo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not control them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile shaving, he turned on the radio, which was tuned to a German station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe learned that the first-ever tank battle in the Pacific theater had developed yesterday on the island of Biak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe occupying Japanese had driven the invading American 162d Infantry back to their beachhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePush them into the sea, Dieter thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dressed in a dark gray worsted suit, a fine cotton shirt with pale gray stripes, and a black tie with small white dots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dots were woven into the fabric rather than printed on it, a detail that gave him pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought for a moment, then removed the jacket and strapped on a shoulder holster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his Walther P38 automatic pistol from the bureau and slid it into the holster, then put his jacket back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down with a cup of coffee and watched Stephanie dressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe French made the most beautiful underwear in the world, he thought as she stepped into silk cami-knickers the color of clotted cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved to see her pull on her stockings, smoothing the silk over her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did the old masters not paint this moment?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Renaissance women didn\u0027t have sheer silk stockings,\" said Stephanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was ready, they left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans Hesse was waiting outside with Dieter\u0027s Hispano-Suiza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man gazed at Stephanie with awestruck admiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo him, she was infinitely desirable and at the same time untouchable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made Dieter think of a poor woman staring into Cartier\u0027s shop window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Dieter\u0027s car was a black CitroensTraction Avant containing four Gestapo men in plain clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMajor Weber had decided to come himself, Dieter saw: he sat in the front passenger seat of the Citroens wearing a green tweed suit that made him look like a farmer on his way to church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow me,\" Dieter told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we get there, please stay in your car until I call you.\" Weber said, \"Where the hell did you get a car like that?\" \"It was a bribe from a Jew,\" Dieter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I helped him escape to America.\" Weber grunted in disbelief, but in fact the story was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBravado was the best attitude to take with men such as Weber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Dieter had tried to keep Stephanie hidden away, Weber would immediately have suspected that she was Jewish and might have started an investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut because Dieter flaunted her, the thought never crossed Weber\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans took the wheel, and they headed for the rue du Bois.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReims was a substantial country town with a population of more than 100,000, but there were few motor vehicles on the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCars were used only by those on official business: the police, doctors, firemen, and, of course, the Germans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe citizens went about by bicycle or on foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetrol was available for deliveries of food and other essential supplies, but many goods were transported by horse-drawn cart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChampagne was the main industry here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter loved champagne in all its forms: the nutty older vintages, the fresh, light, nonvintage cuvees, the refined blanc de blancs, the demi-sec dessert varieties, even the playful pink beloved of Paris courtesans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rue du Bois was a pleasant tree-lined street on the outskirts of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans pulled up outside a tall house at the end of a row, with a little courtyard to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the home of Mademoiselle Lemas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould Dieter be able to break her spirit?
