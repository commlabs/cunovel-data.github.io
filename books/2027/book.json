It would be the retelling of the events of Twilight, but written from the perspective of Edward Cullen as opposed to that of Bella Swan. Meyer has stated that Twilight is the only book from the series that she plans to rewrite from Edward\u0027s perspective. To give them a better feel of Edward\u0027s character, Meyer allowed Catherine Hardwicke, the director of the film adaptation of Twilight, and Robert Pattinson, the actor playing Edward, to read some completed chapters of the novel while they filmed the movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-twilight-saga-5-midnight-sun-twilight-2.jpg","author":"Stephenie Meyer","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-5-midnight-sun-twilight-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:16 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:27 PM"}
