But pictures often lie— and so do Rosewood\u0027s four prettiest girls. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eHanna, Aria, Spencer, and Emily have been lying ever since they became friends with beautiful Alison DiLaurentis. Ali made them do terrible things—things they had to keep secret for years. And even though Ali was killed at the end of seventh grade, their bad-girl ways didn\u0027t die with her. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eHanna\u0027s on a mission to corrupt Rosewood\u0027s youth, starting with a very attractive sophomore. Aria\u0027s snooping into her boyfriend\u0027s past. Spencer\u0027s stealing— from her family. And pure little Emily\u0027s abstaining from abstinence. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe girls should be careful, though. They thought they were safe when Ali\u0027s killer was arrested and A\u0027s true identity was finally revealed. But now there\u0027s a new A in town turning up the heat. And this time Rosewood is going to burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/killer-pretty-little-liars-6.jpg","author":"Sara Shepard","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/killer-pretty-little-liars-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:39 AM"}
