After which, those eyes paused on the blue-clothed lady. His expression slightly warmed while his voice continued to contain a gloominess, “Xin Lan, why has this happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue-clothed lady was clearly Xin Lan, who had led Xiao Yan’s group to the Central Plains. She appeared to have understood Xiao Yan’s meaning when he said these words. Her pretty face dimmed as she softly uttered, “I’m sorry…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan gradually became a lot calmer after seeing that downcast appearance of Xin Lan. She was not very strong. Moreover, it seemed that the Ye clan was currently not in a very good state. Even if Xin Lan could convince them to aid the Little Fairy Doctor, it was likely that they would not possess the ability to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you? You actually dare to randomly barge into my Ye clan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXin Lan’s voice had just sounded when the expression of an old man in the large hall sank. He stood up and angrily cried at Xiao Yan. There were some other elders within the Ye clan beside him. They were also looking at Xiao Yan with similarly furious eyes. Some of the somewhat younger generation possessed a gloating expression in their eyes. Although the Ye clan was currently declining, it was not in a state where anyone could come and provoke them. Moreover, this person was actually a young fellow who was of similar age to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan glanced at this old man. He was merely a one star Dou Zong. Moreover, from the looks of the seat he occupied, his position within the Ye clan should be quite high. However, Xiao Yan completely ignored him. The only one in the large hall who was able to catch Xiao Yan’s attention was the green-clothed, old man who was seated on the leader’s seat. Looking at the majestic aura that surrounded him, it was likely that this person was a six star Dou Zong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Follow me, lead me to her!” Xiao Yan’s eyes stared at Xin Lan as he spoke with a cold voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXin Lan clenched her silver teeth when she heard this. After which, she nodded vigorously. She had led the Little Fairy Doctor and Xiao Yan to the Central Plains, but did not provide them with protection. Instead, she was powerless to do anything when the Little Fairy Doctor fell into a dangerous situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You impudent young man!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat old man who had cried out furiously earlier had an even angrier expression when he was completely ignored by Xiao Yan. His hand slammed violently onto the surface of the table. One could hear a ‘bang’ and the hard table was shattered into powder. He immediately waved his sleeves and the chair behind him carried a wild and violent force as it shot toward Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was completely expressionless. When the wooden chair had entered within a ten feet radius, one could hear a muffled ‘puff’ sound. Without any forewarning, it turned into dark-black ashes that scattered down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was surprise on the faces of quite a number of people present when they saw this scene. Clearly, they did not expect this young fellow to possess such skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you actually possess some skill. No wonder you dare to act so presumptuously in my Ye clan. However, the old me shall teach you, this younger generation, what it means to respect your elders!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat old man narrowed his eyes when he saw the wooden chair being incinerated in a strange manner. He let out a cold laugh. The fury in his eyes soared as his foot stepped on the ground. After which, his body rushed toward Xiao Yan in a lightning-like manner. A wave of strange green flame surged out from his shriveled hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fourth Elder, stop!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXin Lan hurriedly cried out. A paleness was revealed on her pretty face when she saw this old man attacking as he pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, that fourth Elder completely ignored her voice. His character was a little hot-tempered. The situation that the Ye clan was facing also caused him to be irritated. Now, a young fellow, who had appeared from nowhere, dared to jump over him. How could he not be furious?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big brother Xiao Yan, leave quickly!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXin Lan hurriedly turned to Xiao Yan and cried out when she saw that the fourth Elder did not pause. The Ye clan might not be in a good situation now but they were still able to produce two to three elite Dou Zongs. If they really wished to capture Xiao Yan, it was likely that he would have difficulty fleeing given his strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan also ignored Xin Lan’s cry. His eyes looked at the old man who was heading over with a heated wind. A chill flashed across his dark-black eyes. Right now, his mood was also extremely bad because he was worried about the Little Fairy Doctor’s condition. This old fellow had really knocked onto his desire to hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brat, once I have captured you, I will deliver you to your elders and get them to teach you properly!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth Elder’s figure flashed and appeared in front of Xiao Yan while many gazes, that were intending to watch a show, watched. His fist was clenched tightly and green-colored, fierce flames appeared. After which, his fist was ruthlessly swung forward!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis punch did not possess any fanciful moves. However, its majestic force caused a low, deep sonic boom to appear!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire fist was swiftly magnified in those dark-black eyes. At the same time, Xiao Yan raised his hand gently and slowly spread it apart…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fist from the fourth Elder of the Ye clan, that contained a green-colored flame, smashed against Xiao Yan’s palm in front of all the eyes within the large hall. However, before any cheers could be emitted, everyone’s faces became stiff as they discovered that the skinny, weak-looking, young man did not move at all…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, the cluster of green-colored flames on the fist of the fourth Elder seemed to have met something frightening when it made contact with Xiao Yan’s palm. It was extinguished in front of numerous stunned eyes…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire large hall had turned silent at this moment. The members of the Ye clan, who were gloating earlier, looked at each other. Their eyes contained some disbelief. Although the fourth Elder was not the strongest in the Ye clan, he was at the very least an elite Dou Zong. Even in the Ye clan, there was hardly anyone who could receive this powerful attack of his…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it is about teaching a lesson, you are really not qualified to do so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan slightly raised his eyes. His gaze was indifferent as he looked at the old man in front of him, whose expression had drastically changed. The corner of his mouth was lifted into an icy-cold smile. His palm spun a little and abruptly shook!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frightening wild, violent strength surged out of Xiao Yan’s arm like a torrent when his hand shook. After which, it was transmitted into the body of the Ye clan’s fourth Elder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grug!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hidden force that contained the Heavenly Flame trickily destroyed all of the fourth Elder’s defenses. His face instantly paled. His body seemed to have suffered a heavy blow as he flew backwards and heavily collided into a large pillar in the hall. A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out in front of everyone’s shocked eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe originally quiet, large hall had become dead silent when they looked at fourth Elder, who had collapsed after spitting out blood. Even Xin Lan involuntarily covered her small mouth with her hand. Her face was stunned. In the past, she knew that Xiao Yan possessed the ability to fight with an elite Dou Zong. However, at that time, he was unable to merely use a palm to strike an elite Dou Zong until he spat out blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It has only been less than a year… yet he is already this strong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXin Lan’s eyes stared at Xiao Yan’s indifferent face. A fervent expression appeared in her eyes…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is not without reason that the Ye clan has declined until such a state…” Xiao Yan slowly withdrew his hands. He glanced at the fourth Elder, who had fallen onto the ground, before looking around the hall. After which, he shook his head and turned his eyes to Xin Lan, “Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo furious cries sounded the moment Xiao Yan’s voice sounded. Immediately, two old men stood up. These two people were also elite Dou Zongs. Their strengths were a little stronger than the person earlier. Their strengths should be around that of a three star Dou Zong or so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two people who had stood up this time around were not as reckless as that fourth Elder. Instead, they furiously looked at Xiao Yan. They moved their bodies and blocked the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This young friend, this is our Ye clan. Putting aside your barging into this place, you have currently injured an Elder of our clan. This matter cannot be justified, right? Although our Ye clan is currently in decline, it will not accept being bullied by others in such a manner.” That green-clothed, old man in the leader’s seat, who had not spoken since Xiao Yan had appeared slowly opened his mouth and spoke in a deep voice at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faces of everyone present became a little joyful when they saw this green-clothed, old man open his mouth. Being the pillar of the current Ye clan, he still possessed quite a great reputation within the Pill Region despite the Ye clan’s decline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not the first who attacked. Moreover, I still have something to do. Xin Lan must leave with me now. I currently don’t have the time to accompany you in pursuing whatever matter!” Xiao Yan’s eyes turned to the green-clothed, old man in the leader’s seat as he furiously replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What an arrogant brat!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expressions of the two Ye clan Elders, who had blocked Xiao Yan’s path, sank when these words sounded. They immediately cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression of the green-clothed, old man was a little ugly. He said, “Xin Lan is a member of my Ye clan. She is not someone whom you can just bring away as you please…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First Elder, big brother Xiao Yan is the one whom I mentioned before. With his help, the Ye clan will definitely be able to enter the Pill Tower Elders seat once again!” Xin Lan appeared to be unwilling to see the relationship between the Ye clan and Xiao Yan deteriorate too much as she hurriedly cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green-clothed, old man was a little startled when he heard Xin Lan’s words. He immediately frowned a little as he looked at Xiao Yan. Disappointment appeared on his face. Such a young age… how could he be the savior of the Ye clan as Xin Lan had mentioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no need to say anything more. I have my own opinion regarding this matter…” The green-clothed, old man faintly spoke. He immediately looked at Xiao Yan and said, “This young friend, if you are really the helper that Xin Lan has invited, please temporarily stay in the Ye clan and allow us to play our role as a host!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese words might be put beautifully, but their intention was to hold Xiao Yan back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold smile surfaced on Xiao Yan’s face. His gaze stared at the green-clothed, old man as he said, “I am not interested in helping your Ye clan. If not for Xin Lan, I would not even want to come to this place. Moreover, I have something to settle now and do not have time to waste with you. Xin Lan must leave with me now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fury surfaced in the eyes of the green-clothed, old man when he saw that Xiao Yan was not willing to give in. He slowly took a step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In that case, allow the old me to try and see if you have the ability and the qualifications to do so!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1067\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1069\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1068","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM"}
