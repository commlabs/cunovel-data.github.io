This was a question that had remained at the bottom of Fitzdurk’s heart all this time, but he never obtained an answer. The sealed power came from the apostles themselves, so if they wanted to brute force their way through, then it would be the same as fighting themselves. The difficulty of this was self-evident, the consequences of failure extremely serious. Fitzdurk came to the conclusion that his own consciousness wasn’t incredibly firm, which was why he never dared touch these memories, only someone like Serendela who went crazy would do this type of thing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe sealing of the memories most likely came from the inheritor’s hands. Why would he seal up the most important memories? There was definitely a reason behind this. In order to undo the seal, only by gathering more apostle power, or by finding the inheritor himself would there be a chance. Missing memories meant flaws in their instincts, meaning that there was no way for them to display all of their apostle power. However, in order to pay such a great price, there had to be a reason. Before finding the inheritor, Fitzdurk didn’t want to take too much risk. As for the missing memories, he only vaguely remembered that they pertained to the last war, as well as the other apostles that might exist. He was only able to recall all of this after his instincts completely awakened.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThis was a mysterious war, he didn’t know its origins, didn’t know how it went either, but the result was the destruction of all of the apostles. Then, they were reborn one after another on this prison-like planet. Only after reconstructing Valhalla did Fitzdurk realize that there was a problem with this. The resources on this planet were too lacking, perhaps not enough for even a single apostle to use. Based on normal reasoning, the apostles should have been scattered across a relatively concentrated stellar dome to revive, and then after developing to a certain degree, they would gather once more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHowever, what was the purpose of gathering together? The answer to this question was still hidden within the depths of his memories.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eMoreover now, everything seemed to be continuing normally. The mechanical bug swarm already took form, the so-called mechanical bug army enough to engulf the entire continent, entirely possible for the army to even cover the entire planet one day. The energy motherships’ numbers already exceeded ten, a star system level mothership even starting its construction in the northern mountain depths. Progress has been made in the search for companions as well, in the northern mountain region, western region, and Dragon City, each of these areas, a young ultra life form was discovered. Previously, he had always assumed that they were merely ordinary predatory type ultra life forms, but after analyzing things once more, he discovered that things weren’t that simple. Through Valhalla’s calculation ability, after casting aside the element of this world’s will, these young ultra life forms all had a fixed amount of connection to the apostles. Only, it was unknown whether the apostle they were connected to was the brain, inheritor, or was it actually the creator?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHowever, there will soon be an answer to this question. The specimen that was obtained from Dragon City was currently being brought back, and then, before Valhalla, no secrets could be hidden. After detecting that the young ultra life form was related to an apostle, Fitzdurk also changed his method of dealing with them. In the past, he wanted to directly kill them without reason, but now, it was just to obtain samples, not to wipe them out. These ultra life forms might very well be an apostle’s descendant, but since they were ultra life forms, then that meant that the apostle awakened at least half of its instincts, and was not unintentionally doing things under the control of this world’s will. Moreover, the three predatory type ultra life forms, once they fully matured, their fighting strength would inevitably increase substantially, making them a great asset to the completed apostle. Furthermore, if they really were the descendant of a certain apostle, then there was no way their evolution wouldn’t have an end point, and the end point wouldn’t be too low, thus eliminating the greatest worry he had towards predatory type ultra life forms.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThat was why they were entirely different from the young light bringing knight. The latter was merely a product of Serendela when her instincts were sleeping, completely human. Even if he was indeed a genius, it was still something evaluated through human standards. What use did a genius among ants have? He could trample to death as many as he wanted. That was why Fitzdurk didn’t feel the slightest mental burden when killing the light bringing knight, while Serendela didn’t say anything about this matter either. However, the former was different, because these were ultra life forms that stood on the same level as the apostles. In other words, they were innately precious.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eOnly, there were some areas that didn’t go smoothly. After attacking the Blood Parliament on a large scale, only then did Fitzdurk discover that the power hidden behind the iron curtain was actually this powerful. The Blood Parliament had many experts in their territory, their weapons extremely strong, many small-scale inhabited areas even able to persist before the bug swarms with decisive advantages for half an hour to an hour, the mechanical bug swarm’s loss rate also far exceeding what was anticipated. One had to understand that humans weren’t mechanical units, where as long as there was a new design, completely new mechanical units could be produced in a night’s time. If the human race wanted to develop targeted weapon tactics, it would often take half a year or even longer. Being able to develop nearly perfect tactics and weapons for dealing with the mechanical bug swarm in a month’s time proved that the Blood Parliament’s ability users were varied and extensive, possessing powerful research strength, not just some fellas who only developed muscles instead of brains.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-36-4\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-36-6\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-36-5","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM"}
