Each part he touched went dead, beyond numb. My heart cried out, straining against my chest, the only part of me that could protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that, ma chérie? You wonder what will happen to your body? Do you feel it emptying, becoming merely a comely shell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused as if I could speak, as if he could hear me silently screaming. His smile was dark, dark as the hole in Monsieur Charmant’s floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have uses for pretty flesh at the Malediction Club.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, I howled and beat upon the cage of my own bones, the blud slowing in my veins. But there was nothing I could do. Nothing I could move. Nothing I could say. I couldn’t even cry, couldn’t even close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’ll be our second Bludman. Finally, a matched set.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenoir’s eyes flicked to his palette, and he picked up the syringe to squeeze more blud into the puddle of glistening paint. And that’s why he didn’t notice the strangely glimmering object that flew across the room to lodge in his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I recognized it. The silver thing looked like Wolverine’s claws. As Lenoir spun, hands curling into talons, Vale hurtled out of the darkness and punched him square in the teeth. Even from where I lounged, immobile and terrified, it seemed a foolish move, busting his knuckles into a Bludman’s mouth, until I smelled something sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVale’s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenoir reflexively licked his lips as he ripped the claws from his side, painting the floor with blud. “You idiot. Do you have any idea who you’re dealing with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVale shook his hand out, sending splatters of his own blood everywhere. Red danced in my eyes, spots and streaks like the scattered stains left by the white-haired paintbrush Lenoir had dropped on the carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did not know you were a Bludman, at first.” Vale straightened and walked over to the crouched and wounded artist as if inspecting the painting. “Rather lucky for me, don’t you agree?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenoir had one arm over the three puncture wounds dribbling red through his jacket and one hand to his mouth, scrubbing at his pale lips as if he could erase the blood he’d already ingested. “Abyssinian,” he wheezed. His skin was going over pale, his nostrils wide and his eyes all black with widening pupils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me how to save her, and I will give you a gift.” Reaching into his black waistcoat, Vale pulled out a tiny glass vial that glistened metallic gold. “An antidote.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No antidote.” Lenoir hissed. “For what you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But of course there is. We just keep it a secret so bloodsuckers like you will avoid us.” He held up the vial, just within snatching reach of Lenoir, who made a clumsy grab for it. Vale danced back. “Talk first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenoir’s legs buckled, and he fell to the floor, curled around like a dying centipede, legs twitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVale kneeled over him, wiggling the little bottle back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Lenoir sucked in a long breath and exhaled two whispered words. “Burn it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for the glass antidote bottle, but Vale ignored him completely and grabbed a paintbrush from Lenoir’s jar of spirits. An evil stench went up when he stuck it in the fire, and it got even worse when he held the flaming brush to the painting of me. Lenoir let out an unholy wail as bright blue flames licked over the canvas and caught, the entire thing suddenly alight and crackling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Antidote,” he hissed. “Antidote!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Vale was by my side, taking my cold hand, rubbing it between his own. “Still in there, bébé?” he asked, his pinprick pupils telling the truth of his concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all his jaunty swaggering, the boy was so scared I could smell the fear rolling off him in waves, although, strangely, I couldn’t smell him. I took a shuddering breath and felt my fangs dig into my lips. A few seconds more, and I was able to nod my head, just a bit. My eyes blinked and reopened on a vision of myself, a work of ultimate beauty, aflame and dripping paint and belching smoke. He must have turned the easel to face me so I could watch it burn. Vale touched my face, stroked my hair, flexed each of my hands, and ran thumbs down the soles of my feet until they feebly kicked. The ice that had run in my veins ebbed, leaving me warm, as if I’d been breathing in the cold and was finally indoors again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up straight and stared down at Lenoir. Vale nodded once and turned to him with the antidote, but I finally found my words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t give it to him yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes locked on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demi?” Vale asked gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell us where the Malediction Club meets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenoir was foaming at the mouth now, red bubbles leaking from his dry white lips. He laughed, his head spasming and his eyes going mad and glittery. “Wasn’t. The deal.” He wheezed a laugh. “Antidote!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVale sighed and kneeled. “I did promise him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too tired to protest and leaned on the chair’s arm, too drained to hold myself upright. Surely there would be some way to compel Lenoir, if we kept him alive. Vale unstoppered the vial carefully and used the dropper to squeeze a stream of golden liquid into Lenoir’s mouth. The once-handsome painter lapped at it like a starving dog but quickly spit it back out, coughing up red foam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said. There was an antidote.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVale grinned. “Oh, there is one. That’s just not it.” He licked the stopper and scrunched up his face. “Oh, la. It would seem that’s my aunt Merle’s famous hot-pepper sauce. We consider it the antidote to poor cooking. Spicy, n’est-ce pas?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenoir uncurled and straightened in a creepy rictus dance that resembled an exorcism. His trembling hand went for his pocket, but Vale stomped on it, grinding it into the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None of your blud magic, monsieur.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter clenching his teeth and trembling for a moment as he fought to get his hand from under Vale’s boot, Lenoir pinned him with his indigo eyes, the veins bloody and wet and starting to seep into the white. “Going to curse you. For lying to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Think back carefully, monsieur. I did not lie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenoir breathed out, spewing bloody froth. His eyes went lucid and crafty then, and he began speaking in Sanguine, slurry and slow. Before he could get out more than a couple of words, Vale kicked him in the throat, and he choked and fell onto his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, if you’ll tell us how to find the Malediction Club, I have the real antidote right here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA twist of paper appeared in Vale’s fingers, but Lenoir was past caring. With the last of his energy, he pointed at the smoldering painting, then at me, then drew his trembling finger across his own throat. His hand fell on his crushed neck as his head lolled sideways on the carpet, blood spilling from mouth and eyes and bubbling from the holes in his stomach, which would have healed themselves quickly if not for Vale’s half-Abyssinian blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—how will we find it now? If he’s dead?” I shuddered and sobbed. “How will we find Cherie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an angry growl, Vale rushed to a heavy desk in the corner, flicking on the green banker’s light and shuffling through the drawers and papers, throwing everything he found onto the ground. “There must be something here, somewhere. An invitation. A bill. A card. Something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to stand, to hurry to his side, but I could barely move. As it was, I was able to pull myself up holding the back of the chair, then collapse against the windowsill and shuffle along the wall, grabbing each warm sconce like Tarzan reaching for vines. Vale had pulled all the drawers out of the desk by the time I got there, and I fell gratefully to the ground in a puddle of skirts to paw through the spilled papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVale took his search to a series of deep shelves that held rolls of canvas. As he pulled them out and threw them onto the floor, I untied the leather thongs to let the fabric unfurl. I saw fruit, dogs, creepy dolls, cathedrals, haystacks, dead rabbits, piles of bones, people on trains. It was as if he’d plundered an art history book and copied every painting ever, trying out styles from van Gogh, Monet, and even Picasso. They had irregular sides, as if maybe he’d sliced them out of frames. None was signed; hell, maybe they were originals of Sang versions of the artists I revered. With Lenoir dead, there was no way to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Vale moved through the shelves from left to right, the paintings got better and more nuanced. Finally, the figures began to appear, graceful daimon bodies caught in repose or ballerinas holding their legs aloft. There were nudes sprinkled in, too. The first few daimon girls had tails, but after that, the tails disappeared, and the paintings graciously neglected that part of the daimons’ anatomy, perhaps to avoid the inconvenient scars that must have remained after removing so large a limb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, mon dieu.” Vale held an uncurled canvas in front of him so that all I could see was the blank, khaki-colored back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you find something?” I asked, trying to stand and barely making it to my knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not something. Someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned the painting around to show me, and the breath caught in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Bea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe painting had never been finished. The background was washed in red with hastily sketched-in details, and it was a more intimate portrait than I was familiar with, based on his work. His name in Sang was Lenoir, so close to Renoir. But most of his famous paintings were based on those by Toulouse Lautrec, bright and messy visions of cabarets and dancing girls and ballerinas. This one showed Bea dancing in a feathery ivory ballgown, her hair coiled up and one arm raised. The look on her face was more dreamy and relaxed than I’d ever seen her, not at all guarded and jumpy. In fact, now that I considered it, many of Lenoir’s paintings shared the same unfocused gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be the drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, it was blood and absinthe. For the daimons, perhaps he mixed his powders into one of their fiery brews. But I understood instantly that Bea had once stood before Lenoir, just as I had, and fallen under his spell. The only difference was that her painting had never been finished, while mine now smoldered on a stand. What I didn’t understand was why she’d never said more about him than her vague, general warnings. Her fear had been real, but she should have told me the truth. I glanced at my portrait; I’d totally forgotten that a fire burned across the room. It was merry and crackling, just about to reach his bottles of turps and tubes of paint lined up along the easel’s edge. The painter himself lay on the floor, huddled up like a smushed bug, his hair fallen to a pile on the floor around his head and his black lips drawn back over ivory fangs set in shriveled gums. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wicked-after-midnight-blud-3/page-55.html","bookId":1599,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:19 PM"}
