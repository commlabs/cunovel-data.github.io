green wheat, zigzagging from one sleepy market town to the next, circling London to the west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe countryside seemed oblivious of the war or indeed of the twentieth century, and Flick hoped it would long remain so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they wound their way through medieval Winchester, she thought of Reims, another cathedral city, with uniformed Nazis strutting on the streets and the Gestapo everywhere in their black cars, and she gave a short prayer of thanks that they had stopped at the English Channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat next to Paul and watched - the countryside for a while; then-having been awake all night making love-she fell into a blissful sleep with her head on his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt two in the afternoon they reached the village of Sandy in Bedfordshire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bus went down a winding country road, turned onto an unpaved lane through a wood, and arrived at a large mansion called Tempsford House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick had been here before: it was the assembly point for the nearby Tempsford Airfield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mood of tranquility left her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the eighteenth-century elegance of the place, to her it symbolized the unbearable tension of the hours immediately before a flight into enemy territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were too late for lunch, but they got ~tea and sandwiches in the dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick drank her tea but felt too anxious to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the others tucked in heartily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterwards they were shown to their rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little later the women met in the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room looked more like the wardrobe of a film studio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were racks of coats and dresses, boxes of hats and shoes, cardboard cartons labeled Culotres Chausseue~ and Mouchoirs and a trestle table in the middle of the room with several sewing machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn charge of the operation was Madame Guillemin, a slim woman of about fifty in a shirtwaist dress with a chic little matching jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had spectacles on the end of her nose and a measuring tape around her neck, and she spoke to them in perfect French with a Parisian accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you know, French clothes are distinctively different from British clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t say they are more stylish, but, you know, they are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore stylish.\" She gave a French shrug, and the girls laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not just a question of style, Flick thought somberly: French jackets were normally about ten inches longer than British, and there were numerous differences of detail, any of which could be the fatal clue that betrayed an agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo all the clothes here had been bought in France, exchanged with refugees for new British clothes, or faithfully copied from French originals, then worn for a while so that they would not look new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now it is summer so we have cotton dresses, light wool suits, and shower proof coats.\" She waved a hand at two young women sitting at sewing machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My assistants will make alterations if the clothes don\u0027t fit quite perfectly.\" Flick said, \"We need clothes that are fairly expensive, but well worn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want us to look like respectable women in case we\u0027re questioned by the Gestapo.\" When they needed to pose as cleaners, they could quickly downgrade their appearance by taking off their hats, gloves, and belts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Guillemin began with Ruby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked hard at her for a minute, then picked from the rack a navy dress and a tan raincoat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a man\u0027s coat, but in France today no one can afford to be particular.\" She pointed across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can change behind that screen if you wish, and for the very shy there is a little anteroom behind the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe think the owner of the house used to lock himself in there to read dirty books.\" They laughed again, all but Flick, who had heard Madame Guillemin\u0027s jokes before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seamstress looked hard at Greta, then moved on, saying, \"I\u0027ll come back to you.\" She picked outfits for Jelly, Diana, and Maude, and they all went behind the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she turned to Flick and said in a low voice, \"Is this a joke?\" \"Why do you say that?\" She turned to Greta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a man.\" Flick gave a grunt of frustration and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seamstress had seen through Greta\u0027s disguise in seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a bad omen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame added, \"You might fool a lot of people, but not me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell.\" Greta said, \"How?\" Madame Guillemin shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The proportions are all wrong-your shoulders are too broad, your hips too narrow, your legs too muscular, your hands too big-it\u0027s obvious to an expert.\" Flick said irritably, \"She has to be a woman, for this mission, so please dress her as best you can.\" \"Of course-but for God\u0027s sake, try not to let her be seen by a dressmaker.\" \"No problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gestapo don\u0027t employ many of those.\" Flick\u0027s confidence was faked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not want Madame Guillemin to know how worried she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seamstress looked again at Greta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give you a contrasting skirt and blouse, to reduce your height, and a three-quarter-length coat.\" She selected clothes and handed them to Greta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta looked at them with disapproval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer taste ran to more glamorous outfits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, she did not complain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to be shy and lock myself in the anteroom,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Madame gave Flick an apple-green dress with a matching coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The color shows off your eyes,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as you\u0027re not ostentatious, why shouldn\u0027t you look pretty? It may help you charm your way out of trouble.\" The dress was loose and looked like a tent on Flick, but she put on a leather belt to give it a waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so chic, just like a French girl,\" said Madame Guillemin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick did not tell her that the main purpose of the belt was to hold a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all put on their new clothes and paraded around the room, preening and giggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Guillemin had chosen well, and they liked what they had been given, but some of the garments needed adjusting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While we are making alterations you can choose some accessories,\" Madame said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rapidly lost their inhibitions, and downed around in their underwear, trying on hats and shoes, scarves and bags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had momentarily forgotten the dangers ahead, Flick thought, and were taking simple pleasure in their new outfits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta came out of the anteroom looking surprisingly glamorous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick studied her with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had turned up the collar of the plain white blouse so that it looked stylish and wore the shapeless coat draped over her shoulders cloak-style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Guillemin raised an eyebrow but made no comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick\u0027s dress had to be shortened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile that was being done she studied the coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking undercover had given her a sharp eye for detail, and she anxiously checked the stitching, the lining, the buttons, and the pockets to make sure they were in the normal French style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found no fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe label in the collar said \"Galeries Lafayette.\" Flick showed Madame Guillemin her lapel knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only three inches long, with a thin blade, but it was wickedly sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had a small handle and no hilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came in a slim leather sheath pierced with holes for thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to sew this to the coat under the lapel,\" Flick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Guiflemin nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can do this.\" She gave them each a little pile of underwear, two of everything, all with the labels of French shops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith unerring accuracy she had picked not just the right size but the preferred style of each woman: corsets for Jelly, pretty lacy slips for Maude, navy knickers and boned brassieres for Diana, simple chemises and panties for Ruby and flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The handkerchiefs bear the laundry marks of different blanchisseries in Reims,\" said Madame Guillemin with a touch of pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she produced an assortment of bags: a canvas duffel, a gladstone bag, a rucksack, and a selection of cheap fiber suitcases in different colors and sizes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach woman got one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside she found a toothbrush, toothpaste, face powder, shoe polish, cigarettes and matches-all French brands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though they were going in only for a short time, Flick had insisted on the full kit for each of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember,\" Flick said, \"you may not take with you anything that you have not been given this afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour life depends on that.\" The giggling stopped as they remembered the danger they would face in a few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick said, \"All right, everybody, please go back to your rooms and change into your French outfits, including underwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we\u0027ll meet downstairs for dinner.\" In the main drawing room of the house a bar had been set up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Flick walked in, it was occupied by a dozen or so men, some in RAF uniform, all of them- Flick knew from previous visits-clestined to make clandestine flights over France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blackboard bore the names or code names of those who would leave tonight, together with the times they needed to depart from the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAristotle-19:50 Capt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenkins \u0026amp; Lieut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey-20:05 All Jackdaws-20:30 Colgate \u0026amp; Bunter-21:OO Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlister, Paradox, Saxophone-22:05\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at her watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was six-thirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat at the bar and looked around, wondering which of them would come back and which would die in the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome were terribly young, smoking and telling jokes, looking as if they had no cares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older ones looked hardened, and savored their whisky and gin in the grim knowledge it might be their last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about their parents, their wives or girlfriends, their babies and children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight\u0027s work would leave some of them with a grief that would never entirely go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer somber reflections were interrupted by a sight that astonished her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Fortescue, the slippery bureaucrat from MI6, walked into the bar in a pinstriped suit-accompanied by Denise Bowyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick\u0027s jaw dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felicity, I\u0027m so glad I caught you,\" said Simon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout waiting for an invitation he pulled up a stool for Denise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gin and tonic, please, barman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would you like, Lady Denise?\" \"A martini, very dry.\" \"And for you, Felicity?\" Flick did not answer the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s supposed to be in Scotland!\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, there seems to have been some misunderstanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenise has told me all about this policeman fellow-\" \"No misunderstanding,\" Flick said abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Denise failed the course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s all there is to it.\" Denise made a disgusted sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortescue said, \"I really don\u0027t see how a perfectly intelligent girl from a good family could fail-\" \"She\u0027s a blabbermouth.\" \"What?\" \"She can\u0027t keep her damn mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s not trustworthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shouldn\u0027t be walking around free!\" Denise said, \"You insolent cat.\" Fortescue controlled his temper with an effort and lowered his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, her brother is the Marquess of Inverlocky, who\u0027s very close to the Prime Minister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInverlocky himself asked me to make sure Denise got a chance to do her bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, you see, it would be dreadfully tactless to turn her down.\" Flick raised her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me get this straight.\" One or two of the men nearby looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a favor to your upper-class friend, you\u0027re asking me to take someone untrustworthy on a dangerous mission behind enemy lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that it?\" As she was speaking, Percy and Paul walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy glared at Fortescue with undisguised malevolence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul said, \"Did I hear right?\" Fortescue said, \"I\u0027ve brought Denise with me because it would be, frankly, an embarrassment to the government if she were left behind-\" \"And a danger to me if she were to come!\" Flick interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wasting your breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s off the team.\" \"Look, I don\u0027t want to have to pull rank-\" \"What rank?\" said Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I resigned from the Guards as a colonel-\" \"Retired!\" \"-and I\u0027m the civil service equivalent of a brigadier.\" \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" Flick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not even in the army.\" \"I\u0027m ordering you to take Denise with you.\" \"Then I\u0027ll have to consider my response,\" said Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sure you won\u0027t regret it.\" \"All right, here is my response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck off\" Fortescue went red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had probably never been told to flick off by a girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was uncharacteristically speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well!\" said Denise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve certainly found out what type of person we\u0027re dealing with.\" Paul said, \"You\u0027re dealing with me.\" He turned to Fortescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in command of this operation, and I won\u0027t have Denise on the team at any price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to argue, call Monty.\" \"Well said, my boy,\" Percy added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortescue found his voice at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wagged a finger at Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The time will come, Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClairet, when you will regret saying that to me.\" He got off his stool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry about this, Lady Denise, but I think we\u0027ve done all we can here.\" They left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid prat,\" Percy muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s have dinner,\" said Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others were already in the dining room, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Jackdaws began their last meal in England, Percy gave each of them an expensive gift: silver cigarette cases for the smokers, gold powder compacts for the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have French hallmarks, so you can take them with you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women were pleased, but he brought their mood back down with his next remark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have a purpose, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are items that can easily be pawned for emergency funds if you get into real trouble.\" The food was plentiful, a banquet by wartime standards, and the Jackdaws tucked in with relish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick did not feel very hungry, but she forced herself to eat a big steak, knowing it was more meat than she would get in a week in France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they finished supper, it was time to go to the airfield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey returned to their rooms to pick up their French bags, then boarded the bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took them along another country lane and across a railway line, then approached what looked like a cluster of farm buildings at the edge of a large, flat field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sign said Gibraltar Farm, but Flick knew that this was RAF Tempsford, and the barns were heavily disguised Nissen huts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went into what looked like a cowshed and found a uniformed RAF officer standing guard over steel racks of equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore they were given their gear, each of them was searched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA box of British matches was found in Maude\u0027s suitcase; Diana had in her pocket a half-completed crossword torn from the Daily Mirror, which she swore she had intended to leave on the plane; and Jelly, the inveterate gambler, had a pack of playing cards with \"Made in Binning- ham\" printed on every one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul distributed their identity cards, ration cards, and clothing coupons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach woman was given a hundred thousand French francs, mostly in grubby thousand- franc notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the equivalent of five hundred pounds, enough to buy two Ford cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey also got weapons, .45-caliber Colt automatic pistols and sharp double-bladed Commando knives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick declined both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took her personal gun, a Browning nine-millimeter automatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround her waist she wore the leather belt, into which she could push the pistol or, at a pinch, the submachine gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe also took her lapel knife instead of the Commando knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commando knife was longer and deadlier, but more cumbersome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe great advantage of the lapel knife was that when the agent was asked to produce papers, she could innocently reach toward an inside pocket, then at the last moment pull the knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition there was a Lee-Enfield rifle for Diana and a Sten Mark II submachine gun with silencer for Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plastic explosive Jelly would need was distributed evenly among the six women so that even if one or two bags were lost there would still be enough to do the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaude said, \"It might blow me up!\" Jelly explained that it was extraordinarily safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew a bloke who thought it was chocolate and ate some,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mind you,\" she added, \"it didn\u0027t half give him the runs.\" They were offered the usual round Mills grenades with the conventional turtleshell finish, but Flick insisted on general-purpose grenades in square cans, because they could also be used as explosive charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach woman got a fountain pen with a hollow cap containing a suicide pill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a compulsory visit to the bathroom before putting on the flying suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had a pistol pocket so that the agent could defend herself immediately on landing, if necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the suit, they donned helmet and goggles and finally shrugged into the parachute harness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul asked Flick to step outside for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had held back the all-important special passes that would enable the women to enter the chateau as cleaners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a Jackdaw were to be captured by the Gestapo, this pass would betray the true purpose of the mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor safety, he gave all the passes to Flick, to be distributed at the last minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed him back with desperate passion, clutching his body to hers, shamelessly thrusting her tongue into his mouth until she had to gasp for breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get killed,\" he said into her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were interrupted by a discreet cough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick smelled Percy\u0027s pipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke the clinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy said to Paul, \"The pilot is waiting for a word with you.\" Paul nodded and moved away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make sure he understands that Flick is the officer in command,\" Percy called after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Paul replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy looked grim, and Flick had a bad feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a sheet of paper from his jacket pocket and handed it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A motorcycle courier from London brought this from SOE headquarters just before we left the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came in from Brian Standish last night.\" He sucked anxiously on his pipe and blew out clouds of smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick looked at the sheet of paper in the evening sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a decrypt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts contents hit her like a punch in the stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, dismayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brian has been in the hands of the Gestapo!\" \"Only for a few seconds.\" \"So this claims.\" \"Any reason to think otherwise?\" \"Ah, fuck it,\" she said loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA passing airman looked up sharply, surprised to hear a woman\u0027s voice utter such words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick crumpled the paper and threw it on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy bent down, picked it up, and smoothed out the creases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s try to stay calm and think clearly.\" Flick took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a rule,\" she said insistently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any agent who is captured by the enemy, whatever the circumstances, must immediately be returned to London for debriefing.\" \"Then you\u0027ll have no wireless operator.\" \"I can manage without one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what about this Charenton?\" \"I suppose it\u0027s natural that Mademoiselle Lemas might have recruited someone to help her.\" \"All recruits are supposed to be vetted by London.\" \"You know that rule has never been followed.\" \"At a minimum they should be approved by the local commander.\" \"Well, he has been now-Michel is satisfied that Charenton is trustworthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Charenton saved Brian from the Gestapo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat whole scene in the cathedral can\u0027t have been deliberately staged, can it?\" \"Perhaps it never took place at all, and this message comes straight from Gestapo headquarters.\" \"But it has all the right security codes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, they wouldn\u0027t invent a story about his being captured and then released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d know that would arouse our suspicions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would just say he had arrived safely.\" \"You\u0027re right, but still I don\u0027t like it.\" \"No, nor do I,\" he said, surprising her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to take the risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no time for precautions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we don\u0027t disable the telephone exchange in the next three days it will be too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have to go anyway.\" Percy nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick saw that there were tears in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his pipe in his mouth and took it out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good girl,\" he said, his voice reduced to a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE SEVENTH DAY Saturday, June 3,1944
