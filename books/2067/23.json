If I cared what they thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mean that they think you\u0027d hurt me,\" Elena said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore. Or that you wouldn\u0027t protect me. I guess they worry that you might ... might make a pass at me. Or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon stopped and looked at her. Then he picked up her hand and held it, running one finger down the inside of her arm, tracing the vein that led from Elena\u0027s wrist to her elbow. \"And what do you think?\" he asked, smiling gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena snatched her hand back, glaring at him. \"Clearly they have a point,\" she said. \"Knock it off. Just friends, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing deeply, Damon started walking again, and Elena hurried to catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you decided to come to the party with me,\" she said eventual y. \"It\u0027l be fun.\" Damon shot her a velvet-black glance through his lashes but said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was always fun to be with Damon, Elena thought, listening to the clicking of her own heels and watching her shadow grow and disappear as they walked beneath the streetlights. Or at least, it was always fun when Damon was in a good mood and nothing was trying to kil them, two circumstances she wished coincided more often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan, sweet, darling Stefan, was the love of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no doubts about that. But Damon made her feel breathless and excited, swept up in something bigger than herself. Damon made her feel like she was special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was more easygoing than usual tonight. After Matt left, they\u0027d searched the library some more, and then Damon treated her to chips and soda in the basement vending-machine room. They sat at one of the little tables and talked and laughed. It wasn\u0027t anything fancy or elegant, nothing like the parties he\u0027d escorted her to in the Dark Dimension, but it was comfortable and fun, and when she looked at her phone, she was startled to see that more than an hour had passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now Damon even volunteered to come to a col ege keg party. Maybe he was trying to get along with her friends. Maybe they could real y be friends, once things somehow worked out between Stefan and him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena had reached this point in her musings when she suddenly got the unmistakable creepy-crawly feeling that she was being watched. The little hairs on the back of her neck stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damon,\" she said softly. \"There\u0027s someone watching us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon\u0027s pupils dilated as he sniffed the air. Elena could tel that he was sending out questing tendrils of Power, searching for an answering surge, for someone focusing on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" he said after a moment. He tucked his hand under her arm, pul ing her closer. \"It could just be your imagination, princess, but we\u0027l be careful.\" The leather of Damon\u0027s jacket was smooth against Elena\u0027s side, and she held tightly to him as they stepped out into the road that divided the campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust across from them, a car that had been idling at the curb gunned its engine. Its headlights blazed on, blinding Elena. Damon\u0027s arms locked around her waist, squeezing the breath out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car\u0027s tires squealed and it shot toward them. Elena panicked - oh God, oh God, she thought helplessly - and froze. Then she was sailing through the air, Damon holding her so tightly that it hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they hit the grass on the other side of the road, Damon paused for a moment, adjusting his grip on Elena, and Elena peered back at the car, which had passed where they were standing a moment before and skidded back around in a U-turn. She couldn\u0027t make out anything, not what kind of car it was nor anything about the driver; behind the bright lights, it was just a hulking dark shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hulking dark shape that was veering onto the grass and coming back after them. Damon swore and yanked her onward, running rather than flying now, Elena\u0027s feet barely touching the ground. Her heart was pounding. She could tel Damon was hampered from using his ful speed by keeping Elena close. They dodged around the corner of a building and leaned against its wal , surrounded by bushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car hurtled by, then turned, its wheels leaving long skid marks, and lumbered back to the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We lost him,\" Elena whispered, panting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annoy anyone lately, princess?\" Damon asked, his eyes sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should be asking you that,\" Elena retorted. Then she wrapped her arms around herself. She was so cold suddenly. \"Do you think it could have been because of the Vitale Society?\" she asked, her voice quavering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something about them and my parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know who or what could have been on the other side of that trapdoor,\" Damon replied somberly. \"Or maybe Matt...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Matt,\" Elena said firmly. \"Matt would never hurt me.\" Damon nodded. \"That\u0027s true. He\u0027s ridiculously honorable, your Matt.\" He gave her a little wry sideways smile. \"And he loves you. Everyone loves you, Elena.\" He shrugged out of his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One thing\u0027s certain, though. If the driver of that car thought I was human before, he knows differently now.\" Elena pul ed the jacket more tightly around herself. \"You saved me,\" she said in a tiny voice. \"Thank you.\" Damon\u0027s eyes were soft as he put his arms around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wil always save you, Elena,\" he promised. \"Don\u0027t you know that by now?\" His pupils dilated, and he pul ed her closer. \"I can\u0027t lose you,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena felt like she was fal ing. The world was being swal owed up in Damon\u0027s midnight eyes, and she was being drawn along with it, into the darkness. A tiny part of her said no, but despite it she leaned toward him and met his mouth with hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan tapped his fingers against the wal behind him, looked around at al the people jammed too close together: talking, laughing, arguing, drinking, dancing. His skin was crawling with anxiety. Where was she? Matt said he\u0027d seen her at the library more than an hour ago, that she had been planning on coming to the party then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking up his mind, Stefan began to push his way toward the exit. Maybe Elena didn\u0027t want him in contact with her right now, but people were dying and disappearing. It would be worth it to have her angry with him, as long as he knew that she was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe passed Meredith, deep in conversation with her friend, and said, \"I\u0027m going to find Elena.\" He had the quick impression of her faltering, starting to reach out a hand to stop him, but he left her behind. He pushed open the door and stepped out into the cool night air. Campus security was stil by the door checking IDs, but they let him pass without comment, only interested in people trying to come into the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the wind was rushing through the trees overhead and a crescent moon rode high and white above the buildings around him. Stefan sent his Power out around him, feeling for the distinct traces of Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t sense anything, not yet. There were too many people too close together here, and Stefan could only feel the tangled traces of thousands of humans, their emotions and life force mixing together in one great underlying buzz from which it was impossible for him, at this distance, to pick out any particular individual, even one as singular as Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he had fed on human blood recently, it would have been easier. Stefan couldn\u0027t help thinking longingly of the way that Power had surged through him when he drank regularly from his friends. But that was when Fel \u0027s Church needed his best defense against the kitsune. He wouldn\u0027t drink human blood just for pleasure or convenience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan started walking quickly across the quad, stil sending out questing fingers of Power around and ahead of himself. If he couldn\u0027t locate Elena that way, he would head for where she was last seen. He hoped that, as he got closer to the library, his Power would pick up some hint of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis whole body was thrumming anxiously. What if Elena had been attacked, what if she mysteriously vanished and never returned, leaving him with this strange distance as their last memory of each other? Stefan walked faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was halfway to the library when the distinctive sense of Elena hit him like a punch. Somewhere nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scanned left and right and then he saw her. A terrible pain shot through his chest, as if he could actual y feel his heart breaking. She was kissing Damon. They were half hidden in the shadows, but their light skin and Elena\u0027s blond hair shone. They were focused only on each other, so much so that, despite his Power, Damon wasn\u0027t aware of Stefan\u0027s presence, not even when he walked right up to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this why you wanted to take some time apart, Elena?\" Stefan asked, his voice sounding hol ow and distant. Final y noticing him, they broke away from each other, Elena\u0027s face pale with shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan,\" she said. \"Please, Stefan, no, it\u0027s not what it looks like.\" She reached out a hand toward him, then drew it back uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything seemed so far away to Stefan; he was aware that he was shaking, his mouth was dry, but it felt almost as if he was watching someone else in pain. \"I can\u0027t do this,\" he said. \"Not again. If I fight for you, I\u0027l just end up destroying us al . Just like with Katherine.\" Elena was shaking her head back and forth, her hands stretched out toward him imploringly again. \"Please, Stefan,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" Stefan said again, backing away, his voice thin and desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, for the first time, he looked at Damon, and a redhot rage slammed into him, overriding the numb distance instantly. \"Al you do is take,\" Stefan told him bitterly. \"This is the last time. We\u0027re not brothers anymore.\" Damon\u0027s face opened for a split second in dismay, his eyes widening, as if he was about to speak, and then he hardened again, his mouth twisting scornful y, and he jerked his head at Stefan. Very well, that gesture indicated, then get lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan stumbled backward, and then he turned and ran, moving with al the supernatural grace and speed at his command, leaving them far behind even as Elena screamed, \"Stefan!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-23.html","bookId":2067,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:18:43 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:18:43 AM"}
