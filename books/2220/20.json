Maybe he didn’t have time to arrange for a fence that could handle such a big job. Maybe he did hide it in his backyard, like Berglund suggested. Question was, where was his backyard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was while I was attempting to answer that question that the Nordic princess I noticed earlier abruptly pulled out the chair on the opposite side of the table from me and sat down. Up close she looked like a romance novel cliché—perfect teeth in a perfect mouth formed into a perfect smile, eyes sparkling like liquid azurite, hair as lustrous as spun gold. She was wearing a black pencil skirt with a pleated hem and a long-sleeve scoop-neck T-shirt made from some stretch fabric that clung to her athletic body like damp cloth. I would have dropped a pencil so I’d have an excuse to duck under the table and examine her legs except that it was too juvenile even for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe extended her hand. “Good morning, Mr. McKenzie. I’m Heavenly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course you are,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heavenly Petryk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook her hand. There was strength in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your parents named you Heavenly?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some might argue it’s a couple of steps above Rushmore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know my name. Should I be impressed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Considering how quickly you learned the names of my friends yesterday, I wouldn’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ted and Wally are your friends?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavenly held her right hand out for me to see and gave it a waggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More like acquaintances,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to admit to myself, beautiful young women didn’t often accost me in libraries. In fact, the last time it happened was never. So I had to ask, “What do you want from me, Heavenly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My friends call me Hep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hep?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My initials—Heavenly Elizabeth Petryk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we get to be friends, I’ll call you that, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I know we’ll be friends. In the meantime, I would like you to stop researching Jelly Nash. That’s what you’re doing, isn’t it? I recognize some of the boxes.” I don’t know why, but I closed the file in front of me. “Stop your research, return the materials to the desk, and meet me in the café downstairs for a coffee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would I do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavenly spoke loudly—“Because it’ll be more comfortable”—causing heads to turn and someone to go “Shhhhhh.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That explains why we should speak elsewhere,” I said. “Not why we should speak.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe batted her eyelashes. “Most men don’t need a reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I told myself, and there was a time not long ago when I would have lined up like those men. Yet despite evidence to the contrary, I was older now and more mature. At least that’s what I told myself—remember, I didn’t drop the pencil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need a greater incentive than that,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll buy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll meet you in five minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCafé Minnesota, located on the ground floor of the Minnesota History Center, seemed out of place. While all the other rooms and exhibits in the building had a kind of sylvan appeal—plenty of wood, plenty of natural fibers—the café was decidedly new age, all black and silver and shiny surfaces. I sat in a chair that might have been borrowed from the ultramodern Walker Art Center and waited while Heavenly retrieved my black coffee. I tried not to stare at her legs when she returned and set a plastic tray on top of the metal table. Along with my coffee, it held an ice cream coffee drink topped with whipped cream, and a brownie with about an inch of chocolate frosting sprinkled with chopped walnuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t look like a girl who eats a lot of desserts,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she said, speaking around a bite of brownie. “I look like a girl who exercises every day because she eats a lot of desserts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Touché.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re working for that asshole Josh Berglund, aren’t you?” Heavenly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With,” I said. “Not for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Him and that bitch Ivy Flynn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss Flynn happens to be a friend of mine, so kindly keep your insults to yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm,” Heavenly hummed as she finished off another bite of brownie. “You object when I diss Ivy, but not Josh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might want to keep that in mind in the future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have nothing against Ivy except that she’s seeing Josh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why should you care?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavenly dropped the remainder of the brownie on the plate and pushed it away as if she suddenly had no taste for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, said, “Josh and I,” paused again as if she were searching for the right words, said, “We had been seeing each other. We met at the U and stayed … friends, even after I took my master’s and left and got a job working as a writer and researcher while he went for his Ph.D.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jelly-s-gold-mac-mckenzie-6/page-20.html","bookId":2220,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:33 PM"}
