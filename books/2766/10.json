Did you kiss her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you!\" I attempt to shove him away from me, but the guy is like a solid rock of muscle. He grips my wrists and holds them away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kissed Nathan, remember?\" he says, his eyes blazing. \"And now you say you\u0027re dating him. Is that true, Amy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not!\" Nathan calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrow my eyes at Nathan. \"There\u0027s no need to keep us a secret anymore, Nathan. I told Avi about us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan\u0027s words are cut short when Jess pushes him into our team\u0027s ditch and he falls right onto Tori.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your honor and integrity, Avi?\" I throw back the words he said to me back in January when he found out I\u0027d kissed Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said we shouldn\u0027t be exclusive. You said it wasn\u0027t realistic to think we wouldn\u0027t be attracted to other people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of him being attracted to Liron is too much for me to deal with. \"I was just saying that,\" I yell at him. \"I didn\u0027t want you to actually do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lets go of my wrists as if they\u0027re on fire and he\u0027s about to get burned. \"Next time, say what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you meant it when you said you wanted to marry me one day? It was all lies, Avi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know that\u0027s not true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cheating boyfriends become cheating husbands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t chea--\" Avi runs his hand over his grown-out buzz cut. \"Just let me know. Are we breaking up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That depends. Did you kiss Liron just once?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three times?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me, Avi. Three times?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t count.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should have. What did you think, that you could just fast for Yom Kippur come September, repent it one day, and God would wipe your sinning slate clean? What, you think God has only one book? I bet he\u0027s got lots of books, Avi, just filled with names of sinners. Because while God may inscribe you in the Book of Life for another year, he\u0027s probably also inscribing you in the Book of Cheaters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes get darker when he\u0027s angry. They\u0027re definitely dark now. \"Whatever, Amy. I can\u0027t talk to you when you\u0027re being irrational. If God\u0027s got a Book of Irrational People, you\u0027re at the top of the list.\" He whips off his backpack and picks up our team shovel from the ground. \"Get out,\" he orders Tori and Nathan, who immediately scramble out of the ditch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi sheds his military vest. We all watch in awe as Avi finishes digging in less than three minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he\u0027s done, we get back in formation and start marching back to base. After a half hour, he gives us a five-minute break and orders us to drink from our canteens. He does this every half hour. When we reach the base, he orders us to drink what\u0027s left in our canteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m too angry to drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps in front of me. I can feel the heat of the mid-morning sun, but I can also feel the heat of Avis gaze on me. \"Amy, finish the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I already did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might be just a sheep farmer to you back at the moshav, but here I outrank you whether you like it or not. Drink it all, or you\u0027ll dump whatever\u0027s left in the canteen on your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bee decides to hover between us. I hate bees almost as much as spiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a bee about to sting us,\" I say, hoping to make him flinch, or at least get a reaction to remind me he\u0027s human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo such luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink or dump,\" he orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could drink what\u0027s left in my canteen, but my ego is fragile and rebellious. I\u0027m holding on to the little control I have left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir!\" I say sarcastically, then salute my now ex-boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly lift my canteen over my head. Avi is watching intently. I\u0027m pretty sure the odds are 80 percent he\u0027ll stop me before a drop of liquid lands on my head, 20 percent he\u0027ll let me go through with the water-dumping. He has always come to my rescue in the past. This time, though, he\u0027s the one I need rescuing from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my canteen is directly over my head, I realize there\u0027s a 100 percent chance he won\u0027t stop me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePouring water on myself means that my straightened hair will end up a random, curly mess. I can\u0027t do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clench my teeth and lift my chin in defiance. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi grabs my canteen, lifts it over my head, and turns it upside down. Water rushes down my scalp, making the hairs on the back of my neck stick straight up. It drips onto my neck and runs down my back Little rivers run down my face. I must look ridiculous, and it\u0027s all Avis fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cooled off yet?\" Avi asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not by a long shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoves the empty canteen in my hand, then eyes the rest of the team. \"When you\u0027re finished, hold your canteen above your head and turn it upside down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few people quickly drink what\u0027s left in their canteen, making sure not to leave a drop. I\u0027m the only one with a mid-morning sprinkle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m trying not to pay attention to Avi, but I can\u0027t help it. Against my better judgment, I focus on his lips. They\u0027re full and soft to the touch--I know because I\u0027ve felt them with my fingers and my own lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgh. I cannot believe Liron had her lips against his. I shudder just thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Avi dismisses us to our bittan for cleanup time, I corner Nathan in the courtyard in front of the girls\u0027 barracks. I wrap my arms around his neck and kiss him lightly on the lips. \"Please play along while Avi\u0027s watching,\" I whisper in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the devil,\" he says. \"Stay away from me while your boyfriend\u0027s around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not my boyfriend,\" I assure him as I shoo away another hovering bee. \"Not anymore, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither am I, so stop telling everyone I am. I\u0027m trying to get into Tori\u0027s pants, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eww. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s cute, she\u0027s a dancer... I even hear she\u0027s double-jointed. I\u0027ve never been with a double-jointed girl before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sick, and totally acting like Kyle, the biggest perv in school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a. guy, Amy. What do you expect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp until a few weeks ago, Nathan was still obsessed with his ex-girlfriend Bicky. Not Becky... Bicky. She\u0027s a total druggie and has made Nathan\u0027s life miserable, which is the main reason he came on the Sababa trip. He has to get over Bicky, but replacing one bitch with another is definitely not the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just smile and pretend you love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles, puts his arm around my shoulders, and leads me to the barracks. \"I do love you, Amy. As a friend. And as a friend I\u0027m going to tell you that I\u0027d like to keep my ball sacs intact and not piss off your boyfriend or ex-boyfriend or whatever he is. He\u0027s got a gun bigger than my entire arm. And isn\u0027t that thing attached to the bottom of it a grenade launcher? Geez, Amy, even his gun is pimped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spill the beans to Nathan softly, as if nobody else knows yet. \"He\u0027s been fooling around with Liron. He\u0027s probably dating her for all I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Our entire team got the rundown before he finished our ditch, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you feel sorry for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, didn\u0027t you tell me during your conversion class that God gives us challenges to test how strong we are? Maybe this is your test.\" Now two bees are hovering around us. Nathan shoos them away. \"Were bees one of the ten plagues back in Moses\u0027 time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, God is obviously sending them as the eleventh plague. We had a bunch buzzing around our bunks yesterday. It\u0027s a miracle we haven\u0027t gotten stung.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe talk of plagues and getting stung makes me look for Avi. He\u0027s talking to a guy from Sayeret Tzefa, and looks murderous as he stares down Nathan and me. He tries to walk over to us, but the guy he\u0027s with pulls him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan taps my shoulder. \"Talk to him and find out what the deal is, Amy. \u0027Cause I\u0027m not gonna act like your boyfriend just so you can save face. That\u0027s a cop-out, and the Amy Nelson-Barak I know isn\u0027t a coward or a cop-out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like Rabbi Glassman,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan smiles wide, proud to be put in the same category as my awesome rabbi who sponsored my conversion to Judaism. He stands tall and proud, as if he\u0027s Abraham Lincoln addressing the United States Senate (without the top hat, of course). \"Yes, well I\u0027m smart beyond my seventeen years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right. You just said you wanted to date Tori because she was double-jointed. You sounded like an idiot then. Don\u0027t push that \u0027smart beyond my seventeen years\u0027 crap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo, Nate, we gotta do cleanup!\" Brandon, another guy on the Sababa trip, calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan chucks me under the chin. \"I gotta go, Amy. While I probably just signed my death warrant by talking to you for so long, I have to go before Susu starts his inspection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girls\u0027 inspection in fifteen minutes!\" Ronit calls out. \"Nathan, you better not drag your feet. You should have been at the guys\u0027 barracks five minutes ago!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan jogs off, his sandy blond, bed-head hair bouncing with each step and his shirt sticking to his back from the heat of the Israeli sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBees are God\u0027s little reminder not to get too comfortable in life; something or someone is going to come out and sting you when you least expect it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk into the girls\u0027 barracks (which is now a sauna because the stifling air doesn\u0027t move in here). I\u0027m surprised my bed is already made, with perfectly tight hospital corners. Even my wool blanket is folded neatly at the foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic, who just finished making her bunk above me, clues me in. \"Jessica did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turn around, my best friend gives me a big hug. I haven\u0027t told her what\u0027s up with Avi, but she obviously guessed from the conversation we had back at our ditch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I guess that Avi guy isn\u0027t your boyfriend anymore, huh?\" Tori says. \"That\u0027s so... sad. Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m holding it together by a thin thread, lucky to have Jess beside me for support in the face of Tori\u0027s fake concern I don\u0027t believe for a minute that she cares about me and Avi. In fact, I catch a glimmer of triumph in her eyes. I wish a bee was around to sting her in the butt. I know that\u0027s rude, and Rabbi Glassman would say that wishing someone harm isn\u0027t being a righteous Jew. I can\u0027t help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGirls my age either love me or hate me, and I have no clue why it\u0027s so cut-and-dried. Jess says it\u0027s because I come across as confident, and even if I have insecurities I cover them up at all costs. So when the haters see a glimpse into my misery, they\u0027re all over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a big deal,\" I tell Tori as I kneel next to my bed and pull my flat iron out. \"You can find someone else to worry about \u0027cause you\u0027re wasting your pity on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plug it in (with the 220 voltage converter attached), thankful for (1) the lone outlet in the room and (2) that my trusty flat iron heats up in thirty seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hair is already dry from the mid-morning heat. I sit on the floor next to the outlet with my travel mirror and brush in hand, ready to make the curls disappear. Balancing the mirror between my knees, I clamp the flat iron and get to work on the frizzy, curly pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re doing your hair when we\u0027re supposed to be cleaning,\" one of the New York girls says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up, I explain. \"I can\u0027t have half my hair curly and half straight. That would look stupid.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-10.html","bookId":2766,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM"}
