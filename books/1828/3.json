{"id":88670,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eDr. Brent Westfield was the chief of surgery at St. Vincent’s. He had just rounded the corner. Spotting Ellie, he barked, “What are you doing here, Prod? Aren’t you off this weekend? Of course you are. Do I have to remind you that, as of two weeks ago, we are all following new guidelines? No exceptions. You know that.” He glanced at his Gucci sports watch and added, “You should have signed out two hours ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew guidelines. Right. Exasperated, Ellie simply nodded. It was true. According to the new hospital policy, residents and fellows could be on duty only a certain number of hours in a twenty-four-hour day; but there was a big loophole, one little phrase in the guidelines that made them useless: unless there was an emergency. And funny thing, there was always an emergency. Ellie was certain the contingency was just a clever way for the hospital to appear to be following the guidelines while working the residents until they were dead on their feet. In reality, the new guidelines weren’t that different from the old ones, and Westfield knew it. He was just in the mood to hassle her, she decided, probably because he was irritated that she hadn’t signed a contract to stay with the hospital… at least not yet. She was still contemplating where she wanted to live and what she wanted to do-trauma center or general surgery. And she also had to take into account Evan Patterson. Where was he hiding? How could she make a decision without knowing where he was? Ellie was so tired now, nothing sounded good to her, but she knew she would have to make her decision soon because, even with all the scholarships and grants she had received, she owed a little over two hundred thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want me to get in trouble with the board?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he kidding? The board of directors loved him. It was such a bogus question, she didn’t bother to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWestfield abruptly turned to Max. “And who is this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie knew he had noticed the FBI badge hooked to the left side of Max’s belt and the gun holstered on the opposite side, but she didn’t comment on it or mention that Max’s navy blue T-shirt had big yellow FBI letters conspicuously printed across the back. Instead, she quickly made the introductions, and the two men shook hands. The chief had always been a commanding figure to Ellie because of his position of power, his aggressive tactics, and most important, his skill in the operating room, but standing next to the FBI agent who towered over him, Westfield suddenly didn’t seem so intimidating. Max was more imposing. The agent radiated strength and confidence. She strongly doubted he was as contentious as the chief, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard there was a shooting outside the hospital doors. Is that right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it happened close to the hospital,” Max answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWestfield waited for the agent to expound and was sorely disappointed. Usually, the chief’s intense frown, pursed lips, and unnerving silence was enough to make the people he was interrogating so uneasy they would blurt out all sorts of information. His tactics weren’t working on Max.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three men were killed?” he prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, that’s right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother ten seconds passed in silence. Then the chief asked, “An FBI agent was shot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie was trying not to smile. Westfield had to be frustrated. By using his stern tone and his most serious scowl, he was doing his best to push the agent into giving an explanation, but it wasn’t working. Apparently, Max couldn’t be intimidated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chief abruptly turned to Ellie. “Who did the surgery on the agent?” And before she could answer, he added, “It couldn’t have been you because you’re off duty, aren’t you? And you aren’t on call this weekend. So who did the surgery? Was it Walmer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWestfield knew she had operated on the agent. The man knew everything that went on inside the hospital. He was just trying to exert his power and make her squirm. Four more days under his thumb, she reminded herself, just four more days and she was free. She needed to suck it up until then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sir, Dr. Walmer didn’t do the surgery.” Taking Max’s lead, she didn’t say another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Edmonds?” he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then who operated?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glare was back in place. “Even though you were off duty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir, even though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t give me attitude, Sullivan,” he said, pointing a finger at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax kept expecting Ellie to tell Westfield that Agent Goodman had pleaded with her to do the surgery, but she didn’t. She didn’t offer any excuses. She simply stared Westfield in the eyes and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Help me understand,” he began in his best sarcastic voice. “Why didn’t you notify Walmer or Edmonds to hightail it to the OR?” And once again he didn’t give her time to answer the question before posing another. “Do you think you’re a better surgeon than they are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t hesitate. “Yes, sir, I do. Absolutely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax could tell Westfield was pleased with her answer but trying not to let her know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re arrogant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie was about to say, “Thank you,” but caught herself in time. “Yes, sir, I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was true. When it came to her work, she was arrogant, just like all the other surgeons in the hospital. It came with the territory and, in Ellie’s opinion, was a necessary requirement. When a surgeon held a scalpel in her hand and was about to cut open a patient, she had better have skill and almost superhuman confidence. Ellie honestly didn’t think there was such a thing as a timid surgeon, and if there was, she certainly wouldn’t want him cutting on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, none of her self-assuredness and arrogance spilled over into her personal life. During her last trip home, she had been told by her sister Ava that she was depressingly insecure. But, since Ava was the sister who was marrying Ellie’s ex-fiancé, she wasn’t inclined to listen to anything she had to say. Ava’s twin, Annie, was living in San Diego and hadn’t had a chance to weigh in on Ellie’s faults. She would side with Ava, of course, but she would be much kinder about it. Despite her sisters’ persistence, Ellie would disagree with both of them. She wasn’t depressingly insecure. Just mildly so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie suddenly realized she was zoning out. Now wasn’t the time to think about personal problems. She’d have plenty of time for that once she was home. Focus, she told herself. Westfield was chatting with Max again, probably telling him how to do his job. She took a deep breath in an attempt to get more oxygen to her befuddled brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWestfield turned back to her, his index finger just inches from her face. “You. Get out of here. Now.” He didn’t snarl the order, but he came close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie watched him as he strode toward ICU. He shoved the doors out of his way, looked over his shoulder, and snapped, “And sign the contract.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors automatically closed behind him. She sighed and, in a faint Southern accent, said, “Isn’t he sweet? We all just love him to pieces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax laughed. “How long have you been taking orders from him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why does he call you Prod?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “He likes to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started walking down the long hallway with Max at her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does it mean?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she didn’t immediately answer, he glanced down at her and saw her cheeks were flushed. She was embarrassed, and that only piqued his interest all the more. He let the question go for now. “Did I hear you call him a dinosaur? When I asked you who he was…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “You don’t see the resemblance? Actually, I usually call him ‘T. rex.’ I think it’s more personal. When he’s on a roar-which is ninety percent of the time-he does remind me of a gigantic, prehistoric beast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was moving at a fast clip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellie, hold up. Where are you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Upstairs to get my keys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to sit down and-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept right on going. Max was becoming frustrated. “Do you run everywhere you go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty much,” she admitted. She slowed to a normal pace… normal for her, anyway. She noticed that Max had no trouble keeping up with her. In fact, with his long legs, he barely had to increase his stride beyond a stroll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over at him. He was definitely out of her comfort zone. The man had so much testosterone, he made her nervous. He didn’t scare her, though. When he smiled, the corners of his eyes creased, and there was a glint in them that made her shiver inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeez, get a grip, Sullivan. She was acting like a sex-starved teenager. Granted, it had been a long time since she had been with a man-a long, long time-but, still, her reaction to Max went beyond bizarre. It was completely contrary to her usual calm, rational nature. When she had time, she would figure out her weird behavior. There had to be some logical explanation. But then, maybe she didn’t really have to worry about it at all because, as soon as Max questioned her about the shooting, he’d be on his way, and she would be sane again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax noticed that she kept looking at him with a puzzled expression on her face. “What is it?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “Nothing important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not going to be much help with descriptions I’m afraid,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to take your statement anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another agent, Ben MacBride, and I are working this together, and we have to question you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” she agreed. “Where is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the crime scene,” he answered. Where I should be, he silently added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you start asking your questions while you walk with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doesn’t work that way. I’m going to record what you say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, then we need to find someplace quiet, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie passed a bank of elevators and continued on to the stairs. “I’ll grab my things, and we can get out of here. I stand a better chance of actually leaving if you’re with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “You’ve got a gun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax kept pace as she ran up three flights. “You have a thing against elevators? A phobia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the only exercise I get.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were running the track when the shooting started, weren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you figure that out?” she asked, taking the steps a little slower while she waited for his answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m an FBI agent, trained to be observant,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, please. You thought I was one of the kids on that high school soccer team.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “Yeah, I did,” he admitted. “One of the other agents told me you were running the track.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could laugh at himself. What an appealing trait, she thought. She liked that quality in a man… Seriously! What was happening to her? She really needed to get away from him as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You haven’t answered my question. Is it a phobia or just a quirk?” he wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do the stairs and I run the track and I don’t particularly like being crammed inside a little metal box with a bunch of other people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “So that’s a yes. You do have a phobia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably, she thought, but she wasn’t going to admit it. She did ride in elevators with patients when she had to. She didn’t like it, but she did it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do you keep your things? On the roof?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just here.” Ellie entered the hallway on the fourth floor and opened the door to a dark room filled with lockers. She switched on a light and walked to the third one on the left. Had she been alone, she would have locked the door and changed into jeans and a T-shirt, but she wasn’t alone, so she was going to have to stay in her scrubs. She didn’t like wearing them outside the hospital, but she didn’t have a choice now. She pulled out her backpack, put some of her clothes inside, grabbed her keys from the top shelf, and was ready to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed him to the stairwell, appreciating the fact that he wasn’t pushing the issue with the elevators. When his cell phone rang, he stopped on a landing to answer, and she stopped to wait for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax’s partner, Ben MacBride, was on the line and wanted help with a couple of uncooperative witnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, okay, I’ll be there in five.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on,” Ben said. “Agent Hughes wants to talk to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Max was waiting for Ben to get Hughes, he turned to Ellie. She stood on the step above him, and her eyes were level with his. He found it impossible not to stare at her. The woman was breathtaking. Her eyes were the most intense shade of blue. Her nose was dotted with freckles, which he found damn alluring, and her mouth… ah, man, he really needed to stop staring. He was already conjuring up all sorts of fantasies involving her full, luscious lips, and he was going to be in real trouble if he let his eyes wander lower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax didn’t wait for Hughes to get on the line. He abruptly ended the call, turned, and continued down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are we going to do this?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. Now, that was a leading question, considering where his thoughts had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go home.” His voice was brisk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he said, glancing back at her. “You can go home, and we’ll come to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great,” she said. “I can get out of these scrubs. Let me give you my address…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cell phone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got that, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But how-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a witness. I had all your information downloaded to my phone while I was waiting for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You Googled me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I didn’t need to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie wondered what she would find if she Googled him. Under “occupation” would it say he was an FBI agent and give her the number of criminals he’d apprehended… and shot? No, of course not. His profile probably wouldn’t tell her whether he was involved with anyone or whether he was married, either. She had taken the time to notice that he wasn’t wearing a wedding band, and something told her that, if he was married, he would always wear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, why would she make that assumption? She wasn’t clairvoyant, and the truth was, she didn’t know anything about him other than he carried a badge, could be quite intimidating at times, and had a great smile. Was she making him admirable because she wanted him to be? From what she knew about the FBI-which was precious little-outsiders weren’t privy to personal information, but she might Google him anyway just to appease her curiosity. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ideal-man-buchanan-renard-9/page-3.html","bookId":1828,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:24 PM"}
