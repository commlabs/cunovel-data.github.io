Her work gloves were lightweight, but would be a bitch for any zombie to bite through. She was overheated already, but they had to stay safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey slowly approached the Dollar Store. It was hard to see inside past the advertisements taped to the windows. The lights were off; the gloom was unwelcoming. Bill went down on his knees before the door and started to pick the lock. Busting the door open would be the last resort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha. I bet everyone thought the black man would be doing that,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix remarked with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You learn things on the job being a cop,” Bill said somberly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t care if you\u0027re black or white or brown or whatever,” Ed said, “just as long as you don\u0027t turn green and bite me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni laughed and Felix smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill\u0027s brow furrowed as he concentrated. After a moment, he smiled. With a twist of his wrist, the lock spun, and the door opened slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all gagged at once. The smell coming out of the store was putrid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fucking shit,” Felix gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We got a dead one in there all right,” Ed said grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill crawled away from the door, his eyes watering, trying to get a clean breath of air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni pulled her bandana up over her nose. “Gawd, that is awful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enclosed space and rotting dead stuff; not a good combo. Let\u0027s do this, people,” Ed said, pushing the door all the way open with one foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared into the gloom, his rifle with the makeshift bayonet at the end at the ready. “Hey!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice filled the store. A low growl answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s dead and talking,” Ed said somberly, and walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix moved in right behind him as Bill climbed to his feet and joined Jenni. He wiped his eyes and cheeks with a bandana, then nodded to her. His eyes were still smarting, but he looked ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni slid into the darkened interior slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. The Store\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front of the store was empty except for a line of small shopping carts. Both checkout stands stood empty. Jenni walked cautiously toward the first aisle to the right as Ed and Felix moved to check out the left side of the store. Bill peered behind the checkout stands just to make sure they were truly empty. He held his machete at the ready, but with a swift motion of his head, indicated nothing lingered there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni lifted the ax a little higher as she headed down the first aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was loaded up with makeup and all sorts of lotions. A lone bottle of shampoo lay in the middle of the aisle. She scooted it out of her way with the tip of her boot. Bill moved up alongside her, close enough for Jenni to hear his steady breathing. It was comforting. Slowly, she edged around the corner, looking into the aisle that cut down the side of the store. It was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, they advance slowly to the next aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd and Felix were obviously not finding anything as well, but the stench and low moans told them all quite clearly something was dead in the store and still moving. The aisle packed with baby supplies made Jenni\u0027s head swim for a moment, but she shoved any thoughts of Benji out of her mind and set her jaw determinedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aisle was clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill moved up toward the next aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother low moan reverberated through the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is anyone alive in here?” Felix\u0027s voice called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother low moan, not a screech, but a moan, answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you\u0027re human and hurt, say something,” Felix went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere, the moan grew into a hungry growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep, zombie,” Ed said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For sure,” Felix agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill froze for a second as they reached the aisle full of photo books and frames. A lot of merchandise lay on the floor, broken and smashed. Slowly, Jenni lifted her eyes upwards. An arm dangled off the shelf over the display of cheap, but cute frames. It was savagely bitten in several places. A low moan came from the shelf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Found one,” Bill called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombie moaned. Its arm twitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I bet he crawled up there to get away,” Jenni whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombie, wedged tightly between two metal shelves, wiggled anxiously, knowing human flesh was nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do we do this?” Bill looked perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni motioned to the zombie\u0027s foot. “Drag it down and deal with it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill frowned deeply. “Could go wrong on the way down. Could twist around and land on us or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombie thrashed around still unable to free itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let\u0027s go to the other side,” Jenni suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill and Jenni crept around to the other aisle, this one loaded down with all sorts of household supplies. The zombie\u0027s other leg and arm were hanging out on this side. It was a young man, probably in his late teens. If he hadn’t such a slim build, he may have never wedged himself between the two metal shelves. He saw them and thrashed even more, growling. Jenni looked around her and spotted a small stepladder used to stock the higher shelves. It was toppled over on its side and she bet the kid had used it to climb up out of the way of a zombie. Grabbing it, she dragged it over in front of the zombie. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see its decaying hand reaching out desperately to get her, but she was out of reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold me,” Jenni ordered Bill, then stepped up to the top step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill\u0027s big hands grabbed her hips and held her tightly. Jenni was now face to face with the zombie. Its hand waved in front of her eyes, straining desperately to reach her. The kid\u0027s face was stained with his tears and blood. She felt sorry for him. He didn\u0027t look that much older than Jason. But, regardless of his youth, his time was done on this earth. She was ready to send him on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swung her ax as hard as she could into the face of the zombie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed her wrist just as the ax head buried itself into his skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost as soon as his fingers gripped her, they went slack. Jenni wrenched the ax out of his dead features. Bill tightened his grip on her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One more whack to be sure,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swung the ax again and felt it cleave the zombie head in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she was sure it was over. Black goo slid out over the edge of the shelf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s done!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice echoed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low moan from the back of the store answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds like we got another one,” Ed called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I figured that. This one climbed up on a shelf to escape something,” Bill answered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA more desperate moan answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni dropped off the stepladder and held her dripping ax tightly in her hands. She felt a little sick about the death of the kid. The first death, not the one she had given him. The world was just fucked and awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next area was full of hanging clothes and bedding supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni and Bill made sure to study any shelving above eye level. The moans they kept hearing were from the back of the store, but they were very cautious as they moved on. They had to be. It was far too dangerous to let their guard down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Found her,” Felix called out. “She\u0027s on your side. And you won\u0027t believe this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill and Jenni finally reached the back of the store and turned the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA female zombie was reaching toward Felix and Ed who were approaching her from the opposite side of the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to be fucking kidding me,” Jenni said and almost laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground was covered in overturned trash bins of all sizes, plastic clothesbaskets, and plastic storage containers. They were splashed with blood and it was obvious a struggle had happened here. At some point, the female zombie had stepped into a bucket and caught her foot in it. As she had tried to pass between the metal shelves and a support column, her foot in the bucket had become wedged. Unable to move her foot, she was simply standing there moaning. Jenni couldn\u0027t see her face, but her body looked slim and young. She wondered if this was the one who had bitten the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kinda dumb, ain\u0027t they?” Ed smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni heaved the ax over her head and brought it down hard onto the zombie\u0027s head. It wedged halfway into the thing\u0027s skull. The zombie slowly collapsed down to the floor and Jenni yanked the blade out of the dead girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill leaned down and looked at the zombie thoughtfully. “There is a bite on her hand. Only mark other than her head being split apart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, she gets bit, dies, attacks the boy here, he gets bit up, she gets caught, he goes and climbs onto a shelf.” Felix nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And he dies. Makes sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni frowned down at the body. “But who bit her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They\u0027re both wearing vests and name tags. Boxes are open in the aisles. They were early morning stockers. Do you think she came in bit?” Bill looked thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, they all looked toward the door to the storeroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great,” Felix moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We do this right and careful,” Ed said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of them slowly moved toward the swinging metal doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battered metal doors swung open into a long narrow room filled with boxes piled along one wall almost to the ceiling. At the far end was the open door to a narrow bathroom. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fighting-to-survive-as-the-world-dies-2/page-5.html","bookId":2482,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:58:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:58:30 PM"}
