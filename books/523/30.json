There’s nothing to draw them, here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the emission of a sharper click from some unlocated point he felt his spine chill, his nerves grew tense and a queer, uneasy feeling ran over his muscles, an involuntary tremble.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What could make such a sound?” he pondered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he drew his legs in under him as he sat with his back against the metal sheathing of a corner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The small, side door, toward the Sound shore, was opening!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was a complication for which nothing had been planned. Larry and Mr. Whiteside, Dick knew, were lying in the shadow of the hedge behind the hangar, watching the cleverly devised back entry way.\n\u003cbr\u003e 247\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Because it had been supposed that the “ghost”—Jeff—or whoever it was, would use that means of getting in, Dick’s own position had been chosen. He had selected a place sharply diagonal in direction from it. In his corner he could not be seen in the beam of a flashlight from the small cupboard unless its user came all the way out: otherwise the sides would shape the path of the light so it would not come near him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But a man or ghost entering from the side, and playing any light around, would show Dick fully exposed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The worst of that was that there was no rear guard flanking that door!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well,” Dick thought. “I can only wait and see what happens—and be ready to chase if I am discovered. Maybe I can catch and hold the ‘ghost’ till the others get to us.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Careful not to scrape his soles in the cement, he gathered himself into a crouching, compact, alert figure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dim and hardly distinct to his straining eyes, there seemed to be in the slightly lighter gloom of the floor where the door opened, a shadow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It might be an illusion of his taut nerves and tense mind, Dick decided.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He could not see out through the opening because he was almost in a straight line with the wall on that side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He waited, becoming shaky with the strain, for what seemed like a dragging eternity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The intruder must be scanning the landscape, judging conditions, he guessed.\n\u003cbr\u003e 248\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When it seemed that he could not stay as he was another instant, the door was slightly moved, and then softly closed. So quiet was the operation that he did not hear the latch click. He had detected no change in the color of the door itself as it hung, slantwise to his view, and he heard no sound of feet on the cement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That meant nothing fearful or horrifying to Dick.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rubber soles and a dark suit covered the logical explanation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Still, I should have seen his face—maybe a mask, though——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At any rate, he knew that he was not alone inside the edifice, and if Dick’s common sense was too great to let him think of uncanny spirits, the sense of danger supplied chills and thrills a-plenty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A faint, glowing, bluish light broke out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It threw no beam, only a sort of dull phosphorescence; but Dick’s quick eyes ran instantly to its source—some small flashlamp covered with colored cloth, a handkerchief, perhaps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Behind that silhouette, because the light was aimed in the direction away from Dick, he saw what caused him to emit a revealing gasp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The figure silhouette between him and the glow wore a dress!\n\u003cbr\u003e 249\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A woman!” gasped Dick, and at the same instant the figure whirled, Dick leaped up, the light went out and Dick rushed blindly forward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A hand fumbled with the catch: that located her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In his rush, Dick’s arms were carried around the shoulders he could not see. Like a serpent, sinuous, tense, powerful, the woman squirmed around in his arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He tried to hold her with one hand as he strove to open that door with the other, while he took the beating of her furious hands on his bent face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The door catch yielded—their wrestling, struggling weight drew it inward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Help—this way!” screamed Dick.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he clung like a terrier to a tigress!\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2096/59551.html","bookId":523,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 11:24:10 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 11:24:10 AM"}
