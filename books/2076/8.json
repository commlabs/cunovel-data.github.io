There was a nice isolatedarea behind the store, and it was getting dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove his own car around back, then got out to watch the store entrance. When Phil came outwith a bag, he sprang on him from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil yelled and fought, dropping the bag. It didn\u0027tmatter. The sun had gone down and James\u0027s powerwas at full strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dragged Phil to the back of the store and put him facing the wall beside a Dumpster. The classicpolice frisking position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to let go now,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t try torun away. That would be a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil went tense and motionless at the sound of hisvoice. \"I don\u0027twantto run away. I want to smash your face in, Rasmussen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead and try.\" James was going to add,Makemy night, but he reconsidered. He let go of Phil, who turned around and regarded him with utter loathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter? Run out of girls to jump?\" hesaid, breathing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames gritted his teeth. Trading insults wasn\u0027t going to do any good, but he could already tell it was going to be hard to keep his temper. Phil had that effect on him. \"I didn\u0027t bring you out here to fight.I brought you to ask you something. Do you care about Poppy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil said, \"I\u0027ll take stupid questions for five hundred, Alex,\" and loosened his shoulder as if gettingready for a punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because if you do, you\u0027ll get her to talk to me.You were the one who convinced her not to see me,and now you\u0027ve got to convince her that shehastosee me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil looked around the parking lot, as if calling for somebody to witness this insanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames spoke slowly and dearly, enunciating eachword. \"There is something I can do to help her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re Don Juan, right? You\u0027re gonna heal her with your love.\" The words were flippant,but Phil\u0027s voice was shaky with sheer hatred. Not just hatred for James, but for a universe that would givePoppy cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You\u0027ve got it completely wrong. Look, youthink I was making out with her, or trifling with her affections or whatever. That\u0027s not what was going onat all. I let you think that because I was tired ofgetting the third degree from you-and because Ididn\u0027t want you to know what we weredoing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, sure,\" Phil said in a voice filled with equal measures of sarcasm and contempt. \"So whatwereyou doing? Drugs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames had learned something from his first encounter with Poppy in the hospital. Show and tellshould be done in that order. This time he didn\u0027t sayanything; he just grabbed Phil by the hair and jerked his head back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only a single light behind the store, butit was enough togive Phil a good view of the baredfangs looming over him. And it was more thanenough for James, with his night vision, to see Phillip\u0027s green eyesdilate as he stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillip yelled, then went limp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot with fear, James knew. He wasn\u0027t a coward.With the shock of disbelief turning to belief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillip swore. \"You\u0027rea ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" James let him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil almost lost his balance. He grabbed at theDumpster for support. \"I don\u0027t believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do,\" James said. He hadn\u0027t retracted hisfangs, and he knew that hiseyes were shining silver.Philhadto believe it with James standing right infront of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil apparently had the same idea. He was staringat James as if he wanted to look away, but couldn\u0027t.The color had drained out of his face, and he keptswallowing as if he were going to be sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God,\" he said finally. \"I knew there was something wrong with you. Weird wrong. I could neverfigure out why you gave me the creeps. So this is it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI disgust him, James realized. It\u0027s not just hatred anymore. He thinks I\u0027m less than human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t augur well for the rest of James\u0027s plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now do you understand how I can help Poppy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil shook his head slowly. He was leaning againstthe wall, one hand still on the Dumpster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames felt impatience rise in his chest. \"Poppy hasa disease. Vampires don\u0027t get diseases. Do you needa road map?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillip\u0027s expression said he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If,\"James said through his teeth, \"I exchangeenough blood with Poppy to turn her into a vampire,she won\u0027t have cancer anymore. Every cell in herbody will change and she\u0027ll end up a perfect specimen: flawless, disease-free. She\u0027ll have powers thathumans don\u0027t even dream of. And, incidentally,she\u0027ll be immortal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long, long silence as James watchedthis sink in with Phillip. Phil\u0027s thoughts were toojumbled and kaleidoscopic for James to make anything of them, but Phil\u0027s eyes got wider and his facemore ashen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last Phil said, \"You can\u0027t do that to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was thewayhe said it. Not as if he were protesting an idea because it was too radical, too new.Not the knee-jerk overreaction that Poppy had had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said it with absolute conviction and utmost horror. As if James were threatening to steal Poppy\u0027ssoul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only way to save herlife,\"James said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil shook his head slowly again, eyes huge andtrancelike. \"No. No. She wouldn\u0027t want it. Not atthat cost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What cost?\" James was more than impatientnow, he was defensive and exasperated. If he\u0027d realized that this was going to turn into a philosophical debate, he would have picked somewhere less public.As it was, he had to keep all his senses on the alertfor possible intruders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil let go of the Dumpster and stood on his owntwo feet. There was fear mixed with the horror in his eyes, but he faced James squarely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just-there are some things that humansthink are more important than just staying alive,\" hesaid. \"You\u0027ll find that out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t believe this, James thought. He sounds likea junior space captain talking to the alien invadersin a B movie.You won\u0027tfind Earth peoplequitethe easymark you imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAloud, he said, \"Are you nuts? Look, Phil, I wasborn in San Francisco. I\u0027m not some bug-eyed monster from Alpha Centauri. I eat Wheaties forbreakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do you eat for a midnight snack?\" Phil\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003easked, his green eyes somber and almost childlike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or are the fangs just for decoration?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalked right into that one, James\u0027s brain told him.He looked away. \"Okay. Touch?. There are somedifferences. I never said I was a human. But I\u0027m notsome kind of-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re not a monster, then I don\u0027t knowwhat is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t kill him, James counseled himself frantically.You have toconvincehim. \"Phil, we\u0027re not like what you see at the movies. We\u0027re not all-powerful. We can\u0027t dematerialize through walls or travel through time, and we don\u0027t need to kill to feed. We\u0027re not evil, at least not all of us. We\u0027re not damned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re unnatural,\" Phillip said softly, and James could feel that he meant it from his heart. \"You\u0027rewrong. Youshouldn\u0027t exist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we\u0027re higher up on the food chain thanyou?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because people weren\u0027t meant to ...feed ... on other people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames didn\u0027t say that his people didn\u0027t think ofPhillip\u0027s people as people. He said, \"We only do whatwe have to do to survive. And Poppy\u0027s already agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillip froze. \"No. She wouldn\u0027t want to becomelike you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wants to stay a!ive---or at least, she did, before she got mad at me. Now she\u0027s just irrationalbecause she hasn\u0027t got enough of my blood in her tofinish changing her. Thanks to you.\" He paused, then said deliberately, \"Have you ever seen a three-weekold corpse, Phil? Because that\u0027swhat she\u0027s going to become if I don\u0027t get to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil\u0027s face twisted. He whirled around and slammed a fist into the metal side of the Dumpster.\"Don\u0027t you think I know that?I\u0027ve been living withthat since Monday night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames stood still, heart pounding. Feeling the anguish Phil was giving off and the pain of Phil\u0027s injured hand. It was several seconds before he was ableto saycalmly,\"And you think that\u0027s better than whatI can give her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s lousy. It stinks. But, yes, it\u0027s better than turning into something that hunts people. Thatusespeo ple. That\u0027s why all the girlfriends, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, James couldn\u0027t answer right away.Phil\u0027s problem, he was realizing, was that Phil wasfar too smart for his own good. He thought too much.\"Yeah. That\u0027s why all the girlfriends,\" he said at last,tiredly. Trying not to see this from Phil\u0027s point of view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tell me one thing, Rasmussen.\"Phillip straightened and looked him dead in the eye. \"Didyou\"-he stopped and swallowed-\"feed on Poppybefore she got sick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil let out his breath. \"That\u0027s good. Because if you had,I\u0027d have killed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames believed him. He was much stronger than Phil, much faster, and he\u0027d never been afraid of ahuman before. But just at that moment he had nodoubt that Phil would somehow have found a way to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, there\u0027s something you don\u0027t understand,\"he said. \"Poppy did want this, and it\u0027s something we\u0027ve already started. She\u0027s only just beginning tochange; if she dies now, she won\u0027t become a vampire.But she might not die all thee way, either. She couldend up a walking corpse. A zombie, you know?Mindless. Body rotting, but immortal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil\u0027s mouth quivered with revulsion. \"You\u0027re justsaying that to scare me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames looked away. \"I\u0027ve seen it happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen it firsthand!\"Dimly James realized hewas yelling and that he\u0027d grabbed Phil by the shirtfront. He was out of control-and he didn\u0027t care.\"I\u0027ve seen it happen to somebodyIcared about, allright?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, because Phil was still shaking his head:\"I was only four years old and I had a nanny. Allthe rich kids in San Francisco have nannies. Shewas human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go,\" Phil muttered, pulling at James\u0027s wrist.He was breathing hard-he didn\u0027t want to hear this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was crazy about her. She gave me everythingmy mom didn\u0027t. Love, attention-she was never too busy. I called her Miss Emma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But my parents thought I was too attached to her.So they took me on a little vacation-and they didn\u0027tlet me feed. Not for three days. By the time they brought me back, I was starving. Then they sent MissEmma up to put me to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil had stopped fighting now. He stood with hishead bowed and turned to one side so he wouldn\u0027thave to look at James. James threw his words at theaverted face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was only four. I couldn\u0027t stop myself. And the thing is, I wanted to. If you\u0027d asked me who I\u0027d rather have die, me or Miss Emma, I\u0027d\u0027ve said me. But when you\u0027re starving, you lose control. So I fed on her, and all the time I was crying and trying to stop. And when I finally could stop, I knew it wastoo late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. James suddenly realized that his fingers were locked in anagonizingcramp. He letgo of Phil\u0027s shirt slowly. Phil said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was just lying there on the floor. I thought,wait, if I give her my own blood she\u0027ll be a vampire, and everything will be okay.\" He wasn\u0027t yelling anymore. He wasn\u0027t even really speaking to Phillip, butstaring out into the dark parking lot. \"So I cut myselfand let the blood run into her mouth. She swallowedsome of it before my parents came up and stoppedme. But not enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA longer pause-and James remembered why hewas telling the story. He looked at Phillip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She died that night but not all the way. The twodifferent kinds of blood were fighting inside her. Soby morning she was walking around again-but shewasn\u0027t Miss Emma anymore. She drooled and her skin was gray and her eyes were flat like a corpse\u0027s.And when she started to-rot-my dad took her out to Inverness and buried her. He killed her first.\" Bilerose in James\u0027s throat and he added almost in a whisper, \"I hope he killed her first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil slowly turned around to look at him. For thefirst time that evening, there was something otherthan horror and fear in his face. Something like pity, James thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames took a deep breath. After thirteen years of silence he\u0027d finally told the storyto Phillip North,of all people. But it was no good wondering aboutthe absurdity. He had a point to drive home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So take my advice. If you don\u0027t convince Poppyto see me, make sure they don\u0027t do an autopsy onher. You don\u0027t want her walking around without herinternal organs. And have a wooden stake ready forthe time when you can\u0027t stand to look at heranymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pity was gone from Phil\u0027s eyes. His mouth wasa hard, trembling line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won\u0027t let her turn into... some kind of halfalive abomination,\" he said. \"Or a vampire, either. I\u0027m sorry about what happened to your Miss Emma,but it doesn\u0027t change anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poppyshould be the one to decide-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Phillip had reached his limit, and now he was simply shaking his head. \"Just keep away from my sister,\" he said. \"That\u0027s all I want. If you do, I\u0027ll leaveyou alone. And if you don\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to tell everybody in El Camino what you are. I\u0027m going to call the police and the mayorand I\u0027m going to stand in the middle of the streetand yell it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames felt his hands go icy cold. What Phil didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erealize was that he\u0027d just made it James\u0027s duty to killhim. It wasn\u0027t just that any human who stumbled onNight World secrets had to die, but that one activelythreatening to tellabout the Night World had to die immediately, no questions asked, no mercy given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly James was so tired he couldn\u0027t seestraight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of here, Phil,\" he said in a voice drainedof emotion and vitality both. \"Now. And if you reallywant to protect Poppy, you won\u0027t tell anybody anything. Because they\u0027ll trace it back and find out thatPoppy knows the secrets, too. And then they\u0027ll killher-after bringing her in for questioning. It won\u0027tbe fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027re \u0027they\u0027? Your parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Night People. We\u0027re all around you, Phil.Anybody you know could be one-including themayor. So keep your mouth shut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillip looked at him through narrowed eyes. Thenhe turned and walked to the front of the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames couldn\u0027t remember when he\u0027d felt so empty. Everything he\u0027d done had turned out wrong. Poppywas now in more kinds of danger than he couldcount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Phillip North thought he was unnatural andevil. What Phil didn\u0027t know was that most of thetime James thought the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillip got halfway home before he rememberedthat he\u0027d dropped the bag with Poppy\u0027s cranberryjuice and wild cherry Popsicles. Poppy had hardly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeaten in the last two days, and when she did get hungry, it was for something weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo-somethingred,he realized as he paid for a second time at the 7-Eleven. He felt a sick lurch in his stomach. Everything she wanted lately was redand at least semiliquid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Poppy realize that herself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her when he went into her bedroom togive her a Popsicle. Poppy spent most of the time inbed now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was so pale and still.. Her green eyes werethe only alive thing about her. They dominated herface, glittering with an almost savage awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff and Phil\u0027s mother were talking about gettinground-the-clock nurses to be with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t like the Popsicle?\" Phil asked, dragging achair to sit beside her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy was eyeing the thing with distaste. She tooka tiny lick and grimaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillip watched her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother lick. Then she put the Popsicle into anempty plastic cup on her nightstand. \"I don\u0027t know ... I just don\u0027t feel hungry,\" she said, leaning backagainst the pillows. \"Sorry you had to go out fornothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\" God, she looks sick, Phil thought.\"Is there anything else I can do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes shut, Poppy shook her head. A very smallmotion. \"You\u0027re a good brother,\" she said distantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe used to be so alive, Phil thought. Dad calledher Kilowatt or Eveready. She used to radiateenergy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout in the least meaning to, he found himself saying, \"I saw James Rasmussen today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy stiffened. Her hands on the bedspreadformed not fists, but claws. \"He\u0027d better keep awayfrom here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something subtly wrong about her reaction. Something not-Poppy. Poppy could get fierce,sure, but Phil had never heard that animal tone inher voice before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA picture flashed through Phil\u0027s mind. A creaturefromNight of the Living Dead,walking even though its intestines were spilling out. A living corpse likeJames\u0027s Miss Emma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that really what would happen if Poppy diedright now? Was she that much changed already?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll scratch his eyes out if he comes around here,\"Poppy said, her fingers working on the spread like acat kneading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poppy-he told me the truth about what hereally is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely, Poppy had no reaction. \"He\u0027s scum,\"she said. \"He\u0027s a reptile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about her voice made Phillip\u0027s fleshcreep. \"And I told him you would never want to become something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t,\" Poppy said shortly. \"Not if it meanthanging around withhimfor eternity. I don\u0027t want to see him ever again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil stared at her for a long moment. Then heleaned back and shut his eyes, one thumb jammedagainst his temple where the ache was worst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot just subtly wrong. He didn\u0027t want to believe it, but Poppy wasstrange.Irrational. And now thathe thought about it, she\u0027d been getting stranger everyhour since James had been thrown out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo maybe she was in some eerie in-between state. Not a human and not a vampire. And not able tothink dearly. Just as James had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy should be the one to decide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something he had to ask her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poppy?\" He waited until she looked at him, her green eyes large and unblinking. \"When we talked,James said that you\u0027d agreed to let him-change you.Before you got mad at him. Is that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy\u0027s eyebrows lifted. \"I\u0027m mad at him,\" sheconfirmed, as if this was the only part of the questionshe\u0027d processed. \"And you know why I like you?Because you\u0027ve always hated him. Now we bothhate him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil thought for a moment, then spoke carefully. \"Okay. But when youweren\u0027tmad at him, back then,did you want to turn into-what he is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly a gleam of rationality showed in Poppy\u0027s eyes. \"I just didn\u0027t want to die, \"she said. \"I was so scared-and I wanted to live. If the doctors could doanything for me, I\u0027d try that. But they can\u0027t.\" Shewas sitting up now, staring into space as if she saw something terrible there. \"You don\u0027t know what itfeels like to know you\u0027re going to die,\" shewhispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaves of chills washed over Phillip. No, he didn\u0027tknow that, but he did know-he could suddenly picture vividly-what it was going to be like forhimafter Poppy died. How empty the world was going tobe without her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long time they both sat in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Poppy fell back onto the pillows again. Phillipcould see pastel blue smudges under her eyes, as ifthe conversation had exhausted her. \"I don\u0027tthinkitmatters,\" she said in a faint but frighteningly cheerfulvoice. \"I\u0027m not going to die anyway. Doctors don\u0027t know everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0027s how she\u0027s dealing with it,Phillipthought.Total denial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had all the information he needed, though. He had a clear view of the situation. And he knew whathe had to do now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave so you can get some rest,\" he said to Poppy, and patted her hand. It felt very cool andfragile, full of tiny bones like a bird\u0027s wing. \"Seeyou later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped out of the house without telling anyone where he was going. Once on the road, he drovevery fast. It only took ten minutes to reach the apart ment building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d never been to James\u0027s apartment before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames answered the door with a cold, \"What areyou doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I come in? I\u0027ve got something to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames stood back expressionlessly to let him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"place was roomy and bare. There was a singlechairbeside a very cluttered table, an equally clut tered desk, and a square unbeautiful couch. Cardboard boxes full of books and CDs were stacked inthe corners. A door led to a spartan bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First of all, I have to explain something. I knowyou can\u0027t help being what you are-but I can\u0027t helphow I feel about it, either. You can\u0027t change, andneither can I. I need you to understand that from the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames crossed his arms over his chest, wary anddefiant. \"You can skip the lecture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just need to make sure you understand, okay?\"\"What do youwant,Phil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil swallowed. It took two or three tries before he could get the words out past the blockage of hispride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to help my sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-secret-vampire-night-world-1/page-8.html","bookId":2076,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:34:35 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:34:35 AM"}
