{"id":101304,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003eDawson\u0027s pickup, a Dodge Ram, although battered on the outside, was orderly within. It wasn\u0027t a new vehicle by any means - probably five years old - but it was very well-maintained both under the hood and in the cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a member of the pack, Dawson, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Tray. Tray Dawson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson shrugged, as if to say No big deal. \"I never was a good pack animal,\" he said. \"I couldn\u0027t keep in line. I couldn\u0027t follow the chain of command.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why are you joining in this fight?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick Furnan tried to put me out of business,\" Dawson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027d he do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t that many other motorcycle repair shops in the area, especially since Furnan bought the Harley-Davidson dealership in Shreveport,\" Tray explained. \"That so-and-so\u0027s greedy. He wants it all for himself. He doesn\u0027t care who goes broke. When he realized I was sticking with my shop, he sent a couple of his guys down to see me. They beat me up, busted up the shop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They must have been really good,\" I said. It was hard to believe anyone could best Tray Dawson. \"Did you call the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The cops in Bon Temps aren\u0027t that crazy about me anyway. But I threw in with Alcide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetective Cal Myers, obviously, was not above doing Furnan\u0027s dirty work. It was Myers who\u0027d collaborated with Furnan in cheating in the packmaster contest. But I was truly shocked that he would go as far as murdering Maria-Star, whose only sin was being loved by Alcide. We\u0027d seen it with our own eyes, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the deal with you and the police in Bon Temps?\" I asked, as long as we were talking about law enforcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"I used to be a cop; did you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, genuinely surprised. \"No kidding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For real,\" he said. \"I was on the force in New Orleans. But I didn\u0027t like the politics, and my captain was a real bastard, pardon me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded gravely. It had been a long time since someone had apologized for using bad language within my hearing. \"So, something happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, eventually things came to a head. The captain accused me of taking some money this scuzzbag had left lying on a table when we arrested him in his home.\" Tray shook his head in disgust. \"I had to quit then. I liked the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you like about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No two days were alike. Yeah, sure, we got in the cars and patrolled. That was the same. But every time we got out something different would happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. I could understand that. Every day at the bar was a little different, too, though probably not as different as Tray\u0027s days had been in the patrol car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove in silence for a while. I could tell Tray was thinking about the odds of Alcide overcoming Furnan in the struggle for dominance. He was thinking Alcide was a lucky guy to have dated Maria-Star and me, and all the luckier since that bitch Debbie Pelt had vanished. Good riddance, Tray thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I get to ask you a question,\" Tray said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have something to do with Debbie disappearing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. \"Yeah. Self-defense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for you. Someone needed to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were quiet again for at least ten minutes. Not to drag the past into the present too much, but Alcide had broken up with Debbie Pelt before I met him. Then he dated me a little. Debbie decided I was an enemy, and she tried to kill me. I got her first. I\u0027d come to terms with it... as much as you ever do. However, it had been impossible for Alcide to ever look at me again in the same way, and who could blame him? He\u0027d found Maria-Star, and that was a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad been a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt tears well up in my eyes and looked out the window. We\u0027d passed the racetrack and the turnoff to Pierre Bossier Mall, and we went a couple more exits before Tray turned the truck onto the off ramp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe meandered through a modest neighborhood for a while, Tray checking his rearview mirror so often that even I realized he was watching for anyone following us. Tray suddenly turned into a driveway and pulled around to the back of one of the slightly larger homes, which was demurely clad in white siding. We parked under a porte cochere in the back, along with another pickup. There was a small Nissan parked off to the side. There were a couple of motorcycles, too, and Tray gave them a glance of professional interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose place?\" I was a little hesitant about asking yet another question, but after all, I did want to know where I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amanda\u0027s,\" he said. He waited for me to precede him, and I went up the three steps leading up to the back door and rang the bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s there?\" asked a muffled voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sookie and Dawson,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened cautiously, the entrance blocked by Amanda so we couldn\u0027t see past her. I don\u0027t know much about handguns, but she had a big revolver in her hand pointed steadily at my chest. This was the second time in two days I\u0027d had a gun pointed at me. Suddenly, I felt very cold and a little dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Amanda said after looking us over sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcide was standing behind the door, a shotgun at the ready. He\u0027d stepped out into view as we came in, and when his own senses had checked us out, he stood down. He put the shotgun on the kitchen counter and sat at the kitchen table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry about Maria-Star, Alcide,\" I said, forcing the words through stiff lips. Having guns aimed at you is just plain terrifying, especially at close range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t gotten it yet,\" he said, his voice flat and even. I decided he was saying that the impact of her death hadn\u0027t hit him. \"We were thinking about moving in together. It would have saved her life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t any point in wallowing in what-might-have-been. That was only another way to torture yourself. What had actually happened was bad enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know who did it,\" Dawson said, and a shiver ran through the room. There were more Weres in the house - I could sense them now - and they had all become alert at Tray Dawson\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? How?\" Without my seeing the movement, Alcide was on his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She got her witch friends to do a reconstruction,\" Tray said, nodding in my direction. \"I watched. It was two guys. One I\u0027d never seen, so Furnan\u0027s brought in some wolves from outside. The second was Cal Myers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcide\u0027s big hands were clenched in fists. He didn\u0027t seem to know where to start speaking, he had so many reactions. \"Furnan\u0027s hired help,\" Alcide said, finally picking a jumping-in point. \"So we\u0027re within our rights to kill on sight. We\u0027ll snatch one of the bastards and make him talk. We can\u0027t bring a hostage here; someone would notice. Tray, where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hair of the Dog,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda wasn\u0027t too crazy about that idea. She owned that bar, and using it as an execution or torture site didn\u0027t appeal to her. She opened her mouth to protest. Alcide faced her and snarled, his face twisting into something that wasn\u0027t quite Alcide. She cowered and nodded her assent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcide raised his voice even more for his next pronouncement. \"Cal Myers is Kill on Sight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s a pack member, and members get trials,\" Amanda said, and then cowered, correctly anticipating Alcide\u0027s wordless roar of rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t asked me about the man who tried to kill me,\" I said. I wanted to defuse the situation, if that was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs furious as he was, Alcide was still too decent to remind me that I\u0027d lived and Maria-Star hadn\u0027t, or that he\u0027d loved Maria-Star much more than he\u0027d ever cared about me. Both thoughts crossed his mind, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a Were,\" I said. \"About five foot ten, in his twenties. He was clean-shaven. He had brown hair and blue eyes and a big birthmark on his neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" said Amanda. \"That sounds like what\u0027s-his-name, the brand-new mechanic at Furnan\u0027s shop. Hired last week. Lucky Owens. Ha! Who were you with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was with Eric Northman,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long, not entirely friendly silence. Weres and vampires are natural rivals, if not out-and-out enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, the guy\u0027s dead?\" Tray asked practically, and I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d he approach you?\" Alcide asked in a voice that was more rational.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s an interesting question,\" I said. \"I was on the interstate driving home from Shreveport with Eric. We\u0027d been to a restaurant here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who would know where you were and who you were with?\" Amanda said while Alcide frowned down at the floor, deep in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or that you\u0027d have to return home along the interstate last night.\" Tray was really rising in my opinion; he was right in there with the practical and pertinent ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only told my roommate I was going out to dinner, not where,\" I said. \"We met someone there, but we can leave him out. Eric knew, because he was acting as chauffeur. But I know Eric and the other man didn\u0027t tip anyone off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be so sure?\" Tray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric got shot protecting me,\" I said. \"And the person he took me to meet was a relative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda and Tray didn\u0027t realize how small my family was, so they didn\u0027t get how momentous that statement was. But Alcide, who knew more about me, glared. \"You\u0027re making this up,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not.\" I stared back. I knew this was a terrible day for Alcide, but I didn\u0027t have to explain my life to him. But I had a sudden thought. \"You know, the waiter - he was a Were.\" That would explain a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the name of the restaurant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Les Deux Poissons.\" My accent wasn\u0027t good, but the Weres nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kendall works there,\" Alcide said. \"Kendall Kent. Long reddish hair?\" I nodded, and he looked sad. \"I thought Kendall would come around to our side. We had a beer together a couple of times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Jack Kent\u0027s oldest. All he would have had to do was place a phone call,\" Amanda said. \"Maybe he didn\u0027t know...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not an excuse,\" Tray said. His deep voice reverberated in the little kitchen. \"Kendall has to know who Sookie is, from the packmaster contest. She\u0027s a friend of the pack. Instead of telling Alcide she was in our territory and should be protected, he called Furnan and told him where Sookie was, maybe let him know when she started home. Made it easy for Lucky to lie in wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to protest that there was no certainty that it had happened like that, but when I thought about it, it had to have been exactly that way or in some manner very close to it. Just to be sure I was remembering correctly, I called Amelia and asked her if she\u0027d told any callers where I was the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"I heard from Octavia, who didn\u0027t know you. I got a call from that werepanther boy I met at your brother\u0027s wedding. Believe me, you didn\u0027t come up in that conversation. Alcide called, real upset. Tanya. I told her nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, roomie,\" I said. \"You recovering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027m feeling better, and Octavia left to go back to the family she\u0027s been staying with in Monroe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, see you when I get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You going to make it back in time for work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I have to make it to work.\" Since I\u0027d spent that week in Rhodes, I have to be careful to stick to the schedule for a while, otherwise the other waitresses would get up in my face about Sam giving me all the breaks. I hung up. \"She told no one,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you - and Eric - had a leisurely dinner at an expensive restaurant, with another man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him incredulously. This was so far off the point. I concentrated. I\u0027d never poked a mental probe into such turmoil. Alcide was feeling grief for Maria-Star, guilt because he hadn\u0027t protected her, anger that I\u0027d been drawn into the conflict, and above all, eagerness to knock some skulls. As the cherry on top of all that, Alcide - irrationally - hated that I\u0027d been out with Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to keep my mouth shut out of respect for his loss; I was no stranger to mixed emotions myself. But I found I\u0027d become abruptly and completely tired of him. \"Okay,\" I said. \"Fight your own battles. I came when you asked me to. I helped you when you asked me to, both at the battle for packleader and today, at expense and emotional grief to myself. Screw you, Alcide. Maybe Furnan is the better Were.\" I spun on my heel and caught the look Tray Dawson was giving Alcide while I marched out of the kitchen, down the steps, and into the carport. If there\u0027d been a can, I would\u0027ve kicked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take you home,\" Tray said, appearing at my side, and I marched over to the side of the truck, grateful that he was giving me the wherewithal to leave. When I\u0027d stormed out, I hadn\u0027t been thinking about what would happen next. It\u0027s the ruin of a good exit when you have to go back and look in the phone book for a cab company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d believed Alcide truly loathed me after the Debbie debacle. Apparently the loathing was not total.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of ironic, isn\u0027t it?\" I said after a silent spell. \"I almost got shot last night because Patrick Furnan thought that would upset Alcide. Until ten minutes ago, I would have sworn that wasn\u0027t true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTray looked like he would rather be cutting up onions than dealing with this conversation. After another pause, he said, \"Alcide\u0027s acting like a butthead, but he\u0027s got a lot on his plate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand that,\" I said, and shut my mouth before I said one more word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turned out, I was on time to go to work that night. I was so upset while I was changing clothes that I almost split my black pants, I yanked them on so hard. I brushed my hair with such unnecessary vigor that it crackled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Men are incomprehensible assholes,\" I said to Amelia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit,\" she said. \"When I was searching for Bob today, I found a female cat in the woods with kittens. And guess what? They were all black-and-white.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really had no idea what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So to hell with the promise I made him, right? I\u0027m going to have fun. He can go have sex; I can have sex. And if he vomits on my bedspread again, I\u0027ll get after him with the broom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trying not to look directly at Amelia. \"I don\u0027t blame you,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. It was nice to be on the verge of laughter instead of wanting to smack someone. I grabbed up my purse, checked my ponytail in the mirror in the hall bathroom, and exited out the back door to drive to Merlotte\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt tired before I even walked through the employees\u0027 door, not a good way to start my shift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t see Sam when I stowed my purse in the deep desk drawer we all used. When I came out of the hall that accessed the two public bathrooms, Sam\u0027s office, the storeroom, and the kitchen (though the kitchen door was kept locked from the inside, most of the time), I found Sam behind the bar. I gave him a wave as I tied on the white apron I\u0027d pulled from the stack of dozens. I slid my order pad and a pencil into a pocket, looked around to find Arlene, whom I\u0027d be replacing, and scanned the tables in our section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart sank. No peaceful evening for me. Some asses in Fellowship of the Sun T-shirts were sitting at one of the tables. The Fellowship was a radical organization that believed (a) vampires were sinful by nature, almost demons, and (b) they should be executed. The Fellowship \"preachers\" wouldn\u0027t say so publicly, but the Fellowship advocated the total eradication of the undead. I\u0027d heard there was even a little primer to advise members of how that could be carried out. After the Rhodes bombing they\u0027d become bolder in their hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe FotS group was growing as Americans struggled to come to terms with something they couldn\u0027t understand - and as hundreds of vampires streamed into the country that had given them the most favorable reception of all the nations on earth. Since a few heavily Catholic and Muslim countries had adopted a policy of killing vampires on sight, the U.S. had begun accepting vampires as refugees from religious or political persecution, and the backlash against this policy was violent. I\u0027d recently seen a bumper sticker that read, \"I\u0027ll say vamps are alive when you pry my cold dead fingers from my ripped-out throat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI regarded the FotS as intolerant and ignorant, and I despised those who belonged to its ranks. But I was used to keeping my mouth shut on the topic at the bar, the same way I was used to avoiding discussions on abortion or gun control or gays in the military.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the FotS guys were probably Arlene\u0027s buddies. My weak-minded ex-friend had fallen hook, line, and sinker for the pseudo religion that the FotS propagated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArlene curtly briefed me on the tables as she headed out the back door, her face set hard against me. As I watched her go, I wondered how her kids were. I used to babysit them a lot. They probably hated me now, if they listened to their mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook off my melancholy, because Sam didn\u0027t pay me to be moody. I made the rounds of the customers, refreshed drinks, made sure everyone had enough food, brought a clean fork for a woman who\u0027d dropped hers, supplied extra napkins to the table where Catfish Hennessy was eating chicken strips, and exchanged cheerful words with the guys seated at the bar. I treated the FotS table just like I treated everyone else, and they didn\u0027t seem to be paying me any special attention, which was just fine with me. I had every expectation that they\u0027d leave with no trouble Pam walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePam is white as a sheet of paper and looks just like Alice in Wonderland would look if she\u0027d grown up to become a vampire. In fact, this evening Pam even had a blue band restraining her straight fair hair, and she was wearing a dress instead of her usual pants set. She was lovely - even if she looked like a vampire cast in an episode of Leave It to Beaver. Her dress had little puff sleeves with white trim, and her collar had white trim, too. The tiny buttons down the front of her bodice were white, to match the polka dots on the skirt. No hose, I noticed, but any hose she bought would look bizarre since the rest of her skin was so pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Pam,\" I said as she made a beeline for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sookie,\" she said warmly, and gave me a kiss as light as a snowflake. Her lips felt cool on my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" I asked. Pam usually worked at Fangtasia in the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a date,\" she said. \"Do you think I look good?\" She spun around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure,\" I said. \"You always look good, Pam.\" That was only the truth. Though Pam\u0027s clothing choices were often ultra-conservative and strangely dated, that didn\u0027t mean they didn\u0027t become her. She had a kind of sweet-but-lethal charm. \"Who\u0027s the lucky guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked as arch as a vampire over two hundred years old can look. \"Who says it\u0027s a guy?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right.\" I glanced around. \"Who\u0027s the lucky person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then my roomie walked in. Amelia was wearing a beautiful pair of black linen pants and heels with an off-white sweater and a pair of amber and tortoiseshell earrings. She looked conservative, too, but in a more modern way. Amelia strode over to us, smiled at Pam, and said, \"Had a drink yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePam smiled in a way I\u0027d never seen her smile before. It was... coy. \"No, waiting for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat at the bar and Sam served them. Soon they were chatting away, and when their drinks were gone, they got up to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they passed me on their way out, Amelia said, \"I\u0027ll see you when I see you\" - her way of telling me she might not be home tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, you two have fun,\" I said. Their departure was followed by more than one pair of male eyes. If corneas steamed up like glasses do, all the guys in the bar would be seeing blurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made the round of my tables again, fetching new beers for one, leaving the bill at another, until I reached the table with the two guys wearing the FotS shirts. They were still watching the door as though they expected Pam to jump back inside and scream, \"BOO!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I just see what I thought I saw?\" one of the men asked me. He was in his thirties, clean-shaven, brown-haired, just another guy. The other man was someone I would have eyed with caution if we\u0027d been in an elevator alone. He was thin, had a beard fringe along his jaw, was decorated with a few tattoos that looked like home jobs to me - jail tats - and he was carrying a knife strapped to his ankle, a thing that hadn\u0027t been too hard for me to spot once I\u0027d heard in his mind that he was armed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think you just saw?\" I asked sweetly. Brown Hair thought I was a bit simple. But that was a good camouflage, and it meant that Arlene hadn\u0027t sunk to telling all and sundry about my little peculiarities. No one in Bon Temps (if you asked them outside of church on Sunday) would have said telepathy was possible. If you\u0027d asked them outside of Merlotte\u0027s on a Saturday night, they might have said there was something to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I saw a vamp come in here, just like she had a right. And I think I saw a woman acting happy to walk out with her. I swear to God, I cannot believe it.\" He looked at me as if I was sure to share his outrage. Jail Tat nodded vigorously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry - you see two women walking out of a bar together, and that bothers you? I don\u0027t understand your problem with that.\" Of course I did, but you have to play it out sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sookie!\" Sam was calling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get you gentlemen anything else?\" I asked, since Sam was undoubtedly trying to call me back to my senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both looking at me oddly now, having correctly deduced that I was not exactly down with their program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we\u0027re ready to leave,\" said Jail Tat, clearly hoping I\u0027d be made to suffer for driving paying customers away. \"You got our check ready?\" I\u0027d had their check ready, and I laid it down on the table in between them. They each glanced at it, slapped a ten on top, and shoved their chairs back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be back with your change in just a second,\" I said, and turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No change,\" said Brown Hair, though his tone was surly and he didn\u0027t seem genuinely thrilled with my service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerks,\" I muttered as I went to the cash register at the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam said, \"Sookie, you have to suck it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so surprised that I stared at Sam. We were both behind the bar, and Sam was mixing a vodka collins. Sam continued quietly, keeping his eyes on his hands, \"You have to serve them like they were anybody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t too often that Sam treated me like an employee rather than a trusted associate. It hurt; the more so when I realized he was right. Though I\u0027d been polite on the surface, I would have (and should have) swallowed their last remarks with no comment - if it hadn\u0027t been for the FotS T-shirts. Merlotte\u0027s wasn\u0027t my business. It was Sam\u0027s. If customers didn\u0027t come back, he\u0027d suffer the consequences. Eventually, if he had to let bar-maids go, I would, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, though it wasn\u0027t easy to manage saying it. I smiled brightly at Sam and went off to do an unnecessary round of my tables, one that probably crossed the line from attentive and into irritating. But if I went into the employees\u0027 bathroom or the public ladies\u0027 room, I\u0027d end up crying, because it hurt to be admonished and it hurt to be wrong; but most of all, it hurt to be put in my place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we closed that night, I left as quickly and quietly as possible. I knew I was going to have to get over being hurt, but I preferred to do my healing in my own home. I didn\u0027t want to have any \"little talks\" with Sam - or anyone else, for that matter. Holly was looking at me with way too much curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I scooted out to the parking lot with my purse, my apron still on. Tray was leaning against my car. I jumped before I could stop myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You running scared?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m running upset,\" I said. \"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to follow you home,\" he said. \"Amelia there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she\u0027s out on a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m definitely checking out the house,\" the big man said, and climbed into his truck to follow me out Hummingbird Road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t any reason to object that I could see. In fact, it made me feel good to have someone with me, someone I pretty much trusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy house was just as I\u0027d left it, or rather, as Amelia had left it. The outside security lights had come on automatically, and she\u0027d left the light over the sink on in the kitchen as well as the back porch light. Keys in hand, I crossed to the kitchen door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTray\u0027s big hand gripped my arm when I started to twist the doorknob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no one there,\" I said, having checked in my own way. \"And it\u0027s warded by Amelia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay here while I look around,\" he said gently. I nodded and let him in. After a few seconds\u0027 silence, he opened the door to tell me I could come into the kitchen. I was ready to follow him through the house for the rest of his search, but he said, \"I\u0027d sure like a glass of Coke, if you got any.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d deflected me perfectly from following him by appealing to my hospitality. My grandmother would have hit me with a fly swatter if I hadn\u0027t gotten Tray a Coke right then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he arrived back in the kitchen and pronounced the house clear of intruders, the icy Coke was sitting in a glass on the table, and there was a meatloaf sandwich sitting by it. With a folded napkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, Tray sat down and put the napkin in his lap and ate the sandwich and drank the Coke. I sat opposite him with my own drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear your man has vanished,\" Tray said when he\u0027d patted his lips with the napkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think happened to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI explained the circumstances. \"So I haven\u0027t heard a word from him,\" I concluded. This story was sounding almost automatic, like I ought to tape it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s bad\" was all he said. Somehow it made me feel better, this quiet, undramatic discussion of a very touchy subject. After a minute of thoughtful silence, Tray said, \"I hope you find him soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I\u0027m real anxious to know how he\u0027s doing.\" That was a huge understatement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027d better be getting on,\" he said. \"If you get nervous in the night, you call me. I can be here in ten minutes. It\u0027s no good, you being alone out here with the war starting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a mental image of tanks coming down my driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How bad do you think it could get?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad told me in the last war, which was when his daddy was little, the pack in Shreveport got into it with the pack in Monroe. The Shreveport pack was about forty then, counting the halfies.\" Halfies was the common term for Weres who\u0027d become wolves by being bitten. They could only turn into a kind of wolf-man, never achieving the perfect wolf form that born Weres thought was vastly superior. \"But the Monroe pack had a bunch of college kids in it, so it come up to forty, forty-five, too. At the end of the fighting, both packs were halved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of the Weres I knew. \"I hope it stops now,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It ain\u0027t gonna,\" Tray said practically. \"They\u0027ve tasted blood, and killing Alcide\u0027s girl instead of trying for Alcide was a cowardly way to open the fight. Them trying to get you, too; that only made it worse. You don\u0027t have a drop of Were blood. You\u0027re a friend of the pack. That should make you untouchable, not a target. And this afternoon, Alcide found Christine Larrabee dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was shocked all over again. Christine Larrabee was - had been - the widow of one of the previous packleaders. She had a high standing in the Were community, and she\u0027d rather reluctantly endorsed Jackson Herveaux for packleader. Now she had gotten a delayed payback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not going after any men?\" I finally managed to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTray\u0027s face was dark with contempt. \"Naw,\" the Were said. \"The only way I can read it is, Furnan wants to set Alcide\u0027s temper off. He wants everyone to be on a hair trigger, while Furnan himself stays cool and collected. He\u0027s about got what he wants, too. Between grief and the personal insult, Alcide is aimed to go off like a shotgun. He needs to be more like a sniper rifle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t Furnan\u0027s strategy real... unusual?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Tray said heavily. \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s gotten into him. Apparently, he don\u0027t want to face Alcide in personal combat. He don\u0027t want to just beat Alcide. He\u0027s aiming to kill Alcide and all Alcide\u0027s people, as far as I can tell. A few of the Weres, the ones with little kids, they already repledged themselves to him. They\u0027re too scared of what he\u0027d do to their kids, after the attacks against women.\" The Were stood. \"Thanks for the food. I\u0027ve got to go feed my dogs. You lock up good after me, you hear? And where\u0027s your cell phone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed it to him, and with surprisingly neat movements for such large hands, Tray programmed his cell phone number into my directory. Then he left with a casual wave of his hand. He had a small neat house by his repair shop, and I was really relieved to find he\u0027d timed the journey from there to here at only ten minutes. I locked the door behind him, and I checked the kitchen windows. Sure enough, Amelia had left one open at some point during the mild afternoon. After that discovery, I felt compelled to check every window in the house, even the ones upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that was done and I felt as secure as I was going to feel, I turned on the television and sat in front of it, not really seeing what was happening on the screen. I had a lot to think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonths ago, I\u0027d gone to the packmaster contest at Alcide\u0027s request to watch for trickery. It was my bad luck that my presence had been noticed and my discovery of Furnan\u0027s treachery had been public. It griped me that I\u0027d been drawn into this fight, which was none of my own. In fact, bottom line: knowing Alcide had brought me nothing but grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was almost relieved to feel a head of anger building at this injustice, but my better self urged me to squash it in the bud. It wasn\u0027t Alcide\u0027s fault that Debbie Pelt had been such a murderous bitch, and it wasn\u0027t Alcide\u0027s fault that Patrick Furnan had decided to cheat in the contest. Likewise, Alcide wasn\u0027t responsible for Furnan\u0027s bloodthirsty and uncharacteristic approach to consolidating his pack. I wondered if this behavior was even remotely wolflike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured it was just Patrick Furnan-like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone rang, and I jumped about a mile. \"Hello?\" I said, unhappy at how frightened I sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Were Herveaux called me,\" Eric said. \"He confirms that he\u0027s at war with his packmaster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said. \"You needed confirmation from Alcide? My message wasn\u0027t enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d thought of an alternative to the theory that you were attacked in a strike against Alcide. I\u0027m sure Niall must have mentioned that he has enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wondered if one of those enemies had acted very swiftly. If the Weres have spies, so may the fairies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pondered that. \"So, in wanting to meet me, he almost caused my death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he had the wisdom to ask me to escort you to and from Shreveport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he saved my life, even though he risked it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually,\" I said, leaping to firmer emotional ground, \"you saved my life, and I\u0027m grateful.\" I half expected Eric to ask me just how grateful I was, to refer to the kissing... but still he didn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I was about to blurt out something stupid to break the silence, the vampire said, \"I\u0027ll only interfere in the Were war to defend our interests. Or to defend you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy turn for a silent spell. \"All right,\" I said weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you see trouble coming, if they try to draw you in further, call me immediately,\" Eric told me. \"I believe the assassin truly was sent by the packmaster. Certainly he was a Were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of Alcide\u0027s people recognized the description. The guy, Lucky somebody, had just been taken on by Furnan as a mechanic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strange that he\u0027d entrust such an errand to someone he hardly knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since the guy turned out to be so unlucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric actually snorted. Then he said, \"I won\u0027t talk to Niall of this any further. Of course, I told him what occurred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a moment\u0027s ridiculous pang because Niall hadn\u0027t rushed to my side or called to ask if I was okay. I\u0027d only met him once, and now I was sad he wasn\u0027t acting like my nursemaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Eric, thanks,\" I said, and hung up as he was saying good-bye. I should have asked him about my money again, but I was too dispirited; besides, it wasn\u0027t Eric\u0027s problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was jumpy the whole time I was getting ready for bed, but nothing happened to make me more anxious. I reminded myself about fifty times that Amelia had warded the house. The wards would work whether she was in the house or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had some good locks on the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I slept, but I woke up more than once, listening for an assassin. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-dead-to-worse-sookie-stackhouse-8/page-7.html","bookId":2198,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:11 PM"}
