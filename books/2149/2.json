{"id":96442,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eIt was time to find a cure for Brandon. I was more focused on it than I\u0027d ever been. If we could find a cure for him turning into a werewolf, then we\u0027d be able to deal with the singular conflict of me dating a Westsider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy, Abby, and I were in the school library, and I was surfing the net for anything that could help solve Brandon\u0027s lycan condition while they were occupied with a pile of magazines. However, in my surfing, I wasn\u0027t finding anything that seemed reasonable and was becoming increasingly frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnoyed, I was tapping my nails against the keys when Ivy placed her hand on mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" she said. \"What are you so worked up about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh . . . nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you still thinking about werewolves?\" Ivy asked, looking up from her rag mag and peering at the screen. \"We know that Brandon was the costumed stalker. And your report is done. What gives?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh . . .\" I switched to the school\u0027s home page. \"I don\u0027t know. It just stuck with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you trying to cure the Wolfman?\" Ivy teased. \"You\u0027re always helping out the underprivileged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not underprivileged, Ivy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he isn\u0027t one of us.\" She rolled her eyes and returned to her mag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, I know, I thought. I didn\u0027t want to be reminded that my friends didn\u0027t approve of outsiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking of having a party this weekend,\" Abby said. \"Ivy and Nash had one, so it\u0027s my turn. Then it will be yours, Celeste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t imagine hosting a party at my house. Our house was modest, not the grand estates my friends called home. We had a few rooms, but they were filled with hand-knit blankets, outdated sofas, and decades-old carpeting instead of designer decor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, speaking of werewolves,\" I said. \"Maybe we could invite Brandon?\" I asked gingerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There she goes again,\" Ivy protested. \"You are always stuck on him. You feel bad for him because everyone\u0027s been calling him Wolfman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Including you,\" I said. \"And yes, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I kind of do, too,\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" Ivy and I asked in unison. I was happy that I had someone on my side, but I could tell by Ivy\u0027s tone of \"you do?\" that she felt betrayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did find Pumpkin,\" Abby said. \"I was distraught without her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that was a nice thing to do,\" Ivy said. \"But you\u0027ve seen how he eats. Those gloves. He\u0027s weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took Abby\u0027s positive remark as an opportunity to continue to bring Brandon into the mix. \"I think inviting him to your party would be a great way to pay him back,\" I said. \"Someone vandalized his car, so I\u0027m sure he\u0027s feeling awful. This could be an olive-branch opportunity if we included him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh . . . sure,\" Abby said. \"What\u0027s one more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy rolled her eyes. She didn\u0027t like Abby being more amiable than her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be great!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding?\" Ivy said. \"Just like that? Let him into your house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was at Nash\u0027s and seemed pretty normal,\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think people will talk?\" Ivy asked. \"All the popular students, and then him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let them,\" I said. \"Maybe it will be fun to be the center of gossip for a change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone thinks he was the werewolf,\" Ivy challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, maybe he is,\" I said. \"But it won\u0027t be a full moon for a few more weeks.\" I gave her a shot back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This will be cool,\" Abby said. \"I did want to do something for him - for finding Pumpkin, but I didn\u0027t know what. I feel good about this. Thanks for suggesting it, Celeste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy snarled under her breath. \"Awesome, I do, too,\" she said. \"Why don\u0027t we pick him up?\" Ivy asked sarcastically. \"Celeste and me. We can bring him to your house,\" she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI seized this opportunity as well. \"That\u0027s a great idea!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I was just - \" Ivy tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you guys had soft spots in you,\" I said. \"I\u0027m so proud of you both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be fun to have a werewolf at the party,\" Abby said. \"People will be talking about it for ages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was happily daydreaming in third bell, imagining Brandon at Abby\u0027s party. I envisioned Abby and me giving him a tour of her house, he and I exchanging glances from across the room and stealing a kiss in her garage when she needed extra drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter fourth bell, I closely followed Abby and Ivy as they approached Brandon at his locker with their mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to have a party this weekend,\" Abby said. \"And you should come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon appeared surprised by their friendly conversation and invite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\" he asked skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m having a party Friday and would like to invite you,\" Abby said, adjusting her ponytail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped out from behind them. Brandon noticed me, and his skeptical expression brightened. We locked eyes, and for a moment, I was lost in his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby must have noticed because she nudged me. I blushed and twisted my beaded necklace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to repay you for finding my dog,\" Abby said to Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby was the tallest of us girls, but even she didn\u0027t stand as tall as Brandon. He smiled down warmly at my friend, and I wasn\u0027t sure she wasn\u0027t going to blush as well. \"You don\u0027t have to repay me,\" he said sincerely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"I insist you come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste and Ivy will pick you up,\" Abby instructed. \"Be ready at nine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon was taken aback. \"You are going to pick me up?\" he asked Ivy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Abby answered for her. \"They\u0027ll be your escorts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this is really cool,\" he said with a radiant smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll want to come,\" Ivy said in her bossy voice. \"What else do you have to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a quick wink, and we moved to our lockers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see the way he was looking at you?\" Ivy said to me. \"Like a wolf on fresh meat. He\u0027s always staring at you. I think he likes you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good thing you are going out with Nash,\" Abby said. \"Otherwise, you could be dating him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh!\" Ivy cringed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friends cracked up. It was comments like that that made it hard for me to burst out the news that I was in love with Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat afternoon, I was hanging out at Brandon\u0027s guesthouse. The air was still too chilly to spend any time outside without his werewolf form to keep me warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were sitting on top of his bed watching TV, our legs intertwined, sharing a bowl of popcorn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was nice of Abby to invite me to her party,\" he said. \"But if you hadn\u0027t been with them, I\u0027d think they were up to something sneaky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Abby really wants you to come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abby? Or you?\" He was skeptical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, both, silly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you might be behind this . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she really wants you to come. They also think they are inviting a werewolf to the party,\" I confessed softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh . . . they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that ironic?\" I asked. We both laughed. His gorgeous smile radiated like before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Fortunately the full moon is still a few weeks away. I\u0027ve been trying to find a solution. But I haven\u0027t found anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep down I couldn\u0027t help but wait impatiently for the full moon to appear. As a werewolf, Brandon had a magnetic and spellbinding quality that I couldn\u0027t bear to be without.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At this point, I might do anything,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t want to be a werewolf and I don\u0027t want us to be apart.\" He gazed at me longingly. \"Maybe I should meet Dr. Meadows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows was the psychic who originally predicted that I\u0027d be in a snowfall surrounded by wolves and warned me against kissing a werewolf. I had returned to her for help for Brandon, but ultimately she was more interested in getting fame and attention for herself than finding a cure for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t go back to Dr. Meadows,\" I said. \"We can\u0027t trust her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what do we do?\" Brandon was frustrated. He stood up and paced in his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we should go back to Charlie and see if he has any ideas,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d discovered my favorite resident at Pine Tree Village Retirement Community, Mr. Charlie Worthington, was Brandon\u0027s great-grandfather. The elderly man was keen on his Legend\u0027s Run werewolf folklore and liked to talk about how the original creature of the moonlight was his great-grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon seemed pleased with my idea as his dark mood lifted. We grabbed our coats, and he locked his guesthouse door. He politely opened the passenger door of his Jeep and helped me inside, then drove us to Pine Tree Village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington was sitting on the couch in the foyer with an inviting grin, greeting all guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a nice surprise,\" he said, rising. \"It\u0027s not even the weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not here to volunteer,\" I said. \"We want to know more about the Legend\u0027s Run werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, please.\" He was excited to have an eager audience. \"Hold my calls,\" he said to the receptionist, who cracked a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember if he was ever cured?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington took a moment to recollect. \"No, I\u0027m sorry to say he never was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI, too, was disappointed. I was hoping for some magic answers that the Legend\u0027s Run werewolf had discovered that helped him become human again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He lived the rest of his life as a werewolf,\" Mr. Worthington said, \"if you believe it in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We believe it,\" I said. But I was bummed thinking that Brandon, too, would have to spend his entire life running from the full moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re among the few who do,\" Mr. Worthington went on. \"So why, may I ask, are you two so convinced that my great-grandfather, Brandon\u0027s ancestor, was a werewolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Brandon is one, I wanted to say. But I was afraid that Mr. Worthington would have a heart attack right in front of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just think it\u0027s possible,\" I said. \"And you are so convincing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother did have a wild streak in her,\" he said to Brandon. \"But you seem to have turned out fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not so sure,\" Brandon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? You have a nice girlfriend. Don\u0027t tell me you are a wild child, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t say that normally,\" Brandon said. \"But some things have changed . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, your teen years, that\u0027s all,\" Mr. Worthington re-assured. \"I shouldn\u0027t have told you that story. Now you\u0027ll think you are a werewolf, too!\" Mr. Worthington laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we didn\u0027t join in his laughter, Mr. Worthington grew concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I offend you?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" we both replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t seem to be the serious type,\" he went on. \"I thought I could poke a bit of fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we are still interested in your stories,\" Brandon interjected. \"Is there any more you can tell us about the legend? About my family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah . . . yes.\" Mr. Worthington appeared delighted that we - or rather that anyone - was interested in his stories. Many of the seniors at the retirement home longed to talk about their past, but when no one came to visit them, the stories were left to be heard by busy staffers, nurses, or doctors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He lived in isolation. Every time there was a full moon, he roamed the woods alone, tormented by his condition - afraid he\u0027d attack and afraid of being hunted down. Naturally the townsfolk were always trying to find \u0027the wild creature cursed by the moonlight.\u0027 There were those who said their livestock were mauled by him, and even a story in which a man claimed to be attacked by him. But without photos or other proof, they were just thought to be only stories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did anyone try to help your great-grandfather?\" Brandon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. The local Native American chieftain and several gypsies. Potions, salves, and spells. But nothing kept the full moonlight from changing him. Eventually he fled into the woods and never returned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was saddened by his fate. Brandon hung his head low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve often thought that is why your mother was so restless,\" Mr. Worthington continued. \"I can\u0027t understand her behavior - not being responsible. Maybe it is just me trying to justify her behavior. But it is reprehensible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon pushed his hair back off his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I see you have done fine, Brandon,\" Mr. Worthington said. \"Your father takes great care of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And now my grandparents do as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you have this beautiful young lady here. You seem to have it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, except one thing,\" Brandon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\" Mr. Worthington wondered aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The answer to the mystery of your story.\" Brandon leaned in toward his elderly relative. \"What could cure the werewolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah . . . yes,\" Mr. Worthington said. \"That is what you came to find out? I think that is left up to science. Or the mystics. Or the imagination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mystics?\" I asked. I wasn\u0027t sure about going back to Dr. Meadows. But maybe we were supposed to heed Mr. Worthington\u0027s advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Science,\" Brandon said as if that was the answer he\u0027d been waiting for. \"That\u0027s just what I had in mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we have to go to Dr. Meadows,\" I said to Brandon when we got back into his Jeep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie gave us the answer,\" Brandon said. \"My father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But your dad isn\u0027t a mystic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. He\u0027s a scientist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But isn\u0027t he in Europe?\" I asked. Then I paused. \"Does that mean you\u0027ll have to go there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I just know I have to tell him,\" Brandon said. \"But he\u0027s going to freak out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll want to come and get you, won\u0027t he?\" I was worried that if his father took him back with him to Europe, I might never see Brandon again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything happened so fast,\" Brandon said. \"The thought of telling my dad - I was hoping to get this solved by myself. But I see now that I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I wanted Brandon to tell his father - we needed him to tell him. But I didn\u0027t want his father to take him away from Legend\u0027s Run and back to Miller\u0027s Glen or as far away as Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a busy man - and an ocean away. He\u0027s going to totally flip out,\" Brandon said when he pulled into his drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both were lost in thought as he drove down his tree-lined driveway and parked by his guesthouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you call your father and say, \u0027Hey, Dad, I think I\u0027m a werewolf\u0027?\" Brandon appeared overwhelmed by the task at hand and leaned back in his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should invite him here,\" I said. \"Tell him you need him to come home - and plan it just before the full moon appears. Then you won\u0027t need to tell him. Instead, he\u0027ll see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon was considering my suggestion, but he still appeared troubled. \"I hate to be a burden to him. His job is important. Many people rely on him. It\u0027s not like he has a job where he can just come home for lunch. He\u0027s in Europe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re his son. No job is more important than that. He\u0027ll understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know . . . but he\u0027ll think I\u0027m crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Brandon\u0027s father thought he was crazy, it wouldn\u0027t be good for either of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think he will make you leave Legend\u0027s Run?\" I asked, concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know what he\u0027ll do. But I\u0027m not going anywhere.\" Then he placed his hand on mine. \"Not without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want Brandon to leave, but I didn\u0027t want to be so selfish that I stood in the way of his being cured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unbuckled my seat belt and scooted close to him. \"You have to call him. I know it will be awkward. But I know you can do it. I\u0027ll stay with you if you\u0027d like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think this is something I have to do alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my free hand on his knee. His green cargo pants were thick, but I could still feel his toned leg, strong from skating and working on his grandparents\u0027 property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted him to know I was there for him. Didn\u0027t Brandon do everything on his own already? Eat lunch, study, live life as a werewolf. It broke my heart to see him have to face another moment alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027ll call you as soon as I talk to him. If I hurry, I might be able to catch him before he goes to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis meant I\u0027d have to go home; I didn\u0027t want to leave Brandon\u0027s side. I wanted to stay and help him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got out of the Jeep, preoccupied. The impending phone call was causing him major stress. He barely made eye contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be okay,\" I reassured him as I opened my car door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always the cheerleader,\" he said. \"Hey, why aren\u0027t you one? You\u0027d look cute in those short, pleated skirts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried out and didn\u0027t make it,\" I said. \"Freshman year. I guess I\u0027m not coordinated enough. So I cheer from the stands instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon\u0027s blue eyes and red-hot lips blazed. He leaned into me and kissed me, long. I wasn\u0027t about to let go. But then he broke away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call you,\" he said, caressing my cheek with the back of his hand. He leaned in and gave me a hug and another kiss. \"I couldn\u0027t do this without you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Brandon wouldn\u0027t have been in this situation without me, either. I was torn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got into my car and drove away, my heart aching for him and imagining him making the hardest call of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paced inside my home and waited impatiently for Brandon\u0027s call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe will be here in time for the full moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was after midnight when I finally got the text. I was unable to sleep, read, or write and was trying to ease my mind by watching a romantic comedy. When I read his text, a wave of relief flowed through me. Brandon\u0027s father was coming to his rescue, like Brandon had come to mine when I\u0027d been lost in the wintry woods and stumbled upon the pack of wolves. His father was a genius scientist and surely would be able to figure out what Brandon needed to do. It was good that Brandon was finally going to trust someone else with the secret of his lycan condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if Brandon was cured and this full moon would be his last? Was that something I really wanted? Of course, I knew it was, but there was a piece of me that would be haunted by not being with the werewolf that I\u0027d loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d miss our moments together in the snowy woods, surrounded by playful and gentle wolves, his super-strength, powerful and sultry kisses, and ��ber-hot body. I\u0027d have to say good-bye to his unearthly magnetism that I couldn\u0027t get out of my skin; his sensual woodsy smell that remained on my clothes and hair; his divine touch that kept me warm in the coldest of temperatures. I was happy for him but sort of sad for me. These experiences would be only cherished memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the important thing was Brandon would be normal, and he and I could officially date. Maybe my friends could finally accept him into our pack. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-of-the-moonlight-full-moon-2/page-2.html","bookId":2149,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:29 PM"}
