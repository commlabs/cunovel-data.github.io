The vague shape of a distant land mass was my target. Lightning appeared around me, sometimes just barely missing me. I wondered what it would feel like to be struck by lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably hurt like hell. Would I plunge from the sky, to sink to the bottom of the ocean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe. Sinking to the bottom of the ocean didn\u0027t concern me much, since I had little use for my lungs. In fact, I quite enjoyed plunging into the water every now and then and gliding like a great manta ray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanging from one of my scary-looking talons was my favorite Samsonite carry- on bag. I continued about a thousand feet over the churning ocean, buffeted by winds that threatened to knock me off course - threatened, but never succeeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wings were powerful in this form. I was powerful in this form. It would take a lot more than a gale-force wind to knock me down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly, I came upon a rocky shoreline and a few scattered homes. I followed a meandering road that wound along the edge of the land, affording, undoubtedly, wonderful views of the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore homes appeared as the road angled inland. And there, through the driving rain, was the sparkling city of Bellingham. I circled above it within the clouds, looking for a good spot to land, and found one in a park near the university.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI alighted smoothly upon a bench because, in this form, I seemed to prefer landing on something - rocks, tree limbs, park benches - which I could never quite figure out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMust be the bird of prey in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tucked my wings in, and once again saw the vision of the woman in the flame - and soon, a curvy but toned mother of two, was squatting naked on the same park bench, a Samsonite carry-on bag looped around her ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes it\u0027s fun to be me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeird, but fun.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-39.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
