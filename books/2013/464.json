Too late to forgive and too late to be forgiven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered if Seren had known, had perhaps guessed what he would find here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of her made his breath catch in his throat. Oh, he had not known such love could exist. And now, even in the ashes surrounding him here, the future was unfolding like a flower, its scent sweet beyond belief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what love means. 1 finally see-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knife thrust went in under his left shoulder blade, tore through into his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes wide in sudden pain, sudden astonishment, Trull felt Rhulad’s head tilt to one side on his lap, then slide down from hands that had lost all strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Seren, my love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, forgive me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeeth bared, Sirryn Kanar stepped back, tugging his weapon free. One last Tiste Edur. Now dead, by his own hand. Pure justice still existed in this world. He had cleansed the Lether Empire with this knife, and look, see the thick blood dripping down, welling round the hilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thrust to the heart, the conclusion of his silent stalk across the sands, his breath held overlong for the. last three steps. And his blessed shadow, directly beneath his feet-no risk of its advancing ahead to warn the bastard. There was that one moment when a shadow had flitted across the sand-a damned owl, of all things-but the fool had not noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo indeed: the sun stood at its highest point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd every shadow huddled, trembling beneath that fierce ruler in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could taste iron in his mouth, a gift so bitter he exulted in its cold bite. Stepping back, as the body fell to one side, fell right over that pathetic savage’s spear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barbarian dies. As he must, for mine is the hand of civilization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard a commotion at the far end and spun round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quarrel pounded into his left shoulder, flung him back, where he tripped over the two corpses then twisted in his fall, landing on his wounded side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain flared, stunning him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ Hedge moaned, pushing past Koryk who turned with a chagrined expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Damn you, Koryk,’ Fiddler started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ said Quick Ben, ‘You don’t understand, Fid.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoryk shrugged. ‘Sorry, Sergeant. Habit.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler watched the wizard follow Hedge over to where the three bodies were lying on the sand. But the sapper was paying no attention to the skewered Letherii, instead landing hard on his knees beside one of the Tiste Edur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘See the coins on that one?’ Cuttle asked. ‘Burned right in-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That was the Emperor,’ said the captain who had brought them here. ‘Rhulad Sengar. The other Edur… I don’t know. But,’ he then added, ‘your friends do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Fiddler could see that, and it seemed all at once that there was nothing but pain in this place. Trapped in the last breaths, given voice by Hedge’s alarmingly uncharacteristic, almost animal cries of grief. Shaken, Fiddler turned to his soldiers. ‘Take defensive positions, all of you. Captain, you and the other prisoners over there, by that wall, and don’t move if you want to stay alive. Koryk, rest easy with that damned crossbow, all right?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler then headed over to his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd almost retreated again when he saw Hedge’s face, so raw with anguish, so… exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben turned and glanced back at Fiddler, a warning of some sort, and then the wizard walked over to the fallen Letherii.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling, confused, Fiddler followed Quick Ben. Stood beside him, looking down at the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He’ll live,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, Hedge rasped, ‘No he won’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat voice did not even sound human. Fiddler turned in alarm, and saw Hedge staring up at Quick Ben, as if silent communication was passing between the two men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Hedge asked, ‘Can you do it, Quick? Some place with… with eternal torment. Can you do that, wizard? I asked if you can do that!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben faced Fiddler, a question in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no, Quick, this one isn’t for me to say-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fiddler, help me decide. Please.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods, even Quick Ben’s grieving. Who was this warrior? ‘You’re High Mage, Quick Ben. Do what needs doing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard turned back to Hedge. ‘Hood owes me, Hedge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What kind of answer is that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Quick Ben turned, gestured, and a dark blur rose round the Letherii, closed entirely about the man’s body, then shrank, as if down into the sand, until nothing remained. There was a faint scream as whatever awaited the Letherii had reached out to take hold of him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-464.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
