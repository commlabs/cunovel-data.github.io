For example, when dealing with your own kind, whom you have made helpless and at your mercy. Or in the matter of dealing with lesser beasts, when they presume to defy your tyranny. In the palace of the now dead king of Kolanse, there is a vast chamber crowded with stuffed trophies – animals slain by those of the royal line. Wolves, bears, cats. Eagles. Stags, elk, bhederin. They are given postures of ferocity, to mark that final moment of defiance – their presumption to the right to their own lives, one supposes. You are human – as human as was the king of Kolanse. Can you explain to me this sordid need to slay animals? Are we to believe that each and every beast in that chamber sought to kill its slayer?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well now,’ the man replied, ‘I admit to having a personal opinion on such matters, but you have to understand, I never could comprehend the pleasure of slaughter. Those whom I have met who have enjoyed such activities, well, the reasons they tend to give don’t make much sense to me. You could have simply asked the king of Kolanse.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I did,’ Sister Belie said, nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows lifted. ‘And?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He said it made him feel one with the animal he killed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah. I’ve heard similar.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Accordingly,’ she resumed, ‘I killed all his children and had them stuffed and displayed in the same chamber. It was my wish that he feel one with his offspring, too.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I imagine that wasn’t very successful.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. ‘Let us hear your opinion, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Some needs are so pathetic they cannot be satisfied except by killing. I don’t mean those among us who hunt out of necessity. That’s just food. But let’s face it, as soon as you start planting fields and keeping livestock, you don’t need to hunt for food any more.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The king also said it was his means of worshipping nature.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘By destroying it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just my thought, human. But then, is that not your principal means of worship?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now that is a perceptive, if slightly painful, observation. But consider this – in killing and stuffing those children, were you not expressing the same detestable arrogance that so offended you in the first place?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It was an experiment to see if I too could feel one with those I had slain. Alas, I did not. I felt … sad. That I should have such power in my hands, and should choose to use it for destructive ends. And yet I discovered something else – a truth about myself, in fact. There is pleasure in destroying, and it is a most sordid kind of pleasure. I suspect this is what is confused with the notion of “oneness” by such chronic slayers.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re probably right.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because they are, in fact, not particularly intelligent.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I assumed you would arrive at that opinion sooner or later.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, it sounds as if you feel a need to justify killing us, and while you have pity for the lesser beasts of this world, your definition of “lesser beasts” does not include humans. Yet, ironically, your justification is predicated on the very same notion of arrogant superiority that you found so reprehensible in the Kolanse royal family. The beast that knows no better can be slain with impunity. Of course, there is no logic to that notion at all, is there?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Belie sighed. ‘That was most enjoyable. Now I need you to take your own life, so that we may end this pointless battle. I would like to be able to tell you that your army will be well treated, and so on. But the truth is, I will command them – just as I command the Shriven. And with the power of my voice I will set them against my enemies, whoever they may be, and they will fight without fear. They will fight with a ferocity the like of which has never been seen among your kind, because I intend to use them, the way you use horses, or war dogs. In other words, like well-trained beasts.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What a depressing notion, Forkrul Assail. Those pathetic needs I talked about? They all come down to power. The king killed those animals because he had the power to do so, and expressing that power made him feel good. But it never lasts long, so out he goes to kill some more. I find it pathetic. And all that you have just said to me here, well, it’s really the same old shit. By your voice and the sorcery of Akhrast Korvalain you will seek to fill that void in your soul, the void that is the hunger for control, when the bitter truth is, you really control nothing, and the universe is destined to swallow you up just as it does everything else.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-262.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
