{"id":23354,"no":5,"title":"Chapter IV","content":"\u0026nbsp;THE Klan meeting held in the open was well attended. Stover, Springer and McBryan had predicted that there would be but few there. Contrary to their prediction, there were thousands present. Many came to this first public Klan meeting through curiosity; others came earnestly desiring to know something of this much talked of organization. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next time Harold saw Ruth after this meeting she asked, \"Did you attend the Klan meeting?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, I was there and heard every word.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I heard there was a big crowd.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, the crowd was estimated all the way from six to ten thousand.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Stover said that they were drawn there by curiosity and had no intention of joining. He also said there was a morbid curiosity to see some Kluxers in their robes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If they came for that purpose they were not disappointed. There were twelve men in full regalia who passed application blanks.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should have liked to have seen them.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Some time when there is another one we will go, if you care to.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did you like the speech?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very much. He explained the thirteen points of Klanism.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thirteen points, you say; may I ask what they are?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly. These principles are not kept secret. You have the same right to know of them that I have and the other thousands who heard the speech.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He reached in his pocket and took out an inquiry blank with the thirteen principles of the Klan printed thereon and handed it to her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She took it and read aloud as follows:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I am a \"Native Born\" American Citizen, having the best interests of my Community, City, State and Nation at heart, and believe in, viz:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 1. The tenets of the Christian religion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 2. White supremacy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 3. Closer relationship between Capital and American labor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 4. Protection of our pure womanhood.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 5. Preventing the causes of mob violence and lynchings.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 6. Preventing unwarranted strikes by foreign labor agitators.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 7. Prevention of fires and destruction of property by lawless elements.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 8. The limitation of foreign immigration.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 9. Closer relationship of pure Americans.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 10. The up-holding of the Constitution of these United States.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 11. The separation of church and state.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 12. Freedom of speech and press.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 13. The much needed local reforms.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When she had finished reading, Harold asked, \"What is the matter with those principles?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nothing at all so far as I can see, but I thought Jews and Catholics could not join. There is nothing said about either in these principles.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, Ruth. The principles say nothing about either. The Jews cannot subscribe to the first one, the tenets of the Christian religion. The Jews do not believe in the Deity of Christ, consequently they are excluded from this organization.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s so, but I do not see anything in these principles to exclude Catholics.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; but the lecturer said that all candidates for membership in the Klan must, before they become members, be able to declare that they do not owe allegiance to any foreign power, either civil or ecclesiastical. Catholics cannot make this statement—as they owe allegiance to the Pope of Rome.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That makes it perfectly clear why both Roman Catholics and Jews are excluded, but will their exclusion not create bitter feeling and strife?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It seems that the Klan has already aroused the antagonism of Catholics, and they are doing all they can to prevent its growth. But, Ruth, why should the Jews or Catholics object? The Jews have the B\u0027nai B\u0027rith organization and the Catholics have the Knights of Columbus. Protestant Gentiles are excluded from both of these organizations and do not object. I never heard of a Protestant condemning a Catholic for belonging to the Knights of Columbus.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Harold, what about the lawlessness of the Klan?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You see by these principles that it is the purpose of the organization to put down crime and prevent violence and lynchings. The lecturer stated that in no instance had the Klan been convicted of crime.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The principles are good and the organization may be all right in practice, but some way, Harold, I can\u0027t help but wish that you would stay out of it. Maybe it is because I have so much confidence in Mr. Stover and he is so bitterly opposed to it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They were seated on a bench in the park. A dapper young man about Harold\u0027s age approached them and lifted his hat to Ruth. \"How do you do, Miss Babcock.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good evening, Mr. Golter, I want you to meet my friend, Mr. King.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n King stood and shook hands with him. The two men were about the same height, each standing a good six feet. King was the heavier and more rugged in appearance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I heard that you were in town, Mr. Golter, but this is the first time I have had the pleasure of meeting you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have been quite busy in the bank since I arrived in Wilford Springs and have been able to meet scarcely anyone except those who work in the bank. I have had the pleasure of taking several rides with Miss Babcock.\" Ruth colored slightly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are related to Jim Stover?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, he is my uncle. Where are you from, Mr. King?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I was born in Kentucky but came West with my parents when I was only nine years of age, hence I feel that I am of the West as much as if I had been born here.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This is my first experience west of the Mississippi. I was born and educated in Indiana.\" Golter, at King\u0027s invitation, took a seat on the bench. For some time they talked of the opportunities of the West compared to the East. Ruth was asked what she thought of the West as compared to the East.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I like the West,\" she said, \"however, I do not know much of the East—except Virginia. I have been back there often to visit. It is a great place to be entertained;\" and she discussed the hospitality of the people of the state of her ancestors at some length. She spoke in an interesting way of some of her visits to the old plantations. She was a pretty girl and had a dash and at the same time an air of refinement that made her very attractive.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Several times while she was speaking King noticed Golter bestow admiring glances upon her in a way that told him that in Golter he had a rival; but that was no more than he had expected when Ruth spoke of having taken a ride with him a few evenings previous.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There is lots of excitement in town over the Ku Klux Klan,\" remarked Golter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. Were you out to hear the lecture?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I wouldn\u0027t go to hear any of their lectures. I know too much about them.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are acquainted with the activities of the Klan?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, the members in my home town were the lowest class.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Were you a member there?\" There was a trace of sarcasm in King\u0027s voice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly not, sir,\" replied Golter with feeling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How did you know then who were members?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I knew whom they said were members.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A matter of hearsay, then?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, you might call it hearsay, but there are some things one is confident of though he is without positive proof. I know that the organization is lawless.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now, that is what I would like to have proof of. How do you know?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I read the exposure in Judson\u0027s International.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Aren\u0027t the Judson\u0027s publications Catholic?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I believe they are.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t you think Judson\u0027s International might be a bit prejudiced?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think so. It\u0027s a great magazine. Well, I must be going. I will see you at the bank tomorrow,\" he said to Ruth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Harold separated from Ruth at her home, she asked, \"What do you think of Mr. Golter?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To be frank,\" Harold replied, \"I don\u0027t think much of him, that is, I am not favorably impressed.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think he\u0027s nice,\" she said, teasingly, and added, \"don\u0027t you think he is good-looking?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think it\u0027s going to rain,\" Harold remarked and then told her good-night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3286/89872.html","bookId":491,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:33:35 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:33:35 PM"}
