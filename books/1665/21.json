I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at that and spent the next ten minutes snapping pictures of the glittering rocks. Then they started up the rocky hill bathed in sunlight, moving slowly so that Bethany could get a feel for the terrain. Pebbles and loose dirt streamed down behind them as they made their way up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This really isn’t bad,” she said, stopping and glancing behind her. “Whoa. Okay. Remind me not to look back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around. Beth’s spine was ramrod straight. “You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBacktracking to her, he slid a little as he placed a hand on her shoulder. Face pale, she gripped his arm. “Are you sure?” he asked, worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I just don’t think I’ve ever been this high up before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson smiled. “We aren’t that high up, Bethany.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer throat worked. “It doesn’t feel that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she afraid of heights? Oh crap, if that were the case, this was a bad idea. “You want to head back down? We can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” She shook her head, giving him a wobbly smile as she pried her fingers off his arm. “I want to do this with you. Just…just go slowly, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of him wanted to pick her up and zip her back down to the meadow below, but she insisted and he trusted her to tell him when she’d had enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later, he scrambled up the flat rock and reached down to her. “Give me your hand. I’ll pull you up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes narrowed with determination, she placed her hand in his. Warmth cascaded through his chest in response to her trust. Tugging her up, he held her until she was ready to stand. And when she did, he noticed that her legs shook a little as she turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany clutched the camera hanging around her neck. “It’s beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose to his feet, placing his hands on his hips as he took it all in. The sky was that rare, perfect kind of blue. Clouds were fluffy, looking like they were painted in. Tips of ancient elms rose up, concealing the ground below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he said slowly. “It’s amazing. A different world up here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over her shoulder at him. “It would be so cool to be able to sit up here and paint.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany laughed. “I don’t think I’d be able to get my stuff up here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ye of little faith,” he teased. “I can zip your stuff up here and have it ready in three seconds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. “It’s so strange. Sometimes I just forget…what you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people wouldn’t know how to take that, but he recognized it for what it was. And that was why he…why he loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking away, he clamped his mouth shut. The words had been in his chest for weeks, maybe months, demanding to be spoken, but any time he tried to force them out of his mouth, he locked up. Bethany hadn’t said those words, either, and if she didn’t feel the same, he was afraid he’d scare her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of his eye, he saw her inch cautiously toward the edge. “Be careful,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m always careful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson pivoted around and crossed to the other side of the rock. From where he stood, he was almost in perfect alignment with where the colony existed. He sighed, closing his eyes. Neither him nor Daemon had heard from them since the beginning of this year. Soon, he realized, soon he would have to face them, and they’d want to talk about mating. What would he say? There was no way he could even entertain the idea of being with someone else. But he couldn’t tell them about Bethany. He wouldn’t be able to tell them anything. And that would go over like a—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wicked sense of dread shot through him, forcing his eyes open. He glanced down at the sandstone rocks below his feet. The crystals embedded deep into the sediment winked. The surface was shiny, still damp from the recent rain. Slick—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gasp shattered his core, barely audible but as loud as thunder. The scream that came next chilled his entire body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere hadn’t even been a second—time seemed to have stopped, though. His heart pounded in his chest as he whipped around, catching the blurred outline of Beth’s flailing arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLead settled in his stomach, but he shot forward, slipping out of his form without thinking about it. He was fast, but all it took was a second—a second for gravity to do its thing. To reach up and suck Bethany down into nothing but space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was worse than just empty air, because then he would’ve had time to catch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went over the edge blindly, knowing that the side she’d slipped off of had several jagged outcroppings that were bone breaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one, a spike about ten fight long and six feet wide, had stopped her fall about thirty feet down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson wasn’t thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo seconds had passed. Two fucking seconds for him to shed his human form and reach her body, which lay at an odd angle—one leg under the other, an arm hanging limply over the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany wasn’t moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething red pooled under the left side of her head. Not blood—it couldn’t be blood. Whatever it was—because it couldn’t be what it was—leaked from her ears. The camera was gone, having fallen even farther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA part of his brain, the human side, clicked off. Reaching for Beth, he cradled her against his chest, swallowing her in the whitish-blue light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany. Bethany. Bethany. Her name was on repeat. He rocked back against the smooth wall, and he screamed and screamed. His entire world shattered. Open your eyes. Please open your eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn’t move. Some part of him recognized that a human couldn’t have survived that fall depending on how they landed, but Beth…not his Bethany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis…this couldn’t be happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis light flared around them, until he could no longer see her pale face but only an outline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d promised he wouldn’t let anything happen to her. A second—a goddamn second—he had turned away from her. This was his fault. He shouldn’t have brought her up here after so much rain had soaked the ground, coating the bottom of her sneakers. He shouldn’t have kept going up the hill when he’d seen how nervous she was, how shaky her legs were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should’ve been able to stop this—to save her. What the hell kind of power did he have if he couldn’t have saved her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson screamed again, the sound in his ears that of sorrow and rage. But Bethany couldn’t hear it. No one could hear it. Something wet was on his cheeks. Tears, maybe. He wasn’t sure. He couldn’t see past the pulsating light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rested his head against hers, his mouth inches away from her parted lips. His body shook. He inhaled and then exhaled…and the world seemed to stop again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWake up. Wake up. Please wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unknown instinct propelled him forward, a whispering of ages before him. An image filled his mind, of Bethany basked inside and outside in light—his light. It poured through her body, a part of him attaching to her skin, muscles, and bones. He invaded her blood, wrapped himself around her on a cellular level, mending and repairing, healing torn skin and muscle, stitching together shattered bones. It went on and on, seconds into minutes, minutes into hours. Or maybe it wasn’t even a minute that had passed. Dawson didn’t know. But he wasn’t breathing; he wasn’t losing the image or the pleading litany in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWake up. Wake up. Please wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, he wasn’t sure what was happening. He thought he felt her stir in his arms. Then he thought he heard a rough first breath—a weak gulp of air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWake up. Wake up. Please wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shaking, his light pulsating erratically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dawson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of her voice—oh, her sweet voice—destroyed his world for the third time. His eyes flew open, but he still couldn’t see her beyond his own light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany? Are you…? He couldn’t say the words, couldn’t believe somehow she was alive in his arms. And how could she be? Along with losing her, he’d lost his mind. A wave of raw pain crashed through him. Bethany, I love you. I’m sorry I never told you. I love you. I wish I had told you. I love you. And I can’t…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose whispered words weren’t spoken out loud. They were inside him, reverberating through his body and the part of him that had developed something human—a soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his light back into himself. He couldn’t believe what he saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany stared up at him, her warm brown eyes shining with tears. Her face was still pale, but color infused her cheeks. There were smudges of blood around her ears and at the corner of her mouth, but she was looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bethany?” he croaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and whispered, “Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands shaking, he touched her face, and when she closed her eyes, he panicked. “Bethany!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flew open. “I’m here. I’m okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn’t be, but she was alive and breathing in his arms. He ran his fingers down her cheeks, smoothing away the hair caked with blood. His chest was doing that crazy swelling thing again. “Oh, God, I thought…I thought I lost you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you might have.” She gave a shaky laugh. “I’m so, so sorry. I should’ve been paying—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Don’t apologize. This wasn’t your fault.” He kissed her forehead, then her cheek and the tip of her nose. “How are you feeling?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. I’m tired…a little dizzy, but I feel good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was exhausted. As if he’d fought a hundred Arum all at once. Pressing his forehead against hers, he breathed in her clean scent. He couldn’t close his eyes, afraid she might vanish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany trembled. “What did you do, Dawson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. I honestly don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let go of his hand and cupped his cheek. “Whatever you did, it saved…it saved me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany was alive! She was here in his arms, touching him. His cheeks felt wet again, but he didn’t care. Nothing else mattered except the girl he cradled to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany stayed in his arms and on that damn cliff for what felt like hours, and she didn’t want to ever leave his embrace. She was warm wrapped in his arms. But they had to go. She stood, surprised that she even could. There was no doubt in her mind that at least one of her legs had been broken. And by the amount of blood that had dried in her hair, she was sure her skull had been cracked like an egg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the pause on those thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, she couldn’t even begin to think about what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson looked weary as he climbed, but he lifted her off her feet, holding her against his chest. There was only one way to get back down. “Hold on and close your eyes,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany did as instructed and felt the change in him. His body hummed, and she could see his bright light behind her lids. The wind rushed at her face, blowing her hair back. Seconds later, his lips brushed her forehead. When she realized he was walking, she struggled in his arms. He was obviously weaker now and shouldn’t be carrying her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadows-lux-0/page-21.html","bookId":1665,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:45 PM"}
