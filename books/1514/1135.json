However, he could detect a travel weary aura from Lin Dong’s body, testament to the fact that the latter had hurried over without rest. This caused a warm feeling to emerge in his heart. An ordinary person did not have the courage to involve themselves in the troubles of his Celestial Demon Marten tribe, but Lin Dong did so without any second thoughts…\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I am already aware of the general situation.

After all, Little Marten had been missing for a hundred years. The prestige that he enjoyed in the tribe could not be compared with back then. Additionally, his father, the current Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader, was still in an extremely long seclusion.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What can I do to help?” Lin Dong looked at Little Marten.

He waved his sleeve and a circular light barrier covered the stone pavilion. After which, his somewhat low voice was slowly emitted, “I wish for you to go to the Heavenly Cave where my father is in deep seclusion. He has been in seclusion for a hundred years this time and there has been no news from inside. There was no response even when I sent a message to him.

He was not unfamiliar with this name, because those powerful Yimo which had attacked Divine Flame Hall had come from this extremely mysterious and powerful faction!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Do you know what this is?” Little Marten asked in surprise after seeing Lin Dong’s expression.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“A mysterious organisation formed by the Yimo. Come to think about it, it is likely the most terrifying faction in this world…” Lin Dong sighed softly. After which, he briefly described his experiences back at Flame Divine Hall.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I was able to guess that this matter might be related to the Yimo. However, I never expected that… it is actually an organisation.” Little Marten muttered to himself. Soon after, his expression became ferocious. “These damn things have actually unknowingly invaded my Celestial Demon Marten tribe!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong also deeply inhaled a breath of air as he suppressed the shock within his heart. The methods of this ‘Devil Prison’ were really far too amazing. They were actually able to gain access to one of the four overlord tribes, the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, without anyone realising. Moreover, they had even managed to trap the tribe leader, who was in seclusion within the Heavenly Cave.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Even though the strength of that ‘Devil Prison’ can be described as monstrous, it will be difficult for them to pull of such a thing all by themselves.

A Celestial Demon Marten tribe was perhaps no match for the strength of the Devil Prison, but if the latter wished to do something like this without anyone in the entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe realising, they would need someone familiar with what was going on within the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. In order to do this, there must be an inside agent providing them such information.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn other words, there was a spy in their Celestial Demon Marten tribe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Which son of a bitch?!” Wu Zhong’s eyes were sinister while a dense murderous aura surged from within his body.
