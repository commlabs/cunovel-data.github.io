There he was, standing in his office, and he\u0027s clearly out of the picture - wouldn\u0027t say so to her face, but she\u0027d seen defeat in his eyes, his posture,I quit written all over him - and a couple of minutes later he\u0027s jumping into the elevator with her and not looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad he truly been on the fence and she\u0027d misread him? She\u0027d been sosure ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, no use in beating it to death. He was still on board. That was what counted. She didn\u0027t know how good Sullivan was, but at least the sims still had a lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped next to a high privet hedge and she pulled in behind him. She grabbed her umbrella and stepped out of her car. The umbrella was auto open which was good because she had the briefcase in her other hand. She had no intention of leaving it in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn umbrellaless Sullivan came splashing over to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me help,\" he said, reaching for the briefcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe handed him the umbrella handle. \"Help with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aaawww,\" he said, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice smile. Gave him a boyish look. Like a mischievous child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether they sloshed through the soggy grass toward a barrack-like building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most of the caddies and gardening sims should be in. Not a golf day. You\u0027ll have to come back at night after the kitchen and dining room close to catch all of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick knocked and they were admitted by a grinning sim he introduced as Tome. Romy was prepared for the barrack, and her tours of the SimGen dorms prepared her for the vague musty odor that attended a crowd of sims. But she was totally unprepared for the reception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Jesus\u0027 return to Jerusalem: cheering, waving, jumping on furniture, and cries of \"Mist Sulliman!\" from a dozen sim throats. Everything short of throwing palm fronds at his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlushed and looking a little embarrassed, Sullivan turned and gave her a self-conscious shrug. \"My clients.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God,\" she said, unable to hide her awe. \"They...they love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sheepish grin. \"Yeah, well...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They truly do. How could you have ever even considered...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes widened, not in surprise that she\u0027d guessed, more in fear that she\u0027d say it out loud. But she\u0027d never do that - not to his sims. Everyone, even sims, needed someone or something to believe in, even if their god was made of tin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that need in these sims further bolstered her conviction that all sims were too close to human to be treated as they were...as property...as slaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all very complicated,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy shook her head. \"No, it\u0027s not. It\u0027s all very simple, really: You do the right thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But right for whom? What\u0027s good for the right hand may not necessarily be good for the left. In case you don\u0027t know, my specialty is labor relations. It\u0027s all negotiation. The art of the possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was smooth, his eyes intent, his smile sincere. He was good, he was persuasive, and no doubt that he was smart. She wondered if Zero looked like Patrick Sullivan. But Sullivan wasn\u0027t Zero, and Romy wasn\u0027t buying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to draw a line somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"The client and the opposition draw the lines. Then I try to get them to redraw their lines in places that both sides can live with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But these particular clients can\u0027t draw that line,\" she told him. \"They don\u0027t know how, they wouldn\u0027t know where. So you\u0027ve got to draw it for them, making certain it\u0027s in the right place. And then you\u0027ve got to stand behind that line and say, \u0027This far and no farther.\u0027 No matter what is thrown against you -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;SimGen, the Teamsters, the US Government: \u0027This far and no farther.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Sullivan\u0027s turn to shake his head. \"It\u0027s all so clear and simple to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crystal and absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tumultuous greeting had run its course, but a second round of cheering followed when Sullivan introduced Romy and announced that she was contributing \"lots of money\" to pay for the legal battles ahead. That finally died down, and now the sim called Tome was leading a young female toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mist Sulliman. Meet new sim. Anj.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDressed in the bib overalls and T-shirt that seemed to be the off-duty uniform of the Beacon Ridge sims, Anj was young and slight - couldn\u0027t have weighed more than eighty pounds fully dressed - and clung shyly to Tome, not making eye contact. Romy put out her hand and Tome had to take Anj\u0027s arm and extend it for a handshake. But she needed no prompting to grasp Sullivan\u0027s. Even smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old sim grinned. \"Tome tell Anj all \u0027bout Mist Sulliman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gathering\u0027s attention shifted from the two humans to the food cart that was being wheeled in by a pair of kitchen sims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lunch,\" said Tome. \"You eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both declined and watched as Tome led Anj away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems awful young, doesn\u0027t she?\" Sullivan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy was seething. \"SimGen can\u0027t breed sims fast enough to meet demand, so they\u0027re leasing them out at younger and younger ages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched them line up, plates in hand, for servings of some sort of stew being ladled out of a big pot withSIMS hand printed in red on the side. A scuffle broke out between two of them when one tried to cut ahead in line. Tome had to leave Anj to break it up, and she stood alone, looking lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s criminal,\" Romy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan didn\u0027t seem too concerned. \"Speaking of lunch, we need someplace to talk. How about - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a big breakfast. How about right here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too crowded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re busy eating,\" she said, gesturing to the sims seating themselves at the long tables. \"Besides, I\u0027m used to being around sims. I work for OPRR. I\u0027m a field agent in its Division of Animal Welfare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds government.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes and no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found a couple of empty easy chairs angled toward each other and she explained how the Office for the Protection of Research Risks was part of the National Institutes of Health, indirectly funded by the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then that\u0027s government money?\" he said, pointing to the briefcase. \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll be allowed to use - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mymoney, Mr. Sullivan,\" she replied, glad she could say that truthfully. \"Mine. To do with as I wish, and this happens to be what I wish. But I want a commitment from you, Mr. Sullivan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only judges and opposing attorneys call me Mr. Sullivan. Makes me feel like I\u0027m in court. Call me Patrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if I do, she thought, looking at him, I suppose I\u0027m going to have to tell you to call me Romy. First names make us sound like friends. Do I want to sound like your friend, Patrick Sullivan? Can I trust you enough?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe when we know each other better...when I see how much of a commitment you have to this project. I\u0027m more interested in commitment than first names, Mr. Sullivan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment Anj appeared at his side and squeezed next to him in his chair. \"Um, uh...hello, Anj,\" he said, looking nonplused and not a little uncomfortable. \"Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young sim said nothing as she draped herself across his lap, then curled up and began sucking her thumb. She looked so small and fragile in those baggy overalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too young,\" Romy said. And through her cooking anger she could imagine Raging Romy beginning to stir. \"They\u0027re sending them out too damn young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan sat stiff as a board in his easy chair. \"What\u0027s she doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy noticed Anj\u0027s eyelids drooping. \"Looks like she\u0027d going to take a nap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. And what do I do while she\u0027s catching Z\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just sit there while we finish our discussion,\" Romy said, not particularly liking herself for the enjoyment she was taking in his discomfiture. \"Commitment, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to make me sick of that word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t need to mention it again if I get it from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commitment how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you\u0027ll devote enough of your professional time to the sims to see that they get a fair shake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time?\" he said, eyebrows rising. \"You want time, you got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s more than time.\" How could she explain this? \"There\u0027s an obscure Paul Simon song called \u0027Everything Put Together Falls Apart.\u0027 It doesn\u0027t get played much but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember it. A jazzy, bluesy thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it. I don\u0027t recall the lyrics but I\u0027ve never forgotten the title, because I\u0027ve always added my own coda:unless you act . The world does not become a better place andstay a better place on its own. It takes effort. Constant effort, because entropy is the default process. And so every day is a battle against the tendency for things to devolve to a lower state - of existence, of civilization, of meaning, of everything that matters. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve brought you this money. Because everything put together falls apart - unless you act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can\u0027t see sims as entropic. If anything - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To create a new self-aware species is a magnificent accomplishment; to use them as slaves is to drag that accomplishment through the mud; to accept that circumstance is poison for the human soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed and nodded. \"Can\u0027t argue with that. All right, I\u0027ll promise you more than time. As of today I\u0027m quitting Payes \u0026amp; Hecht to devote myself full time to these guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy couldn\u0027t help but wonder if Sullivan was quitting his firm or his firm was quitting him. No matter. Either way he\u0027d have only one client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent, Mr. Sullivan. I\u0027ll deposit the money this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to be a long, bumpy road,\" he said. He gestured around at the barrack. \"I mean, let\u0027s face it: This isn\u0027t a bad life. These sims have it pretty good, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe, but they\u0027re a lucky minority. You can\u0027t imagine what I\u0027ve seen. As a matter of fact...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped herself. Did she dare? Yes. Why not? Mr. Patrick Sullivan needed something to rile him up, stiffen his spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell you what,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll call you in the next day or two and bring you along as I wind up an investigation I\u0027ve been pursuing for weeks. You game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Sure. I\u0027ll just need - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnj whimpered. Her eyes remained closed in sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Misses her mother, I\u0027ll bet,\" Romy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan stared down at the young sim. \"Afraid I can\u0027t help her there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want me to take her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised a hand and gingerly, gently, began stroking her stiff, stringy hair. \"No. That\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy realized she was catching a glimpse of a facet of Patrick Sullivan that he hid from the world, perhaps even from himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You prefer Patrick to Pat?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up with a surprised expression, then grimaced. \"Pat sounds like an androgynous serving of butter, and Patty makes me sound like I should be holding up the bar at the Dublin House Pub. Just Patrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Patrick,\" she said. She hesitated, then figured, what the hell. \"And you might as well call me Romy.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-22.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
