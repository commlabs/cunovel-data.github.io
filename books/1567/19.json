Harry\u0027s dreams were confused and disturbing: Nagini wove in and out of them, first through a wreath of Christmas roses. He woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had called out to him in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand. The snow was falling thickly, and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll move somewhere more sheltered,\" she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas. \"I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside. I even though I saw somebody one or twice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure I imagined it,\" said Hermione, looking nervous. \"The snow the dark, it plays tricks on your eyes.... But perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and Hermione clutching the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness engulfed them; Harry\u0027s feet parted company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered in leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we?\" he asked, peering around at the fresh mass of trees as Hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out the tent poles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Forest of Dean,\" she said, \"I came camping here once with my mum and dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at least protected from the wind. They spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue flames that Hermione was adept at producing, and which could be scooped up and carried in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe, an impression reinforced by Hermione\u0027s solicitousness. That afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter two nights of little sleep, Harry\u0027s senses seemed more alert than usual. Their escape from Godric\u0027s Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more threatening. As darkness drove in again Harry refused Hermione\u0027s offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable. He was on the point of taking out the Marauder\u0027s Map, so as to watch Ginny\u0027s dot for a while, before he remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest. Harry knew that it must be full of living creatures, but he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other, sinister movements. He remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself. Their protective enchantments had worked for weeks; why should they break now? And yet he could no throw off the feeling that something was different tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had fallen asleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparation and Apparation. He had just held a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees. Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to drift toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione\u0027s wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch black in silhouette, and still the thing came closer....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a silver white doe, moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but her inexplicable familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until this moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone. He knew, he would have staked his life on it, that she had come for him, and him alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. \"Come back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon he brightness was striped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was not Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest she led him, and Harry walked quickly, sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her properly. And then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward him once more, and he broke into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened his lips to ask it, she vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was still imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he lowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now fear came: Her presence had meant safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lumos!\" he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green light burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but all that was there was a small, frozen pool, its black, cracked surface glittering as he raised his wand higher to examine it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the pool\u0027s edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red...It was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt....The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were here? In which case, where was the person who wanted to pass it to Harry? Again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye, but he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, \"Accio Sword.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help,\" he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry\u0027s head answered him: Their daring nerve and chivalry set Gryffindor apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where \"chivalry\" entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a pang of Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the pouch containing his wand, his mother\u0027s letter, the shard of Sirius\u0027s mirror, and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed Hermione\u0027s wand at the ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diffindo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence. The surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the sword he would have to submerge himself completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer. He stepped to the pool\u0027s edge and placed Hermione\u0027s wand on the ground still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how much colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering, he jumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery pore of his body screamed in protest. The very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. He could hardly breathe: trembling so violently the water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blade with his numb feet. He only wanted to dive once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasping and shaking, until he told himself that it must be done, gathered all his courage, and dived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold was agony: It attacked him like fire. His brain itself seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out, groping for the sword. His fingers closed around the hilt; he pulled it upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something closed tight around his neck. He thought of water weeds, though nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised his hand to free himself. It was not weed: The chain of the Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the surface, but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around his chest were surely Death\u0027s....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he came to facedown in the snow. Somewhere, close by, another person was panting and coughing and staggering around, as she had come when the snake attacked....Yet it did not sound like her, not with those deep coughs, no judging by the weight of the footsteps....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior\u0027s identity. All he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh. It was gone. Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are ¨C you ¨C mental?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given Harry the strength to get up. Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the hell,\" panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, \"didn\u0027t you take the thing off before you dived?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared with Ron\u0027s reappearance; he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the water\u0027s edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after sweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to be real: He had just dived into the pool, he had saved Harry\u0027s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was y-you?\" Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker than usual due to his near-strangulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yeah,\" said Ron, looking slightly confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Y-you cast that doe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Patronus is a stag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry put Hagrid\u0027s pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final sweater, stooped to pick up Hermione\u0027s wand, and faced Ron again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come you\u0027re here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ve ¨C you know ¨C I\u0027ve come back. If ¨C\" He cleared his throat. \"You know. You still want me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, in which the subject of Ron\u0027s departure seemed to rise like a wall between them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had just saved Harry\u0027s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah, I got it out,\" he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the sword for Harry\u0027s inspection. \"That\u0027s why you jumped in, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"But I don\u0027t understand. How did you get here? How did you find us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long story,\" said Ron. \"I\u0027ve been looking for you for hours, it\u0027s a big forest, isn\u0027t it? And I was just thinking I\u0027d have to go kip under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that dear coming and you following.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t see anyone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Ron. \"I ¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because you\u0027d gone in and you hadn\u0027t come up, so I wasn\u0027t going to make a detour to ¨C hey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry was already hurrying to the place that Ron had indicated. The two oaks grew close together; there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level, an ideal place to see but not be seen. The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see no sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything there?\" Ron asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how did the sword get in that pool?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from Hermione\u0027s wand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You reckon this is the real one?\" asked Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One way to find out, isn\u0027t there?\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Horcrux was still swinging from Ron\u0027s hand. The locket was twitching slightly. Harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione\u0027s wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here.\" he said and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock\u0027s surface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No you should do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" said Ron, looking shocked. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it\u0027s supposed to be you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to open it,\" said Harry, \"and you will stab it. Straightaway okay? Because whatever\u0027s in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the Diary tried to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you going to open it?\" asked Ron. He looked terrified \"I\u0027m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,\" said Harry. The answer came so readily to his lips that thought that he had always known it deep down: Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the serpentine S, inlaid with glittering green stones: It was easy to visualize it as a miniscule snake, curled upon the cold rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" said Ron. \"Don\u0027t open it! I\u0027m serious!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" asked Harry. \"Let\u0027s get rid of the damn thing, it\u0027s been months ¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t, Harry, I\u0027m serious ¨C you do it ¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because that thing\u0027s bad for me!\" said Ron, backing away from the locket on the rock. \"I can\u0027t handle it! I\u0027m not making excuses, for what I was like, but it affects me worse than it affects you and Hermione, it made me think stuff ¨C stuff that I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse. I can\u0027t explain it, and then I\u0027d take it off and I\u0027d get my head straight again, and then I\u0027d have to put the effing thing back on ¨C I can\u0027t do it Harry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do it,\" said Harry, \"you can! You\u0027ve just got the sword, I know it\u0027s supposed to be you who uses it. Please just get rid of it Ron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed, then still breathing hard through his long nose, moved back toward the rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me when,\" he croaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On three,\" said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach. It would have been easy to pity it, except that the cut around Harry\u0027s neck still burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One... two... three...open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide open with a little click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom Riddle\u0027s eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit-pupiled \"Stab,\" said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly, bracing himself, already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a voice hissed from out the Horcrux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have seen your heart, and it is mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t listen to it!\" Harry said harshly. \"Stab it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stab!\" shouted Harry, his voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter... Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend...

Ron raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, Riddle\u0027s eyes gleamed scarlet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the locket\u0027s two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed like two grotesque bubbles, the heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket, first chests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, swaying over Ron and the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron!\" he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking with Voldemort\u0027s voice and Ron was gazing, mesmerized, into its face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why return? We were better without you, happier without you, glad of your absence.... We laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your presumption¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Presumption!\" echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real Hermione: She swayed, cackling, before Ron, who looked horrified, yet transfixed, the sword hanging pointlessly at his side. \"Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One? What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron, stab it, STAB IT!\" Harry yelled, but Ron did not move. His eyes were wide, and the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione were reflected in them, their hair swirling like flames, their eyes shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother confessed,\" sneered Riddle-Harry, while Riddle-Hermione jeered, \"that she would have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who wouldn\u0027t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him,\" crooned Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a close embrace: Their lips met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ground in front of them, Ron\u0027s face filled with anguish. he raised the sword high, his arms shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it, Ron!\" Harry yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron ¨C?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword flashed, plunged: Harry threw himself out of the way, there as a clang of metal and a long, drawn-out scream. Harry whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend himself, but there was nothing to fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone: There was only Ron, standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do. Ron was breathing heavily: His eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue: they were also wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux. Ron had pierced the glass in both windows: Riddle\u0027s eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished; torturing Ron had been its final act. The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees, his head in his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside Ron, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After you left,\" he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron\u0027s face was hidden, \"she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn\u0027t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not finish; it was now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s like my sister,\" he went on. \"I love her like a sister and I reckon that she feels the same way about me. It\u0027s always been like that. I thought you knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Ron\u0027s enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said in a thick voice. \"I\u0027m sorry I left. I know I was a ¨C a ¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down upon him and claim him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve sort of made up for it tonight,\" said Harry. \"Getting the sword.

Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy, with Ron by his side, the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that he entered the tent, Ron lagging a little behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only illumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did not move until Harry had said her name several times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hermione!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?

Who ¨C?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. Harry backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron\u0027s rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the canvas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale face. She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak hopeful smile and half raised his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch ¨C ow ¨C gerroff!

Never before had he seen her lose control like this; she looked quite demented. \"Give me back my wand!

It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but there were still five of them and only one of me, and they\u0027d taken my wand.
