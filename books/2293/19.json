It wasn’t hard to imagine her or many of the other girls doing anything to earn vampire brownie points. But did she want vampire attention badly enough that she’d help kill her friend to get it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma shrugged. “It could be a Draug.” She knew Draugs as well as I did, having fought one with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t rule it out,” I said, though I had a hard time believing it was anything but a thinking, scheming vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From what you learned on your mission,” Emma began carefully, “it seems like…” She looked from me to Mei and back again. “There might be other stuff, on other islands, that we still don’t understand.” She gave me a pointed do-you-understand-my-hint look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was hedging around one of my least favorite topics: Lilac. Subtle, Em.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMei shifted to the edge of her seat. “Would you like me to leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Emma and I said at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I repeated, rubbing my temples. Thoughts of Lilac did nothing to help my killer headache. “You can hear this.” I needed to trust my new roommate. What would my life be if I never trusted anyone ever again? Besides, I had a good feeling about Mei-Ling, and one of us had to take the leap. Who knew? Maybe if I confided in her, she’d open up a little more to me. “Look, this isn’t for public consumption, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI proceeded to give her the full download. Lilac, the crazy pyromaniac roommate. How I’d supposedly killed her in the Directorate Challenge. The weird tension between me and Alcántara on our mission together. The mysterious sighting of someone who looked exactly like her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait.” Mei stopped me, confused. And of course she was—I was confused, and this was my story. “Didn’t you see Lilac’s body? How could she be alive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered back to that day. By the time our fight was over, I was covered in bruises, slashes, and third-degree burns. Not a lot else registered. “I thought she was dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma spoke for me. “They took away the injured girls. They always do. We don’t know what happens to them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe it wasn’t her you saw,” Mei said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I was hallucinating, but then I mentioned it to Alcántara and he wigged out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked alarmed. “Wigged how?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing crazy. You know, he got all…focused. Distant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Strange,” she said, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I could do was nod at that, the understatement of the year. How or why Lilac could be alive and living with a bunch of crazy Germanic vampire monks was a mystery. And rather than put it behind me, it loomed out there like something that might come and bite me in the butt while I slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all quiet then, considering what it could mean, when Kenzie startled us out of it. She was walking down the hall, banging on doors as she went. “Lights out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMei-Ling glared at the door. “She’s like the warden in a prison movie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Emma’s hand on my shoulder. She whispered, “You going to be okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered her question. I had a new roommate, and not only was she not a psycho, she might end up being a friend. I gave Emma a true smile. “Yeah, I think I just might.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Emma left, Mei flicked off the lights as I got into bed. I chuckled in the darkness. “Talk about overwhelming you with information on your first week, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her response was somber. “We could investigate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI edged up onto my elbows. “My thought exactly.” I weighed my words. How much could I trust her? I decided it was all or nothing. “I’ve already tried a little. Investigating, I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’d you find out?” Eager excitement tinged her voice. I’d been right—despite our age difference, Mei was total good friend material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing really. Trinity fought her attacker and ended up on the rocks near the cove. We already knew all that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” she began, “next we could…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next we could…what?” I’d hit a dead end. “Anyway, we’re locked in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could investigate without leaving the dorm. I’m sure we could find out more about the latest killing if we asked around. Gossiping is all anyone has been doing since lockdown.” She was showing me a whole new side. Apparently her stoic act masked total unflinching guts. “It’s possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her idea real consideration. I was beginning to dig my new roomie, and it could only mean trouble. As it was, I had a sinking feeling the day was coming when the powers-that-be would drop Emma and me into some vampire coliseum and force us to go gladiator on each other. No, I had to protect her. “Possible, but too dangerous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If there were three of us, it’d be safer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emma, you mean? Even if we convinced her, she and Yas are inseparable, and I don’t know if she’d do it without him.” I loved Yasuo, but until I understood what was really going on with those Trainees, I wasn’t ready to have one hundred percent trust in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then it’ll be just you and me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed outright at that. “You and me?” I gave it a moment’s thought. But then I dismissed the notion—I needed someone who’d watch my back, which I doubted Mei had the skills to do. “I don’t even know what your weapon is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have a weapon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” I sat up in bed—there’d be no sleeping anytime soon—and the rapid movement amplified the pounding in my head. “We all have weapons. Everyone’s assigned one on the first day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t they have something waiting for you in your drawer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I had was this.” She stood and rifled through her dresser, pulling something out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hopped out of bed and pulled aside a corner of the shades to let in the watery moonlight. She held something long and thin, and I snatched it from her to make sure there wasn’t a blade concealed in there somewhere. I hefted it in my hands and peered down the length of it. “They gave you a flute?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a flute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Masha is gunning for us. There’s a killer on the loose. You’re jonesing to go play Nancy Drew. And all you’ve got to protect yourself is a flute.” I crawled back into bed, suddenly overwhelmed. No wonder the vampires needed me to look out for her—they’d given the girl a flute as her only protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a D’Tzu,” she said, sounding amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, fine. It’s a…that. But trust me, call it what you like, but it won’t kill any Draugs. It’s not even metal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s bamboo.” She held it to her mouth. “Shall I play it for you? It’ll relax you.” The way she’d said it—all calm and sure—sounded so culty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re scaring me, Mei.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The infamous Acari Drew is afraid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, I punched my pillow into shape and flopped my head down. “You don’t scare me, Ho. Go for it. Play your little flute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard her suck in a breath, then immediately winced at the sharp, high-pitched sound her instrument made. It reminded me of a cheesy kung fu movie soundtrack—like something that might play as an old wise man emerged from the mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay in the dark, patiently waiting for her to finish, wondering which would happen first, glass breaking or Kenzie knocking on the door, telling us to shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then something changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music triggered something in my brain. There was a shift. A wave of calm. My headache subsided. I began to register a song where before there’d been only shrill, atonal notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music became hypnotic. It surrounded me, filled me, enveloped me. As that high pitch hummed through my skull, memories swamped me. Mental snapshots of my mother, simple and random.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe unloaded groceries from the car, hitching a bag on her hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put on lipstick and caught my eyes in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snapped her clutch shut with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe widened her eyes, chugging soda as her Coke bottle fizzed over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged me, enveloping me in her lemony scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe images faded, but the scent lingered as I became aware of my bed again. Mei-Ling had finished playing. My pillow was damp. I touched my face—I was crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMei had managed to reach deep into those parts of myself that I’d buried and forgotten. It was the most cathartic experience of my life. And it was the most terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was Mei’s secret. And her weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd her talents would only be enhanced over time as she consumed more of the blood. I lay there, unable to speak. The possibilities were endless. Could she hypnotize people? Trigger reactions in entire crowds? Would she be powerful enough to influence even the vampires?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf vampires could harness her gift—gaining the ability to hypnotize with music, influence emotion, manipulate memory and thought, to control those around them—it would be a powerful weapon indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like to sleep now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a jolt of alarm. “Can that thing put me to sleep?” I had no doubts it’d work in the euthanizing sense of the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat at the edge of the bed, seeming calmed. When I saw her smile in the moonlight, I realized she hadn’t given me many true smiles. I liked the sight. “Relax, Acari Drew. You’ll wake up again. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mei, it’s just Drew. You gotta call me Drew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to play again, quietly this time. For the first time since the bond, the gnawing in my gut subsided. In the moment before I drifted off, I hoped I’d get to feel my mother’s embrace one more time. But the black void of sleep was all that waited for me. Cold sleep and dreams of vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was climbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I knew was the rock in front of my eyes and my own breath reverberating in my head. My fingers found handholds without effort. My legs pushed me up—just as Carden had said they would. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-fever-the-watchers-3/page-19.html","bookId":2293,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:38 PM"}
