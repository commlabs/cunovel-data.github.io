They sat in the back, holding each other the whole way, not saying a word until they thanked him when he dropped them off. On the drive back to the station Rivera tried to formulate a story that would save his career. Any version of the true story seemed like a sure ticket to a psychological disability retirement. In the end he decided to tell the story as far as the point where The Breeze disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA month later Rivera was pumping Slush-Puppies at the Seven-Eleven, working undercover for the robbery division. However, with the arrest of a team of robbers that had terrorized convenience stores in the county for six months, he was promoted to lieutenant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda and Travis rode with Howard. At Amanda\u0027s request, Gian Hen Gian saw that Effrom\u0027s body was turned to stone and placed inside the cave. When Howard stopped in front of Amanda\u0027s house, she invited Travis to come inside. He refused at first, wanting to leave her alone with her grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you completely missed the significance of all this, Travis?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did it occur to you that the presence of Catch and Gian Hen Gian proves that Effrom is not gone completely? I will miss him, but he goes on. And I don\u0027t want to be alone right now. I helped you when you needed it,\" she said, and she waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis went in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward went home to work on a new menu for his restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Technical Sergeant Nailsworth never found out what happened to Roxanne or who she really was, and he was heartbroken. Because of his grief he was unable to eat, lost a hundred and fifty pounds, met a girl at a computer user\u0027s meeting, and married her. He never had computer sex again outside the privacy of his home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e37\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGOOD GUYS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugustus Brine declined offers for a ride home. He wanted to walk. He needed to think. Gian Hen Gian walked at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can repair your truck, make it fly if you wish,\" the Djinn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want it,\" Brine said. \"I\u0027m not even sure I want to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may do as you wish, Augustus Brine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to go back to the store either. I think I\u0027ll give the business to Robert and Jenny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it wise to put the drunkard in the wine barrel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t drink anymore. I want them to have the house, too. I\u0027ll start the paperwork in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You doubt the word of the King of the Djinn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked in silence for a while before Brine spoke again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems wrong that Travis has lived so long without having a life, without love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like yourself, you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not like myself. I\u0027ve had a good life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you have me make him young again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrine thought for a moment before he answered. \"Could you make him age in reverse? For each year that passes he is a year younger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And her, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amanda. Could you make them grow young together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can be done, if you command it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is done. Will you tell them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not right away. It will be a nice surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what of yourself, Augustus Brine? What is it you wish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I always thought I\u0027d make a good madam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the Djinn could say anything else, Rachel\u0027s van sputtered up beside them and stopped. She rolled down the window and said, \"Do you need a ride, Gus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is trying to think,\" the Djinn snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be rude,\" Brine said to the Djinn. \"Which way are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know for sure. I don\u0027t feel like going home\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;maybe ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrine walked around the front of the van and slid open the cargo door. \"Get in, Gian Hen Gian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Djinn got into the van. Brine slammed the cargo door and climbed into the passenger seat next to Rachel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"East,\" Brine said. \"Nevada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was called King\u0027s Lake. When it appeared in the desert, it simultaneously appeared on every map of Nevada that had ever been printed. People who had passed through that part of the state swore that they had never seen it before, yet there it was on the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove the tree-lined banks of King\u0027s Lake stood a palace with a hundred rooms. Atop the palace a massive electric sign read, BRINE\u0027S BAIT, TACKLE, AND FINE WOMEN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who visited the palace was greeted by a beautiful, dark-haired woman, who took their money and led them to a room. On their way out a tiny brown man in a rumpled suit returned their money and wished them well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon returning home the visitors told of a white-haired man who sat all day in the lotus position at the end of a pier in front of the palace, fishing and smoking a pipe. They said that when evening approached, the dark-haired woman would join the man and together they would watch the sun go down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitors were never quite clear as to what had happened to them while they were at the palace. It didn\u0027t seem to matter. But after a visit they found that they appreciated the simple pleasures that life presented to them and they were happy. And although they recommended Brine\u0027s to their friends, they never returned themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat went on in the rooms is another story altogether. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/practical-demonkeeping/page-18.html","bookId":2045,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:42:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:42:50 PM"}
