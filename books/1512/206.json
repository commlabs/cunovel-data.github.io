This was his weapon for the battle, also his only mean of suppressing team Devil at long range.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sniping talents were difficult to come by. Even though it sounded easy, just aim and pull the trigger, but in reality, one millimeter offset meant missing by several meters when the bullet reached the target distance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zero’s offensive power surpassed everyone given enough distance when he was on the team. He didn’t unlock his constraint. It was due to his strength during the battle with team India they were able to overcome and in the end wiped the team. A sniper’s effectiveness in combat well surpass any other team members. Similarly, they were weak in close range. Either Yinkong or he only need one attack to finish off a sniper once they close in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In contrast, Zheng’s strength was in close combat and his sniper ability came from the third stage of the unlocked mode. It also couldn’t last long.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Heng, can you see my location?” Zheng said through his mind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No problem. I can see your area. But it looks like you are lying down so I can’t see you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng said. “Heng, how many arrows do you still have? The enchanted arrows.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Heng counted them. “Thirty seven. It’s enough even if I only use explosive shots. Aren’t there only ten enemies? These arrows are enough. What about you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will begin the attack with the sniper rifle. I will try to assist you if there’s opportunity. What I am worried about isn’t your skill but that you won’t be able to perform them normally. Your personality worries me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Heng laughed. “Rest assured. The Focused ability works great. I can feel myself becoming stronger every time I use it. Even if my personality hasn’t changed much, I won’t be scared of anything once the ability is activated.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng sighed. “I hope so. Just be careful. You are our strongest ranged person. I won’t be able to hold it alone if you die.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Heng nodded then Zheng asked Yinkong. “What about you? Can you see me from where you are?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I can’t see you two, but I can see the people on the ground.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng laughed. “Then I will leave the ground to you. Remember, our mission isn’t to fight to death but gain time for the others. Once they reached the checkpoint, we can leave. Protect yourself, attack after you guarantee your safety.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The three of them looked at a direction in the sky. The psyche scan showed ten people flying over at incredible speed. Although there was still some distance but it wouldn’t take long at this speed. On the other hand, team China’s big group was moving slowly and still had ten kilometers to the checkpoint. These ten people could catch up to them in just twenty minutes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng panicked and immediately said. “Lan! Expose us, stop masking our location! Hurry, let them come attack us!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lan paused for a while then replied. “I can’t. You need the surprise for the ambush to be effective. You will be right under their gunpoint if you are exposed. They spent too much energy forcing the helicopters to land so they can’t break through the mask right now. Don’t mention it again.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng was getting more and more anxious. He yelled. “F*ck. Just do it when I told you to. If I let them go directly after you, then what is the point of us coming out to stop them? Hurry up and expose us so they can come attack us!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lan fell into silence for a while. “If they are planning to wipe us, there’s no stopping even if your location is exposed. It’s better for you to hide them and give them a surprise.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Perhaps killing a few members of team Devil in the ambush would allow Zheng to live even if the big group gets killed. However, Lan didn’t say her thought out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lan didn’t answer Zheng no matter how much he yelled. Several minutes passed like this. Those ten people were only twenty kilometers away from Zheng. The scan suddenly lost effectiveness on them. Zheng, Heng, and Yinkong could only use their eyes from this point on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng stopped talking and calmed himself down. He didn’t want to think about anything other than the rifle at his hand. Even though he was still a little anxious, but as time slowly passed, his mind became calm as a lake.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Several minutes of silent waiting. The hoverboards flew across the streets at twenty meters above them ground. At the same time, Zheng’s eyes went out of focus.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Heng, see the hoverboards? I will shoot the first one, you aim for the second. Go for the head. Don’t move yet. Wait for them to enter the center of this street. Wait.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Attack!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng yelled in his mind. His movements became extremely precise and aimed at the Caucasian man in the front. Bang! The man fell off and the hoverboard flew into a wall. A blonde woman also fell to the ground as she screamed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the same time, Heng’s explosive shot came at the man behind the Caucasian. However, this shot didn’t have the expected effect. That man moved his hands and blocked the arrow with a broadsword burning in a black flame. The force from the arrow knocked him off to the ground but he slowly flew back up after he spread a pair of wings on his back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng’s eyes twitched. He could see the man’s face clearly through the gun’s sight. That face was an exact copy of his minus the scar.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clone Zheng sneered. He swung the sword then asked the white man on the ground. “Francis, how are you doing? That shot shouldn’t injure you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The white man shook his head for a bit then stood up and looked at an item on his hand. “F*ck, a sniper rifle. Lost 80% energy in one hit. Can’t block the next attack.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clone Zheng laughed coldly. “Doesn’t matter. The battle has started. Xuan, take them to go after the rest of team China. There are three people here. Follow our plan. ZhuiKong take care of your sister. Yanwei go kill the archer. Techoi, Francis, and I prepare to get in close combat. Richard assist us with your Gauss sniper rifle.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clone Zheng took out a black book from his pocket and started reciting in ancient Egyptian while he flew up mid air using his wings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng didn’t hold back on his clone and said to Heng. “Shoot at will! Don’t worry about anything. Use your charged shot!” Then he aimed at his clone and bang!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The clone turned into numerous bats and scattered. By the time he came into form again, the recitation was finished.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Dark Cage!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both;\"\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-10-chapter-9-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-10-chapter-10-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-10-chapter-10-01","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
