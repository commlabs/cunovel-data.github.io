But you\u0027re a captain of hooligans all the same, Mr. Forge. A nice life you let them lead my poor boy last term!

Clear as noonday now became the mystery of young Mawdster\u0027s championship of the Rag. That parting shot of his, in which he had told the co-editors that he had not meant to praise the contents of the Rag, but only its printing and \"make-up\", was fully explained. The manager of the Cleartype Press and the fat, unhealthy Squirm were father and son.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Mr. Mawdster, I admit that your boy has become unpopular with his class-mates, but he boards in Holbeck\u0027s House and is therefore not under my protection.

I appeal to you as a father. I love my boy—he\u0027s the only child we\u0027ve got, and it cost a little fortune to rear him, he was so weak at first. But I\u0027d spend another fortune—ay, all I\u0027ve got in the world—to see him happy and to know he was making nice chums amongst gentlemen\u0027s sons up yonder.

It was a relief to pass from the stuffy printing-office into the clear air of a frosty January afternoon.

Some of them had gathered in the Tavern Square, and were entertaining themselves by roughly baiting Fluffy Jim, the village idiot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One big rustic, probably about eighteen years of age, though he had the beginnings of a strong beard on his unbarbered chin, was holding Fluffy Jim\u0027s head tightly between his legs while the other lads took turns at knocking dust out of the idiot\u0027s clothes with the ash-sticks and canes they carried.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nah then, yo\u0027 chaps, let drive at him,\" shouted the biggest tyrant. \"Iverybody as makes him \u0027bale oot\u0027 sco?ars one point, and them chaps \u0027at he \u0027shoots\u0027 mo?ast for gets a fat cigar apiece!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To \"bale oot\" and to \"shoot\" meant the same thing in the dialect of the district—the poor half-witted boy was to be made to shout out in pain beneath the succession of strokes, and from this cruel pastime the yokels were obviously deriving coarse amusement. Now, Dick had no reason to feel tenderly disposed towards the village idiot, who had had so much to do with one of the greatest disappointments of his life. Nevertheless his blood boiled as he joined the little crowd of watchers, some of them elderly men, and realized that, far from showing any desire to interfere, they seemed actually to be enjoying the \"fun\".\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dick had meant going straight into the inn to claim the shelter of the snug little private room which he had booked. His brain was in a whirl, and above everything he craved quietude. His last wish was to be mixed up in a brawl with skylarking farm-hands. The Captain of Foxenby could not really afford the luxury of a \"scrap\" in the open street.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A very genuine howl of agony from Fluffy Jim settled the matter, however. Dick suddenly appeared in the centre of the laughing rustics, and tapped the leader of them on the shoulder.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027ll do, you,\" he said, curtly. \"Let Fluffy Jim go.

The square was thick with the yokel\u0027s friends, a united rush by whom would speedily have put the intruder out and under.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, by gum!

But Dick\u0027s reply, eagerly awaited, was not in words. Catching hold of the yokel\u0027s neckcloth he jerked him smartly back, thereby releasing Fluffy Jim from that unhappy youth\u0027s painful position. In an instant there was angry uproar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hit \u0027im in t\u0027mooth, Juddy! Clart \u0027im in t\u0027lug, lad!

Then it was that the landlord of the \"Anvil Inn\", an old quartermaster-sergeant, took a hand in the game.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not here, gentlemen, I beg,\" said he. \"Do you both want to spend a night in the lock-up?

But some gratis sport of a thrilling character was exactly what the crowd wanted, and they swept both Dick and the horseman, willy-nilly, on to the snow-covered bowling-green at the rear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now then, gents, you all know me as an old boxer and a clean sportsman,\" the landlord shouted. \"So I\u0027ll be referee and see fair play.
