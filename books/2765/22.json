{"id":85767,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u003cp\u003eI try pulling Avi\u0027s hand to make him leave the room, but he\u0027s planted where he is like a stubborn tree root.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like people spreading rumors about my girlfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull his arm more. \"Avi, let\u0027s just leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxanne laughs. \"Rumors? Dude, you\u0027re the second guy she\u0027s been locking lips with this week. And speak of the devil. Hi, Nathan. We were just talking about you and Amy\u0027s hot show in the cafeteria.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man. I\u0027m toast. I look at the door and see Miranda, Jess, and Nathan walking toward us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire room is silent for the moment while the next CD is put into the slot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Jess says. \"We finished with the scavenger hunt and wanted to see if you were still here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi knows the truth. He saw the way Nathan and I looked at each other just now. Is the guilt transparent in my eyes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lied to me,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight in front of everyone he lets go of my hand and leaves me standing here in the middle of Kyle\u0027s party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e23\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not so easy to convert as one might think. I still have to go before three respected Jewish community members called a \"Bet Din\" and take a verbal test. Rabbi Glass-man told me not to stress over it; it\u0027s not like the SATs. Life is full of little SAT tests, though, isn\u0027t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made an ass out of me,\" he says after I catch up with him at the entrance to my building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avi, I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t expect you to go up to Roxanne and get details.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns to me while we\u0027re in the elevator. \"You looked me right in the eye and lied to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands up in surrender. \"Okay, I admit it. I lied to you. Are you happy now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t turn this around to make me the bad guy. Do you always go around kissing guys?\" he asks when we reach my floor and step off the elevator. \"Where\u0027s your loyalty and honor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes and say, \"We\u0027re not in the army now, Avi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" When I open the door and walk inside my condo I turn to him, \"Besides, where\u0027s your commitment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Amy. What would you know about commitment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my mouth wide in shock. \"Screw you!\" I yell, then go to my room and slam the door shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t remember how long it\u0027s been since I had a good cry. You know, one of those cries where you can\u0027t catch your breath and just when you think there can\u0027t possibly be any more tears coming out of your eyes, a new wave of desperation washes over you and you bawl all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the way I\u0027m crying right now. I feel so horrible I messed up with Avi. I feel so horrible that I want to figure out Nathan and what makes him the way he is. Nathan told me I liked Avi because of his looks and warned me if he looked as good I\u0027d be after him, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m a terrible person. It\u0027s not Avi\u0027s fault, either. It\u0027s mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi knocks on my door after about a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open the door and let me in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t allowed in my room, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knocks again, louder. \"Then just open the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I do, I see that he\u0027s got his duffle slung over his shoulder. \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t working. You and I both know it. I\u0027m going to stay with Tarik over at the Northwestern dorms. You remember Tarik, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be here soon. Listen, Amy...you want to kiss other guys, that\u0027s cool. This thing between us wasn\u0027t going to last anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me not to wait. You wanted to be the non-boyfriend, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s in here,\" he says, pointing to his head, \"and what\u0027s in here,\" he says, fist pounding on his heart, \"are two different things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step forward and hold out my hand, wanting to ease his insecurity and the tension between us. \"Avi...come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of stepping forward, he steps back and points to his head. \"Gotta keep my mind clear,\" he says. \"Remember what I told you about the mind games?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. They\u0027re worse than the torture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, I can\u0027t tell you how many irrational things are running through my head right now. Kissing you until you can\u0027t think straight. Kicking that Nathan guy\u0027s ass. Smashing the wall with my fist because you\u0027ve been looking at other guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you I\u0027m the Disaster Girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Amy. You\u0027ve got your life here. Mine is in Israel or wherever the army sends me. It\u0027s the way it is; it\u0027s the way it was always meant to be. Who were we kidding, thinking this thing between us could work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did, but I don\u0027t tell him. He\u0027s obviously given up the fight. \"You\u0027re really leaving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tarik is probably downstairs waiting for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew tears start to come, damn it. I will them to stop, but they won\u0027t. \"I don\u0027t want you to go.\" I want to beg, plead, grab his leg and hang on until he agrees to stay...but I can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he pets Mutt and walks to the door, I let him. And then I stay with him and walk outside where I recognize his friend Tarik in a car outside my building. Tarik steps out of the car and gives me a small hug. \"Hey, Amy,\" he says. \"It\u0027s been a while, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wipe my nose and watery eyes with my sleeve. \"How\u0027s school?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tough, but I\u0027m getting used to it.\" Tarik looks from me (obviously overwrought and devastated) to stone-faced Avi. \"Um...you want me to get involved in this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Avi says emphatically, while I tilt my head to the side and contemplate asking for intervention. Maybe what Avi and I need is third-party arbitration. I learned about arbitration in my social studies class last week and the magic of an unbiased party deciding your fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then...I guess I\u0027ll leave you two to say your goodbyes.\" Tarik heads back to the driver\u0027s side, but calls over his shoulder, \"If you need me, just give a holler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m tempted to holler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi tosses his duffle into the back seat of Tarik\u0027s car, then turns to me. \"I\u0027ll call you before I leave Chicago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to take you to the top of the Sears Tower. Every tourist has to go there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go on my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about Oz Park? Did you know the guy who wrote The Wizard of Oz lived here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll figure it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if you don\u0027t, Avi? What if you go back to Israel without seeing what Chicago has to offer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi cups my cheek with his palm. \"It doesn\u0027t all have to be perfect. Life isn\u0027t perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want it to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thumb slowly caresses my face. \"I know. It\u0027s what makes you unique.\" He squeezes his eyes shut, then says, \"I gotta go before I do something stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as he sits in the passenger seat, says something to Tarik, and the car drives off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he leaves me alone, crying, and devastated, I want to kneel right here and start bawling all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not crying over that guy, are you?\" I hear Nathan\u0027s voice behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI face him and squint my eyes accusingly. \"Have you been spying on me this whole time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Why, was it a good breakup? \u0027Cause if it was, I\u0027m sorry I missed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk up to Nathan, take my finger, and poke it into his chest. \"You are the rudest, most self-centered, dragon-eyed, inconsiderate, egotistical... \" I\u0027m racking my brain to think of more words when Nathan takes my finger into his hand and stops me from poking him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan\u0027s touch doesn\u0027t affect me like Avi\u0027s does. And for the first time it\u0027s clear Nathan isn\u0027t \"The One\" and never has been. I have a connection to him, but it\u0027s oh, so different than the connection I have with Avi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m too weak to do anything else but slump my shoulders and cry. The pain is too great, like someone is ripping open my heart and squeezing it tight. My knees start to buckle and Nathan catches me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really are upset, aren\u0027t you?\" he says, staring at me with his eyebrows down and furrowed in sympathy. I\u0027ve never seen Nathan have sympathy for anyone, especially me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeeze my eyes shut. \"I\u0027m not as plastic as you accuse me of being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess not. Listen, Amy. I\u0027m sorry. You\u0027re right about me. Well, except for the dragon-eyed part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I played you. I played your boyfriend. It wasn\u0027t fair, I know. Sometimes I want everyone\u0027s life to be as screwed up as mine. Call it a self-defense mechanism.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helps me stand. I wipe my nose and eyes with the sleeve of my shirt. \"What\u0027s so wrong with your life, Nathan? Who are you? Make me feel better about my crappy life by sharing yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand why I\u0027m insecure: my dad just came back into my life, my mom and her new husband are planning a family without me... and I don\u0027t know where my family life begins and where it ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a foster kid. Parents gave me up when I was ten because they couldn\u0027t afford all eight kids they had. I\u0027ve been tossed from one foster home to another since then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, I don\u0027t get it. \"I thought Mr. and Mrs. Keener were your aunt and uncle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No other foster home would take me after they took a look at my file, so they were kind of forced into it by the courts. My aunt and uncle aren\u0027t on speaking terms with my parents. They cut all ties a long time ago. Something about marrying trailer trash makes you trailer trash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t imagine my parents giving me away. Even when my dad and I weren\u0027t talking, he still tried. It was me who pushed him away. My mom raised me since she was in college, going to school and working while trying to juggle having a kid and getting a career going. I admire her so much. I don\u0027t think she ever considered giving me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you dress like--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I\u0027m a dork?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My aunt wants me to dress conservative. Thinks if I dress like a bad kid, I\u0027ll be a bad kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you bad, Nathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe focuses on the ground and shrugs. \"I have been. You don\u0027t get kicked out of thirteen foster homes in seven years for being a model kid. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I\u0027m still fucked up.\" He looks at me. \"I shouldn\u0027t have kissed you in front of everyone in the cafeteria. And...I have to admit...I knew your boyfriend was going to be at the party tonight and was secretly happy he found out we kissed. I know I hurt you, Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth is I hurt myself. I let my insecurity and confused emotions overcome what I knew deep in my heart was right all along. I play a tough game, but inside I\u0027m weak. Just like Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hook my arm through Nathan\u0027s and say, \"Do you have any ice cream at your place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so. Vanilla, maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to hang out with me?\" he asks, totally shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Isn\u0027t that what friends are supposed to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to admit, I haven\u0027t had a friend in a long time. Don\u0027t know if I even know how to be one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Bicky?\" I ask when we get in the elevator and head to the fortieth floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a foster kid, too. I met her in a home in Freeport last summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes a deep breath and says, \"Rehab. She got into some bad stuff and is all messed up. I bring her flowers every Saturday, but they won\u0027t let me see her or talk to her. She receives my letters and notes, though.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-22.html","bookId":2765,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:16 PM"}
