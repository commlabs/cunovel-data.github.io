Where is he?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"He\u0027ll be here eventually.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Why not now?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Andorin\u0027s rather handsome head seemed to sink a bit, as though he were lost in thought or coming to a decision, and then he said abruptly, \"I don\u0027t want to bring him until I know where I stand.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"What does that mean?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Simple words in Galactic Standard. How long has it been your aim to get rid of Hari Seldon?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Always! Always! Is that so hard to understand? We deserve revenge for what he did to Jo-Jo. Even if he hadn\u0027t done that, since he\u0027s the First Minister, we\u0027d have to put him out of the way.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"But it\u0027s Cleon-Cleon-who must be brought down. If not only he, then at least he, in addition to Seldon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Why does a figurehead concern you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You weren\u0027t born yesterday. I\u0027ve never had to explain my part in this because you\u0027re not so ignorant a fool as not to know. What can I possibly care about your plans if they don\u0027t include a replacement on the throne?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Namarti laughed. \"Of course. I\u0027ve known for a long time that you look upon me as your footstool, your way of climbing up to the Imperial throne.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Would you expect anything else?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Not at all. I will do the planning, take the chances, and then, when all is quite done, you gather in the reward. It makes sense, doesn\u0027t it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Yes, it does make sense, for the reward will be yours, too. Won\u0027t you become the First Minister? Won\u0027t you be able to count on the full support of a new Emperor, one who is filled with gratitude? Won\u0027t I be?and his face twisted with irony as he spat out the words-\"the new figurehead?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Is that what you plan to be? A figurehead?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I plan to be the Emperor. I supplied advances of credit when you had none. I supplied the cadre when you had none. I supplied the respectability you needed to build a large organization here in Wye. I can still withdraw everything I\u0027ve brought in.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Do you want to risk it? Don\u0027t think you can treat me the way you treated Kaspalov, either. If anything happens to me, Wye will become uninhabitable for you and yours-and you will find that no other sector will supply you with what you need.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Namarti sighed. \"Then you insist on having the Emperor killed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I didn\u0027t say `killed.\u0027 I said `brought down.\u0027 The details I leave to you.\" This last statement was accompanied with an almost dismissive wave of the hand, a flick of the wrist, as if Andorin were already sitting on the Imperial throne.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"And then you\u0027ll be Emperor?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No, you won\u0027t. You\u0027ll be dead-and not at my hands, either. Andorin, let me teach you some of the facts of life. If Cleon is killed, then the matter of the succession comes up and, to avoid civil war, the Imperial Guard will at once kill every member of the Wyan Mayoral family they can find-you first of all. On the other hand, if only the First Minister is killed, you will be safe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Why?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"A First Minister is only a First Minister. They come and go. It is possible that Cleon himself may have grown tired of him and arranged the murder. Certainly we would see to it that rumors of this sort are spread. The Imperial Guard would hesitate and would give us a chance to put the new government into place. Indeed, it is quite possible that they themselves would be grateful for the end of Seldon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"And with the new government in place, what am I to do? Keep on waiting? Forever?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No. Once I\u0027m First Minister, there will be ways of dealing with Cleon. I may even be able to do something with the Imperial Guard-and even with the security establishment-and use them all as my instruments. I will then manage to find some safe way of getting rid of Cleon and replacing him with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Andorin burst out, \"Why should you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Namarti said, \"What do you mean, why should I?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You have a personal grudge against Seldon. Once he is gone, why should you run unnecessary risks at the highest level? You will make your peace with Cleon and I will have to retire to my crumbling estate and my impossible dreams. And perhaps, to play it safe, you will have me killed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Namarti said, \"No! Cleon was born to the throne. He comes from several generations of Emperors-the proud Entun Dynasty. He would he very difficult to handle, a plague. You, on the other hand, would come to the throne as a member of a new dynasty, without any strong ties to tradition, for the previous Wyan Emperors were, you will admit, totally undistinguished. You will be seated on a shaky throne and will need someone to support you-me. And I will need someone who is dependent upon me and whom I can therefore handle you. -Come, Andorin, ours is not a marriage of love, which fades in a year; it is a marriage of convenience, which can last as long as we both live. Let us trust each other.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You swear I will be Emperor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"What good would swearing do if you couldn\u0027t trust my word? Let us say I would find you an extraordinarily useful Emperor and I would want you to replace Cleon as soon as that can safely be managed. Now introduce me to this man you think will be the perfect tool for your purposes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Very well. And remember what makes him different. I have studied him. He\u0027s a not-very-bright idealist. He will do what he\u0027s told, unconcerned by danger, unconcerned by second thoughts. And he exudes a kind of trustworthiness so that his victim will trust him, even if he has a blaster in his hand.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I find that impossible to believe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Wait till you meet him,\" said Andorin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46697.html","bookId":169,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:43:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:43:59 AM"}
