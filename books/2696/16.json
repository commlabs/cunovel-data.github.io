Just chill out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The look on your face…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is what?” she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blurted, “Really freakin’ close to evil,” and took two steps back from the door so she couldn’t take a swing at him. “Remember. This has all been a misunderstanding. You’re safe. That’s all that matters. Why don’t I call Jack and tell him—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d be better off calling a fucking ambulance because I’m gonna kick his ass when I get home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeely rolled up the window and sped off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf her brother wanted to give her a speeding ticket, fine. But he could damn well do it in her driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack paced on the front porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw the lights of Keely’s car, he could finally breathe. He’d nearly gone bald the last four hours, pulling out his hair, desperately trying not to think of worst-case scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam had warned him Keely was mad—really mad, boiling mad, mad like he’d never seen her. But Jack wasn’t worried. Her pregnancy mood swings were so erratic she might be whistling a happy tune after she’d had time to think on the drive home about her inconsiderate behavior. She might even throw herself into his arms with a tearful apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plastered on a smile, prepared to be magnanimous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the door to the Escalade was thrown open so hard the metal supports should’ve bent backward. Her boots hit the pavement before he could offer to help her out. Then she slammed the driver’s door with enough force the entire car shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was nothing compared to how hard Keely shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. “Keely—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a fucking word, Jack-ass. I’m so pissed off at you right now you’d better be glad I actually came home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step toward her and she growled. His wife actually fucking growled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last warning to back off. I’ve had to pee since I left Spearfish and getting pulled over by my brother has just made it worse...and that’s your fault too.” She stomped up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUndeterred, he followed her. “Do you have any idea—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeely whipped around so fast he didn’t have time to duck the blow from her purse. A purse she was now swinging around like a mace. He was so shocked at the vicious expression on her face that he didn’t manage to dodge the second or third blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus, Keely. Will you knock it off?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next time she swung, he grabbed the strap and tugged the pink zebra cowhide bludgeoning tool from her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, have it,” she yelled. “It wasn’t doin’ enough damage to you to suit me anyway.” She stepped back and braced her hand against the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Keely. Can we please talk about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCount to ten. “I’m serious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So am I.” She jammed her heel into the bootjack and removed her right boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you please try and be reasonable?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Reasonable?” she repeated. “You wanna talk about bein’ reasonable? You’re the one who told me to buzz off and leave you alone to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You took that out of context.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bullshit.” Keely removed her other boot. “You said you wouldn’t be home until midnight and I should find something to do to entertain myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad he really said that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So are you all fired up because I wasn’t standing on the porch holding your pipe and slippers to welcome you home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like that’d ever happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeely growled at him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I did mention I might be working late. But that doesn’t change the fact that I couldn’t get ahold of you when my workday ended.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since when am I at your beck and call, Jack Donohue?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the hell had that come from?“You have to admit it’s pretty irresponsible for you—a pregnant woman in a rural area—to forget your phone. What if you’d had car trouble?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then my brother, who was scouring the county for me, could’ve given me a ride home since you called the fucking sheriff’s office like I was a runaway wife. I absolutely cannot believe you’d—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keely. Calm down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calm down?” She reached for her boot. “The fuck I will!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one missed him, but the second boot hit him square in the shin. “Goddammit, that’s enough!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No it’s not! You have no idea how furious I am right now.” Keely picked up a potted plant and started toward him. “You humiliated me in front of my whole family, Jack. And no doubt you’ll blame this, like you blame everything else, on my out-of-control pregnancy hormones!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trust me, buttercup, this psycho redneck behavior is one hundred percent you, and has nothing to do with the baby—” was all he got out before she hurled the flower pot at his head. “I cannot fucking believe you just did that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you’d better not come into the kitchen because knives are a lot harder to duck, asswipe.” Keely stormed into the house. She slammed the door and he heard the snick of the lock as she locked him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocked out. Of his own goddamned house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack yelled, “Real mature, Keely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, real mature yelling at your pregnant wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slumped into the closest chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had this escalated to this point?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou overreacted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, maybe the call to Cam had been unnecessary. But Keely didn’t really believe that he’d called her family to find out where she was as some attempt at humiliation? He’d never do that to her. Jack knew how hard she’d struggled not to be seen as the baby who needed constant supervision and protection. But he’d been frantic because it was so unlike her to be incommunicado for that long. Wanting to know where she was wasn’t a control thing. He missed her, and yeah, he’d felt guilty for snapping at her and blowing her off. He’d initially called her to tell her he’d finished work early because he wanted to spend time with her. But it’d turned into full-blown panic at hour three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he could do now was give her time to calm down. After being married for almost four years he ought to know a way to fix this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrovel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike hell. He ought to spank her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack swept up the dirt and broken pot. He dug in her purse for her house keys and ended up finding her cell phone—her completely dead cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least she’d had the phone with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike that would matter now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he’d let himself inside, he wandered into the kitchen. He washed his hands and face, and eyed the butcher block for missing knives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he wandered through the rest of the main level. Keely wasn’t in the bathroom, den, living room, dining room or out on the back deck. He scaled the stairs to the second floor. Not in the nursery. Or the other three bedrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door at the end of the hallway, which led to their bedroom suite, was shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo bad. He’d kick the damn door in if he had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn’t locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stepped inside the moonlit room and froze when he saw Keely standing by the big bay window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore a nearly see-through white cotton nightgown that made her look like a goddess in the moon’s silvery glow. The way her dark hair trailed down her back, the swell of her abdomen and the heavier weight of her breasts only added fuel to the fire of lust burning inside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when he knew what she needed—what they both needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved in front of her and trapped her gorgeous face in his hands, tilting her head to meet his gaze. Then his mouth crashed down on hers and he kissed her with every ounce of passion and hunger she aroused in him just by existing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeely didn’t deny his kiss or fight him, except to grab his shirt to pull him closer. They kissed crazily; mouths avid, bodies straining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack herded her toward the bed. He broke the kiss, sliding his mouth to her ear. “Keely. I love you. So goddamned much. And I need you. Now. Like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. God, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the nightgown over her head. He filled his hands with her breasts and teased her neck with open-mouthed kisses and tiny sucking bites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arched into him and moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit,” he ordered and inserted himself between her thighs. His hands followed the contour of her belly, amazed at how her body grew and changed every day. “So beautiful,” he murmured. “Every inch of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack, I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her mouth again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sneaky Keely wrested control, her sensual kisses destroying him while she unbuttoned his shirt. Her hands raced over his torso, her fingers digging into his flesh. Then her mouth was on his chest, her tongue flicking his nipples between soft, suctioning kisses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blood pounded so hard even his skin throbbed. Her every lick and nibble made him hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack grabbed a handful of her hair and tugged her head back. “Behave. My way. Or no way. Understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bossy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cupped the outer swell of her stomach and started a trail of kisses from her sternum, straight down her belly. Rubbing his razor-stubbled cheek across the roundness until she squirmed. “You are so fucking sexy when you’re pregnant.” Before she responded, he smooched her belly button and kissed his way down the lower curve of her abdomen, dropping to his knees. He spread her knees wide and jammed his tongue deep into her cunt, filling his mouth, his senses with her essence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lapped at the sweet stickiness, swirling his tongue through her soft tissues. Giving her no respite as he drove her higher and harder with each suck and flicker of his tongue. “Come for me fast, cowgirl. So I can fuck you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then leave your mouth right there,” she panted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack tongued her clit relentlessly. When her thighs went rigid, he fastened his mouth to the swollen nub and sucked with enough force his teeth pressed into her quivering flesh. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/short-rides-rough-riders-14-5/page-16.html","bookId":2696,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:19 AM"}
