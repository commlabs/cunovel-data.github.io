Sean, standing between his grandfather and uncle, lifted his glass of apple juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Daddy and my new Mama,\" he said, giggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly felt her eyes fill. Blinking, she smiled through her tears. \"Thank you, Sean.\" She touched her glass to Sean\u0027s, Ryan\u0027s, Jeremy\u0027s and finally Sheldon\u0027s. She took a sip, holding the liquor in her mouth for several seconds before letting it slide down the back of her throat. It detonated on impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa!\" she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheldon nodded his approval. \"See why this old girl only comes to the dance every few years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy also gasped, holding his throat. \"Boo-ahhh!\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ditto,\" Ryan added after swallowing. He placed his glass on a sideboard. \"That\u0027s enough of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching for the bottle, Jeremy studied the label. \"I\u0027ve never heard of this brand. Pop, are you certain this stuff isn\u0027t moonshine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheldon shook his head. \"I never thought my boys would grow up to be such sissies.\" He drained his glass, reached for Sean, and swung him up in his arms. Cradling his grandson\u0027s head to his shoulder, he whispered loudly, \"It\u0027s time for the men of the house to turn in for the night.\" He blew a kiss at Kelly as he strode out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy walked over to Kelly and hugged her. \"Congratulations again. I\u0027m with Pop and Sean. I\u0027m going to bed.\" He patted Ryan\u0027s shoulder. \"All the best, brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaiting until they were alone, Ryan curved his arms around Kelly\u0027s waist. \"I want you to come back to my place with me. I\u0027d like to show you something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed a mysterious smile. \"You\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly found herself in the middle of the living room of a house that was soon to become her home. The two-story, three-bedroom structure was the equivalent of one city block away from the ones occupied by Sheldon and Jeremy. Ryan had informed her that his father had first taken up residence in the house after he\u0027d returned from a tour of duty in Vietnam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe furnishings were formal and elegant. Every chair, table and lamp was meticulously positioned as if for a magazine layout. It was perfect, a little too perfect. A slight frown appeared between her eyes. There was something wrong with the room. Suddenly it hit her! It didn\u0027t look lived in. Staring at a sofa and matching love seat, Kelly mentally catalogued what she would rearrange. Firstly she would take down the drapes and replace them with a lighter weight fabric to let in the natural light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking over the fireplace, she studied the framed photographs lining the mantel. Smiling, she recognized a younger Sheldon in a United States Army uniform with his young smiling bride. Peering closely at the picture, she noted Julia Blackstone\u0027s natural beauty. Ryan had inherited her smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were photographs of Ryan and Jeremy as children, and more of Sean at different ages. Nowhere was there a photograph of Sean\u0027s mother. It was if she\u0027d been completely erased from his life. She heard footfalls, and turned around. Ryan had returned, holding a small wooden box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cupped her elbow, leading her over to sit on the sofa. He placed the box on her lap. \"Open it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sprang a latch, the lid opening. Staring back at her on a bed of black velvet was a solitaire ring with a large square-cut blue-white diamond; along with the ring was a pair of drop South Sea pearl earrings dangling from a diamond cluster, and a bangle of diamond baguettes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are beautiful, Ryan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They belonged to my great-grandmother. My mother gave them to me a month before she died. She wanted me to give them to my wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him an incredulous look. \"Why didn\u0027t you give them to Sean\u0027s mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression was impassive. \"I\u0027d offered them to her, but she said she didn\u0027t want someone else\u0027s hand-me-downs. The pieces in that box were purchased from Cartier between 1917 and 1919.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the bangle. \"It\u0027s heavy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because all of the pieces are set in platinum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Jeremy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, princess. Jeremy was given his share.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching around her, Ryan picked up the box with the jewelry. He took the ring and slipped it on the third finger of Kelly\u0027s left hand. It was a perfect fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe extended her hand. The light from a floor lamp caught the diamond, prisms of light catching and radiating from the flawless gem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan curved an arm around Kelly\u0027s shoulders when she rested her head on his shoulder. \"We\u0027re going to have to choose a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the last weekend in August.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about the first weekend?\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasing back, she stared at him. \"That\u0027s only three weeks away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. We can go up to Saratoga Springs, New York before the summer racing season ends. I know it\u0027s not much of a honeymoon, but I\u0027d like to take you away, even if it\u0027s only for a weekend. We can take a real honeymoon during the Christmas break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long is the racing season?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly wondered if she could pull everything together in three weeks. She had to send out invitations, get a dress and select a ring for Ryan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she agreed, kissing his cheek. \"I\u0027m going back to D.C. at the end of the week to get my sister to help me with invitations. And while I\u0027m there I\u0027ll do some shopping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan pulled her across his lap. \"If you need help with anything, just let me know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nuzzled his neck, breathing a kiss under his ear. \"You need to take me back to my place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he crooned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I have to go to sleep, Ryan. I\u0027m going need all of my energy for my students tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep here tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not until we\u0027re married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling back he stared at her. \"Don\u0027t tell me I\u0027m marrying an old-fashioned girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m more conservative than old-fashioned. That comes from working with young children. After all, they learn from example.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly had no way of knowing that when she answered an ad for a teaching position on a horse farm she would find a love that promised forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly slept restlessly throughout the night, and when she left her bed at six she felt as if she had been up all night. She brewed a small carafe of coffee, drank several cups, then dialed the area code for D.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePamela answered the phone with a cheery, \"Good morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pamela, this is Kelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere came a pause. \"What\u0027s with the Pamela?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have good news to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you due?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not pregnant!\" she practically shouted. Well, she didn\u0027t think she was pregnant. When she and Ryan had made love the night before he hadn\u0027t used a condom. Squinting she calculated when she\u0027d last had her period. Sighing, she realized she was safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting married in three weeks here at the farm, and I\u0027m going to need your help with addressing invitations and shopping for a dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePamela screamed at the top of her lungs, eliciting a frantic barking from Miss Porter. \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" she said over and over. A loud sniffle came through the earpiece. \"Dang, Kel. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m crying and souping snot at the same time. Wait until I blow my nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pamela?\" Kelly said into the receiver when a full minute elapsed without her sister coming back to the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m back. I had to tell Leo the good news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming in this weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything you want me to do on this end in the meantime?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I need you to use your artistic talents and design an invitation for me. I have to get Ryan\u0027s full name and the directions to Blackstone Farms. And you and I have to do some serious shopping in Chevy Chase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ryan and I are going up to Saratoga Springs next month for a weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Miss Clotheshorse, you\u0027re singing my song.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly laughed. She and Pamela had gotten their love of shopping from their mother. For Camille it was hats, Pamela handbags and Kelly\u0027s weakness was shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to call Mama and give her the news as soon as I hang up with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Pam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so happy for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, big sis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rang off and dialed her mother\u0027s number. The call lasted less than five minutes, and when she hung up it was Kelly\u0027s turn to shed tears of joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA portable stage had been set up under a tent large enough to accommodate the sixty invited guests and more than thirty of Blackstone Farms\u0027 extended family. It had rained steadily for two days, then the night before Ryan Blackstone was scheduled to exchange vows with Kelly Andrews, but after the rain had stopped, a strong wind swept the clouds across the sky to reveal an orange-yellow near-full moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly stood beside Ryan, eyes closed, repeating her vows. She was afraid that if she looked at him she wouldn\u0027t be able to hold back her tears. Her hands were trembling as she slipped a platinum and yellow gold band on Ryan\u0027s finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the judge telling Ryan he could kiss his bride, and her world stood still as she felt the pressure of his firm lips on hers, sealing their troth. It was over. She was now Mrs. Ryan Jackson Blackstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan pulled Kelly closer, her soft curves melding with the hardness of his body. He\u0027d run the race and won the ultimate prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t I warn you, Mrs. Blackstone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\" she whispered against his warm mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I play for keeps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was as dazzling as the sun warming the earth. \"So, do I, Mr. Blackstone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning they faced all of the people who had come to witness another generation of Blackstones solidifying their place in Virginia\u0027s horse country\u0027s history. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-hot-summer-the-blackstones-of-virgina-1/page-12.html","bookId":1873,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:48 PM"}
