We’ll be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobin looked up at the ceiling as though her patience had reached its limit. “I can’t believe I’m hearing this.” Then, turning to Grant, she added, “A little help from you certainly wouldn’t hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I figured you were doing well enough without me,” he said, grinning at Bethanne and his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth and Bethanne stood side by side, with their arms linked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth looked at her children. “Really, there’s no reason to worry. I have the route planned out, I joined AAA and I’ve made hotel reservations. I’ve rented a car, which I’m dropping off in Florida, and we’re flying back. I’m sure I’ve thought of everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a list of your medications?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth frowned. “I take one blood-pressure pill and that’s it—oh, and I have eyedrops. It isn’t like I need a permission slip from my physician to travel. You’re grasping at straws. Furthermore, you’re treating me like a child. I can take care of myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The roads aren’t safe,” Robin insisted, “especially for two women traveling alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Ruth frowned. “If someone does kidnap and murder me, as you seem to expect, you can rest assured that I died happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, honestly, Mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Bethanne?” Grant asked. “If she’s kidnapped and murdered, how would you feel then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve had three karate lessons,” Ruth said facetiously. “I’ll defend her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant burst out laughing. Robin, however, didn’t seem to find anything her mother said the least bit amusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.” Robin pointed an accusing finger at Bethanne. “Just know that if anything happens to my mother because you were foolish enough to fall in with this crazy scheme of hers, I’m holding you directly responsible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne tightened her hold on Ruth’s arm. “I accept full responsibility for your mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you don’t,” Ruth protested. “I’m responsible for myself. Besides, if anything did happen, it would be just like my daughter to file a lawsuit against you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, she won’t,” Grant said, glaring across the room at his sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t count on it,” Robin said, glaring right back. She crossed her arms as if waiting for them to capitulate. In that case, Bethanne hoped Robin was a patient woman because she had no intention of backing down. And she was sure Ruth wouldn’t, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a tense moment, Robin dropped her arms. “Okay, fine. Risk your life. Grant, if you weren’t going to support me in this, you should never have come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I think I should be the one to drive them,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way.” If Ruth agreed to that, Bethanne was counting herself out right then and there. She wanted to get away, reflect, consider the possibility of a future with Grant. She could only do that if he wasn’t trying to influence her. Having him along was out of the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth looked from one to the other. “You’d do that, son?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d need to make arrangements with the office and I might have to change the dates, but if this is important to you, Mom, I’d make it work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you won’t need me,” Bethanne said, starting to withdraw her arm from Ruth’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother-in-law held her tight. “Check that computer phone thing you always have with you,” Ruth said. “Tell me when you’d be free for two entire weeks to drive me all the way across the country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant took out his iPhone and scrolled down the screen. “Like I said, I’d need to make a few phone calls, rearrange some appointments…” he said slowly. “The second and third weeks of August would be manageable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s too late,” Ruth told him. “The class reunion is June 17 and I’m going to be there.” She looked pointedly at Robin. “It doesn’t matter what scare tactics you use. I won’t let tales of renegade truckers and biker gangs intimidate me. Bethanne and I are leaving on schedule and nothing you say is going to change that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, Mom, you can fly out for the reunion and we can drive back again in August,” Grant suggested. “That way—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth shook her head. “I heard all those promises from your father. Year after year he said we’d drive across the country, but something always interfered. It did with Richard and it will with you. No, Grant, my mind is made up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so is mine,” Bethanne added for emphasis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I say—” Grant turned to his sister with a shrug “—that we let them go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like either of them could stop us,” Ruth muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne grinned and, leaning close, whispered, “Annie wants to join us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annie,” Ruth said aloud. “Why, that’s a wonderful idea!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis daughter’s name instantly caught Grant’s attention. “What’s this about Annie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She phoned last night and asked to come with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of objecting, as she’d half expected, Grant broke into a wide smile. “I agree with Mom. Bringing Annie with you is a good idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was an interesting development. Bethanne had assumed that once he learned Annie intended to accompany them, it would be all the excuse he needed to demand they fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobin stared at her brother as though he’d taken leave of his senses. “I give up,” she said, grabbing her briefcase and her purse. “I can see I’m fighting a losing battle. I have a meeting, so I won’t waste any more time here.” She stalked toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Robin,” Bethanne said, halting her progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?” she snapped, whirling around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might want to wish your mother and me a good trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Robin just rolled her eyes and left the house, slamming the screen door on her way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as his sister was gone, Grant started laughing. “Well, she was in rare form, wasn’t she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne hugged Ruth, who had begun to tremble. “Everything’s okay, Ruth. We’re going on the trip of a lifetime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant waited until they’d finished hugging before he spoke. “You didn’t mention this last night when we had dinner.” The comment was filled with accusation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was there any reason I should?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re planning to drive across the country with my mother,” he said. “Didn’t you think Robin and I were entitled to know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a repeat of the conversation she’d had with Annie. “It was up to Ruth to mention it, not me,” she told him, unwilling to be chastised by her ex-husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant’s response was a raised eyebrow, but he didn’t say anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was afraid Robin would make a fuss,” Ruth said. “I wish now I’d kept my mouth shut.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne agreed it would’ve been preferable had Ruth waited until they were on the road, but that seemed a bit underhanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I can, I’d like to ask one thing of you,” Grant said, obviously deciding on a more conciliatory approach. “I’d feel better about the three of you being on the road if you’d call me at least once a day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could do that,” Ruth said, eager to make peace with her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will you?” Grant posed the question to Bethanne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure Ruth and Annie would be happy to keep in touch,” she said curtly, reluctant to add her name to the list. The idea of calling her ex-husband didn’t sit well with her, despite his unexpected support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant held her look. “I won’t be able to relax if I don’t know that the three most important women in my life are safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll check in,” Bethanne eventually promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne drove to the office a few minutes later, but for the rest of that day, she couldn’t get Grant out of her mind. She had to appreciate the fact that he hadn’t joined forces with his sister against them. His concern for Ruth, Annie and her seemed genuine. She’d given him a glimmer of hope that a reconciliation was possible; the idea didn’t seem as repugnant to her as it once had and that, she guessed, was a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt her desk, she made all the necessary arrangements to leave the office for a few weeks. She went home at five that afternoon, slightly depressed at the prospect of an empty house, and wondered what it would’ve been like if Grant had been there waiting for her with a glass of wine and a welcoming smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finally! We’re actually on the road,” Ruth marveled as they reached the summit of Snoqualmie Pass, crossing the Cascade Mountains. They were a little more than an hour outside Seattle, heading due east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth had the map supplied by AAA spread out on her lap and acted as navigator while Bethanne drove. Annie had claimed the backseat; she’d been suspiciously quiet since they’d left Seattle. Bethanne knew Vance had deeply hurt and disappointed her daughter. The fact that he’d decided to travel in Europe for a year—and hadn’t bothered to tell her—could only feel like a betrayal. Bethanne hoped that spending these weeks with her grandmother and with her would help. Annie was still young. In time she’d recognize that Vance’s leaving was the best thing that could have happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered when she’d told her parents she wanted to marry Grant. Her family, especially her father, had urged Bethanne to complete her education first. With just one semester to go before she obtained her degree, he’d argued that it made sense to put off the wedding. Bethanne, however, had been unwilling to listen, unwilling to wait a day longer than necessary to be Grant’s wife. And she’d refused to be separated from him; the university was in the town of Pullman in eastern Washington, while he was working in Seattle. She’d finish school later—only she never had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn retrospect, it had all worked out, but if she’d had her teaching degree who knows how different her life might have been. One thing was sure; with a career of her own, or at least the qualifications for one, she wouldn’t have felt so completely vulnerable when Grant asked for a divorce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie’s situation was different to that extent, anyway. She’d graduate the following year with a business degree. She’d gotten practical experience working at Parties and that would serve her well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie stirred in the backseat, sitting up and yawning. She removed the iPod earbuds and stretched her arms to the side, arching her back. “Where are we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just over the pass,” Bethanne told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Already?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you been asleep?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I was,” Annie murmured sadly. “I haven’t had much sleep the past few nights.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, sweetie, I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vance, Matt and Jessie got off okay,” she muttered with no degree of pleasure. “They ended up getting a cab. He sent me a text from the airport and said he’d keep in touch.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8/page-8.html","bookId":1940,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM"}
