He blinked a few times, and shadows took shape. The bonfire had dwindled, but there was just enough light to see after his eyes had adjusted. His subconscious had mercifully padlocked the nightmares into an unused corner of his mind. Still, a vague dread weighed heavily on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lay perfectly still, listened. The cannibals\u0027 party had waned and finally petered out. But those voices, somewhere close in the night. He tilted his head only slightly. The voices were just around the other side of the stump, two women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first voice: \"I\u0027m so tired. Some party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other: \"Yes. Roger\u0027s sleeping it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it your anniversary? I thought Doris was on guard duty with me tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not feeling well, and Roger couldn\u0027t get it up anyway. He had so much fermented blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get a little tired of the fermented blood sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause. \"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems so long since I had a nice glass of wine or a Dr. Pepper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really don\u0027t like the fermented blood? Seriously?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I like it. Don\u0027t get me wrong. The fermented blood is great. Love the fermented blood, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little bit overkill with all the human flesh and everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. Sometimes I\u0027d trade it all for a nice green salad and a glass of Shiraz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you. But you wouldn\u0027t give it up. The blood and the human flesh and the whole lifestyle. You don\u0027t mean that, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not. All my friends are here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the women spoke, Mortimer had stealthily slunk around the stump, froze when he saw a pair of slim legs wearing pink-and-black cowboy boots stretching away from the stump. The women appeared to be leaning against the stump, facing back toward the compound. They probably should have been facing out instead. A little luck at last. Now Mortimer could slink away without their seeing. He prepared to do just that, when one of the women stood and stretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to take a wee-wee. Back soon.\" She picked her way through the bushes and out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer changed his plan, hardly even thought about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe circled the stump and grabbed the remaining woman, pulled her toward him. She drew breath for a scream, but Mortimer quickly clapped a hand over her mouth. His other arm went around her throat. She struggled, kicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands came up, tried to claw his eyes, but he pulled her down, squeezed. He wanted to end it quickly, crushed her windpipe with his forearm. She went stiff briefly, then limp in his arms. He put her back in front of the stump, arranged her to look as if she\u0027d curled up asleep. A crude spear leaned against the trunk and he grabbed it, darted back to his hiding place on the other side of the stump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands shook; his breathing was shallow, verging on hyperventilation. He\u0027d never killed anyone with his bare hands before. Up close. A woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the spear, squatting and ready to spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long way off an owl hooted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other woman returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, Lydia, you\u0027re not supposed to sleep on guard duty. What if...Lydia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer went for her, spear held out front. He saw this one\u0027s face and almost balked. She looked young, dark hair in a ponytail, expression wide-eyed and innocent like the na\u0026amp;iuml;ve daughter on a feminine hygiene commercial. Her mouth fell open, and Mortimer struck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spearhead caught her square in the throat. Blood bubbled out of her mouth. He yanked out the spear, stabbed her again in the chest. She sank to her knees, coughed more blood and fell on top of her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese hadn\u0027t been the cannibals Mortimer had expected, not drooling savages with bones through the nose. They could have been members of the PTA. Soccer moms. God, forgive me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he remembered the grotesque cookout only a few hours earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knelt next to the bodies, searched them. The one he\u0027d speared had a good bowie knife with an eight-inch blade. He took it, strapped it to his belt. He coveted their dry clothing, but they were both too small. He checked their pockets, had hoped for the miracle of a book of matches. No luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout thinking, Mortimer headed for the sleeping camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a gap in the bone fence wide enough for one person to walk through at a time. Mortimer went in, crouching low and grasping the spear with tight, nervous hands. The stench of scorched flesh mixed with campfire smoke still hung in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dim, dirty orange light, Mortimer now saw a line of shabby huts on the other side of the compound, crude dwellings pieced together from mismatched scraps of wood. His eyes darted in all directions. Presumably, there were other guards. Mortimer kept to the shadows as he crept toward the poles where the limp bodies of his friends were still tied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went to Bill first, lifted his head, slapped his face lightly. Come on, man. Wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill\u0027s eyes creaked open slightly, regarded Mortimer at half-mast. When Bill saw who it was, his eyes shot open with surprise and hope. He opened his mouth to speak, and Mortimer put a hand over it, shook his head. Bill\u0027s eyes slowly moved back and forth. He remembered where he was and nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer sliced through the ropes with the bowie knife, and Bill collapsed to the ground. He silently began to rub the circulation back into his legs and wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler\u0027s bright, clear eye was already open and alert. She wordlessly urged Mortimer to hurry. He cut her down, and she fell also, a grimace across her face as she bit back a groan. Being tied to a post for hours obviously hadn\u0027t been very comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer freed the two muscle guys. One of the big men wept openly, and Mortimer shot him an angry glance, mouthed the words Shut up. Soon they were all on their feet, headed back for the gap in the fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYells from behind, the whole camp suddenly and angrily rousing from sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run!\" Mortimer shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sprinted for the fence, the others staggering behind. Soon they were in the forest, running blind, tree branches lashing them in the darkness. Mortimer stumbled, righted himself, kept running. He risked a glance over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glow of torches, shouts of pursuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scatter!\" Bill yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer didn\u0027t wait to see where the others went. He picked a direction and ran, his arms and legs shouting hatred at him, his face and arms stinging from a dozen shallow cuts. He ran until the glow of torches faded. He ran until the shouts faded to a muffled murmur and then finally to nothing at all, until his own breathing and his own heartbeat pounding in his ears were the only sounds in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he ran some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLADIES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXVII\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike so many nightmares, this one involved falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst he fell into water, deep and dark and cold, so far into the depths he thought he\u0027d fallen to the center of the earth. But then he splashed through the other side, fell through the branches of a huge tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAching limbs, sopping clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something cottony soft broke his fall. Mortimer felt warm and dry. The nightmare feeling ebbed. Perhaps he was dead. That would be a relief. A soft light above him. A clean bright face, blue eyes, blonde hair glowing soft and gold like a halo. Clothed in raiment of white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn angel. Taking me to Heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke, but Mortimer couldn\u0027t understand. Maybe it was Latin. Ancient angel language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it, little angel? Speak to me in your holy tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked if you wanted some soup,\" the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer propped himself up on one elbow, rubbed a knuckle into his eyes. He lay in bed. Clean sheets. He looked around the room. Almost like a hospital room but softer, less sterile, flowered curtains, personal belongings, books and things spread about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the woman, who was young and fresh faced. No more than twenty. She wore clean white pajamas. No, not pajamas. Hospital scrubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saint Sebastian\u0027s of the Woods,\" she said, her voice soothing, calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hospital, thought Mortimer, or some sort of clinic. Thank God. He\u0027d been found, or some good Samaritan had brought him. He flirted with the brief fantasy that the past nine years had all been a coma delusion, but that was going too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room\u0027s heavy curtains were drawn. The light came from a bulb in an overhead fixture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis many cuts and scrapes had been cleaned. A bandage over a deeper slash under his left eye. A fresh bandage on his pinkie stump. He\u0027d been bathed and wore a clean hospital gown. He ran a hand down the soft cotton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your clothes are in the washing machine,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWashing machine. The words were almost alien to him. He remembered his first washer and dryer, a gift from Anne\u0027s parents. It seemed the ultimate luxury when they no longer had to make those weekly trips to the Laundromat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ruth. Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mortimer. How did you find me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me,\" Ruth said. \"Mother Lola. She said it was fate to find you just in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow far had Mortimer fled in his blind panic? Five miles? More maybe. He remembered being dizzy, pressing on. He didn\u0027t remember finally collapsing but figured he must have dropped from exhaustion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she find anyone else? I was with some other people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Just you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer felt a pang of regret. He wondered if he\u0027d see Bill again. Found that he hoped he would. The cowboy was the closest thing Mortimer had to a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s mushroom soup,\" Ruth prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was hungry, famished in fact. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, childlike, as if she\u0027d accomplished something by getting him to eat. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\" She left, closed the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up, arranged his pillows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother woman brought a tray with his soup. She was older, sagging white skin and frightened brown eyes. She approached tentatively, set the tray gently on his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped, jerked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" Mortimer said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to startle-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe yelped and ran from the room, waving her hands in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer blinked. \"What the fuck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and picked up the spoon, filled his mouth with mushroom soup. He spooned fast and slurped. In three minutes, he\u0027d finished the whole bowl. He belched and wiped his mouth on a white cloth napkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth entered, smiled at the empty bowl. \"Oh, my.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held a glass and handed it to him. Water. He drank. It was cool and clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth asked, \"Is there anything I can get you? Anything you need?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to think of what to ask,\" Mortimer said. \"Where is this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. Not angry. A little kid confused. \"I told you. Saint Sebastian\u0027s of the Woods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"But where is that? I know we\u0027re south of Evansville, but I don\u0027t know how far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe offered a blank look in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was on my way to Chattanooga.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of her eyebrows went up. \"I\u0027ve heard of that town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...maybe I\u0027d better talk to...who did you say was in charge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother Lola.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frown again. \"None of what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027d better talk to Mother Lola.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that won\u0027t be any problem at all,\" Ruth said. \"She wants to speak with you too. She says you\u0027ve been sent to us. You\u0027re the talk of the society.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What society?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The society. All that is everything. Together we are all the society.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when exactly can I see Mother Lola?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When she returns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Returns from where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From without the society.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, do you have any drugs or whiskey or anything I can have?\" asked Mortimer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have pain?\" Ruth looked alarmed. \"I can treat it with acupuncture. I\u0027ve been reading a book on how to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frightened woman stuck her head in the door again, mouth hanging slightly open as she eyed Mortimer with trepidation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" Ruth said. \"You can come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe darted in, set Mortimer\u0027s clothing on the foot of the bed and scampered out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll talk your ear off if you let her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the soup. I feel better. I think I\u0027d like to get dressed now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" She didn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer made shooing motions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth looked toward the door, then back at Mortimer. \"Oh.\" She left, closed the door with a loud click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stripped off his gown, naked underneath, and began to dress. He paused, examined his pants and shirt. They were laundered and pressed. Rips had been sewn with fine stitching. Even the socks had been bleached. Boxers lightly starched. He put it all on and felt like a new man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis boots hadn\u0027t been returned to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer went to the window and swept the curtains aside. The boarded-up window surprised him, wide planks fastened snugly crossways. Only a thin slice of light between planks told him it was daylight. He wondered how long he\u0027d been asleep. No clocks in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bathroom, he urinated, washed his hands and splashed water in his face. He dried himself with a fluffy white towel. The towel smelled fresh, like a meadow, with just a hint of bleach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door and found Ruth waiting for him in the hallway. Fluorescent lights, a slight antiseptic odor. It seemed like any hospital he\u0027d ever been in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feeling okay?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are my boots?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t like to track dirt in from the outside,\" Ruth said. \"They\u0027re in storage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer noticed Ruth wore fuzzy white bedroom slippers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re feeling up to it, I can show you around,\" Ruth offered. \"I sensed you were curious about the society. I can show you how we live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds good. I am a little curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile radiated innocent pleasure. \"This way.\" She motioned for him to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked the long hall, passed rooms with closed doors. Sleeping quarters, Ruth explained. A woman Mortimer hadn\u0027t seen before passed them, pushing a cart full of clean laundry. She was tall and haggard, late forties with dark circles under her eyes. She wore the same white scrubs and slippers as Ruth. Mortimer wiggled his fingers in a friendly wave. She returned only wide-eyed silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found a stairwell and went down two levels, came out in a wide main corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer asked, \"How big is this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three main floors, and then two five-story towers on either side of the garden,\" she said. \"There are two sublevels, housing the kitchens, laundry and other maintenance facilities, including the power station. Sixty-three thousand, five hundred and sixty square feet all together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded like she\u0027d memorized a brochure. Maybe she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth led him through a set of wide double doors into a sudden open space, sunlight pouring down on them. Mortimer estimated it was only just after noon. Trees and plants, fat, ripe tomatoes in ceramic pots surrounded by a chest-high wire fence. The temperature was mild, and Mortimer realized they weren\u0027t outside. A huge glass dome arched over them. It was some kind of gigantic arboretum. Completely enclosed, walls rising all around. Mortimer could see blue sky and the towers on either side, but that was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ancient woman tended a dozen goats. There were also chickens and a few ducks. The old woman wore a loose, flowing white gown of light cotton and walked barefoot among the animals. She spotted Ruth and Mortimer, approached and curtsied, her old joints creaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Ruth. Hello, mister.\" Her voice sounded like a rusty hinge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth smiled. \"And how are the goats today, Felicity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mommy says if I milk them all before dinner I\u0027m to have a treat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer stared at the old woman. What the...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a good girl, Felicity. Run along and make sure the goats stay out of the tomatoes this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelicity trotted back to the goats, tittering, a creepy burlesque of a little girl\u0027s giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer looked at Ruth. \"Is she okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has a good way with animals,\" Ruth said. \"Come on. I have so much to show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer followed, a little dazed. What is going on here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed through a storage area marked RECREATIONAL EQUIPMENT. Croquet mallets, a Ping-Pong table, Frisbees, horseshoes, a soccer ball and other sporting gear. Mortimer noticed three large archery targets but neither bows nor arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth took him to the first sublevel, where a big hydroponics setup impressed Mortimer. Ruth explained that they grew a variety of sprouts as well as carrots and other vegetables. They had several books on gardening and hydroponics in the hospital library. Gardening had been considered very good therapy during the hospital\u0027s heyday, and they\u0027d started with a good variety of seeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey paused to watch a young girl about Ruth\u0027s age plant seedlings into small plastic pots lined in neat rows. She had bland brown hair, pale, sickly skin and bone-thin arms and legs. And white bedroom slippers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Emma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, R-Ruth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth said, \"This is Mortimer. He\u0027s been sent to us. I\u0027m showing him the ways of the society.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer nodded. \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the others, Emma looked at him like he was from Mars. \"H-hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have we here?\" Ruth picked up one of the seedlings, squinted at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B-banana p-peppers,\" Emma said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emma has quite a green thumb.\" Ruth passed the seedling to Mortimer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at it briefly before setting it back on the table. \"Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA panicked, high-pitched noise popped out of Emma\u0027s mouth. She bent over the seedling, lined it up exactly with the rest of the seedlings in the row. She examined it from every angle, making sure it was perfectly aligned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She likes things just right,\" Ruth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer smiled weakly. \"Who doesn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe showed him through the kitchens, then took him down another level. She opened a big steel door, and Mortimer balked at the darkness and the damp smell. But Ruth took a lantern hanging from the wall and flipped it on. It hummed and buzzed to life, casting a blue glow on the rough cavern walls beyond. She led, and he followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnel\u0027s low ceiling was a mere two inches from his head, but it soon opened into a wide cave. The sound of rushing water. She held up the lantern, showing Mortimer the pool of water, the underground river flowing in one side and out the other. Mortimer thought of his own caves, where he\u0027d hidden from the world for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We catch fish here,\" Ruth said. \"This isn\u0027t the drinking water. The hospital has a system fed by a very deep well. But we have plans to put in a hydroelectric waterwheel here if the solar panels on the roof give out. There are complete diagrams for how to build a waterwheel in a book in the hospital library.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took Mortimer through the rest of the hospital, showing him inconsequential nooks and crannies. The entire time something about the place nagged at him, something beyond the general strangeness of the people he\u0027d met. He couldn\u0027t quite put his finger on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many live here?\" Mortimer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eighty-eight,\" said Ruth. \"Fewer than in the old times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The old times?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before. The time before the society.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large room with many shelves and books was obviously the hospital library. Ruth credited the written knowledge within for a good portion of the society\u0027s survival. Everything anyone needed to know, she claimed, was written down in one book or another. How to make soap or repair a furnace or catch fish or set a broken arm or...well...anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer wandered while Ruth chattered on about the wonders of the library, her bubbly voice fading to background music. He drifted toward a wall where several framed newspaper articles hung. The newspaper had yellowed almost to brown. He scanned the headlines and photos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man in a hard hat and a business suit breaking ground with a ceremonial golden shovel. Another photo dated almost twenty-four months later, of a sharply dressed woman cutting a ribbon. Various headlines:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGROUND BREAKS ON INNOVATIVE CARE CENTER.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSECLUDED WOMEN\u0027S HOSPITAL A RETREAT FOR THE WEARY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRENOWNED PSYCHOLOGIST TO JOIN SAINT SEBASTIAN\u0027S STAFF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer scanned the articles, frowned as other headlines and bits of story jumped out at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDEPRESSION UP AMONG WOMEN, CLAIMS SAINT SEBASTIAN\u0027S DOCTOR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSAINT SEBASTIAN\u0027S TO OPEN NEW WARD FOR VIOLENT PSYCHOTICS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKNOXVILLE WOMAN WHO MURDERED FAMILY TO GO TO SAINT SEBASTIAN\u0027S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething cold and leaden sagged in the pit of Mortimer\u0027s stomach. He glanced sideways at Ruth, who still gestured airily at the many volumes. Oh, hell, he thought. I\u0027m in a nuthouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer cleared his throat. \"Uh...well, this has been fun. If I could just get my boots, I really need to hit the road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth tilted her head, frowned at him. \"The road?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to leave. Thanks for the soup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Nobody leaves. This is the society. We are within, safe from the outside. No one leaves. Ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer suddenly realized what was so strange about the hospital. He\u0027d not seen a single open door or window. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/go-go-girls-of-the-apocalypse/page-7.html","bookId":1578,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:01:17 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:01:17 AM"}
