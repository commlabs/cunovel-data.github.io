She would have to keep Narishma close to warn her if someone started channeling nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless M’Hael uses the True Power again. Would another man be able to sense that being channeled?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene turned as Merise gestured toward where most of the Aes Sedai and Asha’man were still engaged in a resounding battle with the Sharan forces. Many sisters in colorful dresses lay dead across the hillside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawyn’s death haunted her thoughts like an assassin in black. Egwene set her jaw and stoked her anger, drawing in the One Power as she launched herself at the Sharans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurin, his nostrils stuffed with cloth, fought on Polov Heights with the other Borderlanders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven through the cloth, he smelled the war. So much violence, the scents of blood, of rotting flesh all around him. They coated the ground, his sword, his own clothing. He had already been ill, violently, several times during the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill he fought. He threw himself aside as a bear-snouted Trolloc crawled over the bodies and swung down at him. The beasts sword made the ground shake, and Hurin cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast laughed an inhuman laugh, taking Hurin’s cry to indicate fear. It lunged, so Hurin scuttled forward and under its reach, then opened up its stomach as he ran past. The creature stumbled to a stop, watching at its own reeking innards pour out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave to buy time for Lord Rand, Hurin thought, backing away and waiting for the next Trolloc to come over the bodies. They were coming up the eastern side of the Heights, the river side. This steep slope was hard for them to climb, but Light, there were so many of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep fighting, keep fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Rand had come to him, making apologies. To him! Well, Hurin would do him proud. The Dragon Reborn did not need the forgiveness of a little thief-taker, but Hurin still felt as if the world had righted itself Lord Rand was Lord Rand again. Lord Rand would preserve them, if they could give him enough time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a lull in the action. He frowned. The beasts had seemed endless. Surely they hadn’t all fallen. He stepped cautiously forward, looking over the corpses and down the slope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no they weren’t defeated. The sea of beasts seemed near-endless still. He could see them by the light of fires below. The Trollocs had paused their climb because they needed to move corpses out of their way on the slope, many of whom had been cut down by Tam’s archers. Below them, at the riverbed, the greater army of Trollocs fought Elayne’s army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should have a few minutes\", Lan Mandragoran said to the soldiers from where he sat on horseback. Queen Alliandre rode nearby as well, talking calmly with her men. Two monarchs within sight. Surely they knew how to exercise command. That made Hurin feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They’re preparing for a final charge\", Lan said, \"a push to force us away from the slope so they can fight us up here on even ground. Rest while they clear bodies. Peace favor your swords, friends. The next assault will be the worst one\". The next assault would be the worst one? Light!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them on the middle of the plateau, the rest of Mat’s army continued pressing the Sharan army, trying to push them back to the southwest. If he could do that, and force them down the slope into the Trollocs fighting Elayne’s forces, it could create a right mess that Mat could take advantage of. But for the moment, the Sharans were not giving an inch of ground; in fact, they were pushing back Mat’s army, which was beginning to founder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurin lay back, listening to the moans all around, the distant shouts and ringing of weapons hitting metal, sniffing the stink of violence hanging around him in an ocean of stenches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst still to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight help them . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerelain used a rag to wipe the blood from her hands as she strode into the feast hall of her palace. The tables had been chopped apart for firewood to stoke the enormous hearths at either end of the long room; in place of the furniture lay rows upon rows of wounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors from the kitchens burst open and a group of Tinkers entered, some carrying litters and others helping wounded men limp into the room. Light! Berelain thought. More? The palace was stuffed to bursting with the wounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no!\" she said, stalking forward. \"Not in here. The back hallway. We\u0027re going to have to start putting them there. Rosil! We have new wounded\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tinkers turned toward the hallway, speaking in comforting tones to the wounded men. Only those who could be saved were brought back. She had been forced to instruct the leaders among the Tuatha’an women as to which types of wounds took too much effort to Heal. Better to save ten men with bad wounds than to expend the same energy trying to rescue one man who clung to life by a single blade of hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat moment of explanation had been one of the grimmest things she’d ever done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tinkers continued moving in a line, and Berelain watched the wounded for glimpses of white clothing. There were Whitecloaks among them, but not the one she sought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many . . . she thought again. The Tinkers had no help moving the wounded. Every able-bodied man in the palace, and most women, had gone to the battlefield to fight or help the Caemlyn refugees gather arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosil bustled up, her clothing stained with blood that she ignored. She immediately took charge of the wounded, eyeing them for any who needed immediate attention. Unfortunately, the doors to the kitchen burst open at that moment, and a group of bloodied Andorans and Aiel stumbled through, sent by the Kinswomen from another area of the battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat followed was near madness as Berelain chivvied out everyone she had—grooms, the elderly, some children as young as five—to help settle the newcomers. Only the worst of the Aiel came through; they had a tendency to remain on the battlefield as long as they could hold a weapon. That meant many who came to her were beyond help. She had to settle them in space she couldn’t afford and watch them heave bloody gasps as they died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is foolish!\" she said, standing up. Her hands were wet with blood again, and she hadn’t a clean rag left. Light! \"We need to send more help. You\". She pointed to an Aiel who had been blinded. He sat with his back to the wall, a bandage around his eyes. \"You, the blind Aiel\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am called Ronja\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Ronja. I have some gai’shain here helping me. By my count, there should be a lot more of them. Where are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wait until the battle is through so that they may minister to the victors\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to fetch them\", she said. \"We need every person we can \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-267.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
