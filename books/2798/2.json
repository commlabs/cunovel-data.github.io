It’s about a quarter of the size of Safira’s and I’m sure at one point our two stores used to be one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go in to find Sammi behind the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect. Just who I need to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over to him and smile, he smiles back flirtatiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSammi is eighteen; he works at Winnie’s part time and goes to college. He is cute. At least, I think he is under all that dark hair. His hair is long and brushed forward over one eye. The eye that I can see is a warm brown color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles and says, “Tina, babe, what can I get you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver the charmer, I reply, “Actually, Sammi, I need a favor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face shows unconcealed surprise. A small smile forms on his lips and he says in a husky voice, “Sure! Whatever you need…” He licks his lips in invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, put a hand on my chest and say, “Oh my, not that kind of favor! Sammi, I’m old enough to be your Mo…uh, older sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiggles his brows at me and responds, “My sister ain’t a hottie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t help but laugh. We banter like this all the time. It’s harmless and Sammi is a sweetheart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you help me or not?” I say in mock sternness with my hands on my hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat charming smile appears again and he replies, “Anything for you, babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI explain to him what I need done and he looks at me like I’ve lost my mind. After pleading with him and planting and a wet, sloppy kiss on his cheek, he finally agrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jump up and down in victory, thank him and walk back to Safira. I relieve Mimi, take my place at the counter and wait to see what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half hour passes and the beautiful man across the street appears, right on time, cigarette in hand. I spot Sammi making his way across the street and anxiety knots my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a bad idea. What was I thinking??! God, I am such a turd!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSammi approaches beautiful man and hands a small brown paper bag to him. Sammi says a few words and walks away. He spies me through Safira’s window and winks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch Mr. Beautiful open the brown paper bag and take out the candy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks confused. I’m not surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tears the note off the ribbon, opens it and reads. He looks even more confused and my heart shrinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I see next makes it all worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes crinkle and a small smile twitches at his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot great, but definite progress. This is the first smile I’ve seen grace his gorgeous face and it was nice. I can’t help but smile, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYay, me! See?! Not such a bad idea after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep sigh escapes me. I feel at peace once again. I go about my work with a huge smile plastered on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRawr Raaawr\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inwardly cringe and glare at the damn door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man stands there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s smiling but his eyes look at me like being a girl is a disease and you can catch it from visiting a boutique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is tall, probably 6’2”. Olive skin tone and amber colored eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m mesmerised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes are like honey! I’ve never seen that eye color before. He has dark brown spiky hair and a nice five o’clock shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, this man is gorgeous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks to be about my age. He walks over to me, places both forearms on my counter, leans in close and asks, “Can you help me, honey?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I. Ahh…” I’m tongue tied. His voice is as smooth as his honey eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving obviously heard a man’s voice in the store, Mimi comes to stand next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks Mr. Gorgeous up and down and narrows her eyes. She says firmly, “I can help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks her up and down the same way she’d done mere seconds before and smiles a big smile. Mr Gorgeous has a dimple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy knees almost buckle and I start to sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirks as he responds, “Great. I’m looking for the owner of this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down and feel the flush rise from my chest up. This is because on the counter sits my Mr. Beautiful note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi looks down, brow scrunched in confusion. She reads the note and I know I’m totally busted. Meems knows my handwriting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel her stare bore into me, I won’t look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t…” Her voice colored with amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m red, splotchy, and embarrassed. I look towards the man who is now looking at me with narrowed eyes, his head at a tilt. Like he’s trying to read my mind or figure me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can stop myself, I answer with a shrill, “How did he know it was me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Gorgeous takes the note from the counter and turns it over. We all look down and what I see makes me even redder. I hear Mimi burst out laughing. Mr. Gorgeous quietly chuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafira Boutique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote on Safira stationary!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI. Am. Mortified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was never meant to know!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Gorgeous speaks, “C’mon, sweetheart. You’re comin’ with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh, What?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper, “Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flicks his head to the note and says, “Boss wants to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh, What?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widen and I whisper loudly, “Am I in trouble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks me up and down and his lips lift a little. He answers, “I’m not sure, sweetheart.” He says sweetheart in a way that makes it sound like sweethawt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes my hand that rests on the counter, pulls me next to him, and tucks my hand into the crook his arm. I know he sees uncertainty in my eyes. He looks to Mimi and smiles as he speaks, “I’ll have her back in one piece. I’m Max, by the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe does a little head lift and responds, “Mimi.” She points to me and says, “That’s Tina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles and says, “Great, she’ll be back soon.” He starts pulling me along with him and I turn to glare at Mimi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding tall with eyes wide, she smiles big and lifts her hand in a wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrud! I knew this was a bad idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend-zoned\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m waiting for Max to get back with information on who sent me the candy and note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity eats away at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho the hell would send a guy candy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot just any candy, but those goofy wax lips that taste like cardboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone nutty, that’s for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe even a past fling. I’m wracking my brain trying to think if any of the girls I’ve slept with recently were a bit nutty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was that one girl who wanted me to…Nah. I smile at the memory. She was the good kind of nutty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to my office bursts open and Max tries to walk in but it looks like something is holding him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax starts laughing and says, “C’mon sweetheart, he won’t bite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand and step towards the door, my brows furrowed. I decide to sit on the front of my desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did he bring me, a Pitbull?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax is struggling with whoever is out there and Max is big. And strong. He looks at me like he wants to burst into laughter. Walking back out the office door, he emerges seconds later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking backwards towards me is a woman; Max has his hands on her shoulders and is walking her toward me. Once she hits the middle of the room, he stops walking. He lowers his face to hers and says, “He just wants to talk, hon.” He flicks her hair playfully, turns and walks out. But not before he winks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman standing in my office still has her back to me and she’s looking at the floor. I do a quick scan of her from the back. Medium height; maybe 5”5 or 5”6 without the black pumps she’s rockin’. Nice body. Great ass. Long dark hair to her waist. It’s shiny and has a nice natural wave to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s now been over a minute and this slip of a woman still hasn’t turned to face me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m getting irritated now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to break the ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say, “He’s right, you know. I won’t bite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoulders stiffen but she slowly turns to face me. Her face is still lowered so I can’t see what she looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a look at her body from the front. Decent boobs. Nice curvy body. She’s dressed nicely, wearing a white linen shirt and a high waisted grey skirt. You know the ones that are tight around the ass and get tighter around the knees?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s also wearing a thick black belt that goes just under her boobs. The more I look at her, the sexier she becomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis somehow makes me more irritated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask a little too firmly, “Can you look at me, miss? I just wanna ask you a few questions. Nothin’ to be worried about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and lifts her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fight the urge to roll my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a past fling, that’s for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s cute. And flushed, I mean, really flushed. It kinda makes her cuter. Not just cute, but adorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she’s petrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea why. I mean, I know I’m a big guy but I don’t think I’m that scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe has light green eyes that are unusual because they have a black rim, a cute little nose, and her lips…Oh, man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer top lip is full and her bottom lip is fuller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing my foot, I pull out a chair and motion for her to sit. Thankfully, she does so without hesitating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho is this girl?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh, that voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the type of voice you hear in your own made up fantasies. Deep and sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at Mr Beautiful and Wow. He’s actually even more beautiful up close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I’m close enough to him, I can see he has the same eye color as Max. He looks a lot like Max, too. I’m guessing they’re brothers or at least related.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust above his eyebrow is a scar; it goes through his eyebrow at an angle and ends at the outer tip of his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scowl mars his face and he sighs deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands up and walks around the desk, sits behind it and takes his cufflinks out of the button holes of his silk lilac shirt. Not many men could pull off looking manly in lilac. But he’s just that awesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolls up the sleeves to his elbows. I think he’s done this to make me a little more comfortable around him. I’m surprised that it works. The simple move has made him much less intimidating and I feel myself loosen up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounds bored when he says, “I’m Nik.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe already thinks you’re a weirdo, don’t you dare freeze up now. It’s just talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reply a little too loudly, “I’m Tina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips twitch. He asks, “You work at Safira’s Boutique?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI simply nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe points to the note which now sits on his desk and asks, “Can you tell me who gave me this note?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately I respond, “I did.” Just like ripping off a band aid, the quicker you do it the less painful it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brow furrows in confusion, he taps his pen on the desk and says, “Oh. I guess you could say I’m a little curious about the note. And what’s written on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flush even warmer and slide deeper into the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so embarrassed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly respond, “I’m so sorry if I offended you in any way. I, ah, I think I should just go.” I move to stand but he reaches over the table and takes my hand in his huge one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says, “Sit down, please.” This is not a request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe places my hand back on the desk and I park my butt back down. He reaches for the note and reads aloud, “Smile sometime, handsome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYep. I’m an Idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis Tina woman closes her eyes and cringes when I read the note aloud; it’s so cute I have to bite my lip to stop myself from laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightens up, looks me in the eye and says matter-of-factly, “It’s just that every day you come outside for your cigarette break which, by the way, smoking kills.” She scrunches her nose, and says quietly, “But at least it didn’t stunt your growth.” She looks thoughtful, places her fingers to her chin and tilts her head slightly. Her head straightens suddenly as if she just remembered she wasn’t done and she continues, “And I see you out there every day but you’re never happy. And you never smile. Like ever. And I just wanted to, anonymously, make your day a bit better and make you smile because, frankly, watching you is a bit depressing. And I know it’s none of my business and you have the right to be as broody as you damn well please, but I like when people smile and I like making people smile!” She finishes a little louder than she needs to be. I have to stop myself from running my hands down my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, too cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a frown form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t do cute. She has a great ass that I would definitely like in my bed but I don’t do cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCute girls wanna kiss. I don’t do that shit. Kissing means special things like relationships and girlfriends. And I don’t have relationships or girlfriends. I have fuck buddies. Because I fuck. Often. I most definitely don’t make love. I might not screw hard all the time but even slow screwing is just screwing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t have the time or the inclination to make the effort to keep a girlfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, when I’m not knee deep in nightclub bullshit, I’ll find a nice girl and settle down. I’ll make sure that girl will be worth it. But that time is not now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina is looking at my eyes and asks, “What color are your eyes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh oh, she’s making goo-goo eyes at me. Crap, cut her loose and let her be on her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik shifts in his chair almost nervously as he replies, “Uh, I don’t really know. Like a gold-ish brown or somethin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push the eye color thing. I tell him, “I’ve never seen eyes that color. It’s like warm honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks away and swallows hard before he says, “Uh, yeah, I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my, he is nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he looks toward the bookcase in the corner and I spy ink travelling up the back of his neck past the back of his ear. It’s black, thick, and looks tribal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYummy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe won’t look me in the eye now and I wonder what I said to get a reaction like the one he’s giving me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m confused. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/friend-zoned-friend-zoned-1/page-2.html","bookId":2798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM"}
