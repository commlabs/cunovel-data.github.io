It was like trying to drag a mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cheering stopped, abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sound behind Vimes. It was not, particularly, a loud noise. It just had a peculiarly nasty carrying quality. It was the click of four sets of talons hitting the flagstones at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes looked around and up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoot clung to the dragon\u0027s hide. A few pieces of charred wood had lodged here and there, and were still smouldering. The magnificent bronze scales were streaked with black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt lowered its head until Vimes was a few feet away from its eyes, and tried to focus on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably not worth running, Vimes told himself. It\u0027s not as if I\u0027ve got the energy anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt Lady Ramkin\u0027s hand engulf his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jolly well done,” she said. “It nearly worked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharred and blazing wreckage rained down around the distillery. The pond was a swamp of debris, covered with a coating of ash. Out of it, dripping slime, rose Sergeant Colon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clawed his way to the bank and pulled himself up, like some sea-dwelling lifeform that was anxious to get the whole evolution thing over with in one go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobby was already there, spread out like a frog, leaking water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that you, Nobby?” said Sergeant Colon anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s me, Sergeant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I glad about that, Nobby,” said Colon fervently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish it wasn\u0027t me, Sergeant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon tipped the water out of his helmet, and then paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about young Carrot?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobby pushed himself upon his elbows, groggily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dunno,” he said. “One minute we were on the roof, next minute we were jumping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both looked at the ashen waters of the pond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose,” said Colon slowly, “he can swim?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dunno. He never said. Not much to swim in, up in the mountains. When you come to think about it,” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But perhaps there were limpid blue pools and deep mountain streams,” said the sergeant hopefully. “And icy tarns in hidden valleys and that. Not to mention subterranean lakes. He\u0027d be bound to have learned. In and out of the water all day, I expect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared at the greasy grey surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was probably that Protective,” said Nobby. “P\u0027raps it filled with water and dragged him down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon nodded gloomily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll hold your helmet,” said Nobby, after a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I\u0027m your superior officer!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” said Nobby reasonably, “but if you get stuck down there, you\u0027re going to want your best man up here, ready to rescue you, aren\u0027t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s . . . reasonable,” said Colon eventually. “That\u0027s a good point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drawback is, though ...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“. . .1 can\u0027t swim,” Colon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you get out of that, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon shrugged. “I\u0027m a natural floater.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir eyes, once again, turned to the dankness of the pond. Then Colon stared at Nobby. Then Nobby, very slowly, unbuckled his helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There isn\u0027t someone still in there, is there?” said Carrot, behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked around. He hoicked some mud out of an ear. Behind him the remains of the brewery smouldered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I\u0027d better nip out quickly, see what was going on,” he said brightly, pointing to a gate leading out of the yard. It was hanging by one hinge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” said Nobby weakly. “Jolly good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s an alley out there,” said Carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No dragons in it, are there?” said Colon suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No dragons, no humans. There\u0027s no-one around,” said Carrot impatiently. He drew his sword. “Come on!” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where to?” said Nobby. He\u0027d pulled a damp butt from behind his ear and was looking at it with an expression of deepest sorrow. It was obviously too far gone. He tried to light it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We want to fight the dragon, don\u0027t we?” said Carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon shifted uncomfortably. “Yes, but aren\u0027t we allowed to go home for a change of clothes first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And a nice warm drink?” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And a meal,” said Colon. “A nice plate of-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should be ashamed of yourselves,” said Carrot. “There\u0027s a lady in distress and a dragon to fight and all you can think of is food and drink!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I\u0027m not just thinking about food and drink,” said Colon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could be all that stands between the city and total destruction!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but-” Nobby began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrot drew his sword and waved it over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain Vimes would have gone!” he said. “All for one!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared at them, and rushed out of the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon gave Nobby a sheepish look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Young people today,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All for one what?” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant sighed. “Come on, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey staggered out into the alley. It was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where\u0027d he go?” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrot stepped out of the shadows, grinning all over his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Knew I could rely on you,” he said. “Follow me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something odd about that boy,” said Colon, as they limped after him. “He always manages to persuade us to follow him, have you noticed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All for one what?” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something about the voice, I reckon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but all for one what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Patrician sighed and, carefully marking his place, laid aside his book. To judge from the noise there seemed to be an awful lot of excitement going on out there. It was highly unlikely any palace guards would be around, which was just as well. The guards were highly-trained men and it would be a shame to waste them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would need them later on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe padded over to the wall and pushed a small block that looked exactly like all the other small blocks. No other small block, however, would have caused a section of flagstone to grind ponderously aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a carefully chosen assortment of stuff in there-iron rations, spare clothes, several small chests of precious metals and jewels, tools. And there was a key. Never build a dungeon you couldn\u0027t get out of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Patrician took the key and strolled over to the door. As the wards of the lock slid back in their well-oiled grooves he wondered, again, whether he should have told Vimes about the key. But the man seemed to have got so much satisfaction out of breaking out. It would probably have been positively bad for him to have told him about the key. Anyway, it would have spoiled his view of the world. He needed Vimes and his view of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Vetinari swung the door open and, silently, strode out into the ruins of his palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey trembled as, for the second time in a couple of minutes, the city rocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon kennels exploded. The windows blew out. The door left the wall ahead of a great billow of black smoke and sailed into the air, tumbling slowly, to plough into the rhododendrons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething very energetic and hot was happening in that building. More smoke poured out, thick and oily and solid. One of the walls folded in on itself, and then another one toppled sluggishly on to the lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwamp dragons shot determinedly out of the wreckage like champagne corks, wings whirring frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill the smoke unrolled. But there was something in there, some point of fierce white light that was gently rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt disappeared from view as it passed a stricken window, and then, with a piece of roof tile still spinning on the top of his head, Errol climbed above his own smoke and ascended into the skies of Ankh-Morpork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunlight glinted off his silver scales as he hovered about a hundred feet up, turning slowly, balancing nicely on his own flame . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes, awaiting death on the plaza, realised that his mouth was hanging open. He shut it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was absolutely no sound in the city now but the noise of Errol\u0027s ascent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey can rearrange their own plumbing, Vimes told himself bemusedly. To suit circumstances. He\u0027s made it work in reverse. But his thingys, his genes . . . surely he must have been halfway to it anyway. No wonder the little bugger has got such stubby wings. His body must have known he wasn\u0027t going to need them, except to steer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood grief. I\u0027m watching the first ever dragon to flame backwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe risked a glance immediately above him. The great dragon was frozen, its enormous bloodshot eyes concentrating on the tiny creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a challenging roar of flame and a pummelling of air the King of Ankh-Morpork rose, all thought of mere humans forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes turned sharply to Lady Ramkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do they fight?” he said urgently. “How do dragons fight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I-that is, well, they just flap at each other and blow flame,” she said. “Swamp dragons, that is. I mean, who\u0027s ever seen a noble dragon fight?” She patted her nightie. “I must take some notes, I\u0027ve got my memo book somewhere ...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In your nightshirt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s amazing how ideas come to one in bed, I\u0027ve always said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlames roared into the space where Errol had been, but he wasn\u0027t there. The king tried to spin in mid-air. The little dragon circled in an easy series of smoke rings, weaving a cat\u0027s cradle in the sky with the huge adversary gyrating helplessly in the middle. More flames, hotter and longer, stabbed at him and missed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd watched in breathless silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ \u0027allo, Captain,” said an ingratiating voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes looked down. A small and stagnant pond disguised as Nobby grinned sheepishly up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you were dead!” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027re not,” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Good.” There didn\u0027t seem much else to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you reckon on the fight, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes looked back up. Smoke trails spiralled across the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not going to work,” said Lady Ramkin. “Oh. Hallo, Nobby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Afternoon, ma\u0027am,” said Nobby, touching what he thought was his forelock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What d\u0027you mean, it\u0027s not going to work?” said Vimes. “Look at him go! It hasn\u0027t hit him yet!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but his flame has touched it several times. It doesn\u0027t seem to have any effect. It\u0027s not hot enough, I think. Oh, he\u0027s dodging well. But he\u0027s got to be lucky every time. It has only got to be lucky once.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meaning of this sank in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean,” said Vimes, “all this is just-just show? He\u0027s just doing it to impress?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ \u0027S\u0027not his fault,” said Colon, materialising behind them. “It\u0027s like dogs, innit? Doesn\u0027t really dawn on the poor little bugger that he\u0027s up against a big one. He\u0027s just ready for a scrap.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth dragons appeared to realise that the fight was the well-known Klatchian standoff. With another smoke ring and a billow of white flame they parted and retreated a few hundred yards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king hovered, flapping its wings quickly. Height. That was the thing. When dragon fought dragon, height was always the thing . . . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guards-guards-discworld-8/page-45.html","bookId":1627,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM"}
