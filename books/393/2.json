{"id":40010,"no":2,"title":"A DELFT PARTY. BY EMMA J. GRAY.","content":"\u0026nbsp;\"Look here! look here!\" and mischievous Penelope rustled a handful of bank-bills before her mother, and the next second raised them above her head and waltzed around the room. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What ails you, child, and where did you get that money?\" was the ready inquiry, while Mrs. Thayer\u0027s admiring eyes followed her daughter\u0027s graceful, swift-moving figure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All of a sudden Penelope\u0027s rosy face, flushed with exercise and radiant with happiness, burst into a merry laugh—one of the laughs that ripple all through the atmosphere, and prove so contagious that everybody within hearing of it laughs also.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then stopping just before her mother, and again rustling the crisp bills, for they were bran-new, she this time teasingly said, \"Guess.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But I cannot.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, then,\" and dragging a chair so as to be opposite[Pg 76] both her mother and Cousin Blanche—this cousin has been a young lady for over ten years, and makes her home with them—Penelope sat herself down, and with the tantalizing manner that she could assume on occasions, slowly counted, \"One—two—three—four—five,\" and so on, laying one five-dollar bill over the other while doing so, until they numbered ten. Then satisfactorily surveying the pile before her, she raised her eyes, and looking full into the earnest faces of her listeners, exclaimed, with a wave of her hand in the money direction, \"All mine!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You tantalizing, tormenting—\" and Penelope\u0027s mother, trying to look severe, rose, and threw on the blazing log fire a paper which, until her daughter\u0027s entrance, she had been reading, and then with a swift backward turn of her head she concluded, \"mischievous girl.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Thayer was rarely known to have administered anything but caresses on any of her children, much less to her only daughter and youngest child. \"Mother\u0027s pet,\" the boys called her, but people called her everybody\u0027s pet, for from her youngest brother to her eldest, and she had five of them, their first question was, \"Where\u0027s Penelope?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Therefore Mrs. Thayer was not at all surprised when her daughter finally told her that the money was a present from Uncle Dan. Uncle Dan was Mrs. Thayer\u0027s bachelor brother, and lived with them off and on, and Penelope farther explained, while delight streamed from every feature of her mobile face, \"that uncle had given her the money to spend on a party\"; and having told her story, she raised her gray-blue honest eyes to her mother, and asked,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I could give a party for fifty dollars, couldn\u0027t I?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course you can! the loveliest sort of a party, too,\" was the assuring answer. Then, as that matter was arranged, Mrs. Thayer turned towards Blanche, who was quietly watching the interview but saying not a word. \"Have you any scheme to suggest?\" But before Blanche had an opportunity to reply Mrs. Thayer interjected, suddenly rising to give her dress a fresh smooth out, \"Penelope, how would you like to give the party on your birthday?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027d love to, mother,\" and very rapidly her little hands were clasped together while she added, \"May I?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t see why not; your birthday is—let me count—just three weeks hence;\" and with the most satisfied air Mrs. Thayer exclaimed, \"Plenty of time. But run away now, dear, for we want to plan your party when you\u0027re not around.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And after a slight demur, for Penelope was thirteen years old and thought she should be taken into the consultation, she rose and gayly tripped out of the room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now, Blanche,\" and Mrs. Thayer wheeled about to face her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You amuse me. What should I know about children\u0027s entertainments?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027re the very one that does know. Haven\u0027t you been all over the world nearly? Of course you know.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, how do you think Penelope would enjoy a Delft party?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Shaking her head slowly, Mrs. Thayer replied, \"I never heard of one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nor have I, and I am astonished that it has not been introduced long ago. As New York was settled by the Dutch, a Delft party could partake of the real Knickerbocker flavor—none of the sham kind;\" and with this last word Cousin Blanche rose and walked nearer to the fire, adding, with a slight shiver, that she was cold.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Thayer thereupon rang for the maid, who received orders to bring more wood, and as the fire crackled and blazed, Cousin Blanche talked steadily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course the word Delft suggests Holland, and we right away think of the large windmills everywhere visible. Some of these are built of stone, others of brick, and still others of wood. Many of them are thatched. Now my idea would be for the boys—Penelope\u0027s brothers, I mean—to form a tableau in which they would build windmills. The windmills could be cut out of card-board and pasted together. They could be painted to represent stone or brick. Ordinary straw could be used for thatching, and two or more of the boys might be putting the straw on. These windmills should be stood back of that large screen at the north end of the parlor before the children arrive.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you wouldn\u0027t use a curtain?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; we could arrange all the tableaux back of the screen, and so save a great deal of annoyance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How many tableaux do you think would be nice?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Three or four.\" And Cousin Blanche thoughtfully continued: \"I would show only those that are thoroughly indicative of our Holland Dutch ancestors.\" And Blanche scrutinized Mrs. Thayer\u0027s face while she concluded, \"Entertainment is always better when it is instructive.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But I\u0027m afraid\"—and Mrs. Thayer acted fearful while she explained—\"that the tableaux would be a terrible trouble.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"On the contrary, nothing could be easier;\" and with a good-natured smile rippling over her face, Blanche continued, \"Why not let me help you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Help me? I expected you would. Why, Blanche!\" and the forlorn tone of Mrs. Thayer\u0027s voice decided matters.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am thinking\"—and Cousin Blanche\u0027s face was very bright, showing that her thought was satisfactory—\"that it would be a good idea to show the tulip craze. This tableau would require girls and boys. Penelope could be one of the girls, and Fannie and Julia Mobray the others.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They are quite getatable.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That was my reason in selecting them. Living across the street as they do, they could easily run over for rehearsals.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I did not know that the Hollanders were interested in tulips especially,\" Mrs. Thayer responded, slowly, and lifting her eyes so that they met the astonished ones of Cousin Blanche.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why,\" and without waiting for an explanation Cousin Blanche continued, \"you\u0027ve forgotten about it. The Hollanders spent immense sums of money in ornamenting their gardens with tulips; every new variety of the flower was sought for. They were produced in various shapes and unexpected colors. Indeed, a new color meant a fortune.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh!\" and Mrs. Thayer seemed greatly surprised. \"But how would you show it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I would group the children so that they looked pretty. They could wear green clothes to represent stalk and leaves, and have large colored-paper petals fastened to their waists, and with wire shaped and bent upward they[Pg 77] would look like veritable tulips. Then a few others could, in a previous tableau, show the act of planting tulip bulbs and watering some growing tulips.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Suppose that you cannot get the tulips?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can get tulips of some sort,\" was the assured response. \"If I cannot buy natural ones, I can make paper ones.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Thayer looked pleased, and then a pink flush suffused her face, while she replied, \"I cannot frighten you, can I?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not this time. Indeed, no one can afford to quietly accept things when arranging entertainments;\" and Blanche rose and paced several times up and down the room. While she walked she added: \"As for the other tableaux, one should certainly show a group of girls knitting and crocheting, and others painting pottery, tiles, etc. And then there should be a representation of storks and their nests.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How would you get a stork?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Borrow one from a museum, if there is no other way. But I have friends who have fine specimens of storks, and stork nests also.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, but what about the rest of the party?\" And with a swift glance at her watch, Mrs. Thayer added, \"I have an engagement.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Delft games should be played. For example:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n FIVE.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"select a boy and hand him a knotted handkerchief. He must throw the handkerchief at a player, and before he can count aloud five the person to whom it is thrown must mention a round thing, such as an apple, a globe. If that person fails, he must change places with the one who has caught him, and throw the handkerchief at another. As no repetitions are allowed, it will soon be difficult to find an object that is round.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n BREAKFAST.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Every player is seated. Turn to the person at your right, and ask, \u0027Will you come to breakfast?\u0027 To which the answer is, \u0027Yes.\u0027 When that question and answer have gone around the room, the first one must ask, \u0027What would you like for breakfast?\u0027 Perhaps the reply would be, \u0027Milk\u0027; and he then puts the question to his right-hand neighbor, who perhaps would say, \u0027Oatmeal,\u0027 and so on, until no sensible answer can be made, for no repetitions can occur in this game, also. As the different players fail to respond they must stand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ALPHABET.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Give any letter of the alphabet—for example, S—to the company, also some paper and pencils. In five minutes\u0027 time they should write the names of three celebrated men, and also three sensible sentences, one for each man\u0027s name, as Shakespeare was born in Stratford on the Avon. Forfeits are required for failures.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The games may be interspersed or followed by dances, and also by vocal or instrumental music.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"As you describe it, Blanche, I\u0027m afraid the children wouldn\u0027t get home until morning.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sure they will not want to. And, besides, it will be such a pretty party.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is so; but you haven\u0027t suggested any decorations.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, nor told you what you are to wear.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I to wear?\" and Mrs. Thayer almost screamed the words.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why, the party wouldn\u0027t be anywhere without costumes. You must\"—and Blanche met Mrs. Thayer\u0027s face smilingly—\"look over some Dutch portraits or photographs and decide which you will copy. Besides, you must wear a gown of Delft blue, as, indeed, I must also. And all the girls must wear Delft-blue colored frocks, and fashion them as closely as possible after the style of the young Dutch girls. Their hair should be worn flowing, and tied by the same colored ribbon, or worn in braids down their backs; and the boys must get the color in too some way; of course they could all wear Delft scarfs. And all the decorations should be of the same blue shade. That can readily be arranged by draperies and crêpe paper. And don\u0027t forget to have the caterer serve all confections and ices in form of dikes, windmills, ships, storks, etc. Indeed, we must have everything as Delft as possible.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Penelope heard the scheme she could scarcely wait for her birthday night to come. But the days passed rapidly, after all, because everybody was very busy, and the night of all nights arrived at last.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Uncle Dan, who did not enter the parlor until the games were in progress, exclaimed in amazement, as he turned towards Penelope,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, if it be I, as I suppose it be,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I have a little dog at home, and he knows me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And drawing his hand across his forehead in a dazed sort of way, he inquired: \"Am I dreaming, child? I thought I was in America, but it seems I am in Holland, or perhaps time has gone backward, and it\u0027s the old Knickerbocker period.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3322/90992.html","bookId":393,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:06:23 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 12:06:23 PM"}
