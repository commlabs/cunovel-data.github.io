{"id":38878,"no":15,"title":"Sale of Creeds","content":"Zeus. Hermes. Several Dealers. Creeds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. Now get those benches straight there, and make the place fit to be seen. Bring up the lots, one of you, and put them in line. Give them a rub up first, though; we must have them looking their best, to attract bidders. Hermes, you can declare the sale-room open, and a welcome to all comers. — For Sale! A varied assortment of Live Creeds. Tenets of every description. — Cash on delivery; or credit allowed on suitable security.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hermes. Here they come, swarming in. No time to lose; we must not keep them waiting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. Well, let us begin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. What are we to put up first?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. The Ionic fellow, with the long hair. He seems a showy piece of goods.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Step up, Pythagoreanism, and show yourself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. Go ahead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Now here is a creed of the first water. Who bids for this handsome article? What gentleman says Superhumanity? Harmony of the Universe! Transmigration of souls! Who bids?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First Dealer. He looks all right. And what can he do?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Magic, music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, jugglery. Prophecy in all its branches.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. Can I ask him some questions?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Ask away, and welcome.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. Where do you come from?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. Samos.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. Where did you get your schooling?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. From the sophists in Egypt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. If I buy you, what will you teach me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. Nothing. I will remind you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. Remind me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. But first I shall have to cleanse your soul of its filth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. Well, suppose the cleansing process complete. How is the reminding done?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. We shall begin with a long course of silent contemplation. Not a word to be spoken for five years.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. You would have been just the creed for Croesus’s son! But I have a tongue in my head; I have no ambition to be a statue. And after the five years’ silence?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. You will study music and geometry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. A charming recipe! The way to be wise: learn the guitar.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. Next you will learn to count.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. I can do that already.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. Let me hear you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. One, two, three, four —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. There you are, you see. Four (as you call it) is ten. Four the perfect triangle. Four the oath of our school.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. Now by Four, most potent Four! — higher and holier mysteries than these I never heard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. Then you will learn of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water; their action, their movement, their shapes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. Have Fire and Air and Water shapes?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. Clearly. That cannot move which lacks shape and form You will also find that God is a number; an intelligence; a harmony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. You surprise me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. More than this, you have to learn that you yourself are not the person you appear to be.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. What, I am some one else, not the I who am speaking to you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. You are that you now: but you have formerly inhabited another body, and borne another name. And in course of time you will change once more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. Why then I shall be immortal, and take one shape after another? But enough of this. And now what is your diet?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. Of living things I eat none. All else I eat, except beans.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. And why no beans? Do you dislike them?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Py. No. But they are sacred things. Their nature is a mystery. Consider them first in their generative aspect; take a green one and peel it, and you will see what I mean. Again, boil one and expose it to moonlight for a proper number of nights, and you have — blood. What is more, the Athenians use beans to vote with.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. Admirable! A very feast of reason. Now just strip, and let me see what you are like. Bless me, here is a creed with a golden thigh! He is no mortal, he is a God. I must have him at any price. What do you start him at?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Forty pounds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e First D. He is mine for forty pounds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. Take the gentleman’s name and address.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. He must come from Italy, I should think; Croton or Tarentum, or one of the Greek towns in those parts. But he is not the only buyer. Some three hundred of them have clubbed together.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. They are welcome to him. Now up with the next.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. What about yonder grubby Pontian? 21\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. Yes, he will do.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. You there with the wallet and cloak; come along, walk round the room. Lot No. 2. A most sturdy and valiant creed, free-born. What offers?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. Hullo, Mr. Auctioneer, are you going to sell a free man?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. That was the idea.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. Take care, he may have you up for kidnapping. This might be matter for the Areopagus.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Oh, he would as soon be sold as not. He feels just as free as ever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. But what is one to do with such a dirty fellow? He is a pitiable sight. One might put him to dig perhaps, or to carry water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. That he can do and more. Set him to guard your house, and you will find him better than any watch-dog. — They call him Dog for short.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. Where does he come from? and what is his method?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. He can best tell you that himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. I don’t like his looks. He will probably snarl if I go near him, or take a snap at me, for all I know. See how he lifts his stick, and scowls; an awkward-looking customer!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Don’t be afraid. He is quite tame.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. Tell me, good fellow, where do you come from?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dio. Everywhere. Second D. What does that mean?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dio. It means that I am a citizen of the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. And your model?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dio. Heracles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. Then why no lion’s-skin? You have the orthodox club.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dio. My cloak is my lion’s-skin. Like Heracles, I live in a state of warfare, and my enemy is Pleasure; but unlike him I am a volunteer. My purpose is to purify humanity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. A noble purpose. Now what do I understand to be your strong subject? What is your profession?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dio. The liberation of humanity, and the treatment of the passions. In short, I am the prophet of Truth and Candour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. Well, prophet; and if I buy you, how shall you handle my case?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dio. I shall commence operations by stripping off yours superfluities, putting you into fustian, and leaving you closeted with Necessity. Then I shall give you a course of hard labour. You will sleep on the ground, drink water, and fill your belly as best you can. Have you money? Take my advice and throw it into the sea. With wife and children and country you will not concern yourself; there will be no more of that nonsense. You will exchange your present home for a sepulchre, a ruin, or a tub. What with lupines and close-written tomes, your knapsack will never be empty; and you will vote yourself happier than any king. Nor will you esteem it any inconvenience, if a flogging or a turn of the rack should fall to your lot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. How! Am I a tortoise, a lobster, that I should be flogged and feel it not?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dio. You will take your cue from Hippolytus; mutates mutandis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. How so?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dio. ‘The heart may burn, the tongue knows nought thereof’. 22 Above all, be bold, be impudent; distribute your abuse impartially to king and commoner. They will admire your spirit. You will talk the Cynic jargon with the true Cynic snarl, scowling as you walk, and walking as one should who scowls; an epitome of brutality. Away with modesty, good-nature, and forbearance. Wipe the blush from your cheek for ever. Your hunting-ground will be the crowded city. You will live alone in its midst, holding communion with none, admitting neither friend nor guest; for such would undermine your power. Scruple not to perform the deeds of darkness in broad daylight: select your love-adventures with a view to the public entertainment: and finally, when the fancy takes you, swallow a raw cuttle-fish, and die. Such are the delights of Cynicism.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. Oh, vile creed! Monstrous creed! Avaunt!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dio. But look you, it is all so easy; it is within every man’s reach. No education is necessary, no nonsensical argumentation. I offer you a short cut to Glory. You may be the merest clown — cobbler, fishmonger, carpenter, money-changer; yet there is nothing to prevent your becoming famous. Given brass and boldness, you have only to learn to wag your tongue with dexterity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Second D. All this is of no use to me. But I might make a sailor or a gardener of you at a pinch; that is, if you are to be had cheap. Three-pence is the most I can give.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. He is yours, to have and to hold. And good riddance to the brawling foul-mouthed bully. He is a slanderer by wholesale.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. Now for the Cyrenaic, the crowned and purple-robed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Attend please, gentlemen all. A most valuable article, this, and calls for a long purse. Look at him. A sweet thing in creeds. A creed for a king. Has any gentleman a use for the Lap of Luxury? Who bids?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Third D. Come and tell me what you know. If you are a practical creed, I will have you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Please not to worry him with questions, sir. He is drunk, and cannot answer; his tongue plays him tricks, as you see.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Third D. And who in his senses would buy such an abandoned reprobate? How he smells of scent! And how he slips and staggers about! Well, you must speak for him, Hermes. What can he do? What is his line?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Well, for any gentleman who is not strait-laced, who loves a pretty girl, a bottle, and a jolly companion, he is the very thing. He is also a past master in gastronomy, and a connoisseur in voluptuousness generally. He was educated at Athens, and has served royalty in Sicily 23, where he had a very good character. Here are his principles in a nutshell: Think the worst of things: make the most of things: get all possible pleasure out of things.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Third D. You must look for wealthier purchasers. My purse is not equal to such a festive creed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Zeus, this lot seems likely to remain on our hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. Put it aside, and up with another. Stay, take the pair from Abdera and Ephesus; the creeds of Smiles and Tears. They shall make one lot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Come forward, you two. Lot No. 4. A superlative pair. The smartest brace of creeds on our catalogue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fourth D. Zeus! What a difference is here! One of them does nothing but laugh, and the other might be at a funeral; he is all tears. — You there! what is the joke?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Democr. You ask? You and your affairs are all one vast joke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fourth D. So! You laugh at us? Our business is a toy?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Democr. It is. There is no taking it seriously. All is vanity. Mere interchange of atoms in an infinite void.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fourth D. Your vanity is infinite, if you like. Stop that laughing, you rascal. — And you, my poor fellow, what are you crying for? I must see what I can make of you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Heracl. I am thinking, friend, upon human affairs; and well may I weep and lament, for the doom of all is sealed. Hence my compassion and my sorrow. For the present, I think not of it; but the future! — the future is all bitterness. Conflagration and destruction of the world. I weep to think that nothing abides. All things are whirled together in confusion. Pleasure and pain, knowledge and ignorance, great and small; up and down they go, the playthings of Time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fourth D. And what is Time?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Heracl. A child; and plays at draughts and blindman’s-bluff.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fourth D. And men?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Heracl. Are mortal Gods.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fourth D. And Gods?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Heracl. Immortal men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fourth D. So! Conundrums, fellow? Nuts to crack? You are a very oracle for obscurity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Heracl. Your affairs do not interest me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fourth D. No one will be fool enough to bid for you at that rate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Heracl. Young and old, him that bids and him that bids not, a murrain seize you all!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fourth D. A sad case. He will be melancholy mad before long. Neither of these is the creed for my money.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. No one bids.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. Next lot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. The Athenian there? Old Chatterbox?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. By all means.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Come forward! — A good sensible creed this. Who buys Holiness?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. Let me see. What are you good for?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soc. I teach the art of love.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. A likely bargain for me! I want a tutor for my young Adonis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soc. And could he have a better? The love I teach is of, the spirit, not of the flesh. Under my roof, be sure, a boy will come to no harm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. Very unconvincing that. A teacher of the art of love, and never meddle with anything but the spirit? Never use the opportunities your office gives you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soc. Now by Dog and Plane-tree, it is as I say!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. Heracles! What strange Gods are these?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soc. Why, the Dog is a God, I suppose? Is not Anubis made much of in Egypt? Is there not a Dog-star in Heaven, and a Cerberus in the lower world?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. Quite so. My mistake. Now what is your manner of life?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soc. I live in a city of my own building; I make my own laws, and have a novel constitution of my own.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. I should like to hear some of your statutes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soc. You shall hear the greatest of them all. No woman shall be restricted to one husband. Every man who likes is her husband.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. What! Then the laws of adultery are clean swept away?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soc. I should think they were! and a world of hair-splitting with them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. And what do you do with the handsome boys?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soc. Their kisses are the reward of merit, of noble and spirited actions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. Unparalleled generosity! — And now, what are the main features of your philosophy?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soc. Ideas and types of things. All things that you see, the earth and all that is upon it, the sea, the sky — each has its counterpart in the invisible world.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. And where are they?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soc. Nowhere. Were they anywhere, they were not what they are.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. I see no signs of these ‘types’ of yours.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soc. Of course not; because you are spiritually blind. I see the counterparts of all things; an invisible you, an invisible me; everything is in duplicate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. Come, such a shrewd and lynx-eyed creed is worth a bid. Let me see. What do you want for him?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Five hundred.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. Done with you. Only I must settle the bill another day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. What name?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fifth D. Dion; of Syracuse.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Take him, and much good may he do you. Now I want Epicureanism. Who offers for Epicureanism? He is a disciple of the laughing creed and the drunken creed, whom we were offering just now. But he has one extra accomplishment — impiety. For the rest, a dainty, lickerish creed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sixth D. What price?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Eight pounds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sixth D. Here you are. By the way, you might let me know what he likes to eat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Anything sweet. Anything with honey in it. Dried figs are his favourite dish.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sixth D. That is all right. We will get in a supply of Carian fig-cakes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. Call the next lot. Stoicism; the creed of the sorrowful countenance, the close-cropped creed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Ah yes, several customers, I fancy, are on the look-out for him. Virtue incarnate! The very quintessence of creeds! Who is for universal monopoly?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. How are we to understand that?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Why, here is monopoly of wisdom, monopoly of beauty, monopoly of courage, monopoly of justice. Sole king, sole orator, sole legislator, sole millionaire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. And I suppose sole cook, sole tanner, sole carpenter, and all that?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Presumably.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Regard me as your purchaser, good fellow, and tell me all about yourself. I dare say you think it rather hard to be sold for a slave?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Not at all. These things are beyond our control. And what is beyond our control is indifferent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. I don’t see how you make that out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. What! Have you yet to learn that of indifferentia some are praeposita and others rejecta?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Still I don’t quite see.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. No; how should you? You are not familiar with our terms. You lack the comprehensio visi. The earnest student of logic knows this and more than this. He understands the nature of subject, predicate, and contingent, and the distinctions between them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Now in Wisdom’s name, tell me, pray, what is a predicate? what is a contingent? There is a ring about those words that takes my fancy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. With all my heart. A man lame in one foot knocks that foot accidentally against a stone, and gets a cut. Now the man is subject to lameness; which is the predicate. And the cut is a contingency.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Oh, subtle! What else can you tell me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. I have verbal involutions, for the better hampering, crippling, and muzzling of my antagonists. This is performed by the use of the far-famed syllogism.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Syllogism! I warrant him a tough customer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Take a case. You have a child?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Well, and what if I have?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. A crocodile catches him as he wanders along the bank of a river, and promises to restore him to you, if you will first guess correctly whether he means to restore him or not. Which are you going to say?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. A difficult question. I don’t know which way I should get him back soonest. In Heaven’s name, answer for me, and save the child before he is eaten up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Ha, ha. I will teach you far other things than that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. For instance?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. There is the ‘Reaper.’ There is the ‘Rightful Owner.’ Better still, there is the ‘Electra’ and the ‘Man in the Hood.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Who was he? and who was Electra?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. She was the Electra, the daughter of Agamemnon, to whom the same thing was known and unknown at the same time. She knew that Orestes was her brother: yet when he stood before her she did not know (until he revealed himself) that her brother was Orestes. As to the Man in the Hood, he will surprise you considerably. Answer me now: do you know your own father?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Yes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Well now, if I present to you a man in a hood, shall you know him? eh?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Of course not.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Well, but the Man in the Hood is your father. You don’t know the Man in the Hood. Therefore you don’t know your own father.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Why, no. But if I take his hood off, I shall get at the facts. Now tell me, what is the end of your philosophy? What happens when you reach the goal of virtue?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. In regard to things external, health, wealth, and the like, I am then all that Nature intended me to be. But there is much previous toil to be undergone. You will first sharpen your eyes on minute manuscripts, amass commentaries, and get your bellyful of outlandish terms. Last but not least, it is forbidden to be wise without repeated doses of hellebore.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. All this is exalted and magnanimous to a degree. But what am I to think when I find that you are also the creed of cent-per-cent, the creed of the usurer? Has he swallowed his hellebore? is he made perfect in virtue?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Assuredly. On none but the wise man does usury sit well. Consider. His is the art of putting two and two together, and usury is the art of putting interest together. The two are evidently connected, and one as much as the other is the prerogative of the true believer; who, not content, like common men, with simple interest, will also take interest upon interest. For interest, as you are probably aware, is of two kinds. There is simple interest, and there is its offspring, compound interest. Hear Syllogism on the subject. ‘If I take simple interest, I shall also take compound. But I shall take simple interest: therefore I shall take compound.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. And the same applies to the fees you take from your youthful pupils? None but the true believer sells virtue for a fee?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Quite right. I take the fee in my pupil’s interest, not because I want it. The world is made up of diffusion and accumulation. I accordingly practise my pupil in the former, and myself in the latter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. But it ought to be the other way. The pupil ought to accumulate, and you, ‘sole millionaire,’ ought to diffuse.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Ha! you jest with me? Beware of the shaft of insoluble syllogism.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. What harm can that do?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. It cripples; it ties the tongue, and turns the brain. Nay, I have but to will it, and you are stone this instant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Stone! You are no Perseus, friend?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. See here. A stone is a body?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Yes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Well, and an animal is a body?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Yes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. And you are an animal?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. I suppose I am.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Therefore you are a body. Therefore a stone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Mercy, in Heaven’s name! Unstone me, and let me be flesh as heretofore.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. That is soon done. Back with you into flesh! Thus: Is every body animate?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. No.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Is a stone animate?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. No.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Now, you are a body?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Yes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. And an animate body?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Yes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chrys. Then being animate, you cannot be a stone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Ah! thank you, thank you. I was beginning to feel my limbs growing numb and solidifying like Niobe’s. Oh, I must have you. What’s to pay?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Fifty pounds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Here it is.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Are you sole purchaser?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seventh D. Not I. All these gentlemen here are going shares.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. A fine strapping lot of fellows, and will do the ‘Reaper’ credit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. Don’t waste time. Next lot — the Peripatetic!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Now, my beauty, now, Affluence! Gentlemen, if you want Wisdom for your money, here is a creed that comprises all knowledge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eighth D. What is he like?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. He is temperate, good-natured, easy to get on with; and his strong point is, that he is twins.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eighth D. How can that be?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Why, he is one creed outside, and another inside. So remember, if you buy him, one of him is called Esoteric, and the other Exoteric.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eighth D. And what has he to say for himself?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. He has to say that there are three kinds of good: spiritual, corporeal, circumstantial.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eighth D. There’s something a man can understand. How much is he?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Eighty pounds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eighth D. Eighty pounds is a long price.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Not at all, my dear sir, not at all. You see, there is some money with him, to all appearance. Snap him up before it is too late. Why, from him you will find out in no time how long a gnat lives, to how many fathoms’ depth the sunlight penetrates the sea, and what an oyster’s soul is like.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eighth D. Heracles! Nothing escapes him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Ah, these are trifles. You should hear some of his more abstruse speculations, concerning generation and birth and the development of the embryo; and his distinction between man, the laughing creature, and the ass, which is neither a laughing nor a carpentering nor a shipping creature.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eighth D. Such knowledge is as useful as it is ornamental. Eighty pounds be it, then.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. He is yours.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zeus. What have we left?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. There is Scepticism. Come along, Pyrrhias, and be put up. Quick’s the word. The attendance is dwindling; there will be small competition. Well, who buys Lot 9?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. I. Tell me first, though, what do you know?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. Nothing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. But how’s that?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. There does not appear to me to be anything.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. Are not we something?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. How do I know that?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. And you yourself?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. Of that I am still more doubtful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. Well, you are in a fix! And what have you got those scales for?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. I use them to weigh arguments in, and get them evenly balanced, They must be absolutely equal — not a feather-weight to choose between them; then, and not till then, can I make uncertain which is right. Ninth D. What else can you turn your hand to?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. Anything; except catching a runaway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. And why not that?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. Because, friend, everything eludes my grasp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. I believe you. A slow, lumpish fellow you seem to be. And what is the end of your knowledge?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. Ignorance. Deafness. Blindness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. What! sight and hearing both gone?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. And with them judgement and perception, and all, in short, that distinguishes man from a worm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. You are worth money! — What shall we say for him?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Four pounds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. Here it is. Well, fellow; so you are mine?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. I doubt it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. Nay, doubt it not! You are bought and paid for.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. It is a difficult case. . . . I reserve my decision.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. Now, come along with me, like a good slave.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. But how am I to know whether what you say is true?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. Ask the auctioneer. Ask my money. Ask the spectators.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. Spectators? But can we be sure there are any?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. Oh, I’ll send you to the treadmill. That will convince you with a vengeance that I am your master.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sc. Reserve your decision.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninth D. Too late. It is given.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her. Stop that wrangling and go with your purchaser. Gentlemen, we hope to see you here again tomorrow, when we shall be offering some lots suitable for plain men, artisans, and shopkeepers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n F.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1454/43728.html","bookId":1366,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:56:42 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:56:42 AM"}
