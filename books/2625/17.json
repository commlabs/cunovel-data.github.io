We’re both trying to figure out if what happened between us was real.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonica had entertained a whole spectrum of possibilities of what had happened when Chet had kissed her. She blamed him, then herself, and eventually her upbringing. Having lived a sheltered, protected life hadn’t prepared her for the sensual magnetism she experienced at his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I certainly don’t have any intention of allowing you to kiss me again,” she told him, the words ringing with disdain. It was important he understood this right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not to worry, I’m not exactly thrilled with the prospect myself. I’m curious, and you have to admit you are too, otherwise you wouldn’t be here. Frankly, I can’t figure out what it is about you that intrigues me so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I . . . I was wondering the same thing myself. You won’t leave me alone either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir sandwiches arrived and Chet tore into his as if he hadn’t eaten in a week. Monica glared at him and pointedly reached for her napkin and spread it evenly across her lap. Bowing her head, she murmured a simple prayer of thanksgiving. When she’d finished, she lifted half the sandwich from her plate, holding it daintily in both hands. Chet had started on the second half of his before she’d taken the first bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he finished, Chet reached inside his pocket and brought out a small spiral pad. He flipped through several pages until he found what he was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your father’s name is Lloyd Fischer, the Reverend Lloyd Fischer. You’re an only child and your mother died when you were in your teens. Currently the church employs you as a full-time secretary. You play the piano on Sunday mornings and teach a Sunday school class. Your two best friends are married and live in another state. It’s said that you miss them dearly and write often.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonica was so shocked it took an effort for her to disguise her distress. “How . . . how do you know all that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChet grinned suspiciously. “I have my ways. I’m a private investigator, remember? Don’t tell me you didn’t find out what you could about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I most certainly did not.” She snapped her mouth closed before she added to the lie. She had looked up his name in the business directory and noted the address. His office was close to the Westlake Mall on First Avenue in a dingy part of town. The mission was situated on the same street and she’d mentally calculated which building was his. She’d looked his name up in the white pages as well and learned that his apartment was in the same building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” he said, pushing the empty plate aside and reaching for his coffee. “Do you have any suggestions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what?” She wasn’t sure where he was leading, but she had no intention of continuing with this farce. Having lunch with him was about as far as she intended to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Figuring out what’s going on between us,” he said loudly as if she were hard of hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep your voice down,” she pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The thing is,” Chet continued, “I’m not sure I like you. You annoy the hell out of me and at the same time I can’t help thinking you could be a real woman if you’d let yourself go a little bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonica jerked her shoulders back and scowled at him. “You haven’t exactly endeared yourself to me either, Mr. Costello. You’re everything I don’t want in a man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of insulting him, her words appeared to do just the opposite. He grinned as if she’d stroked his ego with compliments. “Ain’t it a bitch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head snapped back at the use of vulgarity. “Kindly watch your language.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin was cocky in the extreme. “You want me so much you’re practically frothing at the mouth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonica’s hands were shaking so badly she could barely open her purse zipper. She removed her wallet and carefully extracted a ten-dollar bill, which she set next to her plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t believe there’s anything more for us to say,” she said crisply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChet held up his hand. “Don’t be so hasty. We’ve got several matters to discuss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonica slipped out of the booth and dramatically tossed her purse strap over her shoulder. “I won’t say it’s been a pleasure,” she said, taking her gloves from her coat pockets. “Good-bye, Mr. Costello.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him swear and winced at his words as she walked away. His hurried footsteps sounded behind her before she left the store and reached the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, I apologize,” Chet murmured impatiently, “I shouldn’t have said that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was full of surprises. She certainly hadn’t counted on him making amends any more than she’d expected him to chase after her. Monica wasn’t sure how to react, or what she should do. She was more comfortable believing him to be a hopeless Neanderthal. His sincerity went against the assumptions she’d made about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to go for a walk?” Chet asked before she had time to sort through her feelings. “It’ll be a test of our control to see how long we can go without finding something to argue about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do you suggest we walk?” Monica asked, as if that were her only concern. She looked up at him and found his deep, blue eyes intently studying her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The waterfront’s as good a place as any. There’re always lots of things going on down there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right.” Her words were little more than wisps of sound. She hurriedly looked away because she found his gaze mesmerizing and buried her hands in her pockets. Chet followed suit, his own hands waist deep in the pockets of his beige coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You seem to know a lot about me,” she said as a means of opening the conversation, “it only seems fair for you to tell me something about yourself.” She wasn’t sure, but this sounded like a good place for them to start. Her only concern was in knowing exactly what they were starting. She didn’t know if she could be friends with this man, and anything else was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m thirty-three and have never been married,” Chet said, cutting into her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re twenty-five and I didn’t ask you that,” he barked, then seemed to regret his tart remark. “I never found a woman who’d be willing to put up with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonica smiled to herself. “I guess you could say the same thing about me. I don’t seem to communicate very well with men. I thought I did, but I was wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That sounds like you’re speaking from experience. I take it someone’s hurt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “We’re talking about you, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned as if he found the subject boring and was much more interested in her. “What do you want to know about me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, not knowing what to say. “Where’d you go to school, that sort of thing, and how you got into the detective business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” he said, releasing a beleaguered sigh. He seemed eager to get this part over so he could learn what he wanted to know about her. “I graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in criminology and took a job with the local police force. After a few years I decided I’d rather strike out on my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonica speculated that there was a great deal missing in this story, but she didn’t feel she should pressure him for details, not when she was unwilling to supply the missing pieces of her own story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you enjoy police work?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes and no. When I was shot—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were shot?” Monica couldn’t hide her alarm. She studied him for any evidence of permanent injury, and her heart raced at a furious pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was little more than a flesh wound, nothing to worry about physically, at any rate.” He hesitated as if he’d said more than he intended, more than he wanted her to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” she probed, not willing to drop the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing. We’ll leave it at that, all right?” The way he said it told her she wouldn’t get any more information out of him. Knowing that he’d been physically injured had a curious effect on Monica. A strange sick feeling attacked her. Knowing he’d suffered terrible pain greatly distressed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the waterfront, the day was cold and gray, and the angry sky reflected on the waters of Puget Sound. The sidewalks were crowded with the heavy tourist and Christmas traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What made you decide to become a private investigator?” she asked as they stood at the end of the pier. The wind buffeted her and she turned her back on its force. Chet, however, leaned against the rough wood railing, his hands clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChet glanced her way. “You aren’t going to like the answer to this one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I asked the question, didn’t I?” His attitude irked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, since you asked, I’ll tell you. A shapely blonde with loose morals and legs that reached all the way to her neck—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right,” Monica cut him off, “I don’t want to hear the rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what I thought.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey strolled back to the sidewalk and turned into a small shop that specialized in seashells, tacky souvenirs, and gaudy jewelry. Curious, Monica moved to a crowded aisle, no particular destination in mind. She found a paper Japanese fan with a brightly painted dragon and spread it open, fluttering it in front of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChet grinned and she lowered the fan. Slowly the amusement drained from his eyes and darkened to a shade as deep and dark as a moonless night. His sudden enmity unnerved her and she quickly snapped the fan closed and returned it to the table, wondering what she’d done that had displeased him so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand stopped her. “You’re beautiful when you choose to be,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words confused her as much as his look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned hurriedly up another aisle and paused at a rack of necklaces. Taking one, she slid the chain against the palm of her hand until she reached the pendant. A mustard seed was framed in a glass teardrop. The scripture verse about faith the size of a mustard seed leaped into her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Faith is an amazing thing,” Chet surprised her by saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat he’d know the verse shocked her. “You’ve read the Bible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a gallant effort not to laugh and failed. “I’m not a heathen, Monica, even if I’ve been known to frequent seedy bars and sleep with immoral women.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see.” Embarrassed now by his honesty and her assumptions, she started to leave the shop. To her surprise, Chet took the necklace from her hand and carried it to the front of the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you believe in?” she asked as they waited to make the purchase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do I need to believe in anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tell that the question made him uncomfortable. “Everyone has a belief system, whether he acknowledges it or not.” She sounded far more versed in the subject than she was. Her own had been so clearly defined for her from the time she was a child. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-season-of-angels-angels-everywhere-1/page-17.html","bookId":2625,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:57 PM"}
