Sadly, I didn’t want to fuck him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Toss him back,” the girl next in line interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” I could totally respect not progressing with a relationship lacking sexual heat, but I was still bothered by the situation. I didn’t like seeing Megumi so bummed. “I’m going to go grind against some hot guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hit it, girl,” Lacey said with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took off in search of the stairs to the skywalk. I found them guarded by a bouncer policing the number of bodies allowed to venture up. There was a line and I eyed it with dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I debated how much of a delay I was facing, the bouncer unfolded his powerful arms from across his chest and pressed his earpiece deeper into his ear with one hand, clearly focusing on whatever was being relayed through his receiver. He could have been Samoan or Maori, with dark caramel skin, a shaved head, and massive barrel chest and biceps. He had a baby face and was downright adorable when his fierce scowl was replaced by a wide grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand dropped away from his ear and he crooked a finger at me. “You Eva?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached behind him and unhooked the velvet rope blocking the stairway. “Head on up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA roar of protests came from those who were waiting. I offered an apologetic smile, then raced up the metal stairs as fast as my heels would allow. When I reached the top, a female bouncer let me through and pointed to my left. I saw the corner Gideon had mentioned, where two mirrored walls connected and the skywalk wrapped around it in an L shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI weaved my way through writhing bodies, my pulse rate increasing with every step. The music was less loud up here and the air more humid. Sweat glistened on exposed skin and the elevation lent a sense of danger, even though the glass railing surrounding the skywalk was shoulder-high. I was almost to the mirrored section when I was caught around the waist and pulled back into a man’s rolling hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking over my shoulder, I saw the guy I’d danced with before, the one who’d called me beautiful. I smiled and started dancing, closing my eyes to lose myself in the music. When his hands started to slide over my waist, I caught them, pinning them to my hips with my own. He laughed and dipped his knees, aligning his body with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were three songs out before I felt the ripple of awareness that told me Gideon was nearby. The electrical charge swept over my skin, heightening every sensation. Abruptly the music was louder, the temperature hotter, the sensuality of the club more arousing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and opened my eyes, spotting him arrowing toward me. I was instantly hot for him, my mouth watering as I ate up the sight of him in a dark T-shirt and jeans, his hair pulled back from that breathtaking face. No one seeing him would put him together with Gideon Cross, the international mogul. This guy appeared younger and rougher, distinctive only for his incredible smokin’ hotness. I licked my lips with anticipation, leaning into the guy behind me and rubbing my ass voluptuously into the next roll of his hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon’s hands fisted at his sides, his posture aggressive and predatory. He didn’t slow as he neared me, his body on a collision course with mine. Turning, I met him the last step, surging into him. Our bodies crashed together, my arms encircling his shoulders and my hands pulling his head down so I could take his mouth in a wet, hungry kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a growl, Gideon cupped my ass and yanked me up hard against him, my feet leaving the floor. He bruised my lips with the ferocity of his passion, his tongue filling my mouth with hard, deep plunges that warned me of the violent shades of his lust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy I’d been dancing with came up behind me, his hands in my hair and his lips at my shoulder blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon pulled back, his face a gorgeous mask of fury. “Get lost.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the guy and gave a shrug. “Thanks for the dance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anytime, beautiful.” He caught the hips of a girl walking by and moved away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Angel.” With a growl, Gideon pressed me into the mirror, his hard thigh thrust between my legs. “You’re a bad girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShameless and eager, I rode him, gasping at the feel of denim against my tender sex. “Only for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped my bare buttocks beneath my dress, spurring me on. His teeth caught the shell of my ear, my silver chandelier earrings brushing my neck. He was breathing hard, low rumbles vibrating in his chest. He smelled so good and my body responded, trained to associate his scent with the wildest, hottest of pleasures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe danced, straining together, our bodies moving as if there were no clothes between us. The music pounded around us, through us, and he moved his amazing body to it, captivating me. We’d danced before, ballroom style, but never like this. This sweaty, dirty grinding. I was surprised, turned on, fell even deeper in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon watched me with a hooded gaze, seducing me with his need and his uninhibited moves. I was lost in him, wrapped around him, clawing to get closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kneaded my breast through the thin black jersey of my spaghetti-strapped dress. The built-in shelf bra was no barrier. His fingers stroked, then tugged the hardened point of my nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I moaned, my head fell back against the mirror. Dozens of people surrounded us and I didn’t care. I just needed his hands on me, his body against mine, his breath on my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want me,” he said harshly, “right here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quivered at the thought. “Would you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want them to watch. You want them to see me fuck my cock into your greedy little cunt until you’re dripping in cum. You want me to prove you’re mine.” His teeth sank into the top of my shoulder. “Make you feel it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to prove that you’re mine,” I shot back, shoving my hands into the pockets of his jeans to feel his hard ass flex. “I want everyone to know it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon hitched one arm beneath my rear and lifted me, his other hand slapping flat against a pad on the wall by the mirror. I heard a faint beeping, and then a door opened in the mirror at my back and we stepped into almost total darkness. The concealed entrance closed behind us, muting the music. We were in an office, with a desk, a seating area, and a 180-degree view of the club through two-way mirrors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put me down and spun me, pinning my front to the transparent side of the glass. The club was spread out before me, the dancers on the skywalk only inches away. His hands were up my skirt and in the bodice of my dress, fingers sliding into my cleft and rolling my nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was snared. His big body covered mine, his arms around me, torso to hips, his teeth in my shoulder holding me in place. He owned me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me if it’s too much,” he murmured, his lips drifting up my throat. “Safeword before I scare you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmotion flooded me, gratitude for this man who always—always—thought of me first. “I provoked you. I want to be taken. I want you wild.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re so hot for it,” he purred, pumping two fingers quick and hard into me. “You were made for fucking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Made for you,” I gasped, my breath fogging the glass. I was on fire for him, my desire pouring out from the inside, from the well of love I couldn’t contain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you forget that tonight?” His hand left my sex to reach between us and yank open his fly. “When other men were touching you, rubbing against you? Did you forget you’re mine?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never. I never forget.” My eyes closed as his erection, so stiff and warm, rested heavily against the bare cheek of my ass. He was hot for it, too. Hot for me. “I called you. Wanted you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips moved over my skin, forging a scorching trail to my mouth. “Take me, then, angel,” he coaxed, his tongue touching mine with teasing licks. “Put me inside you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArching my back, I reached between my legs, my hand circling his thickness. He bent his knees, lining himself up for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused, turning my head to press my cheek to his. I loved that I could have this with him … be this way with him. Circling my hips, I stroked my clit with the wide crest of his cock, making him slick with my arousal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon squeezed my swollen breasts, plumping them. “Lean into me, Eva. Push away from the glass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my palm to the two-way mirror, I pushed back, my head pillowed on his shoulder. He wrapped my throat with his hand, gripped my hip, and thrust so hard into me that my feet left the floor. He held me there, suspended in his arms, filled with his cock, his groan cascading over my senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side of the glass, the club raged on. I abandoned myself to the wickedly intense pleasure of seemingly exhibitionist sex, an illicit fantasy that always drove us wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI writhed, unable to bear the decadent pressure. My hand between my legs reached lower, cradled his sac. He was tight and full, so ready. And inside me … “Oh God. You’re so hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was made to fuck you,” he whispered, sending shivers of delight through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do it.” I set both hands on the glass, beyond needy. “Do it now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon lowered me to my feet, his hands steadying me as I bent at the waist, opening myself to him so he could slide deep. A low, keening cry escaped as he seized my hips and angled me, knowing just how to position me to make me fit him. He was too big for me, too long and thick. The stretching was intense. Delicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy core trembled, clenching desperately around him. He made a rough sound of pleasure, pulling out just a little before sliding back slowly. Again, then again. The wide crest of his cock massaging the bundle of nerves deep inside me that only he’d ever reached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingers clawing restlessly, leaving steamy trails on the glass, I moaned. I was achingly aware of the distant throb of the music and the mass of people I saw as clearly as if they were in the room with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it, angel,” he said urgently. “Let me hear how much you like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gideon.” My legs shook violently on a particularly skillful stroke, my weight supported only by the glass and his secure hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was unbearably excited, greedy, feeling both the submission of my pose and the dominance of being serviced. I could do nothing but take what Gideon gave me, the rhythmic slide and retreat, the sounds of his hunger. The scrape of his jeans against my thighs told me he’d pushed them down only far enough to free his cock, a sign of impatience that thrilled me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/entwined-with-you-crossfire-3/page-23.html","bookId":1924,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM"}
