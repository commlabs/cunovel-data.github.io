{"id":9855,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 22.","content":"January1989One cold, overcast day in January 1989, three months beforeLaila turned eleven, she, her parents, and Hasina went towatch one of the last Soviet convoys exit the city. Spectatorshad gathered on both sides of the thoroughfare outside theMilitary Club near Wazir Akbar Khan. They stood in muddysnow and watched the line of tanks, armored trucks, and jeepsas light snow flew across the glare of the passing headlights.\n\u003cbr\u003e There were heckles and jeers. Afghan soldiers kept people offthe street. Every now and then, they had to fire a warningshot.\n\u003cbr\u003e Mammy hoisted a photo of Ahmad and Noor high over herhead. It was the one of them sitting back-to-back under thepear tree. There were others like her, women with pictures oftheirshaheed husbands, sons, brothers held high.\n\u003cbr\u003e Someone tapped Laila and Hasina on the shoulder. It wasTariq.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where did you get that thing?\" Hasina exclaimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I thought I\u0027d come dressed for the occasion.\" Tariq said. Hewas wearing an enormous Russian fur hat, complete withearflaps, which he had pulled down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"How do I look?\"\"Ridiculous,\" Laila laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s the idea.\"\"Your parents came here with you dressed like this?\"\"They\u0027re home, actually,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e The previous fall, Tariq\u0027s uncle in Ghazni had died of a heartattack, and, a few weeks later, Tariq\u0027s father had suffered aheart attack of his own, leaving him frail and tired, prone toanxiety and bouts of depression that overtook him for weeks ata time. Laila was glad to see Tariq like this, like his old selfagain. For weeks after his father\u0027s illness, Laila had watchedhim moping around, heavy-faced and sullen.\n\u003cbr\u003e The three of them stole away while Mammy and Babi stoodwatching the Soviets. From a street vendor, Tariq bought themeach a plate of boiled beans topped with thick cilantro chutney.\n\u003cbr\u003e They ate beneath the awning of a closed rug shop, thenHasina went to find her family.\n\u003cbr\u003e On the bus ride home, Tariq and Laila sat behind herparents. Mammy was by the window, staring out, clutching thepicture against her chest. Beside her, Babi was impassivelylistening to a man who was arguing that the Soviets might beleaving but that they would send weapons to Najibullah inKabul.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s their puppet. They\u0027ll keep the war going through him,you can bet on that.\"Someone in the next aisle voiced his agreement.\n\u003cbr\u003e Mammy was muttering to herself, long-winded prayers thatrolled on and on until she had no breath left and had to ekeout the last few words in a tiny, high-pitched squeak.\n\u003cbr\u003e * * *They \"went to Cinema Park later that day, Laila and Tariq,and had to settle for a Soviet film that was dubbed, tounintentionally comic effect, in Farsi. There was a merchantship, and a first mate in love with the captain\u0027s daughter. Hername was Alyona. Then came a fierce storm, lightning, rain,the heaving sea tossing the ship. One of the frantic sailorsyelled something. An absurdly calm Afghan voice translated:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"My dear sir, would you kindly pass the rope?\"At this, Tariq burst out cackling. And, soon, they both were inthe grips of a hopeless attack of laughter. Just when onebecame fatigued, the other would snort, and off they would goon another round. A man sitting two rows up turned aroundand shushed them.\n\u003cbr\u003e There was a wedding scene near the end. The captain hadrelented and let Alyona marry the first mate. The newlywedswere smiling at each other. Everyone was drinking vodka.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m never getting married,\" Tariq whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Me neither,\" said Laila, but not before a moment of nervoushesitation. She worried that her voice had betrayed herdisappointment at what he had said. Her heart galloping, sheadded, more forcefully this time, \"Never.\"\"Weddings are stupid.\" \"All the fuss.\"\"All the money spent.\" \"For what?\"\"For clothes you\u0027ll never wear again.\"\"Ha!\"\"If I everdo get married,\" Tariq said, \"they\u0027ll have to makeroom for three on the wedding stage. Me, the bride, and theguy holding the gun to my head.\"The man in the front row gave them another admonishinglook.\n\u003cbr\u003e On the screen, Alyona and her new husband locked lips.\n\u003cbr\u003e Watching the kiss, Laila felt strangely conspicuous all at once.\n\u003cbr\u003e She became intensely aware of her heart thumping, of theblood thudding in her ears, of the shape of Tariq beside her,tightening up, becoming still. The kiss dragged on. It seemed ofutmost urgency to Laila, suddenly, that she not stir or make anoise. She sensed that Tariq was observing her-one eye on thekiss, the other on her-as she was observinghim. Was helistening to the air whooshing in and out of her nose, shewondered, waiting for a subtle faltering, a revealing irregularity,that would betray her thoughts?\n\u003cbr\u003e And what would it be like to kiss him, to feel the fuzzy hairabove his lip tickling her own lips?\n\u003cbr\u003e Then Tariq shifted uncomfortably in his seat. In a strainedvoice, he said, \"Did you know that if you fling snot in Siberia,it\u0027s a green icicle before it hits the ground?\"They both laughed, but briefly, nervously, this time. And whenthe film ended and they stepped outside, Laila was relieved tosee that the sky had dimmed, that she wouldn\u0027t have to meetTariq\u0027s eyes in the bright daylight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838/53241.html","bookId":1002,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:38:16 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:38:16 AM"}
