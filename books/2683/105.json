Some of the details are small (the way she would unroll the windows in her mother\u0027s Jaguar when racing back from parties in Connecticut so she could smoke, the horrifying bitchery between agents, books she never read, the grams of coke carried in compacts, the crying jags during shoots that would ruin two hours of carefully applied makeup), but the way she tells them makes her world seem larger. Of course during the modeling phase she was always strung out and brittle and so many friends died, lawsuits were started then abandoned, there were fights with Albert Watson, the ill-fated affair with Peter Morton, how everything fizzled out, her mother\u0027s alcoholism and the brother who died of cardiac arrhythmia linked to the ingestion of herbal Ecstasy tablets, and all of this leading up to the designer who fell in love with her-platonically-and subsequently died of AIDS, leaving Marina a substantial sum of money so she could quit modeling. We both admit we know someone who signed a suicide note with a smiley face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I\u0027m able to look as if I\u0027m concentrating intensely on what she\u0027s saying and in fact some of it\u0027s registering, but really I\u0027ve heard it all before; then, while talking, she moves closer and there\u0027s a quickening and I\u0027m relieved. Silently focusing in on her, I realize that I\u0027ve been activated. I stare into her face for over an hour, asking the appropriate questions, guiding her to certain areas, mimic responses that I\u0027m supposed to have, offer sympathetic nods when they\u0027re required, sometimes there\u0027s a sadness in my eyes that\u0027s half-real, half-not. The only sound, besides her voice, is the sea moving below us, faraway waves lapping against the hull of the ship. I notice idly that there\u0027s no moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sums things up bitterly by saying, \"The life of a model-traveling, meeting a lot of superficial people-it\u0027s all just so-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t let her finish that sentence, because my face is so close to hers-she\u0027s tall, we\u0027re the same height-that I have to lean in and kiss her lips lightly and she pulls back and she\u0027s not surprised and I kiss her lips lightly again and they taste like strawberries from the ice cream and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t. Please, Victor,\" she murmurs. \"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so beautiful,\" I whisper. \"You\u0027re so beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, not... now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull back and stretch, pretending nothing happened, but finally I can\u0027t help saying \"I want to come to Paris with you\" and she pretends not to hear me, folding her arms as she Icans against the railing with a sad, placid expression that just makes her face seem dreamier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, let\u0027s go dancing,\" I suggest, then check the watch I\u0027m not wearing and casually pretend I was just inspecting a nonexistent freckle on my wrist. \"We can go to the Yacht Club disco. I\u0027m a good dancer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you\u0027d like the Yacht Club,\" she says. \"Unless you\u0027d like to dance to the disco version of \u0027Don\u0027t Cry for Me, Argentina\u0027 for hours on end. There\u0027s a DJ named Jamtastica too.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-105.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
