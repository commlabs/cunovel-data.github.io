Cade, the trainer from Equinox, is here - I forgot that I had made the call - and now that I understand what his connection to Julian really is I\u0027m embarrassed Cade thinks I\u0027m clueless enough not to know, and I\u0027m standing next to one of Jason\u0027s assistants and drinking vodka from a plastic cup and the boy playing Kevin Spacey\u0027s son keeps asking me questions about his character that I answer in a monotone and he responds by pointing out an owl that\u0027s nesting in the palm tree and then I see the actress - she\u0027s a girl, really - that I hit on in the first-class lounge at JFK before Christmas, maybe a month ago, and Amanda Flew is so much younger than I remember and whenever she glances over at me she smiles nervously at the boy she\u0027s talking to and sometimes the boy whispers in her ear and another boy lights her cigarettes and I\u0027m now aware that I\u0027ve drunk too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know that girl?\" I ask the assistant. \"Amanda Flew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" the assistant says. \"Do you know her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I say. \"I f**ked her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a beat but when I look over at him he says, \"Cool.\" He shrugs but he\u0027s creeped out. \"She\u0027s hot. She\u0027s slammin\u0027.\" Another pause. \"I guess she likes older guys, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I guess.\" I shrug too, and then ask, \"Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought she was one of Rip Millar\u0027s girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m watching as Amanda gets a text, glances at it and then makes a call. She barely says anything, just listens, and then clicks off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His girls?\" I\u0027m asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" the assistant says and then noting my reaction in just those two words, adds, \"I mean, it\u0027s not like a secret or anything.
