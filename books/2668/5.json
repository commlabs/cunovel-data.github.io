The black mush of stewed rose petals covered her hands and arms and spotted an old gown. The air was heavy with the scent of the flowers, nearly as smothering as the weight that settled over her when she realized he\u0027d come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, at the same time, a rush of something else flooded her when she looked up into his grave face. \u0027Twas almost welcome, seeing him again, feeling the command of his full strength as she had not when he was ill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady Madelyne. You do not seem surprised to see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat he used her title did not surprise her. Verily he\u0027d discovered her identity and that was the reason he\u0027d come. For a brief moment, panic surged through her, but she beat it back and wrapped her own strength about her. God would be with her, and...God help her, but she did not believe Lord Mal Verne would hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, I am not. What do you wish from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, looking down at her, his shadow casting darkness over her work. \"What do you do there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne held up two small wooden paddles, grateful for a moment\u0027s reprieve before he should respond, and replied, \"The rose petals have been cooked for days. Now, I take them betwixt these spoons and roll them into beads. See there.\" She pointed to a length of linen spread in the sun, dotted with perfect, round beads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her surprise, he reached into a leather pouch that hung from his tunic and pulled out the prayer beads she\u0027d left with him before. \"You\u0027ve become more skilled in these last years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was surprised again when he hunkered down to sit next to her on the log bench. Now, his face was nearly on level with hers, and his nearness even more overpowering. Strength, warmth, intensity vibrated from his person-yet his eyes and his countenance remained cold and bleak. Madelyne had the sudden urge, so odd at this moment when he threatened her peace and well-being, to touch his face, to learn whether it was as unyielding as it appeared. She curled her fingers into themselves and willed her foolishness not to betray her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you trick me? Why did you not allow us to leave with some dignity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed. \u0027Twas no surprise that a man of his power should be angered at such deceit. Using one of the flat spoons, she scooped up a small portion of the black stew and began to roll it into the shape of a ball as she chose her words to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin watched how her fine hands manipulated the paddles, noticing again the three freckles that decorated one narrow wrist. Her head was bent, and the edge of its veil obstructed much of the expression on her face, though he could see the length of long, thick lashes as she blinked. She had shown no surprise at his presence, nor mistrust, he thought. How could that be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We sought only to protect ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words, when they came, were as even and calm as the rhythm of her breathing. She looked at him, and he saw nothing but the gray depths of her eyes, clear and without deceit, without fear. For a fleeting moment, he wondered when last a woman had looked upon him without fear...and with such guilelessness. She had naught to hide, it seemed...but he knew that could not be so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive us for acting in such a manner,\" she continued, \"but, my lord, we did what we thought best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You removed us from the abbey so that we couldn\u0027t find our way here again, yet you aren\u0027t disturbed at my presence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, and he could see the faintest movement of her lips as they tightened in the first indication of uneasiness. \"\u0027Tis true, I wish that you hadn\u0027t found your way back to the abbey...but now you are here, and there is naught I can do. Your presence portends little good for me, but I prithee...do you not hurt my sisters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean harm to none here at Lock Rose Abbey,\" Gavin replied. \"I merely come in the king\u0027s name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The king? What has he to do with those of us here?\" Confusion passed over her face, and she allowed the black-stained paddles to drop into the stew pot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His royal majesty, King Henry, demands the presence of Madelyne de Belgrume at his court.\" His words were more formal than necessary, and he spoke them distinctly and with a hint of threat to be certain she understood the gravity of the situation. \"I have been appointed to bring you to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remained silent, and Gavin waited impatiently for her outraged response. When she said nothing, he prodded her. \"You do not deny that you are Madelyne de Belgrume, daughter of Fantin de Belgrume, Lord of Tricourten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay.\" The breath she expelled was silent, but of such force that he felt its warmth on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you know you must come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin was caught by the clear steadiness of her eyes, and then they were shuttered as she lowered her lids. She took away the cloth that had rested on her lap, protecting her gown, and set it on the ground. There seemed to be little more to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMade a bit uncertain by the ease of her acquiescence, Gavin rose to his feet and extended a hand to assist her to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne reached for it, then stopped, and, dropping her hand back to her side, pulled to her own feet. \"I do not wish to stain you,\" she explained, spreading her blackened hands. \"I will be thus for many days before it fades. Now, I must speak with Mother Bertilde. She does know that you have arrived?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin nodded, again struck by her clear practicality in what must be a moment of upheaval. \"Aye. However, we must leave before matins, so do you not delay. I\u0027ll not be tricked again, and I\u0027ll not be held longer than need be.\" The annoyance he\u0027d felt at being deceived by a bunch of women surged within him, and he looked at her sharply. \"No tricks, Madelyne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, my lord,\" she responded. \"It is past the time of tricks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne closed the door to her cell and leaned her full weight against it, covering her mouth with two shaking hands. She knew naught could keep the reality of Gavin of Mal Verne at bay, but she hadn\u0027t the strength to hold herself upright any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God, she had known...had known he would come...had known deep in the most secret part of herself that her peace would be destroyed by this man. And, God\u0027s Truth, she had prayed for it-prayed to see him again, prayed that he would find his way back to the abbey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had she done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe choked on a sob and swallowed hard, hearing the grating sound of her dry throat in the dense silence. All in the abbey knew of his arrival, and knew the purpose of it. A hush of anxiety had fallen like a fog that smothered those within its walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, she must collect all of her strength and will and protect them all-most especially protect her mother. She must go willingly with him, she must find a way to keep him from learning of Anne\u0027s existence. The memory haunted her: of those days at Tricourten, of her mother\u0027s face, lined with worry and pain, with dark circles curving under her eyes and purple marks on her face and arms, and scars on her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne could never allow Anne to go back to Fantin, to that life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft knocking at the door drew Madelyne\u0027s scattered, panicked thoughts under control and she thrust herself away from it. Turning to gather her few belongings, desperate to keep her fears hidden, she called, \"Enter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened, but she did not turn from her trunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madelyne!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her surprise, it was Sister Patricka-not Mal Verne-who came into the small room. Before Madelyne could react, the other woman flew toward her, gathering her into her arms in a fierce embrace. \"The Mother has told me you are to go with the men. I am going with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne pulled away to look into her friend\u0027s round, cherubic face. No fear or reluctance showed there, only earnestness and mayhaps a bit of apprehension. \"You are to go with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye. There is no reason that I should stay here any longer-and I could not let you go alone. I have long realized I cannot take the final step and say my last vows. \u0027Tis not God\u0027s will. So I shall go as your tiring woman. If you\u0027ll have me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief flooded through Madelyne, and she hugged her again, huddling her face into Patricka\u0027s shoulder. \"Aye, Tricky, I would have you-if you are certain you wish to make that sacrifice. Only if you are certain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatricka nodded with such vigor that her wimple slipped to one side. \"Aye, and an honor it would be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne gripped her soft fingers, realizing that Patricka did not know how she and Anne had come to Lock Rose Abbey. \"I cannot promise what will happen...there are many things you do not know, and that I cannot tell you at this time. But I vow that I\u0027ll keep you from harm ere I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no fear of that, Maddie. The Mother did warn me that all was not as it seems. I place myself in your hands-and in God\u0027s. \u0027Tis my belief that I can do you more good at your side than here, clutching prayer beads in the chapel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne gave a weak laugh. Tricky had a way of speaking that reduced complicated situations to such simple ones. \"Thank you, my friend. Now, we must gather our things, for Lord Mal Verne does not intend to be kept waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she had collected those few items she intended to take with her, Madelyne gave one last sweep of the small room with her gaze. Would she ever see this cell again, kneel at the worn prie dieu, sleep on the feather-stuffed bed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquaring her shoulders, she pulled the bag made of loose cloth that held her few personal belongings. She adjusted her veil and smoothed her skirt, uncertain how she looked-for there was no mirror in her cell-and left the room for the last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, in the bailey, the rest of the sisters had gathered to bid her farewell. Lord Mal Verne and his men-at-arms stood a discreet distance away, and \u0027though he watched her steadily, he did not speak as she and Patricka embraced their friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Anne did not appear, and for this, Madelyne was grateful. She had said a brief farewell to her mother after speaking with Bertilde, and that leave-taking had been fraught with tears and sobs. They could not risk the chance that Anne would be seen or recognized by the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, the last arms to hold her, and the last face to be kissed, was that of Mother Bertilde. She pulled Madelyne tightly to her and whispered, \"God be with you, my child. Our prayers follow you wherever you go. May you have the strength and peace to accept that which is your future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne\u0027s face was wet with tears when at last she began to walk across the bailey to join Mal Verne and his men. Tricky followed, leaving a sea of red-eyed women behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe approached Mal Verne, who continued to watch with stony eyes, and whose gaze flickered to Patricka as they walked closer. \"I am ready to accompany you now, my lord. This is Patricka, my maid, who will accompany me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA twinge of satisfaction settled over her when she saw the disconcertion in his eyes. \"Your maid? Nuns do not have maids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patricka is my maid, and she does accompany me whither I go. I trust that you will be able to accommodate one extra female.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth tightened ever so slightly-just enough for her to see that she had irked him with her cool response-and he turned abruptly, calling to one of his men. \"Clem, the maid will ride with you.\" He started toward the small herd of mounts gathered near the stable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne took that as a silent command to follow him, and she gathered up the hem of her gown to do so. Some of the men were mounted, and others stood in a small cluster, holding the reins of whuffling, stamping destriers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sight of the huge warhorses, Madelyne\u0027s bravery deserted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mounts stood many hands taller than she, with large heads and round eyes and huge, snorting noses. The hooves that fidgeted in the dirt or stamped in impatience were bigger than her face, and looked powerful enough to flatten a heavy oaken door with one thrust. Madelyne froze, unable to make herself move closer to the fierce creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal Verne turned when he reached one of the larger, more spirited stallions, and frowned when he saw her standing aback. \"Come, my lady,\" he bid her impatiently as he struggled to calm the vigorous horse. \"You ride with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne\u0027s throat dried, and she didn\u0027t know if \u0027twas more from fear of getting close enough to the ferocious creature to sit upon it, or that she would be in such proximity to Mal Verne. It took every ounce of will to force to take a step forward, and then another, before the destrier reared slightly. His hooves slammed into the ground with a hollow sound, and Madelyne jerked backward, hand clutching at her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What ails you, lady?\" Annoyance strained Mal Verne\u0027s voice as he gave off the reins to one of his companions and started toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...do not ride, my lord,\" she managed to say steadily as he approached her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not think that you did,\" he said dismissively, continuing to look at her as if she were daft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne felt the necessity to explain further. \"I...do not like horses,\" she managed to say just before he wrapped one powerful arm around her waist, lifting her easily into the air. A faint shriek emitted from her mouth, surprising her before she pulled herself under control. \"There is no need-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words were stopped as he set her none-too-gently on the back of the dancing stallion. Before she could gather her bearings, she felt him leap into the saddle behind her. Suddenly, a long, firm thigh slid along her legs, which rested over one side of the saddle, and two hard arms enclosed her on either side. Madelyne fought to control a whimper of nervousness as the horse responded to the command of Mal Verne\u0027s legs, nearly leaping forward in its impatience to be off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the destrier stepped eagerly into a fast trot, Madelyne was jostled backward by the momentum, back against the hard wall of man. Her breath caught in her throat as she became aware that she was completely enclosed by Gavin of Mal Verne, completely in his arms and completely in his power...and they rode from the gates of Lock Rose Abbey. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sanctuary-of-roses-medieval-herb-garden-2/page-5.html","bookId":2668,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:57 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:57 AM"}
