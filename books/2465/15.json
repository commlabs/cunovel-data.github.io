He\u0027s been acting so strangely lately!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart and Nadine exchanged glances over Rose\u0027s head. Nadine opened her mouth to speak but her mate\u0027s expression caused her to close it again. Now was not the time for explanations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose.\" Celluci came out of the office and walked quickly across the kitchen, until he could gaze directly into the girl\u0027s face. \"This is important. Besides the family, Vicki, Mr. Fitzroy, and myself, who did Peter talk with today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knows something, Henry thought. I should never have let him take that call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose frowned. \"Well, he talked to the mechanic at the garage, Dr. Dixon, Dr. Levin - the one who took over from Dr. Dixon, she was at his house for a while - um, Mrs. Von Thome, next door to Dr. Dixon, and somebody driving by up on the road, but I didn\u0027t see who.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see the car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. It was black, mostly, with gold trim and fake gold spokes on the wheels.\" Her nose wrinkled. \"A real poser\u0027s car.\" Then her expression changed again as she read Celluci\u0027s reaction. \"That\u0027s the one you were waiting for, wasn\u0027t it? Wasn\u0027t it?\" She stepped toward him, teeth bared. \"Where\u0027s Peter? What\u0027s happened to my brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" Stuart said flatly, coming around from behind his niece, \"you\u0027d better tell us what you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Henry had some idea of the conflict Celluci was going through and he had no sympathy for it. The question of law versus justice could have only one answer. He watched the muscles on Celluci\u0027s back tense and heard his heartbeat quicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything in Celluci\u0027s training said he leave them with an ambiguous answer and take care of this himself. If werewolves expected to be treated like the rest of society, within the law, then they couldn\u0027t act outside the law. And if the only way he could do his duty was to fight his way out of this house... his hands curled into fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low growl began to build in Stuart\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Rose\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Nadine\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry stepped forward. He\u0027d had enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Daniel began to whimper. He threw himself on his mother\u0027s legs and buried his face in her skirt. \"Peter\u0027s gonna get killed!\" The fabric did little to muffle the howl of a six-year-old child who only understood one small part of what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci looked down at Daniel, who seemed to have an uncanny knack for bringing the focus back to the important matters, then over at Rose. \"Can\u0027t you let me take care of this?\" he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, panic beginning to build. \"You don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t understand,\" Nadine added, clutching at Daniel so tightly he squirmed in her grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci saw the pain in the older woman\u0027s eyes, pain that cut and twisted and would continue far longer than anyone should be forced to endure. His decision might possibly keep that pain from Rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carl Biehn was an Olympic marksman. His nephew, Mark Williams, drives a black and gold jeep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose\u0027s eyes widened. \"If he was talking to Peter this afternoon... \" She whirled, her sundress hit the floor, and Cloud streaked out of the kitchen and into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose, no!\" Unencumbered by the need to change, Henry raced after her before Stuart, still caught in challenge with Celluci, began to react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus Christ! Nobody moves that fast! Celluci grabbed Stuart\u0027s arm as Henry disappeared into the night. \"Wait!\" he barked. \"I need you to show me the way to Carl Biehn\u0027s farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go, human!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, Stuart, the man\u0027s got guns. He\u0027s taken Henry out once already! Charging in will only get everyone shot. We can get there before them in my car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t count on it.\" Stuart laughed but the sound held no humor. \"And this is our hunt. You have no right to be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take him, Stuart!\" Nadine\u0027s tone left no room for her mate to argue. \"Think of after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male wer snarled but after an instant he yanked his arm free of Celluci\u0027s hold and started for the door. \"Come on, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter? Celluci wondered as the two of them charged across the lawn. Mary, Mother of God, they want me there to explain the body...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is taking him so long!\" Vicki shoved at her glasses and turned away from the living room window. With the sun down she could see nothing past her reflection on the glass but that didn\u0027t stop her from pacing the length of the room and back then peering out into the darkness again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has to come all the way from Adelaide and Dundas,\" Bertie pointed out. \"It\u0027s going to take him a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that!\" She sighed and took a deep breath. \"I\u0027m sorry. I had no right to snap at you. It\u0027s just that... well, if it wasn\u0027t for my damned eyes, I\u0027d be driving myself. I\u0027d be halfway there by now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBertie pursed her lips and looked thoughtful. \"You don\u0027t trust your partner to deal with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celluci\u0027s not a partner, he\u0027s a friend. I don\u0027t have a partner. Exactly.\" And although Henry could be counted on to keep Celluci from doing anything stupid, who would save Peter, or watch the wer, or grab the murdering bastard - Vicki always saw him with Mark Williams\u0027 face, convinced that he had been the reason for the deaths even if he hadn\u0027t pulled the trigger - and... and then what? \"I have to be there! How can I know it\u0027s justice if I\u0027m not there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealizing that some questions weren\u0027t meant to be answered, Bertie wisely kept silent. Questions of her own would have to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, I told him it was an emergency!\" Vicki whirled back to the window and squinted into the night. \"Where is he?\" With an hour left in the shift, and Colin already back in the station, it hadn\u0027t been hard for Vicki to convince the duty sergeant to release him for a family emergency. \"Why the... There!\" Headlights turned up the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki snatched up her bag and ran for the door, shouting back over her shoulder, \"Don\u0027t talk about this to anyone. I\u0027ll be in touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, and effectively blind, she aimed for the headlights and narrowly missed being run down by one of London\u0027s old blue and white police cars. She grabbed for the rear door as it screeched to a stop and threw herself into the back seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry slammed the car into reverse and laid rubber back down the length of the driveway while Colin twisted around and snarled, \"What the hell is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki pushed her glasses back into place and clutched at the seat as the car took a corner on two wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carl Biehn was an Olympic marksman by way of Korea and the marines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That grasseater?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He may be,\" Vicki snapped, \"but his nephew... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was charged with fraud in \u002786, possession of stolen goods in \u002788, and accessory to murder nine months ago,\" Barry broke in. \"No convictions. Got off on a technicality all three times. I ran him this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the emergency,\" Colin growled, teeth bared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter\u0027s missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrasses and weeds whipped at his legs; trees flickered past in the periphery of his sight, unreal shadow images barely seen before they were gone; the barrier of a fence became no barrier at all as he vaulted the wire net and landed still running. Henry had always known that the wer were capable of incredible bursts of speed but he never knew how fast until that night. Making no effort to elude him, Cloud merely raced toward her twin, not far ahead but far enough that he feared he could never catch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her moonlight-silvered shape remaining so horribly just out of reach, Henry would have traded his immortal life for the ability to shapechange given to his kind by tradition. All else being equal, four legs were faster and more sure than two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll else, therefore, could not be equal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t run like this in many years, and he threw all he was into the effort to close the gap. This was a race he had to win, for if one couldn\u0027t be saved, the other had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpraying dirt and gravel in a great fan-shaped tail, Celluci fought the car through the turn at the end of the lane without losing speed. The suspension bottomed out as they drove into and out of a massive pothole and the oil pan shrieked a protest as it dragged across a protruding rock. The constant machine gun staccato of stones thrown up against the undercarriage of the car made conversation impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart kept up a continuous deep-throated growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver it all, Celluci kept hearing the voice of memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re willing to be judge and jury - who\u0027s to be the executioner? Or are you going to do that, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe very much feared he was about to get his answer and he prayed Vicki would arrive too late to be a part of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Cloud reached the open door of the barn, Henry ran right at her tail. Another step, maybe two and he could stop her, just barely in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Cloud caught the scent of her twin and, snarling, sprang forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs her feet left the packed dirt, Henry saw with horror where she\u0027d land. Saw the false floor. Saw the steel jaws beneath. With all he had left, he threw himself at her in a desperate flying tackle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew as he grabbed her that it wasn\u0027t going to be quite enough so he twisted and shielded the struggling wer with his body as they hit the floor and rolled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo traps sprang shut, one closing impotently on a few silver-white hairs, the other cheated entirely of a prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the floor, Henry took in a kaleidoscope of images - the russet body lying motionless on the table, the mortal standing over it, covered neck to knees with a canvas apron, the slender knife gleaming dully in the lamplight - and by the time he rose to a crouch, one arm still holding the panting Cloud, he knew. Anger, red and hot, surged through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Cloud squirmed free and attacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the second time that night Mark Williams looked death in the face; only this time, he knew it wouldn\u0027t pause. He screamed and fell back against the table, felt hot breath against his throat and the kiss of one ivory fang then suddenly, nothing. Self preservation took over and without stopping to think, he grabbed for the shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry fought with Cloud, fought with his own blood lust. She\u0027s a seventeen-year-old girl, barely more than a child. She must not be allowed to kill. The wer no longer lived apart from humans and their values. What point victory now if she spent the rest of her life with that kind of a stain on her soul? Over and over, as she tried to tear herself out of his grip, he said the only words he knew would get through to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s still alive, Cloud. Storm is still alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she stilled, whimpered once, then turned toward the table, muzzle raised to catch her brother\u0027s scent. A second whimper turned to a howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her attention now fixed on Storm rather than death, Henry stood. \"Stay where you are,\" he commanded and Cloud dropped to the floor, trembling with the need to get to her twin but unable to disobey. As he lifted his head, he came face-to-face with both barrels of the shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, he\u0027s still alive, is he?\" Both the gun and the laugh were shaky. \"I couldn\u0027t feel a heartbeat. You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry could hear the slow and labored beating of Storm\u0027s heart, could feel the blood struggling to keep moving through passages constricted by poison. He allowed his own blood lust to rise. \"I know life,\" he said, stepping forward. \"And I know death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" Mark wet his lips. \"And I know Bo Jackson. Hold it right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry smiled. \"No.\" Vampire. Prince of Darkness. Child of the Night. It all showed in Henry\u0027s smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe table against his back made retreat impossible; Mark had no choice but to stand fast. Sweat beaded on his forehead and dribbled down the side of his nose. This was the demon he\u0027d shot in the forest. Man-shaped but nothing manlike in its expression. \"I - I don\u0027t know what you are,\" he stammered, forcing his trembling fingers to maintain their grip on the gun, \"but I know you can be hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more step would move the barrel of the weapon around enough so that Cloud would be out of the line of fire. One more step, Henry told himself fueling the hunger with rage, and this thing is mine. He raised his foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barn door slammed back, crashing against the wall and breaking the tableau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop it!\" Celluci commanded from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart snarled a counterpoint beside him, the effort of will it took to hold his attack while Cloud remained in danger sending tremors rippling across the muscles of his back. Her howl had yanked him from the car before it had quite stopped and pulled him unthinking into the barn in human form where the clothes he wore confined his shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shotgun barrel dipped then rose again. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is going on out here?\" Carl Biehn demanded, rifle covering the two men standing in the open doorway. He\u0027d heard the car race down the driveway; heard it stop, spraying gravel; heard the howl and known that Satan\u0027s creatures were involved. It had taken him only a moment to snatch up his rifle and he\u0027d arrived at the barn just behind the men from the car. He still didn\u0027t know what was going on, but his nephew needed his help, that much was obvious. \"Put the safety on and toss your revolver to the ground.\" He gestured with the rifle. \"Over there, away from everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeeth gritted, Celluci did as he was told. He couldn\u0027t see as he had an option. The snap of steel jaws closing as the gun hit the floor startled everyone about equally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Traps,\" Stuart said, pointing. \"There and there.\" The dirt floor just beyond his bare foot had been disturbed. \"And here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark smiled. \"Pity you don\u0027t take longer strides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now move over there,\" Carl commanded, \"by the others so I can get a... \" As they picked their way between the traps and into the lamplight, he recognized Stuart and his eyes narrowed. All day he had prayed for an answer to his doubts and now the Lord delivered the leader of the ungodly into his hands. Then he saw Cloud, still crouched behind Henry, ignoring everything but the body on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw Storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered the rifle from his shoulder to his hip, holding it balanced by the pistol grip, finger still resting on the trigger. Keeping the muzzle carefully pointed toward the group of intruders now clustered together at one side of the barn, he moved to stand beside the table. \"What,\" he repeated, \"is going on here? How did this creature die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not dead!\" Rose threw herself into Stuart\u0027s arms. \"He\u0027s not dead, Uncle Stuart! He\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Rose. And we\u0027ll save him.\" He stroked her hair, glaring at the younger human who stared at her as though he\u0027d never seen skin before. She needed comfort but, if they were to save themselves and Storm, too, better she have the use of tooth and claw. Silently he cursed the clothing that held him to human form. \"Change now,\" he told her. \"Watch. Be ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop that!\" The rifle swung from Stuart to Cloud and back again. \"You will do no more devil\u0027s tricks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloud whined but Stuart buried his hand in the thick fur behind her head and said quietly, \"Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl swallowed hard. The pain in the creature\u0027s eyes as it, no, she, gazed up at him added itself to the cry of the creature he had wounded and the weight of doubt settled heavier around his heart. The work of the Lord should not bring pain. He turned and gazed down at Storm with horrified fascination. \"I asked you a question, nephew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark put a little more distance between himself and Henry before he answered - coincidentally moving himself closer to the door, just in case - fighting the silent command that called him to look at me. \"I assume,\" he said with a forced grin, \"that as we\u0027ve been assured my guest isn\u0027t dead you want to know, how did you put it, \u0027What the hell is going on here?\u0027 It\u0027s simple, really. I decided to combine your policy of holy extermination with a profit-making plan of my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not find profit in doing the Lord\u0027s work!\" Suddenly unsure of so many other things, this belief, at least, Carl held to firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit! You reap your rewards in heaven, I want mine... Hold it right there!\" He gestured with the shotgun and Henry froze. \"I don\u0027t know what you are, but I\u0027m pretty damned sure both barrels at this range will blow you to hell and gone and I\u0027d be more than willing to prove it.\" White showed all around his eyes and he was breathing heavily, sweat burning in the scratches on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci glanced at Henry\u0027s profile and wondered what the other man could see that had him so terrified. He wondered, but he really didn\u0027t want to know. In his opinion their best chance lay with Carl Biehn, who looked confused and somehow, in spite of his unquestionable ability with the rifle, fragile and old. \"This has gone too far,\" he said calmly, making his voice the voice of reason, laying it over the tension like a balm. \"Whatever you thought when you started this, things have changed. It\u0027s up to you to end it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" Mark snapped. \"We don\u0027t need your two cents worth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl lifted his hand from where it lay almost in benediction on Storm\u0027s head and took a firmer grip on the rifle. \"And what do you plan to do now?\" he asked pointedly, desperation tinting his voice, the question echoing prayers that had remained unanswered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said yourself the devil\u0027s creatures must die. That one,\" Mark nodded at Storm, \"has been taken care of. This one,\" Cloud whined again and pressed close to Stuart\u0027s legs, \"I could use as well. Pity we can\u0027t get the big one to change before he dies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart snarled and tensed to spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Henry\u0027s command snapped Stuart back on his heels, furious and impotent. With both weapons pointing at them from different angles, an attack, whether it succeeded or not, would be fatal to at least one of their company. There had to be another way and they had to find it quickly for although Storm\u0027s heart still fought to survive, Henry could hear how much it had weakened, how tenuously it clung to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keep your goddamned mouth shut,\" Mark suggested. His hands were sweating around the shotgun but even with his uncle covering their \"guests\" he dared not wipe his palms. He was well aware that the moment the shooting started and it no longer had anything to lose that creature would charge. This had to be carefully choreographed so that he and his pelts came out in one piece. And if he couldn\u0027t bring Uncle Carl around... Poor old man, he wasn\u0027t entirely sane, you know. \"All right, the lot of you, turn around and line up facing that wall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Mark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that I can cover them and you can send them back to hell where they belong.\" With a sudden flash of inspiration, he added, \"God\u0027s will be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl\u0027s head came up. \"God\u0027s will be done.\" It was not for him to question the will of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Biehn.\" Celluci wet his lips. Time to lay all the cards on the table. \"I\u0027m a Detective-Sergeant with the Metropolitan Toronto Police Department. My badge is in the front left-hand pocket of my pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re with the police?\" The rifle barrel dipped toward the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s consorting with Satan\u0027s creatures!\" Mark snapped. The cop would die by a rifle bullet. Poor Uncle Carl...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rifle barrel came up. \"The police are not immune to the temptations of the devil.\" He peered at Celluci. \"Have you been saved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Biehn, I\u0027m a practicing Catholic, and I will recite for you the\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0027Lord\u0027s Prayer,\u0027 the\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0027Apostles Creed,\u0027 and three \u0027Hail Marys,\u0027 if you like.\" Celluci\u0027s voice grew gentle, the voice of a man who could be trusted. \"I understand why you\u0027ve been shooting these people. I really do. But hasn\u0027t it occurred to you that God has plans you\u0027re not aware of and maybe, just maybe, you\u0027re wrong?\" As they were still alive, it had obviously occurred to him; Celluci attempted to make the most of it. \"Why don\u0027t you put down that gun, and we\u0027ll talk, you and I, see if we can\u0027t find a way out of this mess.\" And then, up out of the depths of childhood when his tiny, black-clad grandmother had made him learn a Bible verse every Sunday, he added, \" \u0027For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"St. Luke, chapter twelve, verse two.\" Carl shuddered and Mark saw that he was losing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even the devil quotes scripture, Uncle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if he is not the devil, what then?\" A muscle jumped in the old man\u0027s cheek. \"Would you murder an officer of the law?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man\u0027s law, Uncle, not God\u0027s law!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer my question!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, answer him, Mark. Would you commit murder? Break a commandment?\" Now, Celluci used his voice like a chisel, hoping to expose the rotten core. \"Thou shalt not kill. What about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark had escaped death twice already this night. From the moment he\u0027d recognized the creature that had attacked him in the woods, he\u0027d known that escaping death a third time would take more than luck. In order for him to live, everyone in the barn would have to die. And he was going to live. This goddamned bastard of a fucking cop was manipulating the one thing he needed to pull his ass out of the fire and still be able to make a profit. The old man as a live stooge was preferable to the old man as a dead excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle Carl... \" Stress the relationship. Remind him of where the blood ties lay, of family loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are not God\u0027s creatures. You said so yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl looked down at Cloud and shuddered. \"They are not God\u0027s creatures.\" Then he raised his tormented eyes to Celluci\u0027s face. \"But what of him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Condemned by his own actions. Willingly consorting with Satan\u0027s minions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if he is a police officer, the law... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, Uncle Carl.\" Mark didn\u0027t bother to hide the sudden rush of relief. If the old man was concerned about repercussions, then he\u0027d already decided to take action. It was in the bag. \"I can make the whole thing look like an accident. Just be careful when you kill the white wolf - dog, whatever - that you don\u0027t ruin the pelt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a little too late, he realized he\u0027d said the wrong thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man shuddered and then straightened, as though he were shouldering a terrible weight. \"So much I\u0027m unsure of, but this I know; whatever happens tonight will be for the grace of God. You will not profit from it.\" He swung the rifle around until it pointed at Mark. \"Put down the gun and get over there with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark opened his mouth and closed it, but no sound came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\" Celluci asked, voice and expression carefully neutral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But he isn\u0027t going to be a part of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t do this to me.\" Mark found his tongue. \"I\u0027m family. Your own flesh and blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put down the gun and go over there with them.\" Carl knew now where he\u0027d made his mistake, where he\u0027d left the path the Lord had shown him. The burden was his to bear alone, he should never have shared it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Mark shot a horrified glance at Henry, whose expression invited him to come as close as he liked. \"I can\u0027t... I won\u0027t... you can\u0027t make me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl gestured with the rifle. \"I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark saw the death he\u0027d been holding off approaching as Henry\u0027s smile broadened. \"NO!\" He swung the shotgun around at the one who drove him to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl Biehn saw the muzzle come around and prepared to die. He couldn\u0027t, not even to save himself, shoot his only sister\u0027s only son. Into your hands, I commend my spir...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloud reacted without thinking and flung herself through the air. Her front paws hit the middle of the old man\u0027s chest and the shot sprayed harmlessly over the east wall as the two of them hit the ground together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Henry moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne moment, almost ten feet between them. The next, Henry ripped the shotgun out of Mark\u0027s grasp and threw it with such force it broke through the wall of the barn. His fingers closed around the mortal\u0027s throat and tightened, blood welling around his fingertips where his nails pierced the skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Celluci charged forward. \"You can\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to,\" Henry said quietly. And he backed his burden up; one step, two. The trap snapped closed and Henry released his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arm that stopped Celluci was an impassable barrier. He couldn\u0027t move it. He couldn\u0027t get around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a moment for the pain to penetrate through the terror. With both hands at his throat, Mark pulled his eyes from Henry\u0027s face and looked down. Soft leather deck shoes had done little to protect against the steel bite; his blood welled up thick and red. He cried out, a hoarse, strangled sound, and dropped to his knees, pushing at the hinge with nerveless fingers. Then the convulsions started. Three minutes later, he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry dropped his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Celluci looked from the body to Henry and said, through a mouth dry with fear. \"You aren\u0027t human, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly, no.\" The two men stared at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to kill me, too?\" Celluci asked at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry shook his head and smiled. It wasn\u0027t the smile Mark Williams took with him into death. It was the smile of a man who had survived for four hundred and fifty years by knowing when he could turn his back. He did so now, joining Cloud and Stuart beside Storm\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what? Celluci wondered. Do I just go away and forget all this happened? Do I deal with the body? What? Technically, he\u0027d just been a witness to a murder. \"Hang on, if Storm\u0027s still alive, maybe... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve seen enough death to recognize it, Detective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFitzroy was right. He had seen enough death to know he saw it sprawled at his feet on the dirt floor; not even the flickering lamplight could hide it. \"But why so quickly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He,\" Stuart snarled, \"was only human.\" The last word sounded like a curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus H. Christ, what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci whirled around, hands curling into fists, even though - or perhaps because - he recognized the voice. \"What the hell are you doing here? You\u0027re stone blind in the dark!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin pushed past her, into the barn, desperate to get to his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry moved to follow. One step, two, and the floor shifted under his foot. He felt the impact of steel teeth slamming into a leather police boot all the way up his leg. \"Colin!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin stopped and half turned back toward his partner, caught in the beam of the flashlight Vicki had pulled from her purse, his face twisted with the need to be in two places at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki couldn\u0027t make him choose. \"Go,\" she commanded. \"I\u0027ll take care of Barry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropping carefully to one knee, Vicki trained the light on Barry\u0027s foot. The muscles of his leg trembled where they rested against her shoulder. Tucking the flashlight securely under her chin, she studied the construction of the steel jaws. \"Can you tell if it\u0027s gone through the boot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him swallow. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I don\u0027t think it has, but I\u0027ll have to get it off to be sure.\" Her fingers had barely touched the metal before Celluci slapped them aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poisoned,\" he said before she could protest, and slipped a rusty iron bar in at the hinge. \"Hold his leg steady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth sole and reinforced toe had taken a beating but had held. Barry sagged against Vicki\u0027s arm, relief finally allowing a reaction. I could have died, he thought and swallowed hard. The heat had little to do with the sweat that plastered his shirt to his back. I could have died. His foot hurt. It didn\u0027t seem to matter. I could have died. He took a deep breath. But I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Vicki asked, playing the circular definition of her vision over his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, straightened, and took a step. Then another slightly less shaky one back to her side. \"Yeah. I\u0027m okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki smiled at him and swept the flashlight beam over the interior of the barn. There was a body on the floor. Carl Biehn sat on a barrel of some kind looking stunned. Everyone else - Colin, Cloud, Henry, Stuart - was with Storm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Storm... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s alive,\" Celluci told her. \"Apparently Williams caught him in another one of those traps. Which are buried all over this place so walk only where I tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Williams?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is dead.\" Celluci jerked his head in the direction of Carl Biehn and said to Barry, \"Get over there. Watch him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry nodded, thankful for some direction, and limped across the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the long way here in the back of the police car, Vicki had thought only about arriving in time to make a difference. Now she was here, it was over, and the flashlight showed her only broken scenes suspended in darkness. \"Mike, what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a second, he weighed the alternatives, then he quickly laid out the facts, attempting to keep them uncolored by emotions he himself wasn\u0027t certain of. He watched her face carefully when he told her what Henry had done but she let nothing show he could use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Peter? I mean, Storm?\" she asked when he finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-trail-vicki-nelson-2/page-15.html","bookId":2465,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:38:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:38:00 PM"}
