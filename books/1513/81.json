Moreover, even the academy has strictly regulated the information given for an acolyte to advance into a level 3 acolyte. . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin, who came from another world, naturally saw through these methods of sealing away information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, compared to those high and mighty Magi, Leylin was currently but an ant. Even if he saw through it, there was no way that he could resist it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, Leylin was only a level 3 acolyte, and not even an official Magus!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is definitely information in the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy regarding the experience of advancement to a rank 1 Magus, but I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not something that I can obtain easily! It\u0027s a pity, but this is already the most probable situation I can think of....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked at the distant raindrops, sinking into deep thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the harrowing experience of advancing to a level 3 acolyte, Leylin was rather traumatic over the incident. Before making preparations fully and obtaining enough information, he would definitely not dare to breakthrough into an official Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor magicians, the step to become an official Magus, from an acolyte, was the most crucial step, and no mistakes could be allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin was, however, unable to discover any information pertaining to this. Furthermore, to obtain this information, he could only plan to seize it from an official Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the strength of official Magi far exceeded that of a level 3 acolyte. Not to mention that the defensive force field surrounding the official Magi which the A.I. Chip had detected. Leylin had no means, even now, to break through it. The difficulty of obtaining information on advancement from an official Magus had long surpassed Leylin\u0027s limits. Only if Leylin was mad would he proceed with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for what Leylin knew, obtaining information on the advancement was the most appropriate method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to the news that Kroft had hinted at earlier, although it might be rather dangerous at this time, it is also the best chance to obtain these resources and information!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked at the raging thunderstorm outside and suddenly steeled his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he was someone who treasured his life dearly, in this situation where his path seemed bleak, he could only muster up courage, and take a gamble!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, he was at the optimal age to advance to an official Magus. Once he missed this chance, even if he could obtain resources and information in future, it would be unlikely that his aged body would support him through the breakthrough to a rank 1 Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, it was not as though he did not have any confidence. At the very least, according to his own hypothesis and the A.I. Chip\u0027s simulations, there was, at least, a 90% chance that the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy required him to fulfill some sort of dangerous mission, and hence, would not sacrifice him! This was enough for him to take a gamble!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take a gamble this once! If I am unable to scale the absolute peak and observe the radiance from the rays of dawn, then let me be sludge and sink thoroughly into the earth, and rot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes sparkled as he gazed intensely at the thunderstorm raging in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e......\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days later, in the outer vicinity of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than half of the surrounding forests around the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had already been destroyed. The ground was filled with traces of holes and depressions. Not far away, a few patches of the ground were white in colour, and on top of it were some rubble and ashes. From these, one could surmise what kind of bitter battle the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had gone through!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was actually reduced to a state like this....\" Leylin rode the large horse and dashed ahead, feeling absolutely gleeful that he had made an unwavering decision to leave the academy beforehand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been such a massive battle that it had actually even ruined half of the geography around the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. If Leylin were to remain here, he did not have any confidence in protecting his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the path and traveling on for another dozen minutes, a huge graveyard appeared before Leylin\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the underground entrance to the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, a large granite graveyard. However, right now, half of the tombstones were shattered, and many graves were also dug open, revealing the dark passages within. The surrounding stone walls and mud reflected signs having been abused by many spells. Before Leylin\u0027s eyes, the alert of the A.I. Chip continuously sounded, revealing the extremely high radiation from some traces of these spells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every little tombstone here was actually a personal passageway for each professor in the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy and all are now in such ruins....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he long knew that the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy would definitely suffer a catastrophic loss, this miserable scene still caused Leylin to inhale a mouthful of cold ai\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Bang! *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin casually kicked a stone on the floor, and walked towards the centremost area of the graveyard, where a huge tombstone that looked like a castle was erected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the huge entrance to Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, and was the common path for all acolytes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surface of the castle was littered with cracks, and part of the topmost area was chipped off. What remained was tottering, and seemed to be on the verge of collapse. Seeing such a sight made Leylin somewhat worried; he felt that if he were to stick a finger out and poke it, this castle of a tombstone would crumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Halt! Outsider! If you are unable to show any items of proof, I will make you pay the price of blood!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two stone statues by the large entrance were completely destroyed. The Winged Earthworm and Two-Headed Dog from before were now gone. Right when Leylin wanted to enter, a metallic voice sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccompanying that voice, a large shadow from the peak of the ashened castle climbed down at a rapid speed. This black figure was taller by an average human by two heads, and its hands were extremely long, extending to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the castle tombstone was filled with cracks, no matter how this black figure climbed, the castle did not waver an inch. Obviously, the construction of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy was not as weak as it seemed on the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Bang! * The black figure leapt, and a huge shadow was projected on the ground, completely engulfing Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Thud! * The black figure pounded on the ground, bringing up a layer of dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin squinted and finally saw the appearance of the black figure. This was a large ape-like creature. Its whole body was layered with granite, and both of its hands propped itself up on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Beep! A creature with high levels of energy has been detected. Now comparing to database. Determined as Granite Ape!] The A.I. Chip\u0027s voice intoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranite Ape was a creature in the Magus World with a battle strength comparable to an official Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sense the energy waves emanating from the item of proof on your body, take it out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Granite Ape looked at Leylin, and sniffed him with its large snout. As the ape approached, an extremely dense and putrid stench wafted over. Leylin had to muster up a lot of strength to endure the need to frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Item of proof?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin thought for a while, before hurriedly withdrawing the red metal card from his sack that he obtained before when taking up the mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it was this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Granite Ape took the metal card and swallowed it in one gulp, as if munching on some delicacy. It even closed its eyes to savour the taste of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an acolyte of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy who took on an outside mission previously!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a dozen seconds, the Granite Ape opened its large eyes and said to Leylin, \"Brat, enter!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please accept my offerings!\" Leylin thought, and bowed before the Granite Ape, before taking a bunch of banana like fruits and placing it on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elephant Stout Bananas! Not bad, not bad!\" The large ape nodded its head, and took one from the bunch and peeled it, before tossing it into its mouth, as if it could not wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I ask what happened to the two guardians from before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin asked cautiously, after seeing the Granite Ape enjoying itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re dead!\" The large ape answered concisely, and Leylin gasped silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was something that he had long guessed. The two statues were obviously the first line of defense for the academy. After being attacked, they would easily be the first to perish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another bow, Leylin entered through the entrance of the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dimly lit flight of downward stairs was the same as from before, when Leylin had left the academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, for some unknown reason - which may have been the fact that he was now a level 3 acolyte with a greater spiritual force - Leylin discovered that there were a few marks on the walls and stones, with some traces of blood. There were even some faint wails of spirits who had perished, which travelled to Leylin\u0027s ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin, who had conducted a massive amount of experiments on spirit bodies, would never mistake these noises for something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong the way, he noticed that he had run into far fewer acolytes than he did normally. Leylin estimated that the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy didn\u0027t even have half of its original strength. Even the Trading Post and Mission Area hotspots seemed to be devoid of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the mission desk counter, Leylin handed over the records in the crystal ball and a piece of the Great Snake Mankestre\u0027s scales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here to complete a mission!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alright, please hold on!\" The staff at the counter had changed too. This was a freckled girl, who seemed to only be a level 2 acolyte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he was waiting, Leylin was bored to death, and looked at his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the number of people in the Mission Area had been greatly reduced, the number of missions did not reduce but increased instead. Moreover, many of them had increased rewards compared to before. According to Leylin\u0027s guess, while the difficulty of these missions had remained the same, the rewards had increased to twice of what they were originally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was an abnormal scene, which made Leylin\u0027s eyes flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ley...Leylin!\" A muffled yet hoarse voice sounded behind Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin turned around and saw a swollen figure wrapped in a black veil. Moreover, the stench of pus drifted over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are... Nyssa!\" Leylin\u0027s eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally he recalled this image clearly, but even if he didn\u0027t, the A.I. Chip had recorded it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You actually still remember me!\" Nyssa\u0027s voice had a tinge of excitement. At the same time, an energy wave leaked from her body. According to the A.I. Chip, she was actually a level 2 acolyte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-80\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-82\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-81","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
