{"id":80105,"no":84,"title":"Page 84","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Gone?\" Jonas repeated quizzically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever ability I had with crystals seems to have been directly related to what I shared with you, not Oliver. I\u0027ve felt nothing around crystals since you woke up without your psychic talent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Oliver worked the crystal to bring me out of the unconscious state I was in after that scene in the chamber.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity shook her head. \"Oliver worked it. I concentrated on yelling at you until you finally woke up and paid attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled faintly. \"I could hear you chewing me out and I knew it was time to come back. You\u0027ve got a hell of a mouth on you, my love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you appreciate it,\" she murmured sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate it all right.\" His grin turned wicked with remembered satisfaction. He touched her lips with his fingertips. \"I consider your mouth a very valuable portion of your anatomy. I\u0027m thinking of having it insured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going to call him Nicholas Emerson Quarrel!\" The halls of the small maternity ward of Sequence Springs Community Hospital rang with Emerson\u0027s announcement. If there was anyone left in the waiting room who did not yet know that Nicholas Emerson had arrived, he was now aware of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside her room Verity held the tiny bundle to her breast and smiled. She knew her father had been pacing the waiting room floor since she had gone into labor last night. When Jonas had finally gone out to tell him that he had a grandson, Emerson\u0027s roar of approval had shaken the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity raised her head and looked up at her husband. Jonas was watching his son nurse. There was deep pride in those eyes of Florentine gold. There was also a fascination in them as Jonas studied little Nicholas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at those tiny little hands,\" Jonas marveled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he\u0027s going to have your eyes,\" said Verity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas grinned. \"You think so? The nurse said it was too soon to tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me,\" Verity said with smug certainty. \"I\u0027d know those eyes anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas\u0027s grin widened. He had been grinning a lot for the past couple of hours. He had not been grinning last night, however, when, in the middle of serving dinner to a light crowd at the cafe, Verity had announced that her time had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas had taken over instantly. He had chased out the last of the diners and ordered Emerson to get the Jeep. At the hospital he had issued a steady stream of instructions to Verity and her nurses, consulted with Verity\u0027s doctor, and generally assumed command of a situation that was entirely outside his field of expertise. That had not stopped him for a moment. Jonas had prepared well for the big event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had studied every book on pregnancy and childbirth he had been able to find during the past few months. He had supervised Verity\u0027s vitamin supplements and exercises. He had gone shopping for diapers and baby supplies. Together with Emerson he had planned an educational curriculum for the child that would have stunned the average public-school teacher. It was a lot like the one Emerson had once devised for his daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas had considered himself an expert on childbirth right up to the moment when Verity had gone into the delivery room and started swearing. She had gritted her teeth and shouted words Jonas had never heard her use before. At that point he had realized he was a little out of his depth. Jonas had compensated by giving more orders and holding Verity\u0027s hand so tightly that he was afraid he might crack a few of the delicate bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she had clung to him even more tightly. Her nails had left marks in his palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow they had all come through the ordeal with flying colors. Nicholas Emerson Quarrel had arrived with an ear-splitting squall, prompting Jonas to remark proudly that his son obviously had inherited his mother\u0027s verbal skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Dad still causing a scene out there in the waiting room?\" Verity inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could say that. He bought a case of beer for the hospital staff.\" Jonas leaned over to get a closer look at his son. \"Are you sure you feel all right, honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine. A little tired, but that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe it. We\u0027ve actually made ourselves a kid. A real live baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity smiled, amused by Jonas\u0027s wonder. \"Yes,\" she said, a little amazed herself. \"We did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe past few months had been good, she thought with satisfaction. The time she and Jonas had had together before the baby arrived had assured them both that the bonds between them were strong enough to last a lifetime. Verity\u0027s nagging, Jonas\u0027s teasing, the laughter and the loving were all back to normal. Better than normal, Verity had decided. This time she could be sure that the emotional foundation was for real, not just a byproduct of the psychic link.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hospital room door burst open just as Jonas leaned down to place his son back in the cradle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson stood on the threshold, loaded down with flowers and packages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Behold, I come bearing gifts and the U.S. mail. How\u0027s little Nicholas Emerson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleepy,\" Jonas said. \"Keep your voice down, Emerson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kid might as well get used to the fact that he\u0027s got a mouthy mother, a loud grandfather, and a daddy who\u0027s good with a knife. Here you go, Jonas. A letter from some magazine. Looks like a check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful,\" Verity exclaimed. \"I told you they\u0027d love your piece on Digby Hazelhurst\u0027s contributions to Renaissance scholarship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas raised beseeching eyes toward the ceiling. \"Done in by success. Now I suppose I won\u0027t get any peace until I write that follow-up article for the editor who got me into that mess to begin with.\" But he was smiling with satisfaction as he ripped open the envelope and removed the check inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity knew the source of that satisfaction. During the past few months Jonas had come to the realization that his knowledge of Renaissance history and his feel for the period had not vanished along with his talent. The things he had learned in the academic world and in the time corridor were his for a lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And more baby presents,\" Emerson continued as he placed gaily wrapped packages on the bed. \"The kid is really raking it in. A package from the Griswalds, one from that Crump fellow, and one from Sam Lehigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity pulled off ribbons and tore paper with enthusiasm. Rick and Laura Griswald\u0027s gift was an adorable little yellow playsuit. She held it up with delight. \"Isn\u0027t it cute? It\u0027s perfect for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks a few sizes too big, if you ask me,\" Jonas said, examining the outfit with a critical eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Emerson advised. \"Babies grow. Fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see what Oliver sent,\" Verity said. She shredded more paper, lifted off the top of a white box, and revealed a beautiful chunk of amethyst crystal. \"It\u0027s lovely,\" she said, turning the glittering crystal in her hands. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-84.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
