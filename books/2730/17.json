Cora was a tough chick, and not very much rattled her, but having a stranger force his way into her home had to have been terrifying. She puffed out a little breath against my chest where she was tucked and she thunked a fist on my ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Why the hell not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because they can’t do anything. He didn’t take anything and never got a chance to put his hands on me. They’ll come poke around and tell us tough shit. I’m an idiot for opening the door anyway. I know better than that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set her away from me with a sharp frown. “You could have been seriously hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved a hand in front of me. “No, I couldn’t have been. He was after something, not after me. It just spooked me, is all. What are you doing here, anyway? I thought you went to play nice with Ayd.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t like it one bit. Everything inside me said call the police, that one girl I cared about had already been put through the ringer by a loose cannon. I wasn’t about to let it happen again. I picked her up in a full body hug that had her squealing and laughing at the same time. “You need to be careful, Cora. We wouldn’t know what to do without you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scoffed. “You really think I’m about to let you guys roam around this city unsupervised? The female population of Denver would never survive it. We have to be sure to tell Ayd to be careful. I don’t know what would have happened if she had been home and not me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked that thought even less. I don’t know how all the fury and fire that I barely kept banked would stay contained if something happened to Ayden. If I let it go, not only would I go up in flames but there was a chance I would end up burning anyone close to me to dust as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like this, Cora. I want both of you to be safe.” She hooked her arm through mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’ll be fine, Jet. Seriously, he probably just had the wrong house, or was looking for money for drugs or something. No place is perfect and we can take care of ourselves. You never answered me”—her crazy eyes narrowed at me—“did you fix things with Ayden?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and let her drag me into the house. “Sort of. I apologized for being an asshat last night and told her I couldn’t fight this thing between us anymore. I don’t know what that looks like to her but I can take it day by day for now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was okay with that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess, Honestly, I think that’s the only way she’s okay with it. She’s a hard chick to pin down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be stupid, Jet. You have a lot to offer anyone. The cool thing is Ayden isn’t the type to take it all. She can provide for herself, and be happy just taking what she wants from you. It’s up to you to make her see just how much you’re willing to give and how much better she is off with the entire package. Make her want to be pinned down and not just in the sexy, fun way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just looked at her in silence. This little pixie ran us all ragged and at times I think she had our lives figured out far better than we did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll keep that in mind.” She tapped me on the chin with her finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The guys all went bowling. Do you want to go? Nash was worried you weren’t answering your phone, so I decided to come and check on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scrunched up her nose and ran a hand over her spiky blond hair. “No. I think I’ve had enough excitement for one day. Plus, I had a pretty good sulk going before the breaking-and-entering portion of the day. I think I’d like to finish it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my eyebrows dip sharply down. Cora wasn’t a sulky person. She was cheerful and honest to a fault. “Why are you sulking around? That isn’t like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed and flopped down heavily on the couch. “Watching Rule take such good care of Shaw is kind of hard for me. I never thought he was going to fall in love, never thought anyone would be able to get him to see past himself, but she did, and they are just so perfect together. I thought guys like him—guys like you—were hopeless. Now I’m wondering if I’m the one who is hopeless. I mean, you’re amazing, Ayden is amazing. So, whatever you guys work up is bound to be amazing and I just feel like I’m missing something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were friends and I cared a lot about her. There were plenty of mirrors in the house, so I knew that she knew she was hot enough to make men stupid. I didn’t really understand it, but all I could figure out was that she was alone because she wanted to be alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cora, come on now. You can find a guy in, like, a second flat. Half the guys in the band have you on their laminated list.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her expressive eyes at me. “I want something real, Jet. Something that is life changing and dramatic, something that makes me forget anyone else ever existed. I just can’t see that happening and it makes me sad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you’re maybe reaching for something that doesn’t exist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You see Rule and Shaw. It exists.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t really argue that point with her, but I didn’t know what else to say. I believed in love. I just didn’t trust it and what the end result could be if two people weren’t ultimately right for each other. Every great song was sung from a place of love. I knew love was strong enough to change people. My mom held on to her love for my dad, like it was a raft in the center of the ocean of horror that was her life. It was just my experience that love never changed anyone for the better, with Rule being the exception to the norm. He always did his own thing anyway, so it wasn’t like he was going to even love someone within the conventions of how it normally worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, if some guy does come along, that’s an awful lot of pressure to be putting on him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, so I’m destined to be alone and grumpy for the rest of my life. Not to mention sexually frustrated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop being ridiculous and shake this crap off. Go put on some shoes and come bowling with us. It’ll be fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grumbled until I eventually got tired of it, and just picked her up and hauled her to her room. She argued the entire way, but after I pointed out that I was wearing pants that were bound to make it impossible to throw a heavy ball down the lane without ripping in half, she begrudgingly put on some Chucks and followed me out the door. I refused to ride in her little circus car, so we hopped in the Challenger and roared down to the sprawling blocks of the Sixteenth Street mall where every tourist and degenerate in town hung out. I normally avoided this part of the city. It brought back too many memories of skipping school and sneaking booze from Phil with Rule and Nash. However, after a spectacularly nasty day, I didn’t mind the noise and hustle as much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bowling alley was lit in blue and had velour couches scattered all over the place. Personally, I thought it looked more like a strip club than a bowling alley. The guys had beer and it looked like they were having a great time giving each other shit as they rotated turns. The pink bowling ball looked like a tiny toy in Rowdy’s beefy hands, and when he tossed it down the alley it bounced hard enough that it went right into the gutter. Cora laughed and gave him a high five, while Rule and Nash offered up a round of ridiculous-looking golf claps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a group of teenage girls a few lanes down openly gawking, and I thought they were going to need the paramedics called when Nash winked at them when he got up to take his turn. I sat next to Cora on one of the benches and ducked just in time to avoid getting knocked upside the head by the flat of Rule’s palm. I scowled at him, but his glacial gaze made it clear he wasn’t playing around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ever pull a stunt like you did last night again and I will use your intestines to string your Les Paul.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, because from most people that was an idle threat, but not coming from him. I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, dude, I know. I tried to make it right. We’re good, she doesn’t hate me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose cold eyes regarded me seriously and he must have decided whatever he saw was sincere, because some of the tension left his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good, because if she hates you, then Shaw has to hate you, and by default that means I have to kick your ass all over town and I would hate to have to do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted and took a pint of beer that Rowdy handed me. “You wouldn’t hate that at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and nodded at Cora who was having some kind of argument with Nash over exchanging her Chucks for bowling shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s up with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my mouth pull down at the corners and my eyes sharpen just a fraction. Rowdy sat down on the low lounge table and all three of us bent our heads together so that they could hear me when I lowered my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bad stuff going down at the homestead, guys. When I got there, she was chasing some guy out the door. She said he shoved his way in and was demanding to know where ‘it’ was. She has no clue what he was looking for, but she was pretty shaken up. He took off on some souped-up bike way too fast for me to do anything about it. After everything that went down with Shaw, I don’t like it one bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowdy whistled and Rule growled like a wild animal. “Did you call the cops?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back and laced my fingers behind my head. “Cora wouldn’t let me. You know her, she thinks this is the Wild West still and things like that just don’t happen here like they do in Brooklyn. She seems to think it’s a onetime event and that the guy was just a meth head or something looking for money. That bike was cherry and there was no way he just picked out our house at random. We’re way too far away from downtown for a junkie just looking to score some cash.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t cool.” Rule sounded a little unhinged and I couldn’t blame him. He had gone a little off the rails when Shaw had been attacked and we were all now just starting to settle down from it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but I don’t want to get all worked up over something if it turns out to be nothing. I’ll tell Ayden to keep an eye out and remind Cora that things here can be just as bad as the East Coast, but I’m hoping this was an isolated incident.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRule shoved hard hands through his spiky hair and squinted eyes that were glittering like ice on a frozen lake. “It better be because I’m not going to make it through something like what happened to Shaw again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted a dark eyebrow. “I’ll keep an eye on them. I do live there, you know, and I’m trying to figure shit out with Ayden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “It’s not that. You have no idea what it’s like to have someone you care about, someone you love, facing a danger like that. It changes you, it turns you into a different person. I barely made it when Shaw got hurt. If someone hurts Ayden or Cora, there is no telling what’s going to happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowdy reached out and gave him a shove with one of his hands. Rule glowered at him but there was just something about Rowdy that made you want to listen to what he had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We all care about those girls, Archer. Nobody wants to see anything happen to either one of them. Let Jet handle the home front. You tell Shaw to keep her eyes open and remind Ayden to be careful and on the lookout. We’re a goddamn team and no one better forget it.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jet-marked-men-2/page-17.html","bookId":2730,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:48 PM"}
