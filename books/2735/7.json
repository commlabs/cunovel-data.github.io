I understand the book ends because Anna dies or becomes too ill to continue writing it, but I would really like to know what happens to Anna’s mom—whether she married the Dutch Tulip Man, whether she ever has another child, and whether she stays at 917 W. Temple, etc. Also, is the Dutch Tulip Man a fraud or does he really love them? What happens to Anna’s friends—particularly Claire and Jake? Do they stay together? And lastly—I realize that this is the kind of deep and thoughtful question you always hoped your readers would ask—what becomes of Sisyphus the Hamster? These questions have haunted me for years—and I don’t know how long I have left to get answers to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know these are not important literary questions and that your book is full of important literary questions, but I would just really like to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course, if you ever do decide to write anything else, even if you don’t want to publish it, I’d love to read it. Frankly, I’d read your grocery lists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours with great admiration,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHazel Grace Lancaster\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(age 16)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I sent it, I called Augustus back, and we stayed up late talking about An Imperial Affliction, and I read him the Emily Dickinson poem that Van Houten had used for the title, and he said I had a good voice for reading and didn’t pause too long for the line breaks, and then he told me that the sixth Price of Dawn book, The Blood Approves, begins with a quote from a poem. It took him a minute to find the book, but finally he read the quote to me. “‘Say your life broke down. The last good kiss / You had was years ago.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not bad,” I said. “Bit pretentious. I believe Max Mayhem would refer to that as ‘sissy shit.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, with his teeth gritted, no doubt. God, Mayhem grits his teeth a lot in these books. He’s definitely going to get TMJ, if he survives all this combat.” And then after a second, Gus asked, “When was the last good kiss you had?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. My kissing—all prediagnosis—had been uncomfortable and slobbery, and on some level it always felt like kids playing at being grown. But of course it had been a while. “Years ago,” I said finally. “You?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had a few good kisses with my ex-girlfriend, Caroline Mathers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Years ago?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The last one was just less than a year ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“During the kiss?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, with you and Caroline.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” he said. And then after a second, “Caroline is no longer suffering from personhood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” I said. I’d known plenty of dead people, of course. But I’d never dated one. I couldn’t even imagine it, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not your fault, Hazel Grace. We’re all just side effects, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“‘Barnacles on the container ship of consciousness,’” I said, quoting AIA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he said. “I gotta go to sleep. It’s almost one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggled and said, “Okay.” And then the line was quiet but not dead. I almost felt like he was there in my room with me, but in a way it was better, like I was not in my room and he was not in his, but instead we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he said after forever. “Maybe okay will be our always.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Augustus who finally hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Van Houten replied to Augustus’s email four hours after he sent it, but two days later, Van Houten still hadn’t replied to me. Augustus assured me it was because my email was better and required a more thoughtful response, that Van Houten was busy writing answers to my questions, and that brilliant prose took time. But still I worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Wednesday during American Poetry for Dummies 101, I got a text from Augustus:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac out of surgery. It went well. He’s officially NEC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNEC meant “no evidence of cancer.” A second text came a few seconds later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, he’s blind. So that’s unfortunate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat afternoon, Mom consented to loan me the car so I could drive down to Memorial to check in on Isaac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found my way to his room on the fifth floor, knocking even though the door was open, and a woman’s voice said, “Come in.” It was a nurse who was doing something to the bandages on Isaac’s eyes. “Hey, Isaac,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he said, “Mon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, no. Sorry. No, it’s, um, Hazel. Um, Support Group Hazel? Night-of-the-broken-trophies Hazel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” he said. “Yeah, people keep saying my other senses will improve to compensate, but CLEARLY NOT YET. Hi, Support Group Hazel. Come over here so I can examine your face with my hands and see deeper into your soul than a sighted person ever could.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s kidding,” the nurse said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I said. “I realize.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a few steps toward the bed. I pulled a chair up and sat down, took his hand. “Hey,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” he said back. Then nothing for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How you feeling?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he said. “I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know what?” I asked. I looked at his hand because I didn’t want to look at his face blindfolded by bandages. Isaac bit his nails, and I could see some blood on the corners of a couple of his cuticles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She hasn’t even visited,” he said. “I mean, we were together fourteen months. Fourteen months is a long time. God, that hurts.” Isaac let go of my hand to fumble for his pain pump, which you hit to give yourself a wave of narcotics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse, having finished the bandage change, stepped back. “It’s only been a day, Isaac,” she said, vaguely condescending. “You’ve gotta give yourself time to heal. And fourteen months isn’t that long, not in the scheme of things. You’re just getting started, buddy. You’ll see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse left. “Is she gone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, then realized he couldn’t see me nod. “Yeah,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll see? Really? Did she seriously say that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Qualities of a Good Nurse: Go,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“1. Doesn’t pun on your disability,” Isaac said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“2. Gets blood on the first try,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously, that is huge. I mean is this my freaking arm or a dartboard? 3. No condescending voice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you doing, sweetie?” I asked, cloying. “I’m going to stick you with a needle now. There might be a little ouchie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is my wittle fuffywump sickywicky?” he answered. And then after a second, “Most of them are good, actually. I just want the hell out of this place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This place as in the hospital?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That, too,” he said. His mouth tightened. I could see the pain. “Honestly, I think a hell of a lot more about Monica than my eye. Is that crazy? That’s crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a little crazy,” I allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I believe in true love, you know? I don’t believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love, and it should last at least as long as your life does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wish the whole thing hadn’t happened sometimes. The whole cancer thing.” His speech was slowing down. The medicine working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gus was here earlier. He was here when I woke up. Took off school. He . . .” His head turned to the side a little. “It’s better,” he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The pain?” I asked. He nodded a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” I said. And then, like the bitch I am: “You were saying something about Gus?” But he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went downstairs to the tiny windowless gift shop and asked the decrepit volunteer sitting on a stool behind a cash register what kind of flowers smell the strongest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They all smell the same. They get sprayed with Super Scent,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, they just squirt ’em with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the cooler to her left and sniffed at a dozen roses, and then leaned over some carnations. Same smell, and lots of it. The carnations were cheaper, so I grabbed a dozen yellow ones. They cost fourteen dollars. I went back into the room; his mom was there, holding his hand. She was young and really pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you a friend?” she asked, which struck me as one of those unintentionally broad and unanswerable questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, yeah,” I said. “I’m from Support Group. These are for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took them and placed them in her lap. “Do you know Monica?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, he’s sleeping,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. I talked to him a little before, when they were doing the bandages or whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hated leaving him for that but I had to pick up Graham at school,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He did okay,” I told her. She nodded. “I should let him sleep.” She nodded again. I left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning I woke up early and checked my email first thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/* */ had finally replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Ms. Lancaster,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fear your faith has been misplaced—but then, faith usually is. I cannot answer your questions, at least not in writing, because to write out such answers would constitute a sequel to An Imperial Affliction, which you might publish or otherwise share on the network that has replaced the brains of your generation. There is the telephone, but then you might record the conversation. Not that I don’t trust you, of course, but I don’t trust you. Alas, dear Hazel, I could never answer such questions except in person, and you are there, while I am here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat noted, I must confess that the unexpected receipt of your correspondence via Ms. Vliegenthart has delighted me: What a wondrous thing to know that I made something useful to you—even if that book seems so distant from me that I feel it was written by a different man altogether. (The author of that novel was so thin, so frail, so comparatively optimistic!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould you find yourself in Amsterdam, however, please do pay a visit at your leisure. I am usually home. I would even allow you a peek at my grocery lists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours most sincerely,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Van Houten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ec/o Lidewij Vliegenthart\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“WHAT?!” I shouted aloud. “WHAT IS THIS LIFE?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom ran in. “What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” I assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill nervous, Mom knelt down to check on Philip to ensure he was condensing oxygen appropriately. I imagined sitting at a sun-drenched café with Peter Van Houten as he leaned across the table on his elbows, speaking in a soft voice so no one else would hear the truth of what happened to the characters I’d spent years thinking about. He’d said he couldn’t tell me except in person, and then invited me to Amsterdam. I explained this to Mom, and then said, “I have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hazel, I love you, and you know I’d do anything for you, but we don’t—we don’t have the money for international travel, and the expense of getting equipment over there—love, it’s just not—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I said, cutting her off. I realized I’d been silly even to consider it. “Don’t worry about it.” But she looked worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s really important to you, yeah?” she asked, sitting down, a hand on my calf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It would be pretty amazing,” I said, “to be the only person who knows what happens besides him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would be amazing,” she said. “I’ll talk to your father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, don’t,” I said. “Just, seriously, don’t spend any money on it please. I’ll think of something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to me that the reason my parents had no money was me. I’d sapped the family savings with Phalanxifor copays, and Mom couldn’t work because she had taken on the full-time profession of Hovering Over Me. I didn’t want to put them even further into debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Mom I wanted to call Augustus to get her out of the room, because I couldn’t handle her I-can’t-make-my-daughter’s-dreams-come-true sad face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugustus Waters–style, I read him the letter in lieu of saying hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, right?” I said. “How am I going to get to Amsterdam?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a Wish?” he asked, referring to this organization, The Genie Foundation, which is in the business of granting sick kids one wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I said. “I used my Wish pre-Miracle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’d you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed loudly. “I was thirteen,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not Disney,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did not go to Disney World.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hazel GRACE!” he shouted. “You did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World with your parents.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Also Epcot Center,” I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my God,” Augustus said. “I can’t believe I have a crush on a girl with such cliché wishes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was thirteen,” I said again, although of course I was only thinking crush crush crush crush crush.
