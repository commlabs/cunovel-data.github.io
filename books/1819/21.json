I needed a drink and didn’t want to wait for the waitress, so I excused myself and walked up to the large bar that was shared by both sides of the club. As the bartender approached me, I ordered a shot of Jack. He put the shot glass down in front of me and I threw it back, allowing the burning sensation to coat my throat. Suddenly, I was startled by a voice in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, isn’t this a coincidence seeing you here. It must be fate,” the deep voice whispered as his scent captured me and his hot breath warmed my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, my heart started beating rapidly as the lower half of me started to ache. “Are you following me?” I asked without turning around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just about to ask you the same question. Do you always come to strip clubs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I told you before that it’s my best friend’s bachelorette party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, that’s right,” he said as he traced little circles on my shoulder with his finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy skin started to heat up at his touch. There wasn’t anywhere I could go. He had me trapped between the bar and the stool. “Am I making you uncomfortable?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just a bit,” I answered nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I apologize. You better get back to your friends,” he whispered as he leaned in closer to me and I felt his lips slightly touch my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched and he moved his arm so I could get by. As I walked away, I turned around, even though every part of me said not to. But I did, because I could feel his burning eyes all over me. I sat back at the table just in time for the show to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where were you?” Landon asked. “We were going to start a search party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The bar was packed. It took forever to get the bartender’s attention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe show started and one male stripper walked onto the stage. Peyton started going crazy and yelling. I looked over at her and laughed because she was standing on the chair. I needed to use the bathroom, so I got up from my seat and told the group that I’d be right back. I was feeling a little tipsy from the Jack and coke I was drinking and then the champagne I had earlier. I couldn’t find the bathrooms, so I had to ask one of the waitresses. She pointed down the long hallway and said they were on the left. After peeing, what seemed like forever, I washed my hands and, when I opened the door, I was startled to see the line of people down the narrow hallway. When I stepped out of the bathroom and tried to make my way through the crowd of people, I felt two hands grab my waist. I turned around and it was him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay; let me guide you out of here,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we were reaching the end of the hallway, two drunken girls stumbled and pushed us up against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on. Let them pass,” he whispered in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulped as the ache down below came back and my senses were heightened by his tantalizing scent; an unfamiliar scent to me. Once the girls passed by, he grabbed my waist and led me out of the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t turn around, but hold out your hand,” he instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did what he asked and I held my hand out in front of me. He put a piece of white paper in it and then he closed my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t let anybody see that. It’s only for you,” he whispered and then walked away in the opposite direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my hand and unfolded the piece of paper. It read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy room, tonight, after your party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoom 4709\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll be there, waiting for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stood there staring at the note, I heard someone call my name. I looked up and closed my hand tightly as Mason walked towards me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s taking you so long?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at the line,” I said as I took his hand and we walked back to our table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur time at the strip club was finished and we needed to move on to the last club. As I helped Peyton into the limo, she wouldn’t stop talking about the lap dance she received from the stripper. Everyone was cracking jokes and having a good time. I was starting to get a bit worried that Peyton was too drunk to go to the next club, but she insisted she was fine. When I opened my clutch to pull out my phone, the white piece of paper fell onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oops, you dropped something,” Landon said as he reached down and picked it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! I can get it,” I said in a sharp tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason picked up the paper and handed it to me. “Wow, calm down, Elle, it’s only a piece of paper. “\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe club was packed. The music was blaring, and the floor was thumping. I tried to get my mind off of him, but I couldn’t. His tall stature and assurance were startling, but in a way that was to be desired. To distract myself from the thoughts of him that seemed to consume me, I lost myself in the music, dancing, drinking, and having a good time. When it was time to leave, Landon had to carry Peyton to the limo as the girls and I stumbled behind, laughing and practically falling on our asses. I pulled my phone from my clutch and there were no messages or missed calls from anyone. Not too long after we left the club, we were back at the Waldorf. Landon carried Peyton to the room and collapsed on the couch. I pulled the white piece of paper from my clutch and stared at the room number. It wasn’t the same room he had gone into earlier in the day. This room was on the top floor of the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took in a deep breath and stepped off the elevator. I knocked quietly on the door of Room 4709. Immediately, the door opened, and he stood there with a smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please come in,” he said. “I wasn’t sure if you’d show.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t sure if I would either,” I said as I stepped inside his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like a drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, thank you. I’ve had way too much already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corners of his mouth curved up when I said that. “Is that so?” he said as he walked closer to me, took my clutch from my hands, and threw it on the chair. He stood in front of me, and as I looked down, he cupped my chin in his hand and lifted it up until I was forced to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone as beautiful as you should never be looking down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I took in a sharp breath, he took his finger and ran it across my jaw line. “You’re so stunning. From the moment I laid eyes on you, I wanted you. I know you felt it too. I could tell by the look in your beautiful blue eyes. Did you feel something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded my head lightly as his gaze held mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Say it. I want to hear you say that you felt something when you saw me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I felt something,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned closer to me, gently nipped my bottom lip, and then looked at me. “Do you want me to f**k you? Because I’ve wanted to since the moment I saw you,” he said as he traced my lips with his finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words wouldn’t escape my lips, so I nodded my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth crashed into mine as my lips parted slightly, allowing his tongue to explore my mouth. Once he had me against the wall, he cupped me below, feeling my soaked panties as his fingers pushed them to the side and he inserted his finger inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew I turned you on,” he said as his lips pursued my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I ran my fingers through his hair, he took down both straps of my dress and let it fall to the floor. “I want you to leave your shoes on,” he commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis right hand kneaded my breast as his left ripped the panties right from me. I gasped as he dipped two fingers inside. He moved them in and out of me while he unbuttoned his pants with his other hand and took them down. My breathing was rapid and my moans became louder as he inserted himself into me. He was rock hard and so strong that each time he pushed deeper into me, he sent my body into convulsions. I wrapped my legs tightly around him as he held me up against the wall and continued to thrust in and out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God, oh my God,” I yelled as my body shook and he brought me to an amazing orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right. I want to feel your pleasure all over me,” he said as he forcefully pushed himself into me one last time and I felt him explode inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my legs still wrapped around him, he looked at me and kissed my lips. “Well played, Mrs. Black.” He smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Touché, Mr. Black.” I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unwrapped my legs and he gently put me down. “Please say you’ll stay with me tonight instead of going back to your room. I don’t want to sleep alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I’ll stay here. I love you so much, Connor,” I said as I wiped the sweat from his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I love you, Ellery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe climbed into the luxury bed and Connor wrapped his arms around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you know I was here? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I had no idea you’d be here. I had a Vegas room set up in the suite for Henry’s party and one of the other guys arranged the strip club. When the elevator doors opened and I saw you standing there, you took my breath away, and I felt like it was my first time ever seeing you. That’s why I wanted to pretend that I didn’t know you, and when you played along, that’s when I decided to play it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should do this more often.” I smiled as I rolled over and his arms tightened around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he softly kissed my back, he whispered, “We’re going to have a little talk in the morning about that dress you were wearing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled as I closed my eyes and fell fast asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 27\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne month later…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t give a shit if his wife left him. You tell him that the Chicago building better be ready next month for the inspection. I’ve paid him good money to see that it gets done, and it better be ready! Because if it’s not, you tell that son-of-a-bitch that I’ll see him in court,” I yelled as I threw my phone across the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” Ellery said as she walked into my home office, carrying Julia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just people not doing what they’re supposed to be.” I sighed as I got up from my desk and walked over to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it the Chicago building again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, baby, it is, but I don’t want you worrying about it,” I said as I kissed her head and took Julia from her. “Have you finished the last painting?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I have. I just finished it a few minutes ago.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great. I’ll have them wrapped and shipped to the gallery. They’ll be there just in time for the opening next week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Julia and she stared at me with her big blue eyes as I talked to Ellery. She was growing so fast. Ellery had started her on baby food and she’d learned to sit up by herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peyton and Henry come home today from their month-long honeymoon,” Ellery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They had a great wedding. I can’t believe how fast it came and went.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. Time is going by so fast. Look at how big Julia is getting already,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe heard the elevator doors open and Mason announcing that he had arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready to hit the gym?” I asked Ellery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bet I am. Let me go and grab my bag.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked out of the office and I handed Julia over to Mason. “There’s the little princess.” He smiled. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-us-forever-3/page-21.html","bookId":1819,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:38 PM"}
