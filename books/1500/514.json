Su began to think back to his experience back then, while using the leftover mental ability to gather information from all conversations that were taking place in this pub, as well as categorize and analyze everything. Soon after, he obtained the information he wanted. Behind the bar dance floor was a private room, and within it was a large fat black male, tonight’s target. This fella named Barney was the one in charge of Bleeding Bullet, as well as Ladesma’s trusted aide who controlled this area. Su believed that this person should know about Ladesma’s whereabouts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRight at this moment, a group of big men who clearly had at least two or three levels of power strengthening just from their builds, squeezed over to Su’s table, the one in the lead an enormous white male with a height of two meters.

A pistol had unknowingly when appeared in his hands, its dark silver body and unique design constantly reminding everyone that this was a new era weapon. Meanwhile, the ice-cold muzzle was already pressed against the large male’s forehead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe oppressive gunshot seemed a bit soft, but the destructive power was enough to leave others stupefied.

All of this happened extremely quickly, with no one able to see the process clearly. However, they all remembered the five clear scenes, the scenes of Su’s gun pressing against their foreheads.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter killing six people in an instant, the people in Bleeding Bullet’s bar finally understood that it wasn’t an ordinary gunfight tonight. However, the bloody slaughter left them unwilling to make the slightest movement, all of them throwing their weapons on the ground one after another out of fear of being the next one to have their head blasted open.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu directly walked over to the private room, kicking the door open with a single motion. Then, his muzzle continuously flickered with fiery light, simultaneous blasting apart all six of the \u0026nbsp;bodyguards’ heads. Only the fat black male at the center who was laying on a couch remained, his mouth agape as he stared blankly at Su. The women in the private room went crazy, all of them screaming as they scrambled for the exit to escape. However, their bodies all began to float upwards, their faces quickly becoming purple. They struggled helplessly about, continuously screaming, yet unable to release any sound. Cirvanas who was controlling them used an extremely simple ability, completely freezing the air around their heads. They couldn’t inhale, but couldn’t exhale either, only able to suffocate to death. This was an extremely painful way of death, yet Cirvanas seemed to feel great hatred for them, feeling a need to torment them to death.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu let the young man with bloodshot eyes do his thing.

A light blonde haired Su was like both an angel and fiend as he walked out from the ruins. He stood still for a moment under the darkness, and then the cloak around his body was suddenly torn, revealing the enormous and sinister electromagnetic rifle, as well as a grenade launcher. A new era pistol rested in his hand, and two military blades quietly rested against the sides of his thighs, waiting for the chance to be unsheathed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe heavy military boots moved, crushing the rubble beneath them. Su adjusted his direction, and then, with steady and fixed footsteps, headed towards Ledesma’s residence. With each step he took, his body would release the metallic sound of firearms colliding.
