The fact that he had no idea whether the two of them were even alive caused a fire to begin to burn hot within his heart.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Xiaochun,” Patriarch Spirit Stream said, “it seems likely the Vile-Prince has his eye on your physical body. Since he failed in his attempt to get it, he came up with two plans. One was to extract our blood, the other was to seize Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, and use your unborn children to harvest both their blood and vital yang energy. It\u0027s all for the purposes of extracting the secrets locked within your bloodline!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s eyes were crimson as he threw his head back and let out a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering roar. Suddenly, he was filled with a reckless rage that surpassed anything from before!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThese were his Daoist partners and his children!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that the Vile-Prince wanted to use them for such nefarious purposes was pushing Bai Xiaochun into an insane level of rage, the type that could stain all creation with blood!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven the most fearful and cowardly person would be unable to accept such a situation, and would be driven into a violent rage!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he had not completely lost all sense of reason. He knew that if he went to save Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, he might not come out of the situation alive. He had feared death his entire life, and usually chose to take the safe route, not the dangerous one.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut right now… he didn’t care. Even if he faced mountains of daggers and seas of flames, he would still go. He \u003cem\u003ehad\u003c/em\u003e to go. Even if he died!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the big deal about dying anyway!!” Such sentiments had never existed within Bai Xiaochun’s heart before, but right now, they dominated his mind!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDespite his frenzied state, he looked over at the tens of thousands of Heavenspan Realm cultivators, aware that if he left them here alone, they would be in danger. And if he took them with him in the Greatsword of the North, and he ended up perishing, then they would meet the same fate. Although he might be willing to throw his life away, he couldn’t force the same fate on them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe had few options. Without any hesitation, he performed an incantation gesture and pointed out at the sword. It vibrated, and then released a gravitational force that grabbed all of the Heavenspan Realm cultivators, even Li Qinghou and Patriarch Spirit Stream, and sucked them inside!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNext, Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, sending the Greatsword of the North streaking off into the distance in a beam of light. He had thought of sending them to the damaged fan. But he knew that, despite being the owner of the fan, he couldn’t send that many people into it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Gongsun Wan’er, I, Bai Xiaochun… beg that you do me a favor. Take my people, and this sword, and deliver them… to the Grand Heavenmaster!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSome distance away, Gongsun Wan’er materialized out of thin air, mixed emotions visible on her face. She had come much earlier, and had been considering whether to help Bai Xiaochun or not. In the end, she didn’t need to.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that he had spoken her name aloud indicated that he knew she had come. Even as she watched in silence, he turned and became a blur of light, shooting back toward Vile-Emperor City like a meteor!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“He… trusts me that much…?” she thought. Turning, she blurred into motion as she went after the Greatsword of the North. She knew that Bai Xiaochun was entrusting her with the lives of tens of thousands of his people. And she also knew that she couldn’t stop him from doing what he was setting out to do. It all left her feeling very shaken.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Bai Xiaochun moved with shocking speed toward the bone dragon that was Vile-Emperor City.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGetting rid of the Greatsword of the North reduced his battle prowess to a certain degree, but he knew that he had no other choice. It was the only way to keep the people who had called him the Arch-Ancestor safe. It was the only way… to be able to fight a bloody battle to the death without any distractions!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“If I don’t kill you this day, Vile-Prince, then I don’t deserve to call myself human!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDie. DIE! DIE!!!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe murderous aura which surrounded Bai Xiaochun propelled him forward like a destructive shooting star.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe wind screamed and the lands quaked. The air, unable to sustain such force, cracked and shattered. The cultivators in Vile-Emperor City who could see what was happening were absolutely shocked, and felt like they were being crushed by the pressure. They even felt the Willpower inside of them stirring!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDevas, demigods, and celestials all gasped in shock, especially those in the embassy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of Vile-Emperor City seemed cloaked with a suffocating pressure as countless eyes looked at Bai Xiaochun streaking through the air!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs for his destination, it was very obvious. He was heading to… Vile-Prince Mansion!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like a vicious blade slicing through the air toward the Vile-Prince!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWithin Vile-Prince Mansion, all of the Vile-Prince’s subordinates were shaking in fear. Meanwhile, the Vile-Prince was in a private chamber, a crazed expression on his face as he looked at the spell formation set up in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Let\u0027s see how long you can last, you puny animals!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe spell formation resembled a yin-yang symbol, with Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo sealed within it, their eyes closed. Both of them were trembling, their faces ashen and twisted by expressions of pain. Black smoke curled around them, stabbing into them to extract the blood and essences of both them and their unborn children!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, Song Junwan had a totemic tattoo on her forearm, which surrounded both her and Zhou Zimo with a violet, protective shield of light. Closer inspection would reveal that the totem tattoo depicted… Bruiser!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe spell formation was set up on a blood-colored altar, which was none other than the source of the black smoke.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn response to the incantation gestures performed by the Vile-Prince, the spell formation rotated constantly. At a certain point, the Vile-Prince suddenly looked up and pulled out a transmission jade slip.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit! Can’t anybody stop him?! You want to kill me, Bai Xiaochun? You’re just asking to be cut down! Let’s see who’s faster, you or me. I’m so close to succeeding!” Face twisting with rage, he sent a message to his father. After a long moment passed in which he got no response, he got flustered, and started sending messages to the celestials in the city.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe made all sorts of promises of incredible compensation in order to get their help, and when he finally got a response, he breathed a sigh of relief. Still worried though, he ordered the demigods under his command to intercept Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe experts in Vile-Prince Mansion had no choice but to brace themselves and fly out into the open. By this point, Bai Xiaochun had reached the heart of Vile-Emperor City, and was closing in rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBefore the Vile-Prince’s minions could reach him though, the celestials who had responded to his promised rewards arrived. Daoist Heavenspan, Prince Ur-Demon, Reverend Devourer, and Celestial Virūpākṣa all appeared.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing they did was try to convince Bai Xiaochun to stop.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Back down, Bai Xiaochun!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“The Vile-Emperor is coming out of seclusion at any moment, Bai Xiaochun. Wake up! We can work things out, there’s no reason for all of this!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOn any other occasion, Bai Xiaochun might have agreed to a compromise. But right now, his eyes were bloodshot, and his murderous aura raged to unheard-of levels. Never before in his life had he been this dead set on killing people.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“All of you… get the hell out of my way!!” He didn’t waste time with words. He immediately resorted to the Mountain Shaking Bash, adding in raw fleshly body power and energy from his cultivation base. He even used the Undying Hex and his Godkiller technique.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA boom could be heard as he slammed into Prince Ur-Demon and Daoist Heavenspan. Blood sprayed out of both of their mouths as they were sent tumbling to the side. As for Reverend Devourer and Celestial Virūpākṣa, although they were still leery about the situation, they still tried to block Bai Xiaochun’s path.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMore booms rang out as Bai Xiaochun himself coughed up blood, his chest completely caved in. However, he didn’t seem to care. Laughing with madness, he grabbed Celestial Virūpākṣa and violently headbutted him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs Celestial Virūpākṣa coughed up blood, he realized that Bai Xiaochun was opening his mouth as if to bite a chunk out of his face. Without any hesitation, Virūpākṣa paid a heavy price to flee using a secret magic.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“He’s really gone insane!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, as Bai Xiaochun was tangled up with the celestials, the Vile-Prince’s minions were flying out to meet a different intruder!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe wore black robes that matched his swirling black hair, and wielded a long spear. Although he was clearly a deva, he was obviously powerful enough to fight with demigods!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe was none other than Song Que!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAfter glancing up at the battle being fought between the celestials, he turned toward Vile-Prince Mansion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Que’er is here to rescue you, Aunt Junwan!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1188\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1190\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1189","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM"}
