I mean, how can that happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey shrugged. \"He loves his son. We believe he\u0027s allowed him to fly on other occasions. But there\u0027s a reason why commercial pilots are required to train extensively on specific equipment, to be type certified. He didn\u0027t know what he was doing, and he got caught.\" Casey closed the door, and thought: And so did you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYUMA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:05 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus fucking Christ,\" Dick Shenk said. \"I got a hole in the show the size of Afghanistan and you\u0027re telling me you\u0027ve got a bad parts story? Featuring Yellow Peril Pilots? Is that what you\u0027re telling me, Jennifer? Because I\u0027m not going to run with that. I\u0027ll get murdered. I\u0027m not going to be the Pat Buchanan of the airwaves. Fuck that noise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dick,\" she said. \"It doesn\u0027t really play that way. It\u0027s a family tragedy, the guy loves his son, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can\u0027t use it,\" Shenk said. \"He\u0027s Chinese.

I\u0027m very disappointed in you, Jennifer,\" he said. \"Very, very disappointed. Do you realize what this means? This means I have to go with the gimp Little League segment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dick,\" she said. \"I didn\u0027t cause the accident, I\u0027m just reporting the story ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute.

You had a hot story, a story I wanted, a story about a crappy American product, and two days later you come back with some horseshit about a whack. It\u0027s not the airplane, it\u0027s the pilot. And maintenance. And bad parts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dick - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I warned you, I didn\u0027t want bad parts. You fucked this one to death, Jennifer.

An unfamiliar, gruff voice said, \"Casey Singleton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hal Edgarton here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in Hong Kong, and I\u0027ve just been told by one of my board members that Newsline did not run a Norton story tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very pleased,\" he said. \"I wonder why they didn\u0027t run it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea,\" Casey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, whatever you did, it was obviously effective,\" Edgarton said. \"I\u0027m leaving for Beijing in a few hours, to sign the sales agreement. John Marder was supposed to meet me there, but I\u0027m told that, for some reason, he hasn\u0027t left California.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know anything about that,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Edgarton said. \"Glad to hear it. We\u0027ll be making some changes at Norton in the next few days. Meanwhile I wanted to congratulate you, Casey. You\u0027ve been under a lot of pressure. You\u0027ve done an outstanding job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Hal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My secretary will call to arrange lunch when I get back,\" he said. \"Keep up the good work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdgarton hung up, and then there were other calls. From Mike Lee, congratulating her, in guarded tones. Asking how she managed to kill the story. She said she had nothing to do with it, that Newsline for some reason had decided not to run it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there were more calls, from Doherty, and Burne, and Ron Smith. And Norma, who said, \"Honey, I\u0027m proud of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally Teddy Rawley, who said he happened to be in the neighborhood, and wondered what she was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m really tired,\" Casey said \"Another time, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, babe.

But I\u0027m really tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took her phone off the hook, and went to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGLENDALE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunday, 5:45 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a clear evening. She was standing outside her bungalow, in the twilight, when Amos came up with his dog. The dog slobbered on her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Amos said. \"You dodged a bullet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"I guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whole plant\u0027s talking. Everyone\u0027s saying you stood up to Marder. Wouldn\u0027t lie about 545. That true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More or less.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you were stupid,\" Amos said. \"You should have lied. They lie.

There isn\u0027t. Not for years, kid. I watched those scum on the Aloha incident. All they wanted was the gory details. Stewardess gets sucked out of the plane, did she die before she hit the water? Was she still alive? That\u0027s all they wanted to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amos,\" she said. She wanted him to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said. \"That\u0027s entertainment. But I\u0027m telling you, Casey. You were lucky this time. You might not be as lucky next time. So don\u0027t let this become a habit. Remember: they make the rules. And the game\u0027s got nothing to do with accuracy, or the facts, or reality. It\u0027s just a circus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t going to argue with him. She petted the dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fact is,\" Amos said, \"everything\u0027s changing. Used to be - in the old days - the media image roughly corresponded to reality. But now it\u0027s all reversed. The media image is the reality, and by comparison day-to-day life seems to lack excitement. So now day-to-day life is false, and the media image is true. Sometimes I look around my living room, and the most real thing in the room is the television. It\u0027s bright and vivid, and the rest of my life looks drab. So I turn the damn thing off. That does it every time. Get my life back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey continued to pet the dog. She saw headlights in the darkening night swing around the corner, and come up the street toward them. She walked to the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m rambling,\" Amos said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Amos,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car came to a stop.

In the near darkness, she couldn\u0027t really see his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night,\" he said to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Jim,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer daughter took her hand. They started back inside. It was growing dark, and the air was cool. When she looked up, she saw the straight contrail of a passenger jet. It was so high, it was still in daylight, a thin white streak across the darkening sky. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airframe/page-25.html","bookId":2409,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM"}
