And of the big flowers, the rich flowers, the strange unknown flowers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Where shall the weary rest? When shall the lonely of heart come home? What doors are open for the wanderer? And which of us shall find his father, know his face, and in what place, and in what time, and in what land? Where? Where the weary of heart can abide for ever, where the weary of wandering can find peace, where the tumult, the fever, and the fret shall be for ever stilled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Who owns the earth? Did we want the earth that we should wander on it? Did we need the earth that we were never still upon it? Whoever needs the earth shall have the earth: he shall be still upon it, he shall rest within a little place, he shall dwell in one small room for ever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Did he feel the need of a thousand tongues that he sought thus through the moil and horror of a thousand furious streets? He shall need a tongue no longer, he shall need no tongue for silence and the earth: he shall speak no word through the rooted lips, the snakeâ€™s cold eye will peer for him through sockets of the brain, there will be no cry out of the heart where wells the vine.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The tarantula is crawling through the rotted oak, the adder lisps against the breast, cups fall: but the earth will endure for ever. The flower of love is living in the wilderness, and the elm-root threads the bones of buried lovers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The dead tongue withers and the dead heart rots, blind mouths crawl tunnels through the buried flesh, but the earth will endure for ever; hair grows like April on the buried breast and from the sockets of the brain the death flowers grow and will not perish.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O flower of love whose strong lips drink us downward into death, in all things far and fleeting, enchantress of our twenty thousand days, the brain will madden and the heart be twisted, broken by her kiss, but glory, glory, glory, she remains: Immortal love, alone and aching in the wilderness, we cried to you: You were not absent from our loneliness.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1137/33824.html","bookId":175,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 6:02:18 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 6:02:18 AM"}
