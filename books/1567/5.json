He could not understand where Voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the darkness at any moment. Something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dark mass did not stir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry did not recognize the man\u0027s voice. Then a woman shouted. \"They\u0027ve crashed. Ted! Crashed in the garden!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry\u0027s head was swimming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hagrid,\" he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions, with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm. His missing tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead was still throbbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hagrid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit sitting room. His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man was watching Harry anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hagrid\u0027s fine, son,\" said the man, \"the wife\u0027s seeing to him now. How are you feeling? Anything else broken? I\u0027ve fixed your ribs, your tooth, and your arm. I\u0027m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks ¨C Dora\u0027s father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry sat up too quickly. Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Voldemort ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy, now,\" said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry\u0027s shoulder and pushing him back against the cushions. \"That was a nasty crash you just had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong with the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. \"Death Eaters, loads of them ¨C we were chased ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Death Eaters?\" said Ted sharply. \"What d\u0027you mean, Death Eaters? I thought they didn\u0027t know you were being moved tonight, I thought ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They knew,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTed Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don\u0027t we? They shouldn\u0027t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order\u0027s charms. He only hoped they would continue to work: He imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate what Harry visualized as a great transparent bubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive. He had barely stood up, however, when a door opened and Hagrid squeezed through it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a little but miraculously alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs. \"Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o\u0027 that? I thought we were both goners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, me too. I can\u0027t believe ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You!\" he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wand\u0027s here, son,\" said Ted, tapping it on Harry\u0027s arm. \"It fell right beside you, I picked it up...And that\u0027s my wife you\u0027re shouting at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m ¨C I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks\u0027s resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry\u0027s exclamation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to our daughter?\" she asked. \"Hagrid said you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" said Harry. \"We don\u0027t know what happened to anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the sight of their expressions, if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He had consented to the plan, given them his hair...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Portkey,\" he said, remembering all of a sudden. \"We\u0027ve got to get back to the Burrow and find out ¨C then we\u0027ll be able to send you word, or ¨C or Tonks will, once she\u0027s ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dora\u0027ll be ok, \u0027Dromeda,\" said Ted. \"She knows her stuff, she\u0027s been in plenty of tight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey\u0027s through here,\" he added to Harry. \"It\u0027s supposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we do,\" said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoulders. \"I ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for which he felt so terribly responsible, but no words occurred to him that he did not seem hollow and insincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell Tonks ¨C Dora ¨C to send word, when she... Thanks for patching us up, thanks for everything, I ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go, son. That\u0027s the Portkey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying on the dressing table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a moment,\" said Hagrid, looking around. \"Harry, where\u0027s Hedwig?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She... she got hit,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" he said gruffly, \"Never mind. She had a great old life ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hagrid!\" said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue, and Hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Second later, Harry\u0027s feet slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. He heard screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?\" cried Mrs. Weasley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What d\u0027you mean? Isn\u0027t anyone else back?\" Harry panted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley\u0027s pale face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Death Eaters were waiting for us,\" Harry told her, \"We were surrounded the moment we took off ¨C they knew it was tonight ¨C I don\u0027t know what happened to anyone else, four of them chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort caught up with us ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her sons, but ¨C\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank goodness you\u0027re all right,\" she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t go\u0027 any brandy, have yeh, Molly?\" asked Hagrid a little shakily, \"Fer medicinal purposes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward the crooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their Portkey, it came back without them,\" she said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. \"And that one,\" she pointed at an ancient sneaker, \"should have been Dad and Fred\u0027s, they were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and,\" she checked her watch, \"if they made it, George and Lupin aught to be back in about a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed to Hagrid. He uncorked it and drank it straight down in one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mum!\" shouted Ginny pointing to a spot several feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew immediately that there was something wrong: Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry ran forward and seized George\u0027s legs. Together, he and Lupin carried George into the house and through the kitchen to the living room, where they laid him on the sofa. As the lamplight fell across George\u0027s head, Ginny gasped and Harry\u0027s stomach lurched: One of George\u0027s ears was missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son that Lupin grabbed Harry by the upper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oi!\" said Hagrid indignantly, \"Le\u0027 go of him! Le\u0027 go of Harry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?\" he said, giving Harry a small shake. \"Answer me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A ¨C a grindylow in a tank, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wha\u0027 was tha\u0027 about?\" roared Hagrid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Harry, but I had to check,\" said Lupin tersely. \"We\u0027ve been betrayed. Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan. You might have been an impostor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why aren\u0027 you checkin\u0027 me?\" panted Hagrid, still struggling with the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re half-giant,\" said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. \"The Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight,\" said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. \"Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, he didn\u0027t know which one I was in the beginning. If he\u0027d been in on the plan he\u0027d have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Voldemort caught up with you?\" said Lupin sharply. \"What happened? How did you escape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry explained how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks\u0027s parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They recognized you? But how? What had you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...\" Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion. \"I saw Stan Shunpike.... You know, the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of ¨C well, he doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin looked aghast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren\u0027t prepared to kill!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were hundreds of feet up! Stan\u0027s not himself, and if I Stunned him and he\u0027d fallen, he\u0027d have died the same as if I\u0027d used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,\" Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore\u0027s Army how to Disarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Harry,\" said Lupin with painful restraint, \"and a great number of Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under the imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?\" said Harry angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" said Lupin, \"but the Death Eaters ¨C frankly, most people! ¨C would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t blast people out of my way just because they\u0027re there,\" said Harry, \"That\u0027s Voldemort\u0027s job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin\u0027s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down; it collapsed beneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will George be okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Lupin\u0027s frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so, although there\u0027s no chance of replacing his ear, not when it\u0027s been cursed off ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt over Hagrid\u0027s legs and sprinted into the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized they were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger, Hermione flung herself into Harry\u0027s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione\u0027s shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,\u0027\" said Lupin calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, \"It\u0027s him, I\u0027ve checked!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, all right!\" said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak, \"But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it seems,\" replied Lupin, \"but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven Harrys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Small comfort!\" snarled Kingsley. \"Who else is back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione stifled a little moan behind her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to you?\" Lupin asked Kingsley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Followed by five, injured two, might\u0027ve killed one,\" Kingsley reeled off, \"and we saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly. Remus, he can ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fly,\" supplied Harry. \"I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s why he left, to follow you!\" said Kingsley, \"I couldn\u0027t understand why he\u0027d vanished. But what made him change targets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,\" said Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stan?\" repeated Hermione. \"But I thought he was in Azkaban?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley let out a mirthless laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hermione, there\u0027s obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up. Travers\u0027s hood fell off when I cursed him, he\u0027s supposed to be inside too. But what happened to you, Remus? Where\u0027s George?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He lost an ear,\" said Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"lost an ¨C?\" repeated Hermione in a high voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Snape\u0027s work,\" said Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Snape?\" shouted Harry. \"You didn\u0027t say ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a specialty of Snape\u0027s. I wish I could say I\u0027d paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he was injured, he was losing so much blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no sign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying friends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, give us a hand!\" called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free, the headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw a clean gaping hole where George\u0027s ear had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Weasley looked around and said, \"I can\u0027t make it grow back, not when it\u0027s been removed by Dark Magic. But it could\u0027ve been so much worse.... He\u0027s alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Thank God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I hear someone else in the yard?\" Ginny asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hermione and Kingsley,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank goodness,\" Ginny whispered. They looked at each other; Harry wanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act on the impulse, there was a great crash from the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I\u0027ve seen my son, now back off if you know what\u0027s good for you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He burst into the living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but uninjured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arthur!\" sobbed Mrs. Weasley. \"Oh thank goodness!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first time since Harry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin\u0027s wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father\u0027s arrival, George stirred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel, Georgie?\" whispered Mrs. Weasley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge\u0027s fingers groped for the side of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saintlike,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with him?\" croaked Fred, looking terrified. \"Is his mind affected?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saintlike,\" repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. \"You see... I\u0027m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred\u0027s pale face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pathetic,\" he told George. \"Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah well,\" said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. \"You\u0027ll be able to tell us apart now, anyway, Mum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Harry ¨C you are Harry, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry, moving closer to the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, at least we got you back okay,\" said George. \"Why aren\u0027t Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not back yet, George,\" said Mrs. Weasley. George\u0027s grin faded. Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside. As they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron and Tonks should be back by now. They didn\u0027t have a long journey; Auntie Muriel\u0027s not that far from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the Burrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky every time he turned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None of them looked around when Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves ¨C\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground ¨C\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s them!\" screamed Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remus!\" Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin\u0027s arms. His face was set and white: He seemed unable to speak, Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re okay,\" he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought ¨C I thought ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027M all right,\" said Ron, patting her on the back. \"\u0027M fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron was great,\" said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin. \"Wonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you\u0027re aiming at a moving target from a flying broom ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always the tone of surprise,\" he said a little grumpily, breaking free. \"Are we the last back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Ginny, \"we\u0027re still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye and Mundungus. I\u0027m going to tell Mum and Dad you\u0027re okay, Ron ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran back inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what kept you? What happened?\" Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bellatrix,\" said Tonks. \"She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus, She tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I\u0027d got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely injured Rodolphus.... Then we got to Ron\u0027s Auntie Muriel\u0027s and we missed our Portkey and she was fussing over us ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle was jumping in Lupin\u0027s jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what happened to you lot?\" Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the continued absence of Bill, Fleur, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and harder to ignore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an hour ago,\" said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. \"Let me know when they\u0027re back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate. Harry thought he heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow\u0027s boundaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. And Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind them. Both parents hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Weasley, \"for our sons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly, Molly,\" said Tonks at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s George?\" asked Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with him?\" piped up Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s lost ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the end of Mrs. Weasley\u0027s sentence was drowned in a general outcry. A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill and Fleur slid from its back, windswept but unhurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill! Thank God, thank God ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory. Looking directly at his father, he said, \"Mad-Eye\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside him was falling, falling through the earth, leaving him forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We saw it,\" said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window. \"It happened just after we broke out of the circle: Mad-Eye and Dung were close by us, they were heading north too. Voldemort ¨C he can fly ¨C went straight for them. Dung panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort\u0027s curse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backward off his broom and ¨C there was nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our own tail ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill\u0027s voice broke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you couldn\u0027t have done anything,\" said Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite comprehend it. Mad-Eye dead; it could not be.... Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate survivor...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no point of waiting in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. And Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow, and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered, \"What\u0027s happened? Who\u0027s ¨C?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mad-Eye,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"Dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twins\u0027 grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know what to do. Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief: She had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favorite and his prot¨¦g¨¦e at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had most space, was dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-whisky and some glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" he said, and with a wave of his wand, eh sent twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft. \"Mad-Eye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mad-Eye,\" they all said, and drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mad-Eye,\" echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup. The firewhisky seared Harry\u0027s throat. It seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality firing him with something that was like courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Mundungus disappeared?\" said Lupin, who had drained his own glass in one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watching Lupin, both wanting him to go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of what they might hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you\u0027re thinking,\" said Bill, \"and I wondered that too, on the way back here, because they seemed to be expecting us, didn\u0027t they? But Mundungus can\u0027t have betrayed us. They didn\u0027t know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case you\u0027ve forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery. Why wouldn\u0027t he have told them the essential point? I think Dung panicked, it\u0027s as simple as that. He didn\u0027t want to come in the first place, but Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who went straight for them. It was enough to make anyone panic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to,\" sniffed Tonks. \"Mad-Eye said he\u0027d expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley.... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and zat eez all very good,\" snapped Fleur, \"but still eet does not explain \u0027ow zey know we were moving \u0027Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody must \u0027ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider. It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze \u0027ole plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face, silently daring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did. The only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccupping from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had just risked his own life to save Harry\u0027s ¨C Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into giving Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon\u0027s egg....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised: The firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice. \"I mean... if somebody made a mistake,\" Harry went on, \"and let something slip, I know they didn\u0027t mean to do it. It\u0027s not their fault,\" he repeated, again a little louder than he would usually have spoken. \"We\u0027ve got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don\u0027t think anyone in this room would ever sell me to Voldemort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry felt a little hot again, and drank some more firewhisky for something to do. As he drank, he thought of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye had always been scathing about Dumbledore\u0027s willingness to trust people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well said, Harry,\" said Fred unexpectedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Year, \u0027ear, \u0027ear,\" said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of whose mouth twitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It was close to pitying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I\u0027m a fool?\" demanded Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I think you\u0027re like James,\" said Lupin, \"who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father had been betrayed by his friend Peter Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set down his glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, \"There\u0027s work to do. I can ask Kingsley whether ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Bill at once, \"I\u0027ll do it, I\u0027ll come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" said Tonks and Fleur together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mad-Eye\u0027s body,\" said Lupin. \"We need to recover it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t it ¨C?\" began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at Bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait?\" said Bill, \"Not unless you\u0027d rather the Death Eaters took it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said good bye and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who remained standing. The suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to go too,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen pairs of startled eyes looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly, Harry,\" said Mrs. Weasley, \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, he had not hurt like this for more than a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re all in danger while I\u0027m here. I don\u0027t want ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t be so silly!\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"The whole point of tonight was to get you here safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur\u0027s agreed to get married here rather than in France, we\u0027ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Voldemort finds out I\u0027m here ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why should he?\" asked Mrs. Weasley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"He\u0027s got no way of knowing which safe house you\u0027re in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not me I\u0027m worried for!\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know that,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly, \"but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yer not goin\u0027 anywhere,\" growled Hagrid. \"Blimey, Harry, after all we wen\u0027 through ter get you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?\" said George, hoisting himself up on his cushions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mad-Eye wouldn\u0027t want ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I KNOW!\" Harry bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think he did not know what they had done for him, didn\u0027t they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now, before they had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Hedwig, Harry?\" she said coaxingly. \"We can put her up with Pidwidgeon and give her something to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"Escaped him, fought him off when he was right on top of yeh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t me,\" said Harry flatly. \"It was my wand. My wand acted of its own accord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few moments, Hermione said gently, \"But that\u0027s impossible, Harry. You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Harry. \"The bike was falling, I couldn\u0027t have told you where Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn\u0027t even a spell I recognized. I\u0027ve never made gold flames appear before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Often,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"when you\u0027re in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before they\u0027re trained ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t like that,\" said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning. He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match Voldemort\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis scar seared with pain, it was all he could do not to moan aloud. Muttering about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he crossed the yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up ¨C rustled its enormous batlike wings, then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would have known how and why Harry\u0027s wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore always had the answers; he had known about wands, had explained to Harry the strange connection that existed between his wand and Voldemort\u0027s.... But Dumbledore, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all were gone where Harry could never talk to them again. He felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me the problem would be solved by using another\u0027s wand!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor, screaming, a horrible drawn-out scream, a scream of unendurable agony....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! No! I beg you, I beg you....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not.... I swear I did not....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear I did not.... I believed a different wand would work....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explain, then, what happened. Lucius\u0027s wand is destroyed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot understand....

It was several moments before he realized that Ron and Hermione were at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, come back in the house,\" Hermione whispered, \"You aren\u0027t still thinking of leaving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you\u0027ve got to stay, mate,\" said Ron, thumping Harry on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry\u0027s face. \"You look awful!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Harry shakily, \"I probably look better than Ollivander....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked appalled, but Hermione downright terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar ¨C it wasn\u0027t supposed to do this anymore! You mustn\u0027t let that connection open up again ¨C Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he did not reply, she gripped his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, he\u0027s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding world!
