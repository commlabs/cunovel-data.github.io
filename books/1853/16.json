That every day with her felt like I was just biding my time until I found her again? I knew it was shitty of me and I probably deserved to walk in on her gargling with the neighbor\u0027s spunk, but it still sucked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearing my head of duck-fucking rabbits and depressing thoughts, I raised my glass in the air with an angry growl and waited for the other three to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re drinking to all of the lying bitches in this world that wouldn\u0027t know how to tell the truth if it smacked them in the f**king face. Cheers!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw back the shot and slammed my glass down, wondering why the beautiful girl in front of me hadn\u0027t drank hers and instead stood there staring at me with a look of horror on her face. I watched her friend elbow her and she quickly sucked that shot down like a champ. And then proceeded to pour herself another. And another. And then, like ten more after that - in a row. She’d obviously overcome her decision that it wasn’t a good idea to drink on the job. Drew and I just kind of sat there watching her in awe. I mean, I drank like ten times that much tonight, but not all at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf the bottle was gone by the time Liz reached over and took it out of her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay there, home slice, I think that\u0027s enough for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was seriously losing my ability to focus at this point. I wanted to ask her if I could suck on one of her fingers and see if it tasted like a Snickers bar. I wanted to ask her what her name was and tell her I didn\u0027t always do stuff like this, but she was already walking away and I couldn\u0027t figure out how to lift up my arm to signal her back. I stared down at my arm resting on the bar and it just sat there like a little piece of shit slacker. I stared really hard at it and thought about it moving, but it didn\u0027t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFucking arm. It must be in a union and on a break. I can\u0027t feel my teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drew, I can\u0027t feel my teeth.\" I tapped my finger against them. I had dreams all the time that my teeth were falling out. Fuck, what if this was one of those dreams? But it can\u0027t be a dream because I don\u0027t remember falling asleep. In my dreams my teeth were always falling in my lap and there was blood everywhere and no one cared that I was spitting them all out. Every tooth I touch just falls right out and no one looked at me funny even though that was some crazy shit, right? I ran my fingers around the hard edges of all my teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever mind, it\u0027s fine. Teeth are still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I think it\u0027s time to say nighty-night and get you home, little buddy,\" Drew said as he got up from his stool and threw a wad of bills down on the bar before pulling my dead arm up and swinging it over his shoulders. I looked up at Drew as he helped me walk out of the bar. \"I wanna eat her Snickers finger but my arm teeth won\u0027t feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t remember much after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. I Got a Big Weiner\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was having the best dream ever. It was one of those hot dreams where you\u0027re having sex and you start having an orgasm and you slowly wake up in the middle of it and you don\u0027t know if you really did just have an orgasm or if it was part of the dream, but you know you want it to keep going. I was warm and cozy under the covers, and I slid my hand down between my legs to either do it again or finish it. Right when my fingers started to slip inside my underwear, I opened my eyes and screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"HOLY SHIT!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy son stood there next to the bed just staring at me. Seriously, two inches from my face just staring at me like those creepy twins in \"The Shining.\" I waited for him to start saying, \"Come play with us\" in their freaky twin voices while I tried not to have a heart attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gavin, seriously. You can\u0027t just stand here and stare at mommy. It\u0027s weird,\" I grumbled as I put my hand to my aching head and tried to calm my pounding heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet Jesus, who kicked me in the head and shit in my mouth last night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said a bad word, Mommy,\" he informed me as he clambered onto my bed and straddled my waist. My other hand joined the first one on my head and I held on tight, fearing the entire thing was going to explode all over the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mommy said bad words. Sometimes mommies say bad words. Just don\u0027t ever repeat them, got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started bouncing up and down on my stomach like he was riding one of those stupid hopping balls with handles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gavin, come on. Mommy doesn\u0027t feel good,\" I complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped bouncing and leaned forward to sprawl his body out on top of me, putting his face right up to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me ta\u0027 beat up your friends, Mommy?\" he whispered conspiratorially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI removed my hands from my head and opened my eyes to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about, Gav?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought his hands up and put them on my chest, resting his chin on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your friends, Mommy. The ones who maded you sick,\" he said in a voice that clearly screamed, \"Duh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my arms around his little body and shook my head at him. \"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about, buddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out an exasperated sigh. Poor kid. He got stuck with a dumb mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Papa says your friends Johnny, Jack and Jose maded you sick. Friends shouldn\u0027t do stuff like that, Mommy. If Luke maded me sick, I\u0027d punch him in the nuts!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gavin! Come on, we don\u0027t say things like that,\" I scolded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" he huffed. \"I\u0027d tickle him in the nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus Christ on a waffle cone. There\u0027s a reason why some animals in the wild eat their young. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-16.html","bookId":1853,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM"}
