The disbelief she had felt as his sharp teeth had ravaged her and her blood spilled over her breasts. It had not felt real, yet her world had grown dark. Her vision had narrowed as her heart became sluggish. Her life had become a narrow little window of consciousness, a window that had been filled with the handsome face of her killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As your heart beat slower and slower, I gave you my blood. It doesn\u0027t always create the change. I wasn\u0027t too sure if I had actually managed to feed you in time. You died faster than I thought. Then I took you into the woods and I buried you. And I waited. Waited for you to rise. And you did, last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re my Psychology professor,” she protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this was making sense, yet it was. Memories of her fight out of her grave filled her mind. The shower to remove the grime from her body, the strange flashing in and out of reality her reflection had done in the mirror; she remembered it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now your Master.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t understand,” she whispered. Her full lips trembled. Tears hovered on the edges of her lashes. She was lying. She did understand. She may not truly believe it, but she did understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, this is the interesting part. What will you do next? You\u0027re in a room full of dead people. There are exactly thirteen bodies strewn about you. You\u0027re naked, covered in dried gore, full of fresh blood, and just awakening to this life.” He smiled, tilted his head, and settled back in the chair with his arms crossed over his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him aghast. His strong aristocratic features seemed so cruel and harsh now. His beard made him look like a devil. Slowly, she looked around the room to see people lying around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears quivered in her eyes. She swallowed hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking down, she saw that she was covered in dried blood. Flakes of the brown stuff came off her skin as she drew back the covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she understood. It all made sense. Her great need last night. Coming here where there were plenty of people from which to feed. She had hunted last night without realizing it, and now, they were all dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, I see you understand. You\u0027re awakening to the reality. Yes, last night you rose as I watched you. I followed you to see what you would do. I have to say you have reacted better then some of the others I have created. You went home, cleaned up, and then you hunted. Look at the wonders you found yourself. A secret orgy. Perfection.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head to regard the professor with growing horror. “What did you do to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you ask if you already know the answer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you do to me?” Her voice was shrill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and brushed off his clothes. “Now to see what you will do. You know what you are. You are fully transformed now that you have fed. You are just at the beginning of your new existence. But, you have difficulties. Such as the room full of bodies and the inability to venture out in the sunlight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s night time,” she said, her dull reply automatic. She wasn\u0027t sure how she knew this, but she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled slowly. “Yes, it is. Frankly, I am curious to see what you will do. Will you try to hold onto your old life as so many of my former children have? Or will you strike out on your own?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya slid off the bed and looked around for her clothes. To her dismay, she saw they were soaked in blood. “Give me your jacket.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your jacket. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a little smile, he slid it off and handed it to her. “Just this one time of assistance. No more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you,” she answered. She pulled it on. Trying not to panic, she stepped over the bodies until she found her shoes. They were black, so blood was not immediately noticeable on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re not like them, you know? It\u0027s not the tattoos, the piercing or your rocker girl persona; it\u0027s your strength. How old were you when your mother died and your father married your cousin? Ten, was it? Living in a house full of boys and knowing that your father was fucking your cousin while your mother lay dying of cancer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” she growled. She had to escape this nightmare right now. Her thoughts were jumbled. She needed to get away to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You went to work at what age? Thirteen, wasn\u0027t it? Saving for college. But everyone made fun of you. That wasn\u0027t what the daughter of Samuel Vezorak was supposed to do, was it? No, no; you were supposed to get married and have babies. School grades were sufficient, but not enough to get you a scholarship. Yet you managed to get one through your drumming. Off you went to Austin, to the University of Texas, where you dyed your blond hair black, got a few nifty tattoos, and learned how to rock with the best of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtoning up the coat, she brushed past him. She ignored the ache between her thighs. It was hard to forget how insanely good he had felt inside of her. Being around him made her feel weak and wanting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to get out of here. Away from him and this room of -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped in her tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They\u0027re dead,” she whispered in shock. “I killed them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was when your younger sister, half sister really, got the terrible cancer, just like your poor mother, that you gave up your scholarship and went home. Now, years later, you are at a second rate college in East Texas, hoping to God it isn\u0027t too late to claw your way out of your bayou existence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhirling around, Amaliya screamed, “Shut the fuck up!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You see, fate had other plans for you. I have never made a child with your background. I honestly have no idea how you will fare, though I’m absolutely excited to see what you will do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave me alone!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I intend to. And that is the reality of it now, you see. You are on your own.” His fiendish smile made his attractive face much crueler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could bagging a hot professor end up this badly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t need you,” Amaliya snapped, pushing past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027ll see,” he said in a mocking tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot looking back, Amaliya whipped open the door and ran out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe professor smiled with satisfaction, tucked his hands behind his back, and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya struggled across the vast lawn that led to her dorm. She stumbled every few steps as her heels sunk into the moist, dew drenched soil. When she reached the nearly-empty employee parking lot, her foot got caught in a small pothole and she tripped. She hit the asphalt on all fours. Grimacing at the pain, she pushed herself up on her battered hands. She managed to get her feet under her with a little difficulty. Brushing the grit off her bloodied knees, she began to run again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stinging in her hands and knees faded. Glancing down, she realized she had already healed. Only gravel and smears of blood remained on the smooth heels of her hands. The sight of her restored flesh horrified her. A quivering moan of despair fell from her lips. Her mind felt incapable of understanding what was happening to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her, she heard a car door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amaliya,” Professor Sumner\u0027s voice rang out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite herself, she turned toward him. Her black hair flowed around her pale face. She stood trembling, hands held up before her. She dropped the bloodied clothes she had tucked under her arm. Her murderer was perfectly framed between her healed hands, and she clenched them into hard fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good luck,” he said with a rakish smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck off!” She gave him the finger to emphasize her words, then turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laughter tormented her as she snatched up her clothes. She darted behind a building and tried to put as much space between them as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dorm windows were completely dark when she skirted around the building to the side entrance. Fishing her keys out of her blood- encrusted jeans, she bit her bottom lip. She rubbed the back of her hand over her eyes to wipe away her tears, fighting back a desperate sob of despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay calm,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers shook as she tried to fit the key into the lock. She failed to line it up with the keyhole. Exasperated, she leaned her forehead against the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay calm,” she uttered again, her hands steadying. She pushed the key toward the tiny slot again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key slid into the lock. The knob turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe entered the dorm through the entrance under the stairs. It was empty and dark, with no sign of any of the other girls who inhabited the long, squat building. Quickly, she sprinted up the cement steps, her heels making a dreadful clunking noise the whole way up. Reaching the second floor, she turned and ran down the hall, hoping to God no one would open their door to see what the noise was about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s Easter weekend, she thought. No one is here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was supposed to have gone home Saturday night to attend services with her family on Sunday morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter unlocking her door and slipping into her room, she steadied herself with one hand against the wall. The room was still a mess, but now she saw the mud and gunk she had left behind the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God,” she whispered, moving down the narrow hallway into her bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirt littered the floor and bits of foliage skittered in front of her. It had really happened. She had crawled out of her own forest grave. Slowly, her gaze descended to her body. She unfastened the jacket with quivering fingers. Beneath the black fabric, her pale skin was caked with blood. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-dies-pretty-when-she-dies-1/page-4.html","bookId":2616,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM"}
