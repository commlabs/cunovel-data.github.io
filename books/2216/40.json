Somewhere in the city. Somewhere with a view of the river.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked that she said “the city.” I’m a St. Paul boy, born and raised, and can’t imagine living anywhere else, although … When I came into my money I moved my father and myself to a house on Hoyt Avenue. I thought I was moving to St. Anthony Park, a smart neighborhood near the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota. Unfortunately, I didn’t realize until after I made an offer that the house was on the wrong side of the street; I had inadvertently relocated to the suburb of Falcon Heights—and Bobby Dunston and my other childhood friends have been teasing me about it ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whose name would we put on the lease?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mine, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why of course?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If things go sour, I’ll be the one throwing you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why can’t I throw you out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood and spread her hands wide as if she were revealing herself to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I said. “You’ve got a point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite my best lobbying efforts, Nina insisted on taking a shower and getting dressed alone. Apparently she needed to go early to her club, and I wondered if this was what she meant by compromises. It took me twenty-five minutes to drive from her place in Mahtomedi, a suburb northeast of St. Paul, to my home. That’s something I won’t miss, I told myself as I pulled into the driveway—the long commute. It wasn’t until I put the Audi in park and turned off the engine that I noticed the back door to my house was standing wide open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started the Audi again, opened the garage door with my remote, and drove inside—I didn’t want to be exposed to the open back door when I got out of the car. I exited through the side door of the garage, dashed across my lawn, and hugged the side of my house. I was carrying the SIG in both hands, the safety off, as I edged along the stucco wall until I reached the open door. I poked my head around the jamb, glanced inside, and quickly pulled it back again. I didn’t see anyone, and no one threw a shot at me so I looked again, this time lingering for a moment. The house had a lot of windows, especially the kitchen. The morning sun shone through them, giving it a light, airy, and empty appearance. I eased myself inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dining room was on the right; the “family room,” as my father called it, was on the left. I went left because if I were waiting to ambush me, that’s where I would be hiding. The room was cluttered with furniture, overflowing bookcases, vinyl records and CDs and the machines needed to play them, speakers, personal computer, flat-screen TV, and Blu-Ray player. Nothing seemed out of place. Even my Dr. Who sonic screwdriver had been left undisturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people who find their homes broken into but nothing missing would be relieved. I was nervous with the realization that the intruder had not come to steal. Plus, he was savvy enough to bypass what I had been led to believe was a state-of-the art security system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the second time someone got past your home defenses, my inner voice reminded me. You’d be better off keeping geese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was easier to search my house after I left the family room because there were so few places to hide. My dining room consisted of a matching table, buffet, and a half-dozen chairs. There was no furniture in my living room and two of the upstairs bedrooms at all. I bought the house for my father and myself. That’s why I took the price on Teachwell—to buy the house and guarantee my father a comfortable retirement. My mother died when I was in the sixth grade, and it had just been the two of us. Unfortunately, he passed six months later, and I never got around to furnishing it properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick glance in my basement proved that the floor safe where I stowed a few guns, cash, and a couple of false IDs was unmolested. The safe and its contents got me thinking. If Navarre was from Spain, he must have a passport, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned to the kitchen. There were dishes on the table and a couple of empty Summit Ale bottles that I hadn’t noticed before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally? my inner voice said. The sonuvabitch raided my refrigerator? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-may-care-mac-mckenzie-11/page-40.html","bookId":2216,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:49 PM"}
