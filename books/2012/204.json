Elsewhere, in shadow, the snow was as blue as the sky. ‘What have you done, Silchas?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, the Tiste Andii replied, ‘What I deemed … necessary. I have no doubt that Kilava succeeded in forcing your people out of that realm – they won’t die, not there, not then. Udinaas is a clever man. In his life, he has come to understand the pragmatism of survival. He will have led the Imass away from there. And he will find them a home, somewhere to hide from humans—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How?’ Ryadd demanded. ‘It’s not even possible.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He will seek help.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Seren Pedac,’ Silchas replied. ‘Her old profession makes her a good choice.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Her child must have been born by now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. A child she knows she must protect. When Udinaas comes to her, she will see how her need and his can be resolved together. She will guide the Imass to a hidden place, and in that place she too will hide, with her child. Protected by Onrack, protected by the Imass.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why can’t we be just left alone?’ Ryadd heard the anguish in his own voice and closed his eyes against the outside glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ryadd Eleis, there is a kind of fish, living in rivers, that when in small numbers – two or perhaps three – is peaceful enough. But when the school grows, when a certain threshold is reached, these fish go mad. They tear things apart. They can devour the life in a river for a league’s length, and only when their bellies start bursting do they finally scatter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What has that to do with anything?’ Ryadd turned to glare at Silchas Ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tiste Andii sighed. ‘When the gate of Starvald Demelain opens, the Eleint will come through in vast numbers. Most will be young, by themselves little threat, but among them there will be the last of the Ancients. Leviathans of appalling power – but they are incomplete. They will arrive hunting their kin. Ryadd, if you and I had remained, seeking to oppose the opening of that gate, we would lose our minds. We would in mindless desire join the Storm of the Eleint. We would follow the Ancients – have you never wondered why, in all the realms but Starvald Demelain itself, one will never find more than five or six dragons in one place? Even that many demands the mastery of at least one Ancient. Indeed, to be safe, Eleint tend to travel in threes.’ Silchas Ruin walked up to stand beside Ryadd, and stared out at the vista. ‘We are the blood of chaos, Ryadd Eleis, and when too many of us gather in one place, the blood boils .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then,’ Ryadd whispered, ‘the Eleint are coming, and there’s no stopping them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What you say is true. But here you are safe.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Me? What of you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin’s hand found the grip of his scabbarded sword. ‘I must leave you now, I think. I did not plan it, and I am not pleased at the thought of abandoning you—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And all that we spoke of before was a lie,’ cut in Ryadd. ‘Our perilous mission – all of it, a lie.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your father understood. I promised him that I would save you, and I have done so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why did you bother?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because you are dangerous enough alone, Ryadd. In a Storm … no, I could not risk that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then you intend to fight them after all!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will defend my freedom, Ryadd—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What makes you think you can? With what you said of the Ancients—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because I am one, Ryadd. An Ancient.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyadd stared at the tall, white-skinned warrior. ‘Could you compel me, Silchas Ruin?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have no desire to even so much as attempt it, Ryadd. Chaos seduces – you have felt it. And soon you may witness the fullest expression of that curse. But I have learned to resist the seduction.’ He smiled suddenly, and in an ironic tone added, ‘We Tiste Andii are skilled at denying ourselves. We have had a long time to get it right, after all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyadd drew his furs close about himself. His breath plumed in the bitter cold. He concentrated a moment, was answered by a billowing of the hearth’s flames behind him. Heat roiled past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas glanced back at the sudden inferno. ‘You are indeed your mother’s son, Ryadd.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. ‘I was tired of being chilled.’ He then looked across at Silchas. ‘Was she an Ancient Eleint?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-204.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
