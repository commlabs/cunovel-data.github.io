But what happened before then? What’s the real story on the plane crash?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared back at him. He thought that she would brush him off with a casual remark. But she hesitated. “You already think I’m crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that the mind—that the human brain—is a frontier. Many things may be possible. Or the illusions that we create in our mind may seem very real. I’m serious. Please. Tell me. What happened with the plane crash?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath and looked away from him. He knew that the memory was painful, but she had apparently decided to share it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The weather was bad throughout the flight, but our flight attendant kept assuring us that it was like bumping over the waves in the ocean. I was only twelve then, but even I knew when it went straight to hell. The flight attendant went rushing by us, white as a sheet, crossing herself. The plane began to heave and twist, and when it went to the side, I knew that something was really, really wrong. I was sitting next to my mom, and she threw her arms around me, as if she could protect me. The passengers started screaming. I can still hear the sound in my mind sometimes…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” Jackson said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some were pulling out their cell phones, trying to say goodbye to loved ones. Most were just screaming. Then it happened fast. The pilots struggled, I’m sure—but they were attempting to land against a terrible wind shear—I learned that later. The plane broke up as it hit the ground. Luggage flew, no matter how it had been stowed. A wing broke off. The plane spun around. The next thing I knew, I was sideways down on the tarmac, and fire was bursting all over in spurts along with the remnants of the plane. I managed to undo my seat belt and fall face-first to the ground. I shouted for my mother and father. I tried to crawl through the wreckage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped speaking. Jackson urged her on. “And what then?” He almost whispered the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Games in my head? In my heart?” She looked at him. “I saw them. My fellow passengers. They had turned into yellow light, and they rose from the ground, heading for a greater source of light, and I wanted to get up and follow them. I saw my mother, and I shouted for her, but she was ahead with my father. They had found one another, and my father was looking at my mother with a pained expression that still held hope and love. I cried out for them both to wait. They didn’t seem to hear me, but there was someone next to me. A man in some kind of white shift, so it seemed, and he hovered down by me. He smoothed back my hair and he said gently, ‘No, little one, they have to go, and you have to stay. It’s all right. If you look, you’ll see all the light and the splendor, and you can know in your heart that you’re always safe, for the light shines down upon you.’ He touched my face, and I closed my eyes. When I opened them again, the sound of sirens blaring was all around me, and I was in excruciating pain. Luckily, I blacked out again. I spent weeks in the hospital. But Eamon was there for me, my brother. He hadn’t been on the plane with us because he’s three years older than me, and he was away at football camp.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so you made it,” Jackson said. “And you believe that…you saw your parents walk toward the light—heaven?—and that you were told by an entity of good that you had to stay behind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “Yes, that’s more or less the gist of it. And, so now, you think I’m crazier still, but maybe I have a right to be crazy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You survived,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I survived. My broken bones mended, and my burned flesh peeled away, and thankfully, I don’t even bear a scar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t quite believe that, but you went into law enforcement, and you’ve helped in many cases,” he said. “Any connection?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled ruefully. “Not really. I fell in love, lost the man I loved to cancer, and knew that I had to use whatever I possessed to try to help others. I am not a particularly good soul or anything of the like—it was what was left for me to do that seemed important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I do think that you are a good soul,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t want to. He liked her. Very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the way he had met her. Pickax in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were caught there, in that intimate moment, not just physically intimate, but somehow, as a meeting of something that might be of the souls, though that sounded somewhat ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what about you?” she asked quietly. “None of us got to see your file, if you’ll recall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was saved from having to answer her when they heard the doorbell ring, and shouts arise from the front, the sound carrying easily to them where they stood outside on the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, please! Carrying a heavy load out here, you know!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat came from Whitney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang again, insistently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, gee, honey,” he said lightly. “I guess the kids are home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER SEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next few hours, bags of groceries were put away, and Whitney and Jake settled in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela spent the time in her room—Regina Holloway’s room—arranging her own clothing in drawers and closets, and pausing now and then to see if she could get a sense of the children again, and she wondered if finding them would really help the team in their quest to discover the truth. But she didn’t see or feel anything; the room was just a room at that moment, a beautiful one. She kept the balcony doors open because the city had yet to grow hot and humid; spring was still in the air, the humidity was not at the eighty or ninety percent it could be and the breeze that came in was just beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found herself wondering more about Jackson Crow. He had become human to her; she still couldn’t believe that she had told him about the plane crash—and the man who had spoken to her, telling her that it wasn’t time for her to go to the “light.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tap at her open door interrupted her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson leaned against the door frame, his stillness so familiar despite their short acquaintance. Adam wouldn’t have him heading up this unit if there wasn’t a core of belief in life after death. She knew he had to be shaken up about his last experience in the field; people had died. Friends had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd despite the fact that two of the kids had only just arrived, making her the more senior team member, she could barely imagine what he had felt. She was certain that Adam had taken great care when putting their team together. They were people who were very different, but who had the talents and personalities that would complement one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you busy?” he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded at the open drawers. “Just finishing in here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t sure if you’d sensed more bones in the wall. I wanted to be able to duck quickly,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, the pickax is in the basement,” she told him, able to smile. He was actually joking. “You’re safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and walked in. “Do you have a hang-up about people sitting on the end of your bed?” he asked. “Nope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat. “So, what was your take on the senator?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you heard him—I think he really wanted ghost hunters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what did you feel about him? About his emotions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s really devastated by his wife’s death,” she said. “And he is the one who found her. What did you discover in regards to his companions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every one of them is a possible suspect. The day she died, they were all in New Orleans. Senator Holloway was working. Blake Conroy was at his home gym, so he says, and Grable Haines was gambling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Martin DuPre?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was at the office with the senator, but I doubt they were in clear view of one another all the time. You can walk here from the Central Business District. I’d say it would take someone twenty to thirty minutes, walking briskly. A cab would take a few minutes, depending on traffic. Perhaps he has his own car. I didn’t want them all together when I got into specifics.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do you want to go from here?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tonight? We’re heading toward dusk, you know. I thought we should lie low, help set up the cameras and get started taking video or film or whatever they work with, and see if we have any surprises showing up on the screens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And are you expecting anything?” she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “I never say never.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really.” He glanced at his watch. “It’s almost seven, it’s been a long day—I’m heading down for a beer. Oh, Jake Mallory is a sushi freak—and an expert sushi chef, so he claims. Do you eat sushi? He’s doing up some noodles and stir-fry, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m pretty safe on almost anything,” she told him. “Well, I don’t want to try monkey brains, or anything, but otherwise…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, rising. “You coming down?” he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was twilight. Part of her wanted to just go with him; a beer did sound appealing at the moment. But this was near when Regina Holloway had died, and if there were things that might be seen in the room, this was the time. She should be open to allowing the past to talk to her now, whether that meant ghosts, or just something that she did with her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered talking to Jake, though, and Jake telling her ardently that he knew people who saw ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake and his friends were crazy. That was all she’d allow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be down in just a few minutes,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll keep your beer on ice,” he said, leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensations could indeed be strange. The room seemed empty when he left; drained of life. She tried to dismiss the thought, reminding herself that she had only known him one day. Last night, he’d put her on the defensive. But maybe that was what he had felt he needed to do as the head of the team. Today, she felt as if she had seen behind his facade. He was vulnerable, too. He knew that he hadn’t caused the deaths that had befallen his last team. Yet, he still blamed himself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/phantom-evil-krewe-of-hunters-1/page-17.html","bookId":2275,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:41 PM"}
