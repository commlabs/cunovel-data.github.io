But the murderer has been gone for over two years. Hell, he might even have died in that passageway himself, trying to find a way out. For all we know he\u0027s lying at the other end of the tunnel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas stopped talking, hoping she hadn\u0027t noticed the rest. He should have known better. The woman had eyes like a hawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity wandered over to the window. \"The hand that held that stiletto had a ring on it. A big ruby ring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I saw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced back at him over her shoulder. \"It looked very old, Jonas. In fact, it looked like it could have been part of the jewelry collection in that treasure chest in the vision, or it could even have been one of the rings the man in the image was wearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a certain resemblance,\" Jonas agreed carefully. He saw the expression in her eyes and walked over to put an arm around her shoulders. \"Hey there,\" he said softly, giving her a slight shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let your imagination run away with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I\u0027m thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. You\u0027re wondering if the four-hundred-year-old man in the frozen vision managed to come alive long enough to kill old Hazelhurst. It\u0027s utterly and completely impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas, you\u0027ve said yourself that you learn something new every time you explore that psychic corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t know everything about how reality works in there. And you\u0027ve admitted there was something very strange about that first vision. What if he figured out a way to survive in the time corridor, and he\u0027s been sitting there all these years protecting his treasure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas felt a shudder run through her and he tightened his comforting grip around her shoulders. \"Not a chance. Relax, honey. There are no ghosts in that corridor, just small scenes from the past. Postcards caught in time. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The postcard of that man seated at the Renaissance writing desk didn\u0027t look like it had \u0027wish you were here\u0027 written on the back. I got the feeling that guy didn\u0027t want us around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That vision was different from anything we\u0027ve seen before in the corridor, I\u0027ll grant you that. But that doesn\u0027t mean a lot at this point. You\u0027ve got too much imagination for your own peace of mind, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blew a fiery ringlet away from her temple and kissed her there. She smelled sweet and felt warm. He could feel himself getting hard, not an unusual reaction after a trip into the psychic corridor—not an unusual reaction around Verity at any time, for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone killed Digby,\" she reminded him stubbornly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But it was a long time ago. You want my best guess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he had a companion helping him in the treasure hunt. Someone he trusted enough to take into that passageway. Maybe someone he even trusted with the crystal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And maybe that someone figured that as long as he knew about the passageway and the crystal, he no longer needed Digby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makes sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where is that person now?\" Verity persisted. She leaned her palms against the wide stone window ledge and gazed out into the rainy darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows? There\u0027s no mention of Hazelhurst discovering the hidden corridor in his diary, which means he must have found it shortly before he was killed. Either he never got the opportunity to write it down or the information is in those missing pages. I haven\u0027t come across any reference to a companion either. Our best bet may be to talk to Maggie Frampton. She might know if Hazelhurst had involved anyone else in the treasure hunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea. And in the meantime… \" Verity stopped, peering intently out the window. \"Jonas, he\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s gone?\" He followed her gaze down to the dark fountain. \"You mean Spencer? Maybe the man had enough sense to come in out of the rain, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have come back here, Jonas. He had enough time to get back into this room and pull the chair out of the passage doorway. Maybe that\u0027s why the door closed on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas considered that, his eyes darkening. \"I locked the bedroom door. How could he have gotten in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows? There may be plenty of keys floating around. The locks on the doors here in the south wing appear to be relatively new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas gave her another small, affectionate shake. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s very likely. He couldn\u0027t have known about the corridor, and he wouldn\u0027t have dared try to come back into this room knowing I\u0027d be in here with you. Besides, the man was falling-down drunk; he was just about unconscious by the time I dumped him in that fountain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he recovered sufficiently to get himself out of the pool,\" Verity pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas studied the shadowed garden. \"You\u0027re right, he did. I guess I didn\u0027t hit him hard enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want you to know that if he sues, you\u0027re the one who\u0027s going to have to explain everything to the insurance investigator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll come up with something,\" Jonas said, not the least concerned. His mind was definitely on something else now. He put his arms around Verity\u0027s slender waist and drew her back against his thighs. His jeans were drawn taut across his burgeoning manhood. \"In fact,\" he murmured into her ear,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"something is already coming up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t possibly be thinking of… of sex when there\u0027s a body lying not more than fifteen feet away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look so shocked. You\u0027re such a little prude, you know that? I keep telling you, that body\u0027s already been there for a couple of years. It won\u0027t bother us.\" He unzipped his jeans with one hand, keeping his other arm around her middle. His rigid shaft sprang free. Jonas eased Verity back again so that she could feel him through her quilted robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas, I\u0027m shocked. I really think you should show a little more respect in a situation like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re not as excited as I am. Going into that psychic corridor always has this effect on both of us.\" He grabbed a fistful of robe and raised it up above her waist. His hands closed lovingly over the soft, firm flesh of her derriere. \"Lean forward, honey,\" he whispered against her nape. \"Brace your hands on the window ledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas, this is embarrassing. Someone might see us through the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one will see us. Everyone\u0027s in this wing. You\u0027d have to be in another wing of the villa to see into this window.\" He remembered belatedly how he himself had been in another wing earlier that evening and had had a perfectly good view of this bedroom. He reached out and turned off the bedside light. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-28.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
