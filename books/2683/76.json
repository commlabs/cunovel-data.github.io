Hawkins, who\u0027s with Ethan Hawke and Matthew Barney. Below us a photographer spots me and Damien standing by the railing and snaps three, four, eight shots in rapid succession before I can straighten my tie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one knows this yet,\" Damien sighs, lighting another cigarette. \"Let\u0027s keep it this way. Let\u0027s just keep everyone smiling until tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah man, cool,\" I say, nodding. \"I think I\u0027m capable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And please try to keep Alison and Lauren away from each other,\" he says, walking away. \"Let\u0027s make a concerted effort to try and pull that off, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m capable, dude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll slide down the surface of things...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone calls up to me and I move away from the railing and head downstairs back into the party and then Carmen, this Brazilian heiress, grabs my arm. Chris O\u0027Donnell has moved away from Lauren, who spots me from across the room and just stares, and Baxter\u0027s still desperately keeping Alison occupied, even though it looks like she\u0027s losing interest, because she\u0027s rolling her eyes and making yapping gestures with her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor! I just see the film Beauty and the Beast and I love it! I-love-it!\" Carmen\u0027s shrieking, eyes wide, flailing her arms around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, you\u0027re cool,\" I say worriedly. \"But it would be somewhat profitable if you chilled out a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison pats Baxter on the side of his face and starts to move away from the bar toward the center of the room, where the camera flashes are most intense, and Chloe, predictably, is now standing with Chris O\u0027Donnell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Victor, you hear me?\" Carmen\u0027s blocking my way. \"I love it. I adore both the Beauty and the Beast. I love it. \u0027Be My Guest\u0027-Oh my god!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, be my guest. You need a drink.\" Distressed, I snap at Beau while pointing at Carmen. \"Beau-get this chick a Caipirinha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push Carmen out of the way but it\u0027s too late. Tarsem and Vivienne Westwood grabbing each of my arms, I can only watch helplessly as Alison glides gaily, drunkenly toward Chloe, who\u0027s being interviewed with Chris O\u0027Donnell for MTV, her expression becoming more confused the nearer she gets. Once she\u0027s behind Chloe, Alison sees the dress, immediately grabs a lighter out of Sean Penn\u0027s hand and, horror-struck, waves the flame so she can see Chloe better. Bijoux from MTV isn\u0027t looking at Chloe now and has lowered her microphone, and Chloe turns around, sees Alison, smiles, and in the middle of a tiny wave notices Alison\u0027s dress, grimaces, squints desperately, tries to take a closer look-Chris O\u0027Donnell is pretending not to notice, which makes things better-and Bijoux leans in to ask a question and Chloe, dazed, turns hesitantly back to the camera to try and answer it, succeeds with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren is standing next to me holding a giant glass filled with what I can only hope is not vodka and without saying a word clamps her free hand onto my ass. Alison starts heading toward us, purposefully grabbing a martini off a passing tray and getting about half of it in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get off the Xanax?\" I\u0027m murmuring to somebody quasi-famous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean get the Xanax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, get the Xanax, cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was withdrawing from marijuana addiction and so I went to my mom\u0027s doctor and-hey Victor, you\u0027re not listening to me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, don\u0027t freak, you\u0027re cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison walks up to me, licks my cheek and, standing incredibly close, places her mouth on mine, desperately trying to push her tongue in, but my teeth are clenched and I\u0027m nodding to the guy who\u0027s talking about Xanax and shrugging my shoulders, trying to casually carry on my part of the conversation, when Alison finally gives up, pulls back, leaving my mouth and chin slathered with a combo of saliva and vodka, smiles meanly and then stands next to me so that I\u0027m flanked by her and Lauren. I\u0027m watching Chloe, her interview over, squinting into the crowd trying to find me, Chris O\u0027Donnell still nursing his Grolsch. I look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison leans in and touches my ass, which I tense uselessly, causing her hand to creep across until it touches the back of Lauren\u0027s hand and freezes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-76.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
