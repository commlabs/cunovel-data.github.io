All of the figure that met the eye was gleaming metal, brilliant where it caught the Sun\u0027s rays, black with shadow where it did not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut underneath that metal was no flesh and blood, only more metal, gears, tubes, a micropile which powered the figure with nuclear energy and produced the gamma rays that Lucky had detected with his pocket ergometer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limbs of the creature were monstrous and its legs were straddled far apart as it stood there facing Lucky. What passed for its eyes were two photoelectric cells that gleamed a deep red. Its mouth was a slash across the metal on the lower part of its face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a mechanical man, a robot, and it took Lucky no more than one glance to know that it was no robot of Earth\u0027s manufacture. Earth had invented the posi-tronic robot, but it had never built any model like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot\u0027s mouth opened and closed in irregular movements as though it were speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"I cannot hear sound in a vacuum, robot.\" He said it sternly, knowing that it was essential to establish himself as a man and therefore a master at once. \"Switch to radio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now the robot\u0027s mouth remained motionless but a voice sounded in Lucky\u0027s receiver, harsh and uneven, with the words unnaturally spaced. It said, \"What is your business, sir? Why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not question me,\" said Lucky. \"Why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA robot could only be truthful. It said, \"I have been instructed to destroy certain objects at intervals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By whom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have been instructed not to answer that question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you of Sirian manufacture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was constructed on one of the planets of the Sirian Confederation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky frowned. The creature\u0027s voice was quite unpleasant. The few robots of Earth manufacture that Lucky had had occasion to see in experimental laboratories had been outfitted with voices boxes which, by direct sound or by radio, seemed as pleasant and natural as a well-cultivated human voice. Surely the Sirians would have improved on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s mind shifted to a more immediate problem. He said, \"I must find a shadowed area. Come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot said at once, \"I will direct you to the nearest shade.\" It set off at a trot, its metal legs moving with a certain irregularity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky followed the creature. He needed no direction to reach the shade, but he lagged behind to watch the robot\u0027s gait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had seemed to Lucky, from a distance, to be a lumbering or a clumsy pace, turned out, at close hand, to be a pronounced limp. A limp and a harsh voice. Two imperfections in this robot whose outer appearance was that of a magnificent mechanical marvel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt struck him forcibly that the robot might not be adjusted to the heat and radiation of Mercury. Exposure had damaged it, probably. Lucky was scientist enough to feel a twinge of regret at that. It was too beautiful to have to endure such damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe regarded the machine with admiration. Underneath that massive skull of chrome-steel was a delicate ovoid of sponge platinum-indium about the size of a human brain. Within it, quadrillions of quadrillions of positrons came into being and vanished in millionths of a second. As they came into being and vanished they traced precalculated paths which duplicated, in a simplified way, the thinking cells of the human brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngineers had calculated out those positronic paths to suit humanity, and into them they had designed the \"Three Laws of Robotics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe First Law was that a robot could not harm a human being or let one come to harm. Nothing came ahead of that. Nothing could substitute for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Second Law was that a robot must obey orders except those that would break the First Law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Third Law allowed a robot to protect itself, provided the First and Second Laws weren\u0027t broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky came out of his short reverie when the robot stumbled and almost fell. There was no unevenness in the ground that Lucky could see, no trifling ridge that might have caught his toe. If there had been, a line of black shadow would have revealed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground was table-smooth at that point. The robot\u0027s stride had simply broken for no reason and thrown him to one side. The robot recovered after threshing about wildly. Having done that, it resumed its stride toward the shade as though nothing had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky thought: It\u0027s definitely in poor working order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey entered the shadow together, and Lucky turned on his suit-light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"You do wrong to destroy necessary equipment. You are doing harm to men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no emotion in the robot\u0027s face; there could be none. Nor was there emotion in its voice. It said, \"I am obeying orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is the Second Law,\" said Lucky severely. \"Still, you may not obey orders that harm human beings. That would be to violate the First Law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have not seen any men. I have harmed no one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have harmed men you did not see. I tell you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have harmed no man,\" said the robot stubbornly, and Lucky frowned at the unthinking repetition. Despite its polished appearance, perhaps it was not a very advanced model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot went on. \"I have been instructed to avoid men. I have been warned when men were coming, but I was not warned about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky stared out past the shadow at the glittering Mercurian landscape, ruddy and gray for the most part but blotched with a large area of the crumbly black material which seemed so common in this part of Mercury. He thought of Mindes spotting the robot twice (his story made sense now) and losing it when he tried to get closer. His own secret invasion of the Sun-side, combined with the use of an ergometer, had turned the trick, fortunately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said suddenly and forcefully, \"Who warned you to avoid men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky didn\u0027t really expect to catch the robot. A robot\u0027s mind is machinery, he thought. It cannot be tricked or fooled, any more than you can trick a suit-light into going on by jumping at the switch and pretending to close contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot said, \"I have been instructed not to answer that question.\" Then slowly, creakily, as though the words were coming out against its will, it said, \"I do not wish you to ask such questions any longer. They are disturbing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky thought: To break the First Law would be more disturbing still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeliberately he stepped out of the shadow into the sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to the robot, who followed, \"What is your serial number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, RL-726, you understand I am a man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not equipped to withstand the heat of Mercury\u0027s Sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor am I,\" said the robot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize that,\" said Lucky, thinking of the robot\u0027s near-fall a few minutes earlier. \"Nevertheless, a man is much less equipped for it than is a robot. Do you understand that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, then, listen. I want you to stop your destructive activities, and I want you to tell me who ordered you to destroy equipment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am instructed... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you do not obey me,\" said Lucky loudly, \"I will remain here in the Sun until I am killed and you will have broken the First Law, since you would have allowed me to be killed when you could have stopped it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky waited grimly. A robot\u0027s statement could not be accepted as evidence, of course, in any court, but it would assure him that he was on the right track if it were to say what he expected it to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the robot said nothing. It swayed. One eye blinked out suddenly (more imperfection!), then came to life. Its voice sounded in a wordless squawk, then it said in an almost drunken mumble, \"I will carry you to safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would resist,\" said Lucky, \"and you would have to harm me. If you answer my question, I will return to the shade of my own accord, and you will have saved my life without any damage to me at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Will you tell me who ordered you to destroy equipment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly the robot lunged forward, coming to within two feet of Lucky before stopping. \"I told you not to ask that question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts hands moved forward as though to seize Lucky but did not complete the motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky watched grimly and without concern. A robot could not harm a human being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then the robot lifted one of those mighty hands and put it to its head, for all the world as though it were a man with a headache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeadache!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden thought stabbed at Lucky. Great Galaxy! He\u0027d been blind, stupidly, criminally blind!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t the robot\u0027s legs that were out of order, nor its voice, nor its eyes. How could the heat affect them? It was-it had to be-the positronic brain itself that was affected; the delicate positronic brain subjected to the direct heat and radiation of the Mercurian Sun for how long? Months?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brain must be partially broken down already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the robot had been human, one would say he was in one of the stages of mental breakdown. One might say he was on the road to insanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mad robot! Driven mad by heat and radiation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow far would the Three Laws hold in a broken-down positronic brain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now Lucky Starr stood there, threatening a robot with his own death, while that same robot, nearly mad, advanced toward him, arms outstretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very dilemma in which Lucky had placed the robot might be adding to that madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCautiously, Lucky retreated. He said, \"Do you feel well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot said nothing. Its steps quickened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky thought: If it\u0027s ready to break the First Law, it must be on the point of complete dissolution. A positronic brain would have to be in pieces to be capable of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, on the other hand, the robot had endured for months. It might endure for months more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe talked in a desperate attempt to delay matters and allow time for more thought. He said, \"Does your head ache?\" \"Ache?\" said the robot. \"I do not understand the meaning of the word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"I am growing warm. We had better retire to the shadow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more talk of heating himself to death. He retreated at a half-run now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot\u0027s voice rumbled. \"I have been told to prevent any interference with the orders given me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky reached for his blaster and he sighed. It would be unfortunate if he were forced to destroy the robot. It was a magnificent work of man, and the Council could investigate its workings with profit. And to destroy it without even having obtained the desired information was repugnant to him. Lucky said, \"Stop where you are.\" The robot\u0027s arms moved jerkily as it lunged, and Lucky escaped by a hair as he floated away in a side-wise twist, taking the fullest advantage of Mercury\u0027s gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he could maneuver his way into the shadow; if the robot followed him there...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coolness might calm those disordered positronic paths. It might become tamer, more reasonable, and Lucky might be spared the necessity of its destruction. Lucky dodged again, and again the robot rushed past, its metal legs kicking up spurts of black grit that settled back to Mercury promptly and cleanly since there was no atmosphere to keep it in suspension. It was an eerie chase, the tread of man and robot hushed and silent in the vacuum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s confidence grew somewhat. The robot\u0027s movements had grown jerkier. Its control of the gears and relays that manipulated its limbs was imperfect and growing more so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet the robot was making an obvious attempt to head him off from the shadow. It was definitely and beyond any doubt trying to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still Lucky could not bring himself to use the blaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped short. The robot stopped too. They were face to face, five feet apart, standing on the black patch of iron sulfide. The blackness seemed to make the heat all the greater and Lucky felt a gathering faintness. The robot stood grimly between Lucky and the shade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Out of my way.\" Talking was difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot said, \"I have been told to prevent any interference with the orders given me. You have been interfering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky no longer had a choice. He had miscalculated. It had never occurred to him to doubt the validity of the Three Laws under all circumstances. The truth had come to him too late, and his miscalculation had brought him to this: the danger of his own life and the necessity of destroying a robot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his blaster sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd almost at once he realized that he had made a second miscalculation. He had waited too long, and the accumulation of heat and weariness had made his body as imperfect a machine as was the robot\u0027s. His arm lifted sluggishly, and the robot seemed to be twice life-sized to his own reeling mind and sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot was a blur of motion, and this time Lucky\u0027s tired body could not be driven into quick enough movement. The blaster was struck from Lucky\u0027s hand and went flying. Lucky\u0027s arm was clamped tight in the grip of one metal hand, and Ms waist was embraced by a metal arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the best of circumstances, Lucky could not have withstood the steel muscles of the mechanical man. No human being could have. Now he felt all capacity for resistance vanish. He felt only the heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot tightened its grip, bending Lucky backward as though he were a rag doll. Lucky thought dizzily of the structural weakness of the inso-suit. An ordinary space-suit might have protected him even against a robot\u0027s strength. An inso-suit could not. Any moment, a section of it might buckle and give.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s free arm flailed helplessly, his fingers dragging into the black grit below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thought flicked through his mind. Desperately he tried to drive his muscles into one last attempt to fend off what seemed inevitable death at the hands of a mad robot. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-big-sun-of-mercury-lucky-starr-4/page-12.html","bookId":1757,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:05 AM"}
