I needed to see him face-to-face\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and see which features stared back at me, those of a handsome guy or those of a wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found him in the backyard stacking wood into a pile alongside a small shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Brandon wasn\u0027t pleased by my presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" he asked. \"I told you I couldn\u0027t see you. Especially tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to be near you, just like the wolves did when they came to see you at school,\" I confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to leave, Celeste.\" He backed away, but I followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up a few pieces of wood that had tumbled from the pile. \"You have to\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it\u0027s the only way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you will have to carry me off,\" I said, finally facing him. \"And I\u0027m much heavier than that pile of wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned the logs into the pile and stared off at the setting sun. \"Celeste, what is happening to me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pain and torment were palpable. I would have taken it all away if I could. I hugged him and he caved in on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Brandon. It seems odd, mystical, paranormal. Or maybe it\u0027s nothing at all. Maybe it\u0027s all coincidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I never felt anything like this before... until that day when I heard you calling in the woods. And then I was never the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a full moon, then. I knew it was my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d experienced Brandon Maddox through my five senses. One, I first saw Brandon in class that day that he transferred. Two, I heard him speak when Ivy and Abby confronted him. Three, we touched that day he saved me in the woods. Four, his scent still lingered on his shirt that I kept on my nightstand. Five, I had tasted his lips against mine. But there was one more sense I was desperate to witness; I needed to confirm my suspicions through the sixth sense\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the paranormal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to go\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I don\u0027t know how I\u0027ll be\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or what I\u0027ll be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held on to him with all my strength. \"It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to see for sure if what we\u0027d experienced under the last full moon was coincidence or could be explained away by another reason\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;one other than legends, folklore, or predictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe full moon shone down upon us as Brandon enveloped me in his arms and kissed me. He was so passionate and intense, I was afraid I was going to be the one who would have to throw off my coat this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon was kissing my neck when he suddenly broke away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m burning up. Like the sun is lighting me on fire\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;only there\u0027s no sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just the moon...\" I barely managed to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must leave. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had Brandon\u0027s shirt at home, so I knew last month\u0027s episode wasn\u0027t a dream. But that didn\u0027t mean I\u0027d seen what I thought I\u0027d seen. Tonight, I wouldn\u0027t let Brandon out of my sight. I had to see the transformation for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon\u0027s blue eyes turned intensely gray. He covered them and retreated. He went into the woods, using trees to block my view. He was desperate for me not to see him, but I followed him anyway. I ran past trees and jumped over fallen branches and trudged through snow. By the time I caught up to him, his hair was savagely long and lush. His face sported that sexy goatee I\u0027d seen before, and his well-muscled arms and chest were covered with a thin layer of hair. He let out a howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike last time, I backed away. My instincts told me to run for my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was something drawing me to Brandon, to this strange and powerful figure, something more than just his magnetic muscles and chiseled abs. It was his soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, I was scared. For him and for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe breathed heavily. His chest heaved; his ribs were like those of a lean animal. His stare was hypnotic; I could barely stand in his presence. I wondered if, like Juliette said, he\u0027d carry me off into the woods. Part of me wanted to escape; the other yearned to find out what might happen if I stayed\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;if I could help him, since this was all my fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI debated running, attempting to leave the uncertainty of woods on the hilltop for the safety of my home\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a simple place where werewolves were on TV or were the subjects of students\u0027 essays. However, I knew it would be impossible to outrun Brandon. In this lycan form he was powerful, perhaps invincible, and, to me, deadly attractive and soulful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Brandon appeared frightened about what he was capable of doing. He began to retreat. I sensed his turmoil. I wanted to stay, but he wanted me to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and didn\u0027t move. If he had wanted to kill me, he would have tried to already. I was safe with him for now. I extended my hand to him. I tried my best to remain calm, but my shaking revealed my fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon\u0027s brow furrowed and his piercing fangs were shining. His gray gaze bore through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and focused on my task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" I said, my voice quavering. \"I want to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t be near me like this.\" His voice was low and seductive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon was more alone than I\u0027d ever seen him before\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;more alone than he\u0027d been as a new student walking the halls of a cliquey school, more than a misunderstood outsider quietly eating his lunch in solitude, more than a guy living in a small guesthouse behind his grandparents\u0027 home, with his father a continent away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inched forward. Brandon didn\u0027t attack me. He didn\u0027t run away, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took his hand, which was sporting masculine brown hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we touched it was as if I could know his soul. Feelings of love, fear, loneliness, and euphoria raced through me as if we were one. I stared up at him. I was attracted to his spirit as much as to his shirtless body. By touching him, everything I thought I sensed about his feelings from across the hallway, lunchroom, or class I now felt as well, magnified a thousand times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen my fingers grazed his palm and the raised scar from his wolf bite. It was bright red, as if the moonlight had branded its radiance into his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed his hand to my heart. I wanted to let him know I was here for him, like he\u0027d been there for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wolf bit you under a full moon,\" I said. \"I guess the Legend\u0027s Run Werewolf folklore is true. If you hadn\u0027t saved me, then this wouldn\u0027t have happened to you. And then the kiss\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it was under a full moon as well. Dr. Meadows warned me...\" I was filled with remorse and guilt at being the one who had caused his condition. If I had heeded Dr. Meadows\u0027s warning, Brandon would have been like any other student going to school. Instead, he was a werewolf. A tear leaked and drizzled down my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There has to be more to... whatever this is,\" he reassured me. \"It\u0027s not your fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI adored Brandon\u0027s strength, not only physical but moral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached for his face. Gingerly, I touched his goatee and stubble. He melted into my tender caress as if he\u0027d been yearning for this touch for a lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smelled delightfully woodsy, like burning leaves mixed with frosting snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grazed the tips of his fangs along the tips of my fingers. Chills danced from them straight to my pounding heart. I felt completely spellbound, as though by being together\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;whether in this form or his daylight one\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I felt complete. Brandon wasn\u0027t alone, and neither was I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t go,\" I said. \"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one more thing I longed for. I felt a pull to Brandon more than ever before. If only I could get close enough to him to feel his lips against mine. By day Brandon was handsome, and by moonlight he was stunningly gorgeous and irresistible. Whatever coursed through his veins to make him a werewolf also made him unbelievably magnetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon perked up as if he had heard something in the distance. Then I, too, heard the cry of a wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon lurched away. He shook his head, his long hair flowing wildly, and held me at bay. I wasn\u0027t ready for our time together to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I knew it, I was standing in the woods alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis woodsy scent still lingered in the air, and my skin still danced from his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I knew now that it was true. I\u0027d fallen in love with a werewolf. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-20.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
