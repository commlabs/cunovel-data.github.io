But that didn\u0027t change the problem coming right down their throats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hold stretched up all around them -- the core of a mile-long asteroid, slowly spun up to provide gravity, and recently hollowed out. Delgado and Melko stood on the inside wall of the rocky cylinder. The cargo area\u0027s metal walls sunk into the rock and it was crammed with spare supplies from other asteroids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado pulled out his pistol and pressed the heavily engraved and personalized grip up to his cheek. His uncle had replaced the weapon\u0027s stock with some very rare oak back on Madrigal, and created a piece of art out of this standard-issue M6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was before the Covenant forces had glassed Madrigal. Before humans had fled to the safety of the asteroids trailing the gas giant Hesiod that the Insurrectionists who had been hiding there called \"the Rubble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado kissed the scrollwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiring around the corner of the bulkhead, he leapt for the safety of the next stack of cargo containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught a brief glimpse of his attackers -- awkwardly tall, birdlike aliens with plasma pistols gripped strong in their talonlike hands. Their beady eyes stared right at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spiny quilled mohawks on their skulls twitched. The sound of plasma shots hit the other side of the container and reverberated through the hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jackals,\" Delgado said with a wince. That was what most humans called these aliens, though they called themselves the Kig-Yar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were just one of the alien races of the so-called Covenant. The ones who\u0027d discovered humans hiding out near Hesiod in the Rubble after the destruction of Madrigal and, for some reason, chose not to wipe them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were as greedy for spoils as their human nickname suggested. Ruthless piracy raids from rogue Kig-Yar weren\u0027t uncommon in the Rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelko Hollister leaned against the old container, his gray reservist\u0027s uniform specked with blood. \"How many?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three.\" Delgado looked at his old friend, worried. They\u0027d flown their way around the Rubble\u0027s nooks and crannies together and helped each other stagger back from late night binges for years. They were close enough people often mistook them for brothers. \"What happened to you? Looks like something ran you over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think I\u0027m in bad shape?\" Melko coughed. \"Should see the other guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado kept his back to the container, gun aimed at the edge. \"You killed one of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We turned the corner at the same time.\" Melko stepped back, chancing a glance around the other side of the container. He held his handgun in his right hand while his left clenched his stomach. \"I fired first. I fired second. I fired the third time, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d the blood come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the other Jackals fired fourth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado shook his head. This had gotten out of control. He reached in his pocket and pulled out the instigator of all their troubles: a tiny chip, lying in the heart of a toughened case just smaller than his thumb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe information inside never used to be all that special, back when the planet Madrigal was a thriving Outer Colony world. Back before the Covenant destroyed it, and the survivors fled to the drifting rocks of the Rubble. Back before the United Nations Space Command abandoned them all. And back before Delgado ended up here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe location of Earth had been commonplace, buried in the heart of every ship making the long jumps back to the Inner Colonies and on to the home world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\" Delgado handed the chip to Melko.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, as far as anyone here knew, this chip contained the only known navigation maps that could get someone back. All the others had been destroyed, rooted out by viruses, or the ships they were on mysteriously disabled and all info wiped clean. All this had happened in the last week or so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had radically changed things in the Rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelko slipped the black oval into a thigh pocket. \"Jackals are getting pushy, trying to sneak in here for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were. And Delgado didn\u0027t like it. Although the Kig-Yar here in the Rubble had been relatively peaceful, and even worked to help build the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003easteroid Habitats, deep down Delgado could never trust anything Covenant. Not after seeing the glowing remains of Madrigal from orbit as a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis just confirmed a deeper suspicion. The Covenant were never up to any good, and Delgado\u0027s people were probably at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, for Delgado, it was important the navigation data be kept from them at any cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado gauged the distance to the airlock from their cluster of containers. \"Make the run, Melko, I\u0027ll hold them off. When you get on board Distancia, blow the locks and make a hard run for it, in case there\u0027s a Jackal ship waiting. Start calling for help the moment you punch out.\" He held up the scrimshawed gun. \"Me and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSen ora Sies here will hold them back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t...\" Melko started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I try running to the ship after you it\u0027ll slow everything down -- they\u0027ll be able to come running in too. At the very least, this splits them, and confuses them. They\u0027ll be expecting us both to make a run for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelko grabbed Delgado\u0027s arm. \"Okay. But the moment you hear me cut free and the emergency overrides shut the doors, you bug out of here and keep clear of the Jackals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe asteroids of the Rubble were all connected to each other by flexible docking tubes. Once\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistancia was away, Delgado planned to use those to get out of this storage facility and into the larger asteroid complex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were bloody smudge marks on Delgado\u0027s forearm. \"No problem there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of something crawling on top of one of the containers made Delgado look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it\u0027s time,\" Melko said. He handed over his plain handgun. \"You\u0027ll need the extra firepower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. Hey, mijo,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado said. \"See you on the other side. In three,\" and held out three fingers. Three ... two ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one Melko leapt forward and threaded his way through the maze of containers that stood between him and the airlock. Delgado quickly followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jackal on the top of the container ran forward, focused on Melko. It looked down, spotted Delgado aiming up at it, and raised its curved firearm to shoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late. Delgado pulled the trigger three times and the large, birdlike alien screeched as the shots hit home. Purple blood made a faint cloud in the air, and as the Jackal fell forward, an oval energy shield flickered on from a bracelet strapped to its right hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado had made it across a corridor to a gap in the containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other two Jackals would turn the corner any second. He dropped the empty magazine out of his handgun one-handed, keeping Melko\u0027s handgun\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaimed forward. He slid another magazine out of his pocket awkwardly with the fingers that still held\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSen ora Sies, wiggling the tip in until it clipped, and then shoving it home against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept both up, aimed and ready, and as the Jackals turned the corner, he let off a withering burst of shots. The aliens slid to a stop and ducked back behind the container, but not before firing back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMetal splashed around Delgado, searing his ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as he clutched at burned skin with a hand, he heard the thunderclap of explosive decompression from the other side of the containers. Air rustled, and then roared past as it was sucked out into the void past the open airlock Melko used when he\u0027d cleared out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jackals shot clear of the corner, triple-jointed legs jerking and their oval energy shields flaring as they ran at Delgado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe emptied his magazines uselessly against their violet translucent shields and stood ready with gritted teeth as they lowered them to bring energy pistols to bear on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gray blur dropped down from a set of containers stacked four high behind the Jackals. Massive boots struck the fused rock floor, leaving large dents in place and tossing up shattered rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado stared as the massive gray statue with the gold-faced helmet shot the nearest Jackal in the torso with a full round of submachine-gun fire, point blank. Then it yanked the butt of the gun up hard into the other Jackal\u0027s long, jagged-toothed jaw as it turned to face the sudden threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jackal flew back, purple blood slinging up in a long arc above it in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limp body of the alien landed at Delgado\u0027s feet with a crunch, then slid past him, slamming into the container at his back as the Jackal\u0027s blood rained to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long trail of slick purple wetness pointed back toward the tall, armored soldier that stood where the Jackal had been. The armor-plating, chipped, scarred, and dull with wear, shifted as it removed its helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran a gray-gauntleted hand over her tightly tied-back hair, surveying her handiwork. \"Now that I\u0027ve done you a favor,\" she said in a Slavic-accented voice, \"I don\u0027t suppose you could return it and tell me where your friend is headed in that little spaceship of yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado felt something sticky and wet spreading down his side, and patted at it. His fingers came up red with his own blood. He shook his head and staggered, then slumped to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenora Sies and Melko\u0027s gun skittered away from him as he let go of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn.\" The woman thudded her way over and crouched by him. She unfolded a small med kit and pulled out a can of bio-foam and some field dressings. She had very blue eyes for such an efficient killer, Delgado thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are you?\" he asked, as she ripped his shirt open to spray the foam. It stung as it sealed the wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Spartan.\" She wrapped tape around his torso to hold the bandage on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard rumors about Spartans out here. But figured if you really existed you\u0027d be all off in the Inner Colonies now, fighting the Covenant for the UNSC. What are you doing out here, behind enemy lines?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatisfied with her emergency medical work, the Spartan leaned back. \"Some of us get more bizarre assignments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were always rumors that Spartan soldiers were around, sneaking about and causing trouble. But then, people also blamed gremlins in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eequipment for causing random, unexplained trouble. One didn\u0027t believe it. Spartans were like boogey-men to the Insurrectionists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re after the navigation data too, huh?\" Delgado realized, wondering if the navigation data was the whole reason they were here, or if they somehow had gotten abandoned in the Rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe massive Spartan smiled. \"If the Jackals get their claws on that chip everyone will suffer.\" She leaned forward and placed a small pin into his open hand. The gauntlet was surprisingly careful and precise as she folded his hand into a fist, the device inside it. \"If you ever want to hand it over, just trigger this beacon, we\u0027ll come calling. We\u0027ll certainly protect it better than you\u0027re doing right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado shook his head. He didn\u0027t trust the Kig-Yar. But the UNSC was far from loved out here, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"A shame.\" She scooted back and picked up\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenora Sies and tilted it in her hands to examine it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado held his hand up, and she gave it back to him. \"Nice piece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My uncle spent three weeks on it,\" Delgado gasped. His side still hurt. \"He\u0027s talented.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartan cocked her head, listening to her earpiece. \"Your backup has arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\" Delgado tried to stand, but gave that up the moment he shifted and felt the pain rush up through him. \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartan stood, looming over him. \"My name is Adriana. Spartan One-One-One.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ignatio Delgado.\" Delgado held up his hand again. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdriana shook his offered hand, carefully. \"You\u0027re welcome, Mr. Delgado. Just remember this. I was not here, and I certainly did not help you. There are no Spartans going bump in the night. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatio didn\u0027t, really. He was feeling quite dizzy. But he nodded anyway. It seemed prudent, sitting on the floor in front of this titan in her suit of armor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery prudent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, Mr. Delgado.\" Adriana let go of his hand and pulled her helmet back on. The voice that came out from the helmet sounded powerful and amplified. \"Good-bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leapt up onto the nearest container, then thudded off, leaving Delgado to wait for his rescuers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUNSC DESTROYER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARMAGEDDON\u0027S EDGE,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOUTER FRINGES, ECTANUS 45 SYSTEM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the cyrogenic darkness came a deep, crisp-sounding, but slightly amused voice. \"Wakey, wakey, Professor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob Keyes sat up and took his first deep breath.
