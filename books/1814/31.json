But I was hoping I was wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores agrees, “Weren’t we all. I don’t know what was worse— having to listen to my mother moaning in ecstasy, or hearing him beg for more and having to visualize what the f**k she was doing to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cover my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all do. It starts off small, and then builds—to a tablesmacking, eye-tearing, bent-over-at-the-waist crescendo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh . . . my . . . God!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even though Delores is cackling, she insists, “It’s not funny! I think my girl parts are broken. Every time I think about it, my vagina clamps down like a littleneck clam fighting to stay closed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe howl louder. And it’s the first real, genuine laughter I’ve had since this all began. My cheeks hurt and my sides ache—and it feels wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know, sometimes I try and picture what my life would be like if Dee Dee wasn’t in it. And then I stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I just really can’t imagine it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we got Delores settled in my room, Billy put a call in to his manager. he planned to do a show here at a little bar called Sam’s Place, where he used to play in high school. he wanted to honor the place where he came from—give something back to the locals, like Bruce Springsteen always does at the Stone Pony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Sam’s Place is where we are right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s packed—standing room only. Delores and I are in front, our arms bumping against each other as we dance and sing. Billy’s up on stage, a few songs into his first set. he looks fantastic. Dark jeans, a crisp white button-down, and a clean-shaven chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe knows just how to work the crowd—when to get them fired up with a guitar-screaming riff or settle them down with soft ballad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never been more proud of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe song ends and someone in the back yells that they love him. Billy looks down and laughs, a little bashful. Then he brings his mouth to the microphone. “I love you guys too. So this next song is new. I haven’t played it for any of the suits yet, but I wanted to play it for you tonight. It’s for someone . . . who believed in me . . . even when there wasn’t much of a reason to. And I want her to know that I’ll always have her back, that she’ll always be in my heart, and she’ll never be alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis eyes find mine in the crowd. And he winks. I nod, message\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereceived. Then he starts to sing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYears feel like yesterday\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I can’t believe how fast time flies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t want to let another second go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout letting you know\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat you always should have known\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll catch you if you stumble\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePick you up if you fall\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHold you when you’re hurting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut baby, most of all,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll be there . . . so you’ll never be alone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t ever feel alone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beat pulses in my stomach. And I listen to the words. And I think about how lucky I am to have all the things I do. Priceless, precious blessings. I have a family that loves me. Friends who would kill for me. Literally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I think about who I am. I survived my father’s death with my soul intact. I graduated Wharton School at the top of my class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember when I first started working at the firm? And Drew Evans was the golden boy? And I put him right in his place— kicked his ass from one end of the office to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I was stubborn. And smart. And because I believed I was capable. Drew once told me you can change the color of the walls, but the room would still be the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was all those things before him—and I’m still all those things now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom now on, each day that goes by Gonna give it my best try To show you what you mean to me ’Cause if I don’t have you on my side None of this means anything Don’t want to let another second go Without letting you know What you always should have known have you ever lost your keys? And you check all your pockets and pull the cushions off the couch. And then—after searching for ten minutes—you turn around and there they are. On the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight in front of you the whole time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost . . . like the answer was too easy to see right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what this feels like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause suddenly I know what I want. I’m confident. Certain. And I know what I’m capable of. It won’t be easy—the greatest achievements in life never are. Things like climbing Everest, or becoming the president? They’re difficult. But so worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll catch you if you stumble\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePick you up if you fall\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHold you when you’re hurting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut baby, most of all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll be there . . . so you’ll never be alone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t ever feel alone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagine myself a few years from now, walking home on the city streets from the job I love—one hand holding a briefcase, the other holding the small, sweet hand of my little girl or boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I picture us at the dining-room table, working on homework and talking about our day. I see story times, and bedtimes, tickle-times, hugs, and butterfly kisses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a single mother wasn’t something I’d ever planned to be . . . but now? It’s who I want to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll be there every step of the way\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWon’t miss a moment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll be there every step of the way\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWon’t miss a moment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know that saying? The best-laid plans of mice and men . . . ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might want to remember that right about now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause as soon as the decision takes root in my mind, I feel a dull throbbing. You ladies will know what I’m talking about. That pulling cramp in my lower abdomen. And a thick, warm wetness oozes out from between my legs, seeping into my underwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heartbeat pounds against my chest, and I head for the restrooms. hoping I’m wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut once I’m in the stall, I see that I’m not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumble back out of the bathroom, into the crowd. My hands shaking with dread, with fear. Because this is wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrong, wrong, wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab Delores’s arm and tell her. But the music’s too loud, and she doesn’t hear me. I pull her to the back of the bar, where it’s quieter, and I force the words out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dee, I’m bleeding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForest Gump had it all wrong. Life isn’t like a box of chocolates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoctors are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vivacious but inexperienced physician right out of medical school, or the battle-hardened know-it-all finishing the last minutes of a twenty-hour shift—you never know what you’re gonna get. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-tangled-2/page-31.html","bookId":1814,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM"}
