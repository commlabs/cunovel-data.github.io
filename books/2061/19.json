I hadn\u0027t been to Mason\u0027s room, but I remembered him mentioning the number once and found it without difficulty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShane, Mason\u0027s roommate, opened the door a few moments after I knocked. \"Hey, Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped aside for me, and I walked in, peering around. Some infomercial was playing on the TV- one downside of a nocturnal life was a shortage of good programming- and empty soda cans covered nearly every flat surface. There was no sign of Mason anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShane stifled a yawn. \"I thought he was with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen him all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yawned again, then frowned in thought. \"He was throwing some stuff in a bag earlier. I figured you guys were running off for some crazy romantic getaway. Picnic or something. Hey, nice dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I murmured, feeling a frown of my own coming on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePacking a bag? That didn\u0027t make any sense. There was nowhere to go. There was no way to go, either. This resort was as tightly guarded as the Academy. Lissa and I had only managed to break out of that place with compulsion, and it had still been a pain in the ass. Yet, why on earth would Mason pack a bag if he wasn\u0027t leaving?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked Shane a few more questions and decided to follow up on the possibility, crazy as it seemed. I found the guardian in charge of security and scheduling. He gave me the names of those guardians who\u0027d been on duty around the resort\u0027s borders when Mason had last been seen. Most of the names I knew, and most were off duty now, making them easy to find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the first couple hadn\u0027t seen Mason around today. When they asked why I wanted to know, I gave vague answers and hurried off. The third person on my list was a guy named Alan, a guardian who usually worked the Academy\u0027s lower campus. He was just coming in after skiing, taking his equipment off near the door. Recognizing me, he smiled as I approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, I saw him,\" he said, bending down to his boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief flooded over me. Until then, I hadn\u0027t realized how worried I\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where he is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Let him and Eddie Castile...and, what\u0027s her name, the Rinaldi girl, out through the north gate and didn\u0027t see them after that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared. Alan continued unhooking his skis as though we were discussing slope conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You let Mason and Eddie ... and Mia out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um ... why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished and looked back up at me, a kind of happy and bemused look on his face. \"Because they asked me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn icy feeling started creeping through me. I found out which guardian had watched the north gate with Alan and immediately sought him out. That guardian gave me the same response. He\u0027d let Mason, Eddie, and Mia out, no questions asked. And, like Alan, he didn\u0027t seem to think there was anything wrong with that. He appeared almost dazed. It was a look I\u0027d seen before ... a look that came over people when Lissa used compulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn particular, I\u0027d seen it happen when Lissa didn\u0027t want people to remember something very well. She could bury the memory in them, either erasing it all together or planting it for later. She was so good at compulsion, though, that she could just make people forget completely. For them to still have some memories meant someone who wasn\u0027t as good at compulsion had worked on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone, say, like Mia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t the fainting type, but for just a moment, I felt like I could keel over. The world spun, and I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. When I could see again, my surroundings stayed stable. Okay. No problem. I would reason this out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason, Eddie, and Mia had left the resort earlier today. Not only that, they had done it by using compulsion- which was utterly forbidden. They hadn\u0027t told anyone. They\u0027d left through the north gate. I\u0027d seen a map of the resort. The north gate guarded a driveway that connected to the only semi-major road in the area, a small highway that led to a little town about twelve miles away. The town Mason had mentioned that had buses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Spokane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpokane- where this traveling pack of Strigoi and their humans might be living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpokane- where Mason could fulfill all his crazy dreams of slaying Strigoi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpokane- which he only knew about because of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, no,\" I murmured to myself, almost running toward my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, I stripped off the dress and changed into heavy winter clothes: boots, jeans, and a sweater. Grabbing my coat and gloves, I hurried back toward the door and then paused. I was acting without thinking. What was I actually going to do? I needed to tell someone, obviously...but that would get the trio in a lot of trouble. It would also tip Dimitri off that I\u0027d gone and gossiped about the Spokane Strigoi information he\u0027d told me in confidence as a sign of respecting my maturity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied the time. It would take a while for anyone around the resort to know we were missing. If I could actually get out of the resort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, I found myself knocking on Christian\u0027s door. He answered, looking sleepy and cynical as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027ve come to apologize for her,\" he told me loftily, \"you can just go ahead and- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shut up,\" I snapped. \"This isn\u0027t about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHastily, I relayed the details of what was going on. Even Christian didn\u0027t have a witty response for that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So...Mason, Eddie, and Mia went to Spokane to hunt Strigoi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit. Why didn\u0027t you go with them? Seems like something you\u0027d do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resisted the urge to smack him. \"Because I\u0027m not insane! But I\u0027m going to go get them before they do something even stupider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when Christian caught on. \"And what do you need from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to get off the resort\u0027s property. They got Mia to use compulsion on the guards. I need you to do the same thing. I know you\u0027ve practiced it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have,\" he agreed. \"But...well...\" For the first time ever, he looked embarrassed. \"I\u0027m not very good at it. And doing it on dhampirs is nearly impossible. Liss is a hundred times better than me. Or probably any Moroi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But I don\u0027t want her to get in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"But you don\u0027t mind if I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a piece of work, you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I do, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, five minutes later, he and I found ourselves trekking out to the north gate. The sun was coming up, so most everyone was inside. This was a good thing, and I hoped it\u0027d make our escape that much easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid, stupid, I kept thinking. This was going to blow up in our faces. Why had Mason done this? I knew he\u0027d had this whole crazy vigilante attitude...and he\u0027d certainly seemed upset that the guardians hadn\u0027t done anything about the recent attack. But still. Was he really that unhinged? He had to know how dangerous this was. Was it possible...was it possible I\u0027d upset him so much with the making-out disaster that he\u0027d gone off the deep end? Enough to go do this and get Mia and Eddie to join him? Not that those two would be hard to convince. Eddie would follow Mason anywhere, and Mia was almost as gung ho as Mason to kill every Strigoi in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, out of all the questions I had about this, one thing was definitely clear. I\u0027d told Mason about the Strigoi in Spokane. Hands down, this was my fault, and without me, none of this would have happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lissa always makes eye contact,\" I coached Christian as we approached the exit. \"And speaks in a really, like, calm voice. I don\u0027t know what else. I mean, she concentrates a lot too, so try that. Focus on forcing your will on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he snapped. \"I\u0027ve seen her do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I snapped back. \"Just trying to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquinting, I saw that only one guardian stood at the gate, a total stroke of luck. They were in between shifts. With the sun out, the risk of Strigoi had disappeared. The guardians would still continue in their duties, but they could relax just a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy on duty didn\u0027t seem particularly alarmed by our appearance. \"What are you kids doing out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian swallowed. I could see the lines of tension on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to let us out of the gate,\" he said. A note of nervousness made his voice tremble, but otherwise, he did a fair approximation of Lissa\u0027s soothing tones. Unfortunately, it had no effect on the guardian. As Christian had pointed out, using compulsion on a guardian was nearly impossible. Mia had gotten lucky. The guardian grinned at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he asked, clearly amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian tried again. \"You\u0027re going to let us out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy\u0027s smile faltered just a little, and I saw him blink in surprise. His eyes didn\u0027t glaze over in the same way Lissa\u0027s victims did, but Christian had done enough to briefly enthrall him. Unfortunately, I could tell right then and there that it wouldn\u0027t be enough to make him let us out and forget. Fortunately, I\u0027d been trained to compel people without the use of magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting near his post was an enormous Maglite, two feet long and easily seven pounds. I grabbed the Maglite and clocked him on the back of the head. He grunted and crumpled to the ground. He\u0027d barely seen me coming, and despite the horribleness of what I\u0027d just done, I kind of wished one of my instructors had been there to grade me on such an awesome performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ,\" exclaimed Christian. \"You just assaulted a guardian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" So much for getting the guys back without getting anyone in trouble. \"I didn\u0027t know just how much you sucked at compulsion. I\u0027ll deal with the fallout later. Thanks for your help. You should head back before the next shift comes on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head and grimaced. \"No, I\u0027m going with you on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I argued. \"I only needed you to get through the gate. You don\u0027t have to get in trouble over this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m already in trouble!\" He pointed at the guardian. \"He saw my face. I\u0027m screwed either way, so I might as well help you save the day. Stop being a bitch for a change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hurried off, and I cast one last, guilty glance at the guardian. I was pretty sure I hadn\u0027t hit him hard enough to cause real damage, and with the sun coming out, he wouldn\u0027t freeze or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter about five minutes of walking down the highway, I knew we had a problem. Despite being covered and wearing sunglasses, the sun was taking its toll on Christian. It was slowing us down, and it wouldn\u0027t take that long for someone to find the guardian I\u0027d taken out and come after us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car- not one of the Academy\u0027s- appeared behind us, and I made a decision. I didn\u0027t approve of hitchhiking in the least. Even someone like me knew how dangerous it was. But we needed to get to town fast, and I prayed Christian and I could take down any creepy stalker guy who tried to mess with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, when the car pulled over, it was just a middle-aged couple who looked more concerned than anything else. \"You kids okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked my thumb behind me. \"Our car slid off the road. Can you take us to town so I can call my dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt worked. Fifteen minutes later, they dropped us off at a gas station. I actually had trouble getting rid of them because they wanted to help us so much. Finally, we convinced them we\u0027d be fine, and we walked the few blocks over to the bus station. As I\u0027d suspected, this town wasn\u0027t much of a hub for real travel. Three lines serviced the town: two that went to other ski resorts and one that went to Lowston, Idaho. From Lowston, you could go on to other places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d half-hoped that we might beat Mason and the others before their bus came. Then we could have hauled them back without any trouble. Unfortunately, there was no sign of them. The cheery woman at the counter knew exactly who we were talking about, too. She confirmed that all three of them had bought tickets to Spokane by way of Lowston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it,\" I said. The woman raised her eyebrows at my language. I turned to Christian. \"You got money for the bus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian and I didn\u0027t talk much along the way, except for me to tell him he\u0027d been an idiot about Lissa and Adrian. By the time we reached Lowston, I finally had him convinced, which was a minor miracle. He slept the rest of the way to Spokane, but I couldn\u0027t. I just kept thinking over and over that this was my fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late afternoon by the time we reached Spokane. It took a few people, but we finally found someone who knew the shopping center Dimitri had mentioned. It was a long ways from the bus station, but it was walkable. My legs were stiff after almost five hours of riding a bus, and I wanted the movement. The sun was a while from setting, but it was lower and less detrimental to vampires, so Christian didn\u0027t mind the walk either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, as often happened when I was in calm settings, I felt a tug into Lissa\u0027s head. I let myself fall into her because I wanted to know what was happening back at the resort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you want to protect them, but we need to know where they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa sat on the bed in our room while Dimitri and my mom stared her down. It was Dimitri who had spoken. Seeing him through her eyes was interesting. She had a fond respect for him, very different from the intense roller coaster of emotions I always experienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you,\" said Lissa, \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustration and fear for us burned through her. It saddened me to see her so anxious, but at the same time, I was glad I hadn\u0027t gotten her involved. She couldn\u0027t report what she didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe they wouldn\u0027t have told you where they were going,\" said my mother. Her words sounded flat, but there were lines of worry on her face. \"Especially with your...bond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It only works one way,\" said Lissa sadly. \"You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri knelt down so he could be at Lissa\u0027s height and look her in the eye. He pretty much had to do that to look anyone in the eye. \"Are you sure there\u0027s nothing? Nothing at all you can tell us? They\u0027re nowhere in town. The man at the bus station didn\u0027t see them ... though we\u0027re pretty sure that\u0027s where they must have gone. We need something, anything to go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMan at the bus station? That was another stroke of luck. The woman who\u0027d sold us the tickets must have gone home. Her replacement wouldn\u0027t know us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa gritted her teeth and glared. \"Don\u0027t you think if I knew, I\u0027d tell you? You don\u0027t think I\u0027m worried about them too? I have no idea where they are. None. And why\u0027d they even leave... it doesn\u0027t make any sense either. Especially why they\u0027d go with Mia, of all people.\" A twinge of hurt flickered through the bond, hurt at being left out of whatever we were doing, no matter how wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri sighed and leaned back on his heels. From the look on his face, he obviously believed her. It was also obvious that he was worried- worried in more than a professional way. And seeing that concern- that concern for me- ate up my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose?\" Christian\u0027s voice brought me back to myself. \"We\u0027re here, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plaza consisted of a wide, open area in front of a shopping center. A caf¨¦ was carved into a corner of the main building, its tables spilling out into the open area. A crowd moved in and out of the complex, busy even at this time of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, how do we find them?\" asked Christian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"Maybe if we act like Strigoi, they\u0027ll try to stake us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small, reluctant smile played over his face. He didn\u0027t want to admit it, but he\u0027d thought my joke was funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and I went inside. Like any mall, it was filled with familiar chains, and a selfish part of me thought that maybe if we found the group soon enough, we could still get in shopping time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian and I walked the length of it twice and saw no signs of our friends or anything resembling tunnels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we\u0027re in the wrong place,\" I finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe they are,\" suggested Christian. \"They could have gone to some other- wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed, and I followed the gesture. The three renegades sat at a table in the middle of the food court, looking dejected. They looked so miserable, I almost felt sorry for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d kill for a camera right now,\" said Christian, smirking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t funny,\" I told him, striding toward the group. Inside, I breathed a sigh of relief. The group clearly hadn\u0027t found any Strigoi, were all still alive, and could maybe be taken back before we got in even more trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t notice me until I was almost right next to them. Eddie\u0027s head jerked up. \"Rose? What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you out of your mind?\" I yelled. A few people nearby gave us surprised looks. \"Do you know how much trouble you\u0027re in? How much trouble you\u0027ve gotten us in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell did you find us?\" asked Mason in a low voice, glancing anxiously around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys aren\u0027t exactly criminal masterminds,\" I told them. \"Your informant at the bus station gave you away. That, and I figured out that you\u0027d want to go off on your pointless Strigoi-hunting quest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look Mason gave me revealed he still wasn\u0027t entirely happy with me. It was Mia who replied, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t pointless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" I demanded. \"Did you kill any Strigoi? Did you even find any?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" admitted Eddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" I said. \"You got lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you so against killing Strigoi?\" asked Mia hotly. \"Isn\u0027t that what you train for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I train for sane missions, not childish stunts like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t childish,\" she cried. \"They killed my mother. And the guardians weren\u0027t doing anything. Even their information is bad. There weren\u0027t any Strigoi in the tunnels. Probably none in the whole city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian looked impressed. \"You found the tunnels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Eddie. \"But like she said, they were useless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should see them before we go,\" Christian told me. \"It\u0027d be kind of cool, and if the data was bad, there\u0027s no danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I snapped. \"We\u0027re going home. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason looked tired. \"We\u0027re going to search the city again. Even you can\u0027t make us go back, Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but the school\u0027s guardians can when I call and tell them you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall it blackmailing or being a tattletale; the effect was the same. The three of them looked at me like I had just simultaneously gut-punched them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d really do that?\" asked Mason. \"You\u0027d sell us out like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my eyes, wondering desperately why I was trying to be the voice of reason here. Where was the girl who\u0027d run away from school? Mason had been right. I had changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t about selling anyone out. This is about keeping you guys alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think we\u0027re that defenseless?\" asked Mia. \"You think we\u0027d get killed right away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"Unless you\u0027ve found some way to use water as a weapon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flushed and didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We brought silver stakes,\" said Eddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFantastic. They must have stolen them. I looked at Mason pleadingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mason. Please. Call this off. Let\u0027s go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me for a long time. Finally, he sighed. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie and Mia looked aghast, but Mason had assumed a leadership role with them, and they didn\u0027t have the initiative to go on without him. Mia seemed to take it the hardest, and I felt bad for her. She\u0027d barely had any real time to grieve for her mother; she\u0027d just jumped right on board with this revenge thing as a way to cope with the pain. She\u0027d have a lot to deal with when we got back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian was still excited about the idea of the underground tunnels. Considering he spent all his time in an attic, I shouldn\u0027t have been all that surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the schedule,\" he told me. \"We\u0027ve got a while before the next bus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t go walking into some Strigoi lair,\" I argued, walking toward the mall\u0027s entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are no Strigoi there,\" said Mason. \"It\u0027s seriously all janitorial stuff. There was no sign of anything weird. I really do think the guardians had bad information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose,\" said Christian, \"let\u0027s get something fun out of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all looked at me. I felt like a mom who wouldn\u0027t buy her kids candy at the grocery store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, fine. Just a peek, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others led Christian and me to the opposite end of the mall, through a door marked staff only. We dodged a couple of janitors, then slipped through another door that led us to a set of stairs going down. I had a brief moment of d¨¦j¨¤ vu, recalling the steps down to Adrian\u0027s spa party. Only these stairs were dirtier and smelled pretty nasty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the bottom. It wasn\u0027t so much a tunnel as a narrow corridor, lined in grime-caked cement. Ugly fluorescent lights were embedded sporadically along the walls. The passage went off to our left and right. Boxes of ordinary cleaning and electrical supplies sat around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" said Mason. \"Boring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed in each direction. \"What\u0027s down there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" sighed Mia. \"We\u0027ll show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked down to the right and found more of the same. I was starting to agree with the boring assessment when we passed some black writing on one of the walls. I stopped and looked at it. It was a list of letters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eV\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome had lines and x marks next to them, but for the most part the message was incoherent. Mia noticed my scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s probably a janitor thing,\" she said. \"Or maybe some gang did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably,\" I said, still studying it. The others shifted restlessly, not understanding my fascination with the jumble of letters. I didn\u0027t understand my fascination either, but something in my head tugged at me to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB for Badica, Z for Zeklos, I for Ivashkov ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared. The first letter of every royal family\u0027s name was there. There were three D names, but based on the order, you could actually read the list as a size ranking. It started with the smaller families- Dragomir, Badica, Conta- and went all the way up to the giant Ivashkov clan. I didn\u0027t understand the dashes and lines beside the letters, but I quickly noticed which names had an x beside them: Badica and Drozdov.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped back from the wall. \"We have to get out of here,\" I said. My own voice scared me a little. \"Right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others looked at me in surprise. \"Why?\" asked Eddie. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you later. We just need to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason pointed in the direction we\u0027d been heading. \"This lets out a few blocks away. It\u0027s closer to the station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peered down into the dark unknown. \"No,\" I said. \"We\u0027re going back the way we came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all looked at me like I was insane as we retraced our steps, but nobody questioned me yet. When we emerged from the mall\u0027s front, I breathed a sigh of relief to see that the sun was still out, though it was steadily sinking into the horizon and casting orange and red light onto the buildings. The remaining light would still be enough for us to get back to the bus station before we were really in any danger of seeing Strigoi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I knew now that there really were Strigoi in Spokane. Dimitri\u0027s information had been correct. I didn\u0027t know what the list meant, but it clearly had something to do with the attacks. I needed to report it to the other guardians immediately, and I certainly couldn\u0027t tell the others what I\u0027d realized until we were safely at the lodge. Mason was likely to go back into the tunnels if he knew what I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of our walk back to the station proceeded in silence. I think my mood had cowed the others. Even Christian seemed to have run out of snide comments. Inside, my emotions swirled, oscillating between anger and guilt as I kept reexamining my role in everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead of me, Eddie stopped walking, and I nearly ran into him. He looked around. \"Where are we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnapping out of my own thoughts, I surveyed the area too. I didn\u0027t remember these buildings. \"Damn it,\" I exclaimed. \"Are we lost? Didn\u0027t anyone keep track of which way we went?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an unfair question since I clearly hadn\u0027t paid attention either, but my temper had pushed me past reason. Mason studied me for a few moments, then pointed. \"This way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turned and walked down a narrow street between two buildings. I didn\u0027t think we were going the right way, but I didn\u0027t really have a better idea. I also didn\u0027t want to stand around debating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hadn\u0027t gone very far when I heard the sound of an engine and squealing tires. Mia was walking in the middle of the road, and protective conditioning kicked in before I even saw what was coming. Grabbing her, I jerked her out of the street and up against one of the building walls. The boys had done the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large, gray van with tinted windows had rounded the corner and was headed in our direction. We pressed flat against the wall, waiting for it to go past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly it didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreeching to a halt, it stopped right in front of us, and the doors slid open. Three big guys spilled out, and again, my instincts kicked in. I had no clue who they were or what they wanted, but they clearly weren\u0027t friendly. That was all I needed to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them moved toward Christian, and I struck out and punched him. The guy barely staggered but was clearly surprised to have felt it at all, I think. He probably hadn\u0027t expected someone as small as me to be much of a threat. Ignoring Christian, he moved toward me. In my peripheral vision, I saw Mason and Eddie squaring off with the other two. Mason had actually pulled out his stolen silver stake. Mia and Christian stood there, frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur attackers were relying a lot on bulk. They didn\u0027t have the sort of background we had in offensive and defensive techniques. Plus, they were human, and we had dhampir strength. Unfortunately, we also had the disadvantage of being cornered against the wall. We had nowhere to retreat to. Most importantly, we had something to lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Mia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy who\u0027d been sparring with Mason seemed to realize this. He backed off from Mason and instead grabbed her. I barely saw the flash of his gun before its barrel was pressed against her neck. Backing off from my own adversary, I yelled at Eddie to stop. We\u0027d all been trained to respond instantly to those kinds of orders, and he halted his attack, glancing at me questioningly When he saw Mia, his face went pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted nothing more than to keep pummeling these men- whoever they were- but I couldn\u0027t risk this guy hurting Mia. He knew it, too. He didn\u0027t even have to make the threat. He was human, but he knew enough about us to know that we\u0027d go out of our way to protect the Moroi. Novices had a saying grilled into us from an early age: Only they matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stopped and looked between him and me. Apparently we were the acknowledged leaders here. \"What do you want?\" I asked harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy pressed his gun closer to Mia\u0027s neck, and she whimpered. For all her talk about fighting, she was smaller than me and not nearly as strong. And she was too terrified to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man inclined his head toward the van\u0027s open door. \"I want you to get inside. And don\u0027t start anything. You do, and she\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Mia, the van, my other friends, and then back to the guy. Shit. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/frostbite-vampire-academy-2/page-19.html","bookId":2061,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:14 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:14 AM"}
