Woman, you do amaze me again\". He hesitated. \"I do wish you’d have let me come with you\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My husband\", Leilwin whispered, \"you are as brave and stout a man as any woman could wish on her crew. But you move with all of the stillness of a bear charging through a river\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted, but joined them as they left the edge of the camp, quietly and carefully. About ten minutes away, Egwene finally trusted herself to embrace the Source. Glorying in it, she made a gateway for them and Skimmed to the White Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha ran with the rest of the Aiel through gateways. They surged, like floodwaters, into the valley of Thakan’dar. Two waves, rushing down from opposite sides of the valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha did not carry a spear; that was not her place. Instead, she was a spear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was joined by two men in black coats, five Wise Ones, the woman Alivia and ten of Rand\u0027s sworn Aes Sedai with Warders. None of them save Alivia had responded well to having Aviendha placed above them. The Asha’man did not like having to answer to any woman, the Wise Ones didn’t like being ordered by Rand at all, and the Aes Sedai still thought of Aiel channelers as inferior. They all obeyed the order anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand had whispered to her in a quiet moment to watch them all for Darkfriends. Fear did not make him speak those words, but his sense of realism. Shadows could creep anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were Trollocs here in the valley and some Myrddraal, but they had not anticipated this attack. The Aiel took advantage of their disarray and commenced a slaughter. Aviendha led her group of channelers toward the forge, that massive gray-roofed building. The Shadow-forgers turned from their inexorable movement, showing just a hint of confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha wove Fire at one, removing its head from its shoulders. The body turned to stone, then started to crumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seemed a signal to the other channelers, and Shadow-forgers through the valley began to explode. They were said to be terrible warriors when provoked, with skin that turned aside swords. That might just be rumor, as few Aiel had ever actually danced the spears with a Shadow-forger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha didn’t particularly want to discover the truth. She let her team end the first group of Shadow-forgers, and tried not to think too hard about the death and destruction these things had caused during their unnatural lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shadowspawn tried to mount a defense, some of the Myrddraal screaming and whipping at their Trollocs to charge and break the Aiel attack that came at them across a broad front. It would have been easier to stop a river with a handful of twigs. The Aiel didn’t slow, and those Shadowspawn who tried to resist were slain in their tracks, often falling to multiple spears or arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the Trollocs broke and ran, fleeing before the thunder of Aiel yells. Aviendha and her channelers reached the forges and the nearby pens of dirty, lifeless-eyed captives who had been awaiting death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quickly!\" Aviendha said to the Warders who accompanied her. The men broke open pens as Aviendha and the others attacked the last of the Shadow-forgers. As they died—falling to stone and dust—they dropped half-finished Thakan’dar blades to the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha looked upward to the right. A long serpentine path led up toward the cavern maw in the side of the mountain that loomed above. The hole there was dark. It seemed a trap that tempted light to enter, then never released it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha wove Fire and Spirit, then released the weave into the air. A moment later, a gateway opened at the head of the path up to Shayol Ghul. Four figures stepped through. A woman in blue, small of stature but not of will. An aging man, white-haired and shrouded in a multihued cloak. A woman in yellow, her dark hair cut short, adorned with an assortment of gemstones set in gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a tall man, hair the color of living coals. He wore his coat of red and gold, but under it a simple Two Rivers shirt. What he had become and what he had been, wrapped together in one. He carried two swords, like a Shienaran. One looked as if it were glass; he wore it upon his back. The other was the sword of the Treekiller, King Laman, tied at his waist. He carried that because of her. Fool man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha raised her hand to him, and he raised his in return. That would be their only farewell if he failed in his task or she died during hers. With a last look, she turned away from him and toward her duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo of her Aes Sedai had linked and created a gateway so that the Warders could usher the captives to safety. Many needed to be prodded into motion. They stumbled forward, eyes nearly as dead as those of the Shadow-forgers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check inside the forge, too\", Aviendha said, motioning to a few of the Warders. They charged in, Aes Sedai following. Weaves of the One Power shook the building as they found more Shadow-forgers, and the two Asha’man quickly went in as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha scanned the valley. The battle had become uglier; there were more Shadowspawn at the corridor leading out of the valley. These had been given more time to prepare and form up. Ituralde led his forces in behind the Aiel, securing the sections of the valley already taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatience, Aviendha thought to herself. Her job would not be to join that battle ahead, but to guard Rand’s back as he ascended and entered the Pit of Doom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe worried about one thing. Couldn’t the Forsaken just Travel directly into the cavern itself? Rand didn’t seem worried about that, but he was also very distracted by what he had to do. Perhaps she should join him and . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned, looking up. What was that shadow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh above, the sun shone in a turbulent sky. Some storm clouds, in patches, some deep black, others brilliant white. It wasn’t a cloud that had suddenly obscured the sun, however, but something solid and black sliding into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha felt a chill and found herself trembling as the light slipped away. Darkness, true darkness, fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoldiers across the field looked up in awe, and even fear. The light went out. The end of the world had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChanneling came suddenly from the other end of the wide valley. Aviendha spun, shaking off her awe. The ground nearby was littered with torn garments, dropped weapons and corpses. All of the fighting was at the mouth of the valley, distant from her, where the Aiel were trying to push the Shadowspawn back into the pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Aviendha couldn’t see much through the darkness, she could tell soldiers were staring at the sky. Even the Trollocs looked awestruck. But then the solid blackness began to move in the sky, revealing first the edge of the sun, and then the sun itself. Light!
