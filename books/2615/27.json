I will do all I can to serve him and you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We shall be like sisters,” I promised her, my fingers grasping hers a little too tightly. I could see her discomfort, but she did not dare withdraw from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes! Always,” she answered, then with much more fervor, “and forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see that she was snared and I smiled at her with satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcerpt from Letter from Earl Wright to his sister, Countess Dracula\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must say, my darling sister, I am concerned by the tone of your recent letter. The news of the destruction of your lovely home filled me with terror. To think you could have perished in the flames fills me with dread. I cannot bear to lose you after the loss of our family. My only solace is the knowledge you are in the safe hands of our friend Baroness Dosza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize your husband has many duties to which he must attend, but that you are without the company of family in a time such as this worries me. Perhaps you should return to England and stay with us until your estate is restored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcerpt from Letter from Countess Dracula, to her brother, Earl Wright\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour concern for my safety warms me, my dear brother! Though I long to return to England, I feel I must perform my duties as a faithful wife and follow my husband’s directions in this matter. I am quite comfortable in the home of the baroness. Though I miss you and our family terribly, I must stay here for the time being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease do not worry after me. Your love and prayers are my strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Countess Dracula\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJune 30, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dosza Palace, Buda\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew’s sweet letter pierced my heart when I read it. I could feel his great concern and love for me pouring out of the words he had written. It pains me to lie to him, but I cannot leave Buda until I have exacted my revenge against Vlad’s minions. And I cannot leave until I find my beloved Ignatius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am also unsure of how I can return to England and hide from my brother my new nature. I am not the sister he remembers. I once hid my unnatural beauty behind veils, pretending to be disfigured, but I cannot keep up such a ruse. My brother and I share the same nature and he would be suspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am at a loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy family now rests in the crypt of the Dosza Chapel. I am grateful to have them safely interred at last. Magda attended the service performed by a local priest in my stead. I am considering sending them home to England by ship at a later date, but I am uncertain if this is wise. At least for now their bodies are in a holy place. That gives me peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, despite my urgent request to see Astir. He has declined my request to see him and is silent on the matter of the vampire who attacked us. I wish only for answers and receive only silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have settled into my new life at the Baroness’ palace. It has not been as difficult as I had feared for the Baroness often sleeps through the day. At her insistence, I call her Csilla during our conversations and she is perfectly relaxed in my presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon after my arrival, she grew restless and began to throw small soirees every evening. I soon learned that she is fond of drink, men, and is every bit as scandalous as I had once hoped to be. At her insistence, I join her small parties, listening to the mad gossips, laughing at the grandiose tales of young men trying to impress me, and enjoy being the center of attention. My title is enough to gain interest, but my English background and my family’s tragedy make me quite the draw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your husband is quite the man,” a middle-aged dowager duchess named Frida informed me one night. Fanning herself on the veranda, she regarded with amusement the younger drunken people attempting to play croquet in the moonlight. “So forceful and exciting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He has his moments,” I conceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdem lingered nearby watching the dark cloak of night hiding within the tree line. The night air was warm and thick with moisture. I could see the lights from the palace glinting on the waters of the Danube beyond the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I often wondered when he would find a bride. He seemed like such a rogue,” Frida said, her eyes glittering with wine and a hint of cruelty. “When word reached me that he had found a wife, I was shocked. I must admit I thought he would perhaps one day marry our dear Csilla. They are very much alike in their particular predilections.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilting my head, I graced the nasty gossip with a wide smile. “Aren’t they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrida’s wicked expression dimmed somewhat. “Yes. But I’m sure he has taken you under his wing to show you the wonders of married life.” The innuendo dripped from her lips as her keen dark eyes watched me with anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a light laugh, I flipped open my fan. Fluttering it before my face to create a small breeze, I graced her with a bemused smile. “Well, he would be a rather bad husband if he did not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving her heavy body closer to mine, she whispered conspiratorially, “Well, if he had not, I’m certain you could have found one of these dashing young men to do the honors.” With a hard edge to her smile, she added, “While he was away, on business, of course, with the Baroness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She may be his mistress, but I am his wife and carry his title,” I said keeping the steel from my tone. I refused to be baited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile faded to a hard little line as she pressed her lips together. The ostrich feathers of her turban bobbed around her head as she settled into a chair to watch the gaiety on the lawn. “Sometimes titles are all women such as we can cling to when our husbands are distracted.” She added in a curious tone, “Or perhaps we enjoy their distraction allowing us to pursue other... interests.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSettling upon a stone bench, I shrugged my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrida’s gaze shifted to Adem. “Yes, I could see that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you see what is not there,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing her words, Adem merely shook his head and returned to watching the antics of the Hungarian aristocrats and a few foreign guests. Csilla was in fine form, laughing gaily, prancing about with a glass of wine in one hand. It was clear that she had selected a young Frenchman to bed. She was particularly enthralled with his accent and broad shoulders. I could see the allure of his blond curls and blue eyes, but his beauty was dim in comparison to my lost love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughter sang through the air as people cheated flamboyantly at the game while flirting outrageously with each other. At one point in my young life I would have been scandalized by the flagrant actions of those around me, but I had lost my innocence in Vlad’s castle. When two men playfully tried to lift the skirts of the baroness, I thought it fairly tame compared to how Vlad had torn off my dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Countess, this just arrived,” Brice said, his tall form stepping to my side. Upon his tray was a simple card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Brice,” I said with a true smile. Plucking up the card, I read it over swiftly. “Is there a messenger awaiting a reply?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, madam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My response is that I shall be there in due haste,” I said as I gathered my shawl about my shoulders and stood. Gesturing to Adem, I swiftly walked into the house ignoring Frida’s query and speculative gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdem fell into step behind me as I rushed toward my suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your master finally agreed to my request to meet with him,” I informed Adem. “It took him long enough, didn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes he has no awareness of the passage of time, and other times he merely likes to make people wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see the truth in Adem’s comment, but I was not mollified. I was in a temper over Astir’s dismissive behavior. I quickly dressed in a blue silk gown and matching turban with ostrich feathers. Magda fussed over my hair and clothing as I rushed to the waiting carriage. My slippers were new and slightly pinched my feet, but I was pleased with my attire. It was one of the many new outfits Vlad had bought me and I felt very fashionable. Upon my throat, wrists and ears I wore diamonds and aquamarines, another gift, this time from my brother. He had presented them to me as a wedding gift and I was very fond of them. The color of the aquamarines matched my eyes and the diamonds sparkled brilliantly upon my limbs as I moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce settled in Astir’s carriage, I allowed myself a moment of peace to gather my wits about me and set my words in order. My temper would get the best of me if I was not careful and I needed Astir to be my supporter, not my enemy. The carriage groaned as the horses were urged forward and the wheels turned carrying me away from the palace. I should have probably informed the baroness I was departing, but a bit of mystery would keep her in awe of me. I did not want her to feel too familiar. It was difficult enough to deal with her at times since she so passionately desired to be my dear friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstir’s message had been simple. It was a summons to a cafe that was one of the finer establishments in Buda. I had not ventured out since my arrival and it was a lovely balm to my tattered soul to see the city in all its beauty. I could hear the violins playing in one restaurant mingling with the soft whisper of the Danube. The gentle rocking of the carriage and the clacking of the horse hooves against the cobblestones was a lovely reminder of a happier time in Buda. Perhaps I had been foolish, but for a time I had been at peace with my life with Vlad. Of course it had been while my brother had been visiting and there were times when Vlad did strike me, but it had been such a relief from the brutality of the castle I had been seduced into complacency. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-27.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
