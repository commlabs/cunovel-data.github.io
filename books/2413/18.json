Officer Pilomento will be here at eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen looked at the dove-gray slacks and soft, cowl-necked sweater she wore. \"Is that who you\u0027re getting all dressed up for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" When he came to stand behind her, she smiled at their twin reflections. \"I\u0027ve developed a penchant for the police lately. It has all the earmarks of becoming an obsession.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that right?\" He bent to brush his lips over the back of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped his hands to her shoulders, wanting to remain close, touching. \"Worried about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Still smiling, she turned into his arms. \"I\u0027m not worried a bit. Not about that or anything else.\" Because there was a frown between his brows, Tess lifted a ringer to smooth it away. \"I wish you weren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my job to worry.\" For a moment he just held her, knowing it was going to be hard, unreasonably hard, to walk out the door that morning and trust her to someone else\u0027s care. \"Pilomento\u0027s a good man,\" he told her, as much to appease himself as her. \"He\u0027s young but he\u0027s by-the-book. Nobody\u0027s going to get in the door while he\u0027s here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Come on, let\u0027s have some coffee. You\u0027ve only got a few more minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lowenstein relieves him at four.\" As they walked into the kitchen, he ran over the schedule, though they both knew every move. \"She\u0027s the best. She might look like a nice suburban wife, but there\u0027s nobody I\u0027d rather have backing me up in a hairy situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be alone at all.\" Tess took down two mugs. \"Cops will still be taking shifts on the third floor, the phone\u0027s wired, there\u0027ll be a unit parked across the street at all times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t be a black and white. If he makes his move, we don\u0027t want to scare him off. Bigsby, Roderick, and Mullendore will switch off with Ed and me on surveillance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, I\u0027m not worried.\" After handing him his coffee, she took his arm to walk to the dining room table. \"I\u0027ve thought this through. Believe me, I\u0027ve thought this through. Nothing can happen to me as long as I\u0027m inside and inaccessible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t know you\u0027re being guarded. When I return- at midnight, I\u0027ll come in the back and use the stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has to make his move tonight, that I\u0027m sure of. When he does, you\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate the confidence, but I tell you I\u0027d feel a little less edgy if you were a little more so. Look, no grandstanding.\" He took her arm for emphasis, before she could lift the coffee. \"When we\u0027ve got him, he goes back to the station for interrogation, you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, you know how important it is to me to talk to him, to try to get through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can only block me on this so long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as it takes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess backed off and tried another tack, one that had woken her in the early hours and kept her awake. \"Ben, I think you understand this man better than you know. You know what it is to lose someone who\u0027s an intricate part of your life. You lost Josh, he lost his Laura. We don\u0027t know who she was, but we can be sure that she mattered a great deal to him. You told me that when you lost Josh, you considered killing his doctor. Wait,\" she said before he could speak. \"You wanted to blame someone, to hurt someone. If you hadn\u0027t been a strong man emotionally, you might very well have done so. Still, the resentment and the pain stayed with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words, and the truth behind them, made him uncomfortable. \"Maybe they did, but I didn\u0027t start killing people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you became a cop. Maybe part of the reason you did was because of Josh, because you needed to find answers, to make things right. You\u0027re healthy, self-confident, and were able to turn what might have been the biggest tragedy in your life into something constructive. But if you weren\u0027t healthy, Ben, if you didn\u0027t have a strong self-image, a strong sense of right and wrong, something might have cracked inside you. When Josh died you lost your faith. I think he lost his over Laura. We don\u0027t know how long ago it might have been-a year, five years, twenty-but he\u0027s picked up the pieces of his faith and put them back together. Only the pieces aren\u0027t fitting true; the edges are jagged. He kills, sacrifices to save Laura. Lauras soul. What you told me last night made me wonder. Perhaps she died in what the Church considers mortal sin and was refused absolution. He\u0027s been taught all of his life to believe that without absolution, the soul is lost. In his psychosis he murders, sacrifices women who remind him of Laura. But he still saves their souls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything you say may be right. None of it changes the fact that he\u0027s killed four women and is aiming for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Black and white, Ben?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes that\u0027s all there is.\" It frustrated him more because he was beginning to understand, even to feel some of what she was saying. He wanted to continue to look at it straight-on, without any angles. \"Don\u0027t you believe that some people are just born evil? Does a man tell his wife he\u0027s going out to hunt humans then drive to the local McDonald\u0027s and shoot kids because his mother beat him when he was six? Does a man use a college campus for target practice because his father cheated on his mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but this man isn\u0027t the kind of mass murderer you\u0027re talking about.\" She was on her own ground here and knew her steps. \"He isn\u0027t killing randomly and motivelessly. An abused child is as likely to become a bank president as a psychotic. And neither do I believe in the bad seed. We\u0027re talking about an illness, Ben, something more and more doctors are coming to believe is caused by a chemical reaction in the brain that destroys rational thought. We\u0027ve come a long way since the days of demon possession, but even sixty years ago schizophrenia was treated by tooth extraction. Then it was injections of horse serum, enemas. And in the last quarter of the twentieth century, we\u0027re still groping. Whatever triggered his psychosis, he needs help. The way Josh did. The way Joey did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for the first twenty-four hours,\" he said flatly. \"And not until the paperwork clears. He might not want to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve thought of that, but I believe he will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of this matters until we get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the knock came, Bens hand reached slowly for his weapon. His arm was still stiff, but usable. He\u0027d have no problem holding his Police Special. He moved toward the door, but stood beside it. \"You ask who it is.\" As she started to move forward, he held up a hand. \"No, ask from over there. You don\u0027t stand in front of the door.\" Though he doubted the means would change from amice to bullet, he wasn\u0027t taking chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detective Pilomento, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecognizing the voice, Ben turned and pulled the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paris.\" Pilomento knocked snow from his shoes before he stepped inside. \"The roads are still a mess. We got about six inches. Morning, Dr. Court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning. Let me take your coat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. Freezing out there,\" he said to Ben. \"Mullendore\u0027s in position out front. Hope he wore his long underwear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get too comfortable watching game shows.\" Ben reached for his own coat as he took a last look around the room. There was only one entrance, and Pilomento would never be more than about twenty-five feet from her. Still, even as he bundled into his coat, he didn\u0027t feel warm. \"I\u0027ll be in periodic contact with the surveillance teams. Now, why don\u0027t you go into the kitchen and pour yourself some coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I just had one in the car on the way over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" He looked from Ben to Tess. \"Yeah, sure.\" Whistling between his teeth, he walked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was rude, but I don\u0027t mind.\" With a low laugh Tess slipped her arms around Ben\u0027s waist. \"Be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I make a habit of it. See that you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew her close, and the kiss was long and lingering. \"You going to wait up for me, Doc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Count on it. You\u0027ll call if... well, if anything happens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Count on it.\" Taking her face in his hands, he held it a moment, then pressed a kiss to her forehead. \"You\u0027re so lovely.\" It was the quick surprise in her eyes that made him realize that he hadn\u0027t made use of all his clever and slick compliments with her as he had with other women. The realization caught him off balance. To cover it, he tucked her hair behind her ear, then backed away. \"Lock the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled it shut behind him, wishing he could shake the uneasy feeling that things weren\u0027t going to go as neatly as planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Hours later he was huddled inside the Mustang, watching Tess\u0027s building. Two kids were putting the finishing touches on an elaborate snowman. Ben wondered if their father knew they\u0027d copped his fedora. The day had gone even slower than he\u0027d imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Days\u0027re getting shorter,\" Ed commented. Sprawled in the passenger\u0027s seat, he was warm as a bear in a union suit, corduroys, flannel shirt, sweater, and an L.L. Bean parka. The cold had long since numbed its way through Ben\u0027s boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s Pilomento.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detective came out of the building, paused only a heartbeat on the sidewalk, and flipped up the collar of his coat. It was the signal that Lowenstein was inside and things were tight. Ben\u0027s muscles relaxed only fractionally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine, you know.\" Ed stretched a bit and began isometric exercises to keep his legs from cramping. \"Lowenstein\u0027s mean enough to hold off an army.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t going to move until dark.\" Because his face froze if he cracked the window for too long, Ben substituted a Milky Way for the cigarette he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what that sugar\u0027s doing to the enamel of your teeth?\" Never one to give up the battle, Ed drew out a small plastic container. Inside was a homemade snack of raisins, dates, unsalted nuts, and wheat germ. He\u0027d made enough for two. \"You gotta start reeducating your appetite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen took a large, deliberate bite of his candy bar. \"When Roderick relieves us, we\u0027re stopping by the Burger King on the way in. I\u0027m getting a Whopper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, not while I\u0027m eating. If Roderick, Bigsby, and half the station had a proper diet, they wouldn\u0027t have been down with the flu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t get sick,\" Ben said over a mouthful of chocolate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blind luck. By the time you hit forty, your system\u0027s going to revolt. It won\u0027t be pretty. What\u0027s this?\" Ed sat up straight as he watched the man across the street. His long black coat was buttoned high. He walked slowly. Too slowly, too cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth detectives had one hand on their weapons and one on the door handles when the man suddenly broke into a run. Ben had already pushed the car door open when the man scooped up one of the little girls playing in the snow and tossed her high. She let out a quick, ringing laugh, and called out, \"Daddy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the breath pushed out of his body, Ben sat back down. Feeling foolish, he turned to Ed. \"You\u0027re as jumpy as I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like her. I\u0027m glad you decided to risk eating turkey with her granddaddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told her about Josh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd\u0027s brows lifted, disappearing into the seaman\u0027s cap he\u0027d pulled over his head. That, he knew, was more of a commitment than even he\u0027d believed Ben could make. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I guess I\u0027m glad I did. She\u0027s the best thing that\u0027s happened in my life. God, that sounds corny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Content, Ed began to munch a date. \"People in love tend to be corny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say I was in love.\" That came out quickly, the reflex action on the trap door. \"I just mean she\u0027s special.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certain people have difficulty admitting to emotional commitment because they fear failing in the long haul. The word love becomes a stumbling block that once uttered is like a lock, blocking off their privacy, their singleness, and obliging them to perceive themselves as one half of a couple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen tossed the candy wrapper on the floor. \"Redbook?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I made it up. Maybe I should write an article.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, if I was in love with Tess, with anybody, I wouldn\u0027t have any trouble saying it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So? Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I care about her. A lot.\" Euphemism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s important to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evasions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027m crazy about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite there, Paris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time he did crack the window and pull out a cigarette. \"All right, so I\u0027m in love with her. Happy now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a date. You\u0027ll feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore, then heard himself laugh. Tossing out the cigarette, he bit into the date Ed handed him. \"You\u0027re worse than my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what partners are for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside tess\u0027s apartment time went just as slowly. At seven she and Lowenstein shared a supper of canned soup and roast beef sandwiches. For all her talk about not being worried, Tess managed to do little more than stir the chunks of beef and vegetables around in her bowl. It was a cold, miserable night. No one who didn\u0027t have to would want to be out in it. But the fact that she couldn\u0027t move beyond her own door left her with a feeling of being caged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You play canasta?\" Lowenstein asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Canasta.\" Lowenstein glanced at her own watch and figured her husband would be giving their youngest a bath. Roderick would be in position out front, Ben and Ed would be sweeping the area before they returned to the station, and her oldest daughter would be complaining about being stuck with the dishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m being lousy company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowenstein set half a sandwich back on the pale green glass plate she\u0027d admired. \"You\u0027re not supposed to entertain me, Dr. Court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Tess pushed her plate aside and made the effort. \"You have a family, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mob, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not easy, is it, managing a demanding career and taking care of a family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve always thrived on complications.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I admire that. I\u0027ve always avoided them. Can I ask you a personal question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, if I can ask you one afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough.\" With her elbows on the table, Tess leaned forward. \"Does your husband find it difficult being married to someone whose job is not only demanding, but potentially dangerous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it\u0027s not easy. I know it\u0027s not,\" Lowenstein corrected. She took a pull from the Diet Pepsi Tess had served in thin, scrolled glasses Lowenstein would have kept on display. \"We\u0027ve had to work through a lot of it. A couple of years ago we had a trial separation. It lasted thirty-four-and-a-half hours. The bottom line is, we\u0027re nuts about each other. That usually cuts through everything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Even when I feel like pushing his head in the toilet, I know. My turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowenstein gave her a long, measuring look. \"Where do you get your clothes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was only too surprised to laugh for a few seconds. For the first time all day, Tess relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Roderick and a stocky black detective known as Pudge shared a thermos of coffee. A bit cranky with a head cold, Pudge shifted every few minutes and complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to see a sign of this dude. Mullendore\u0027s got the late shift. If anyone makes the collar, it\u0027ll be him. We\u0027ll just sit here freezing our asses off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has to be tonight.\" Roderick poured Pudge another cup of coffee before going back to study Tess\u0027s windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Pudge let out a huge yawn and cursed the antihistamines that left his nose and his mind clogged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it was meant to be tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ, Roderick, no matter what shit-shoveling duty you pull, you never complain.\" On another yawn, Pudge slumped against the door. \"God, I can hardly keep my eyes open. Goddamn medication whips you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoderick took another sweep of the street, up, then down. No one stirred. \"Why don\u0027t you sleep awhile? I\u0027ll watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Predate it.\" Already half there, Pudge closed his eyes. \"Just give me ten, Lou. Mullendore takes it in an hour anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his partner snoring lightly, Roderick kept watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess was learning the fine points of canasta from Lowenstein when the phone rang. The relaxed girl talk ended with a snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, you answer it. If it\u0027s him, keep calm. Stall if you can, agree to meet him if you have to. See if you can pin him down to a location.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" Though her throat dried up, Tess picked up the receiver and spoke naturally. \"Dr. Court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctor, this is Detective Roderick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Detective.\" Her muscles went limp as she turned and shook her head at Lowenstein. \"Yes? Is there any news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got him, Dr. Court. Ben picked him up less than two blocks from your building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben? Is he all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, don\u0027t worry. It\u0027s nothing serious. He wrenched his shoulder some during the arrest. He asked me to call you and let you know you can relax. Ed\u0027s taking him to the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hospital.\" She remembered the tray with the blood-soaked bandages. \"Which one? I want to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s being taken to Georgetown, Doctor, but he didn\u0027t want you to bother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s no bother. I\u0027ll leave right away.\" Remembering the woman breathing down her neck, Tess turned to Lowenstein. \"You should talk to Detective Lowenstein. I appreciate you calling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re all just glad it\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She squeezed her eyes shut a moment, then handed the phone to Lowenstein. \"He\u0027s been caught.\" Then she dashed into the bedroom for her purse and car keys. When she hurried back in for her coat, Lowenstein was still pulling details out of Roderick. Impatient, Tess tossed her coat over her arm and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like a clean collar,\" Lowenstein said when she hung up. \"Ben and Ed decided to do a few more sweeps of the area and saw this guy come out of an alley and head toward your building. He had his coat open. They could see he was wearing a cassock. He didn\u0027t protest when they stopped him, but when Ben found the amice in his pocket, he apparently lost it, started fighting and calling for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God.\" She wanted to see him, talk to him. But Ben was on his way to the hospital, and Ben came first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lou said Ben got a little banged up, doesn\u0027t sound serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll feel better when I see for myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you mean. Do you want me to take you to the hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m sure you want to get back to the station and tie up the loose ends. It doesn\u0027t look as though I need police protection any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I\u0027ll walk you down to your car anyway. Tell Ben I said good work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs ben crossed the parking lot to the station house, Logan pulled in behind him and hurried out of his car. \"Ben.\" Hatless, gloveless, dressed as he rarely was in a cassock, he caught up with them on the steps. \"I was hoping I\u0027d find you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a good night for priests to go walking around, Tim. We got a lot of nervous cops out tonight. You could find yourself cuffed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was saying late Mass for the sisters and didn\u0027t have time to change. I think I have something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inside,\" Ed said, pushing open the door. \"Your fingers are going to fall off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in such a hurry.\" Absently, Logan began to rub his fingers together for warmth. \"For days I\u0027ve been going over everything. I knew you were fixed on the use of the name Reverend Francis Moore and were checking it out, but I couldn\u0027t get my mind off the Frank Moore I\u0027d known at the seminary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re still digging there.\" Impatient, Ben looked at his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but I was with him, you see, I knew that he bordered between being a saint and a fanatic. Then I remembered a seminarian who\u0027d been under him and had left after a celebrated row with Moore. I remembered him because the young man had gone on to become a well-known writer. Stephen Mathias.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard of him.\" As excitement began to drum, Ben edged closer. \"You think Mathias-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no.\" Frustrated by his inability to speak quickly or coherently enough, Logan took a deep breath. \"I didn\u0027t even know Mathias personally, since I was already established in the university when all that went on. But I remembered the gossip that there was nothing, and no one, Mathias didn\u0027t know about in the seminary. In fact, he used plenty of inside stuff for his first couple of books. The more I thought about that, the more things clicked. And I remembered reading one novel in particular that mentioned a young student who had suffered a breakdown and had left the seminary after his sister-his twin sister-had died as the result of an illegal abortion. Apparently there was a tremendous scandal. It was discovered that the boy\u0027s mother was confined to an institution and that he had been treated himself for schizophrenia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s track down Mathias.\" Ben was already heading down the hall when Logan stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already done that. It only took me a few calls to locate him. He\u0027s living in Connecticut, and he remembered the incident perfectly. The seminarian had been unusually devout, as devout to Moore as he was to the Church. In fact, he served as his secretary. Mathias said his name was Louis Roderick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was possible for the blood to freeze, for the heart to stop pumping, and for the body to remain alive. \"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mathias was positive, but when I asked, he went back through his old notes and checked on it. He\u0027s willing to come down and give you a description. With that and a name, you should be able to find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know where he is.\" Ben spun around into the squad room and grabbed the first phone he reached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know him?\" Logan grabbed on to Ed before he lost him as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a cop. He\u0027s one of us, and right now he\u0027s heading up the outside surveillance on Tess\u0027s building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet God.\" As the room in front of him humped into action, Logan began to pray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnits were dispatched to Roderick\u0027s address, others to back up Tess\u0027s apartment. Logan was on Ben\u0027s heels as they headed to the door. \"I want to go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is police business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seeing a priest might calm him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get in the way.\" They hit the glass door and nearly ran over Lowenstein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell\u0027s going on here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf wild with fear, Ben caught her by the collar of her coat. \"Why aren\u0027t you with her? Why did you leave her alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with you? Once Lou called to verify it had gone down, there was no reason for me to hang around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did he call?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty minutes ago. But he said you were on your way-\" Though her mind rejected it, the expression on Ben\u0027s face told her everything. \"Oh, God, not Lou? But he\u0027s-\" A cop. A friend. Lowenstein kicked herself back. \"He called twenty minutes ago, telling me there had been a clean arrest and to pull off the guard and come in. I never questioned it. God, Ben, I never thought to verify with headquarters. It was Lou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed Ben\u0027s arm before he could push past her. \"Georgetown Hospital. He told her you\u0027d been taken to Emergency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing else was needed to have him streaking down the steps to his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess pulled up in the parking lot after a frustrating twenty-minute drive. The roads were all but clear, but that hadn\u0027t stopped the fender benders. She told herself the good part was that Ben was already fixed up and waiting. And it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlamming her door, she dropped her keys into her pocket. On the way home they were going to pick up a bottle of champagne. Two bottles, she corrected. Then they were going to spend the rest of the weekend in bed drinking them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea was so pleasant, she didn\u0027t notice the figure melt out of the shadows and into the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlarm came first, with her hand flying up to her throat. Then, with a laugh, she lowered it and started forward. \"Detective Roderick, I didn\u0027t know you\u0027d-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light glinted on the white clerical collar at his throat. It was like the dream, she thought in a moment of blank panic, when she\u0027d thought herself only a step away from safety only to find her worst fears confirmed. She knew she could turn and run, but he was only an arm\u0027s span away and would catch her. She knew she could scream, but she had no doubt he\u0027d silence her. Completely. There was only one choice. To face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted to talk to me.\" No, it wouldn\u0027t work, she thought desperately. Not if her voice was shaking, not when her head was filled with the rushing echo of her own fear. \"I\u0027ve wanted to talk to you too. I\u0027ve wanted to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once I thought you could. You had kind eyes. When I read your reports, I knew you understood I wasn\u0027t a murderer. Then I knew you\u0027d been sent to me. You\u0027d be the last one, the most important one. You were the only one the Voice said by name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about the voice, Lou.\" She wanted to back up, just edge back one foot, but saw by his eyes that even that small movement would trigger the violence. \"When did you first hear it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was a boy. They said I was crazy, like my mother. I was afraid, so I blocked it out. Later I realized it was a call from God, calling me to the priesthood. I was happy to be chosen. Father Moore said only a few are chosen to carry out the Lord\u0027s work, to celebrate the sacraments. But even the chosen are tempted to sin. Even the chosen are weak, so we sacrifice, we do penance. He taught me how to train my body to fight off temptation. Flagellation, fasting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one more piece to the puzzle fell into place. An emotionally disturbed boy enters the seminary, to be trained by an emotionally disturbed man. He would kill her. Following the path he saw laid out for him, he would kill her. The parking lot was all but empty, the doors of the Emergency Room two hundred yards away. \"How did you feel about becoming a priest, Lou?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was everything. My whole life was formed, do you understand? Formed. For that purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you left it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He lifted his head as if scenting the air, as if listening to something only for his ears. \"That was like a blank spot in my life. I didn\u0027t really exist then. A man can\u0027t exist without faith. A priest can\u0027t exist without purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw him reach in his pocket, saw the snatch of white in his hand. Her eyes were almost as wild as his when they met again. \"Tell me about Laura.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d come a step closer, but the name stopped him. \"Laura. Did you know Laura?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t know her.\" He had the amice in both hands now, but seemed to have forgotten it. Treat, she told herself to hold back a scream. Treat, talk, listen. \"Tell me about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was beautiful. Beautiful in that fragile way that makes you worry if such things can last. My mother worried because Laura enjoyed looking at herself in the mirror, brushing her hair, wearing pretty clothes. Mother could sense the Devil drawing, always drawing Laura into sin and bad thoughts. But Laura only laughed and said she didn\u0027t care for sackcloth and ashes. Laura laughed a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You loved her very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were twins. We shared life before life. That\u0027s what my mother said. We were bound together by God. It was for me to keep Laura from spurning the Church and everything we\u0027d been taught. It was for me, but I failed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you fail Laura?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was only eighteen. Beautiful, delicate, but there wasn\u0027t any laughter.\" The tears began, sobless, to glisten on his cheeks. \"She\u0027d been weak. I hadn\u0027t been there for her, and she\u0027d been weak. Back-street abortion. God\u0027s judgment. But why did God\u0027s judgment have to be so harsh?\" His breathing quickened and became painfully loud as he pressed a hand to his forehead. \"A life for a life. It\u0027s fair and just. A life for a life. She begged me not to let her die, not to let her die in such sin that would send her to Hell. I had no power to absolve her. Even as she lay dying in my arms, I had no power. The power came later, after the despair, the dark, blank time. I can show you. I have to show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped forward, and even as Tess\u0027s instincts had her pull back, he slipped the scarf around her. \"Lou, you\u0027re a police officer. It\u0027s your job, your function to protect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protect.\" His fingers trembled on the scarf. A policeman. He\u0027d had to drug Pudges coffee. It would have been wrong to do more, to hurt another officer. Protect. The shepherd protects his flock. \"I didn\u0027t protect Laura.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it was a terrible loss, a tragedy. But now you\u0027ve tried to give something back, haven\u0027t you? Isn\u0027t that why you became a police officer? To give something back? To protect others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to lie, but after Laura it didn\u0027t seem to matter. Maybe with the police I could find what I\u0027d been looking for in the seminary. That sense of purpose. Vocation. Man\u0027s law, not Gods law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you swore to uphold the law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Voice came back, so many years later. It was real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, to you it was real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t always inside my head. Sometimes it\u0027s a whisper in the other room, or it comes like thunder from the ceiling over my bed. It told me how to save Laura, and myself. We\u0027re bound together. We\u0027ve always been bound together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands clenched over the keys in her pocket. She knew if the scarf tightened, she would use them to gouge his eyes. For survival. The need to live surged through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will absolve you from sin,\" he murmured. \"And you will see God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taking a life is a sin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"A life for a life. A holy sacrifice.\" The pain rushed through his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taking a life is a sin,\" she repeated as the blood pounded in her ears. \"To kill breaks God\u0027s law, and man\u0027s. You understand both laws as a police officer, as a priest.\" When she heard the siren, her first thought was that it was an ambulance coming into Emergency. She wouldn\u0027t be alone. She didn\u0027t take her eyes from his. \"I can help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me.\" It was only a whisper, part question, part plea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Though it trembled, she lifted her hand and placed it on his. Her fingers brushed over the silk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoors slammed behind them, but neither of them moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get your hands off her, Roderick. Take your hands off her and move aside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping her fingers around Roderick\u0027s, Tess turned to see Ben no more than ten feet behind them, spread-legged, his gun held in both hands. Beside him and to the left, Ed mirrored his position. Sirens still screamed and lights flashed as cars poured into the lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, I\u0027m not hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t look at her. His eyes never left Roderick, and in them she saw that core of violence he strapped down. She knew if she stepped aside now, he\u0027d cut it loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, I said I\u0027m not hurt. He wants help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move out of the way.\" If he\u0027d been certain Roderick wasn\u0027t armed, he would have rushed forward. But Tess turned her body and used it as a shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s over, Ben.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a quick hand signal, Ed walked forward. \"I have to search you, Lou. Then I have to cuff you and take you in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Dazed and docile, he lifted his arms to make it simpler. \"That\u0027s the law. Doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. No one\u0027s going to hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the right to remain silent,\" Ed began when he\u0027d removed Roderick\u0027s police issue from under his coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right, I understand.\" As Ed snapped on the handcuffs, Roderick\u0027s attention focused on Logan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father, did you come to hear my confession?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Would you like me to go with you?\" As he spoke, Logan put his hand over Tess\u0027s and squeezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m so tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can rest soon. Come with us now, and I\u0027ll stay with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his head bowed, he began to walk between Ed and Logan. \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen waited until they\u0027d passed him. Tess stood where she was, watching him, not certain her legs would carry her if she moved forward. She saw him holster his gun before he was across the pavement to her in three strides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all right, I\u0027m all right,\" she repeated over and over as he crushed her against him. \"He wasn\u0027t going to go through with it. He couldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen only drew her away to yank the scarf from around her and toss it in a mound of snow. He ran his own hands over her throat to make certain it was unmarked. \"I could have lost you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She pressed herself against him again. \"He knew. I think he knew all along I could stop him.\" As tears of relief began, she tightened her arms around him. \"The trouble was, I didn\u0027t. Ben, I\u0027ve never been so frightened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stood between us and blocked me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSniffling, she drew away only far enough to find his lips with hers. \"Protecting a patient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not your patient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to take the chance that her legs would hold her a few minutes longer. Stepping back, she faced him. \"Yes, he is. And as soon as the paperwork clears, I\u0027ll start tests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed her by the front of her coat, but when she touched a hand to his face, he could only drop his forehead on hers. \"Damn you, I\u0027m shaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith arms hooked tight around waists, they walked to the car. She noticed, but didn\u0027t comment, that he\u0027d run over the curb. Inside the car she huddled against him again. No one had ever been so solid or so warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s ill.\" Tess linked her fingers with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s been one step ahead of us all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s been suffering.\" She closed her eyes a moment. She was alive. This time she hadn\u0027t failed. \"I\u0027m going to be able to help him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment he said nothing. He would have to live with this, her need to give herself to people. Maybe someday he\u0027d come to believe that both the sword and words could bring about justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Doc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember talking about us getting away for a few days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Sighing, she imagined an island with palm trees and fat orange flowers. \"Oh, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got some time coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How soon do you want me packed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, but continued to jiggle the keys nervously in his hand. \"I was thinking we could go down to Florida for a while. I want you to meet my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, not wanting to take a leap when a step was indicated, she lifted her head from his shoulder to look at him. Then he smiled, and his smile told her everything she needed to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to meet your mother.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sacred-sins/page-18.html","bookId":2413,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:02 AM"}
