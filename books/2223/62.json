Man, were they going to love this. Afterward, I accompanied the tow truck driver to the garage. They put the Audi on a hoist and determined that there had been no damage to the undercarriage. After reattaching the bumper and engineering a temporary fix of the rear lights and filters—there was a lot of duct tape involved—they pronounced the car drivable as long as I didn’t drive it too hard. They told me they’d be happy to fix the Audi “as good as new,” but I would have to wait a good long time for parts. That didn’t seem like an option to me. I paid with a credit card, thanked everyone, and drove off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still held to my plan, although it had been pushed back over four hours. Using my map and the address I had gleaned from the Internet, I found Josiah Bloom’s place across from the Nicholas County Fairgrounds. There were no other houses in the vicinity and I wondered why it had been built there. Nor was there a garage, only a strip of asphalt next to the house. The strip was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knocked on the door and waited. After a few moments I knocked again. I tried the latch. The door was unlocked. I gave it a gentle shove and it swung open. I called Bloom’s name several times. No answer. I stepped inside and was immediately seized by a sense of dread so deep inside me that it felt I had been born with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Bloom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the shades were drawn, turning the bright winter sunlight into gray shadows. I moved through a tiny living room filled with furniture that didn’t match. There was a TV and a VCR. A long screwdriver had been jammed into the mouth of the tape machine—the sight made me consider returning to the Audi for my gun. Instead, I crossed into the dining room beyond. Through an open door on my right I saw a bathroom. To my left was a small arch and what looked like a kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Bloom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smelled something I couldn’t place. It reminded me of cat urine, but what was that sweet smell mixed with it? It seemed to come from the kitchen, and smelling it did something to my body. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck rising, felt my lungs fight for air. Perspiration welled up under my arms and on my forehead and I swore I could hear—actually hear—the beating of my heart as I drifted toward the kitchen. I found a switch and flicked the light on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf of Josiah Bloom’s body was in a chair, the rest slumped over a small wooden table. A puddle of rich, red blood nearly covered the table and dripped into another, much larger puddle on the pale yellow linoleum floor. I gagged when I first saw the small entry hole surrounded by burned and unburned gunpowder in his right temple. I gagged again when I discovered that the bottom left side of Bloom’s head was gone, that his blood, bone, teeth, and brain were splattered on the kitchen wall, cabinets, and floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gag reflex kicked in and I ran to the bathroom. I found the toilet, hovered above it, my body shuddering, until the gagging finally subsided. I took pride in not vomiting—the first time I came across a dead body I had. I rinsed my mouth and splashed cold water on my face. Contaminating a crime scene, oh this is so smart, my inner voice told me. Wouldn’t they be proud of you back at the St. Paul Police Department? Oh, wouldn’t they, though?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suicide,” I told my reflection in the mirror. “I drove him to suicide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet over yourself, my private voice replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of cat urine was far greater in the bathroom and I began to look for the source. Did Josie keep cats? I found two large plastic buckets, one filled with empty cough medicine bottles and the other with batteries. The bathtub was hideously stained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that might be a reason,” I said aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself back into the kitchen and examined Bloom’s wound. Next I searched for the gun. I found it in an unlikely location—Bloom’s hand. I looked at it for a long time. Then back at the entry wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Danny isn’t going to like this,” I said aloud before I called 911.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave my statement twice, first to Mallinger, then to the medical examiner, a local doctor who moonlighted for the county. Mallinger had made sure that no one entered the kitchen before the ME arrived, including herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An apparent suicide,” the ME announced. “However, there are some inconsistencies. For one, we have a footprint and some smearing in the blood on the floor.” He held up his camera for us to see. “I have several shots of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was me,” said I. To prove it, I showed them the tip of my boot, now stained red. “Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ME took a photograph of my boot. Apparently he was a oneman forensics department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else did you do?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I used the bathroom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ME had a disgusted look on his face. Mallinger nodded her head in understanding. She looked like she wanted to vomit herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were outside, standing next to Mallinger’s cruiser. She was pale and I noticed her breath was coming hard. Other officers hung about waiting for instructions, but Mallinger waved them back. I suspected that she had never seen as messy a crime scene before. Unfortunately, I was about to make it worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t suicide,” I told the ME.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it was,” the ME said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since CSI everyone’s a criminologist,” the ME told Mallinger. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3/page-62.html","bookId":2223,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:55 PM"}
