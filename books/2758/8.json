I don\u0027t know why. I don\u0027t own Pax, not in the slightest. But he\u0027s been coming to see me every day so I felt like there was a mutual attraction there. I mean, he drove into town just to walk me the length of one block every day. Frankly, it\u0027s all I\u0027ve been able to think about. He\u0027s even invaded my dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut clearly, I was wrong. My fascination with him isn\u0027t reciprocated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s getting a blowjob from the girl who left him on the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t even think. My head is swirling in a blur of anger and hurt. I just grab my supplies, fold up my easel and bolt for my car. I think I might hear his voice behind me, calling my name, but I don\u0027t turn around. I start to run, and when I reach my car, I dump my things into it and peel out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chance a glance into the rearview mirror and he\u0027s not there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exhale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m disappointed or not. A sick part of me kind of wishes that he\u0027d cared enough to chase after me. But he didn\u0027t. So he doesn\u0027t care. I feel like crying. And that\u0027s ridiculous. But then I cry anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cry for the end of something that didn\u0027t even have a chance to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I cry because I feel even stupider for having such stupid thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive to my shop and sit there for a bit inside of my car. I pull myself together and finally walk inside. I flip the sign to Open and put my apron on. And then I do what I always do when I\u0027m happy or sad or bored or well, anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith swooping strokes, I paint the sun hanging over the edge of the lake by Pax\u0027s house. I paint the gray choppy water and then I turn the sun black, allowing the paint to drip toward the water. It\u0027s a dark scene and it perfectly fits how I feel. Stormy, black, angry. All are words that can be used to fit both the scene and my mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shop door jangles and I sigh. I usually don\u0027t hope that customers don\u0027t come, but today I\u0027d sort of like to be alone. I turn, my paintbrush still in hand, ready to smile at the customer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0027s Pax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile dies on my lips and I am frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is freshly showered, I can tell. His hair is wet and I can smell the scent of soap as he approaches. His face is oh-so-serious and I clench my jaw. This guy just got a blowjob. He has no right to come and talk to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why am I so happy that he came?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt defies logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry you had to see that,\" Pax says quietly, forgoing a greeting. \"Please, Mila. I\u0027m really sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grit my teeth and turn back to my painting, smearing the sun into the gray sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you do is your business,\" I tell him curtly. \"It\u0027s not mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax sighs and I can hear it from here, even though he stopped moving several steps away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could tell you that it wasn\u0027t what it looked like, but that would be a lie. It was exactly what it looked like. I could explain it, but you wouldn\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you here?\" I whisper, confused. If he doesn\u0027t want to explain, then what\u0027s the point? I don\u0027t look at him, instead I just stare at the movement of my paintbrush. I notice that my hand is shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I feel him behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand closes around mine, steadying it. His is warm and large. And I should pull away, but I don\u0027t. His warmth is all around me and I want to be absorbed by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m here,\" he admits softly, and his voice is so close to my neck. \"Because I can\u0027t stop thinking about you, I guess. And because I\u0027ll never get that horrified expression on your face out of my head. I\u0027m sorry to have put it there. Just know that she doesn\u0027t mean anything to me. She was persistent and I didn\u0027t say no. It was a habit. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart hammers hard in my chest. I don\u0027t know what to say. I know that I should tell him to get far away from me, but my heart is a traitor and wants him here. My heart must have issues. But I can\u0027t say that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t even know me,\" I tell him instead, finally turning around to look at him, pulling my hand away as I do. I stare up into his hazel eyes and find an expression there that I haven\u0027t yet seen. Trepidation. \"Why would you apologize to someone that you barely even know? You don\u0027t owe me anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs and his movement stirs his masculine scent. I inhale it and fight the urge to close my eyes so that I can better enjoy the smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. All I know is that ever since I met you, I\u0027ve wanted to know you. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve been coming into town this week to see you. Something about you makes me think that I can be better, maybe even get my shit straight. I haven\u0027t felt that way in a very long time. And I feel like I do owe you something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell. His words strike a chord in me and I swallow hard. His tone is hesitant, soft. And it melts my heart. I can\u0027t help it. Sometimes, there is such a broken look in his eyes. And deep down, I just want to fix it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I ask, my gaze firmly locked with his. He shakes his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. You just seem so good, so wholesome. It draws me to you. I can\u0027t explain it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh now, thoroughly amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gesture toward my painting. \"Does that seem good and wholesome to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both study the angry black and gray canvas. It looks like something that someone in a Psych ward might have painted. Pax finally smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, Red, it looks like you\u0027ve got a dark side. But the difference between you and me is that you channel yours in a healthy way. I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him, trying to decide what to say, how honest to be. But this moment seems like a good time for honesty, so I don\u0027t hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s all that healthy that I\u0027m attracted to you,\" I admit finally. \"I\u0027ve never been attracted to a bad boy before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is so close to me that his proximity is a bit intoxicating. I feel almost dizzy from it as I stare up at him, waiting for his response. It also seems as though I can feel the danger emanating from him...it\u0027s charged, electrical, fascinating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax thinks on it for a moment, his jaw covered in day-old stubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ve never wanted to be good before, so I guess it\u0027s a first for both of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stare into each other\u0027s eyes for what seems like forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know if I should believe him, but he seems so sincere. I do know that I want to believe him, even if it\u0027s a stupid feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what to say and apparently, he doesn\u0027t either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, he ducks his head and his lips meet mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is as unexpected as it is amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips are soft and he tastes like mint. Gone is the taste of ashtray and vomit. Gone is the limp man from the other night, the one who convulsed on the pavement. In his place is someone vibrant and alive, someone who smells delicious and is devastatingly sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone who is bad for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue delves softly into my mouth and I fight the urge to sigh into his. His hands grip my back and I don\u0027t know when they got there, but I lean into his embrace, clutching his waist. I revel in the way his fingers knead at my skin, at the firm pressure he places against me, at the hard rigidity pressed against my hips. It\u0027s dizzying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally need to breathe, he pulls away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am shaky from the kiss, from his absence from me. From the idea that I enjoyed that way too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s waiting for a reaction and I\u0027m not sure what to do. The kiss was perfect. Pax is sexy as hell. But he\u0027s so different from me. And he just got a blow job from someone else. The vision of that horrible girl on her knees in front of Pax springs into my head and I cringe. He could very definitely hurt me if I give him the chance. I\u0027ve already had enough pain in life. I don\u0027t need more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think this is a good idea,\" I finally say reluctantly. And the words are so very hard to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warm light dims in Pax\u0027s eyes as he stares at me and I see the disappointment in them, the rejection, before he hardens it into a cool expression that makes me want to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry you feel that way,\" he says calmly. \"Because I think it\u0027s a very good idea. The best I\u0027ve had in a long, long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns around and walks away, out of my shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAway from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch his wide shoulders as he walks away, out of my sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I sink to my knees right in the middle of my shop. My hands are shaking and my head is spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did I just do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I insane? I met someone who made me feel something for the first time in the two years since my parents died, and I\u0027m too chicken-shit to pursue anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m pathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach for my phone and call my sister. I speak before she even has a chance to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ready for that drink tonight.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-8.html","bookId":2758,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:14 PM"}
