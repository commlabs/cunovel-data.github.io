I must know if he is as good in bed as he looks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust thinking about Alistair made her toes curl. “How can you leap to the conclusion that we’ve been intimate? Perhaps he was a perfect gentleman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alistair Caulfield? On a ship for endless days?” Hester laughed her sweet, tinkling laugh. “Any other man, perhaps. But not a scoundrel like he. So … ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So … He is as delectable as he looks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew it!” Hester smiled over the rim of her cup. “I am so happy for you, Jess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess wanted to feel equally happy for her sister, but the circumstances didn’t warrant it. Hester was far too frail, especially for a woman who was midway through a pregnancy. “How are things between you and Regmont?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s equally consummate in bed,” Hester said with the faintest note of bitterness in her tone. “Far too skilled, actually. No man should be so knowledgeable about a woman’s body.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is he unfaithful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHester’s cup lowered and she looked contemplative. “I have no notion. If so, his appetite for me hasn’t decreased at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long stretch of silence ensued as Jess tried to understand what was causing her sister so much pain. “Hester …” she said finally. “Please tell me what’s wrong. You’ve lost far too much weight. What of the baby and the nourishment required for it to grow plump and healthy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll eat more now that you’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And when I’m not?” Jess pushed to her feet. Restless, she paced, a bad habit her father had beaten out of her in her youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have changed,” Hester noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So have you.” Pointing to the lemon cream scones sitting untouched on the tea service tray, she said, “You adore those scones. They are your favorite. You always eat too many of them, with heaping scoops of clotted cream that fall off your fingers when you take a bite. Yet you haven’t touched a one. You won’t even look at them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not hungry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am certain your child is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHester winced and Jess felt horrid, but something had to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to her sister, Jess sank to her knees and caught up Hester’s hands, noting the skeletal thinness with growing despair. “Tell me. Are you ill? Have you seen a doctor? Or is it something else? Is it Regmont? Are you afraid to tell me because I suggested the pairing? Tell me, Hester. Please. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHester’s pent-up breath left her in a rush. “My marriage is no longer a happy one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Hester.” Jess’s heart broke. “What happened? Did you fight? Can it be salvaged?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I once hoped so. Maybe it would be possible if I was stronger, like you. My weakness angers him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are not weak.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I am. When Father turned his wrath to me and you interceded, I let you. I was grateful you were taking the switch and not me.” Her mouth turned down at the corners. “So damned grateful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were a c-child.” Jess’s voice cracked with unshed tears. “You were wise to allow me to intercede. It would have been foolish to do otherwise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps, but courageous, too.” Hester’s eyes were giant verdant pools in her pale face. The rouge she wore to feign a healthy glow was incongruous against her bloodless skin, making her appear like a caricature of a bewigged and powdered peeress from times gone by. “I need that courage now, and I don’t know where to find it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will help,” Jess vowed, squeezing her sister’s fingers gently. “We shall find it together. As for Regmont, I’m certain he must be worried sick about you, as I am. Once he sees you regaining your strength, your relationship will improve. It’s natural for a woman to experience moodiness and melancholia while increasing, but that might be difficult for a man to grasp. We will just have to educate him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHester smiled and cupped Jess’s cheek. “I’m so sorry you cannot have children, Jess. You would be so good with them. Far better than I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense. You will be a doting mother, and I shall be a very proud aunt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your betrothed loves you very much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think he does,” Jess agreed, laying her cheek against Hester’s knee. “He cannot seem to bring himself to say it aloud, but I feel it when he touches me. I hear it in his voice when he speaks to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course he adores you, and his desire is unquestionable.” Hester’s cool fingers stroked Jess’s brow. “You will be the envy of every woman in England. Alistair Caulfield is rich, breathtakingly handsome, and mad for you. Toss in the dukedom and there isn’t a woman alive who would not kill to trade places with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess lifted her head, laughing. “Your dreams are too lofty. He’ll never inherit the title.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHester blinked. Then, her eyes widened with something akin to horror. “Dear God … You don’t know, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlistair paced before the grate in the family parlor of the Masterson residence in Town, his sleekly polished Hessians treading silently across the oriental rug. His fingers were laced at the small of his back, his hands tingling from the strain of his white-knuckled clasp. “Smallpox.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” His mother’s voice was soft with anguish. Louisa, the Duchess of Masterson, sat on a carved wooden chair with her back painfully straight. Her hair remained as dark as Alistair’s, the glossy tresses unmarred by any gray, but her lovely face betrayed both her age and the agony of outliving three of her four sons. The portrait of her above the mantel was taller and wider than Alistair’s height, and it served as the focal point of the room. Her younger self smiled down at anyone occupying the expansive space, her blue eyes naively clear of the many tragedies yet to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlistair had no notion of what to say. All three of his brothers were dead, and grief weighted his heart like a heavy, oppressive stone. Of equal burden was the title he now bore, a distinction he’d never coveted. “I don’t want this,” he said hoarsely. “Tell me how to get out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no way out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her. Masterson was at home, but she dealt with this impossible situation alone because her beloved husband couldn’t face the bastard who would now bear his exalted title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He could denounce me,” Alistair suggested, “which would open an avenue for a relative to inherit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alistair …” She lifted a handkerchief to her mouth and sobbed, the wretched sound tearing through his innards like claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He cannot even face me. He must want a way out as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If there was an alternative he could live with, yes. But he will not be a cuckold or shame me, and the next in line to inherit is a distant cousin whose worth is questionable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not want this,” he said again, stomach churning. Alistair wanted a life of travel and adventure with Jessica. He wanted to bring her joy and challenges, and the freedom to erase the oppression of her youth with an adulthood that was boundless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will be one of the wealthiest men in England now—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By God, I won’t touch a shilling of Masterson’s precious coin,” he bit out, his blood boiling at the mere suggestion. “You have no notion of the things I’ve done to be solvent. He gave me scant assistance when I most needed it. I damned well won’t take anything from him now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouisa rose, her hands twisting in her kerchief. Tears coursed unchecked down her hollowed cheeks. “What would you have me do? I cannot regret your birth. I would not go back and give you up. To have you in my life I had to risk this, and Masterson took that risk for me. With me. We made the decision together, and we will abide by it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yet here you stand, alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer chin lifted. “My choice. My consequence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbandoning the fireplace, he approached her. The ceiling hung thirty feet above them; the nearest wall was a score of feet away. Every Masterson holding boasted similar cavernous spaces containing furnishings and artwork accumulated over centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distant walls closed in, squeezing Alistair’s chest like a vise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d never felt connected to any of it, had never felt a sense of familial pride or a sense of belonging. Bearing the title would be akin to wearing a mask. He’d donned a role once before to survive, but now he was comfortable with who he was. Comfortable being the man Jessica loved unconditionally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your choice,” he said softly, feeling very much like the impostor he was being told to be. “But I must pay the price.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaying as a guest in Regmont’s house, Jess slept not a wink all night. Her thoughts sped too swiftly through her mind, her heart breaking at every turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlistair was now the Marquess of Baybury. Someday in the future, he would become the Duke of Masterson. Immense power and prestige came with those stations, but so, too, did grave responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not take a barren woman to wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn both the Acheron and the island, they’d slept until noon. On their second morning in London, however, Alistair came calling at the ungodly hour of eight o’clock. She was dressed and ready for him, knowing he would come to her as soon as it was acceptable to do so. Knowing she had to be strong enough for both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe descended the stairs with as much decorum as she could manage while feeling as if she was headed toward the gallows. When she rounded the bend in the stairs leading to the foyer, she found Alistair waiting with one hand atop the newel post and one foot propped on the bottom stair. He retained his hat and wore black from head to toe. His features appeared as stark as she felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his arms to her, and she raced to fill them, dashing down the remaining stairs and launching herself against him. He caught her easily, squeezing tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am so sorry for your loss,” she breathed, her fingers kneading restlessly into his tense nape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am sorry for my gain.” His voice was flat and cold, but his embrace was not. He pressed his temple to hers and held her as if he would never let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment, he allowed her to lead him into the parlor. They both remained standing, facing each other. He looked tired and older than his years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning a hand through his hair, he groaned his frustration. “It seems we are to be trapped.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, then stumbled toward the nearest chair. Her heartbeat was too quick and erratic, making her dizzy. We, he said, as she had known he would. She sank into a yellow damask-covered wingback and sucked in a deep breath. “You’ll be busy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, damn it all. It has already started. The moment Masterson learned I’d returned, he began filling a schedule for me. I haven’t a free quarter hour to myself over the next three days. God knows if I’ll even be allowed to relieve myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart ached for him. He resented the road set before him, but he was more than competent. He had a brilliant head for business matters and an air of command that earned the respect of great men. “In no time at all, you will have everything running so smoothly others will stand back in awe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t give a damn what he thinks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t referring to Masterson, but regardless, you care what your mother thinks and she cares about what he thinks. She loves you and fought for you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is enough?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look he shot her was combative. She held his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe growled. “God, I miss you. I detest this game of waiting for certain hours to see you and lying in bed at night without you beside me. I miss having your ear and being the grateful recipient of your counsel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess’s eyes stung. He looked so hard faced, discouraged, and alone. He’d retained his hat, and he worried the brim with restless hands, twisting the chapeau around and around. “I will always be available to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what you wanted,” he said gruffly, “but I can’t wait for it. It may take months to work through the morass my life has become, and I cannot focus on that while starving for you. I’ve come to ask you to elope with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands linked in her lap. The pain in her chest was agonizing, nearly debilitating. “That wouldn’t be wise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stilled, his fevered gaze narrowing. “Don’t do this to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You knew I would. That is why you’re so agitated and why you came to me with the sun barely in the sky.” She blew out a deep breath. “You need me to do this so you can move forward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do what, Jess?” he asked with dangerous softness. “Say it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Afford you the time and space to become accustomed to who you will have to be from this point in your life onward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what you wanted,” she corrected, “but now you have so much more to consider. Where do all the pieces fit? Do some overlap? Are others obsolete? You won’t know until you immerse yourself in this role you’ve assumed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t,” he snapped, his voice vibrating with fury. “Don’t you dare sit there so primly and speak about the dissolution of our relationship in that toneless voice as if you are asking me if I want more tea instead of ripping out my heart!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alistair …” Her lower lip quivered and she bit it, tasting blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re afraid,” he accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t you? It is the worst state of mind in which to make life-altering decisions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nostrils flared. “You cannot live without me, either, Jess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t; she knew that. She hoped she wouldn’t have to. But they both had to be certain. “Hester needs me now. I can’t leave her.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seven-years-to-sin-historical-1/page-30.html","bookId":2663,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:56 AM"}
