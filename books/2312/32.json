He’d just given himself something to think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mike,” Garrity said, coming toward him with a hand outstretched. “Sorry to keep you waiting. Had a phone call from a fellow with a hankering to buy a little five-acre lot of mine on the south edge of town. Thing is, I don’t want to sell it to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But there’s ten acres on the other side of town I’d be perfectly happy to sell to him, but he’ll only want it if he thinks of it himself. So that left me on the phone longer than I would have liked. Now what would you say to a glass of brandy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe a small one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrity led the way to the den, poured drinks for both of them. “You should have come earlier,” he said. “In time for dinner. I hope you know you don’t need an invitation. There’ll always be a place for you at our table.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you can’t talk about it,” Garrity said, “but I hope your project here in town is shaping up nicely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Slow but sure,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some things can’t be hurried,” Garrity allowed, and sipped brandy, and winced. If Keller hadn’t been looking for it, he might have missed the shadow that crossed his host’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently he said, “Is the pain bad, Wally?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s that, Mike?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller put his glass on the table. “I spoke to Dr. Jacklin,” he said. “I know what you’re going through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That son of a bitch,” Garrity said, “was supposed to keep his mouth shut.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, he thought it was all right to talk to me,” Keller said. “He thought I was Dr. Edward Fishman from the Mayo Clinic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calling for a consultation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did go to Mayo,” Garrity said, “but they didn’t need to call Harold Jacklin to double-check their results. They just confirmed his diagnosis and told me not to buy any long-playing records.” He looked to one side. “They said they couldn’t say for sure how much time I had left, but that the pain would be manageable for a while. And then it wouldn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’d have all my faculties for a while,” he said. “And then I wouldn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller didn’t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, hell,” Garrity said. “A man wants to take the bull by the horns, doesn’t he? I decided I’d go out for a walk with a shotgun and have a little hunting accident. Or I’d be cleaning a handgun here at my desk and have it go off. But it turned out I just couldn’t tolerate the idea of killing myself. Don’t know why, can’t explain it, but that seems to be the way I’m made.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up his glass and looked at the brandy. “Funny how we hang on to life,” he said. “Something else Sam Johnson said, said there wasn’t a week of his life he’d voluntarily live through again. I’ve had more good times than bad, Mike, and even the bad times haven’t been that godawful, but I think I know what he was getting at. I wouldn’t want to repeat any of it, but that doesn’t mean there’s a minute of it I’d have been willing to miss. I don’t want to miss whatever’s coming next, either, and I don’t guess Dr. Johnson did either. That’s what keeps us going, isn’t it? Wanting to find out what’s around the next bend in the river.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought that would make the end easier to face,” he said. “Not knowing when it was coming, or how or where. And I recalled that years ago a fellow told me to let him know if I ever needed to have somebody killed. ‘You just let me know,’ he said, and I laughed, and that was the last said on the subject. A month or so ago I looked up his number and called him, and he gave me another number to call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you put out a contract.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that the expression? Then that’s what I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suicide by proxy,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I guess you’re holding my proxy,” Garrity said, and drank some brandy. “You know, the thought flashed across my mind that first night, talking with you after you pulled my grandson out of the pool. I got this little glimmer, but I told myself I was being ridiculous. A hired killer doesn’t turn up and save somebody’s life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s out of character,” Keller agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides, what would you be doing at the party in the first place? Wouldn’t you stay out of sight and wait until you could get me alone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I’d been thinking straight,” Keller said. “I told myself it wouldn’t hurt to have a look around. And this joker from the hotel bar assured me I had nothing to worry about. ‘Half the town’ll be at Wally’s tonight,’ he said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Half the town was. You wouldn’t have tried anything that night, would you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember thinking, I hope he’s not here. I hope it’s not tonight. Because I was enjoying the party and I didn’t want to miss anything. But youwere there, and a good thing, wasn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Saved the boy from drowning. According to the Chinese, you save somebody’s life, you’re responsible for him for the rest ofyour life. Because you’ve interfered with the natural order of things. That make sense to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or me either. You can’t beat them for whipping up a meal or laundering a shirt, but they’ve got some queer ideas on other subjects. Of course they’d probably say the same for some of my notions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrity looked at his glass. “You called my doctor,” he said. “Must have been to confirm a suspicion you already had. What tipped you off? Is it starting to show in my face, or the way I move around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller shook his head. “I couldn’t find anybody else with a motive,” he said, “or a grudge against you. You were the only one left. And then I remembered seeing you wince once or twice, and try to hide it. I barely noticed it at the time, but then I started to think about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought it would be easier than doing it myself,” Garrity said. “I thought I’d just let a professional take me by surprise. I’d be like an old bull elk on a hillside, never expecting the bullet that takes him out in his prime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It makes sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it doesn’t. Because the elk didn’t arrange for the hunter to be there. Far as the elk knows, he’s all alone there. He’s not wondering every damn day if today’s the day. He’s not bracing himself, trying to sense the crosshairs centering on his shoulder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never thought of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Neither did I,” said Garrity. “Or I never would have called that fellow in the first place. Mike, what the hell are you doing here tonight? Don’t tell me you came over to kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I came to tell you I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because we’ve come to know each other.” Keller nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I grew up on a farm,” Garrity said. “One of those vanishing family farms you hear about, and of course it’s vanished, and I say good riddance. But we raised our own beef and pork, you know, and we kept a milk cow and a flock of laying hens. And we never named the animals we were going to wind up eating. The milk cow had a name, but not the bull calf she dropped. The breeder sow’s name was Elsie, but we never named her piglets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Makes sense,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess it doesn’t take a Chinaman to see how you can’t kill me once you’ve hauled Timmy out of the drink. Let alone after you’ve sat at my table and smoked my cigars. Reminds me, you care for a cigar?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, where do we go from here, Mike? I have to say I’m relieved. I feel like I’ve been bracing myself for a bullet for weeks now. All of a sudden I’ve got a new lease on life. I’d say this calls for a drink except we’re already having one, and you’ve scarcely touched yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is one thing,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the den while Garrity made his phone call. Timothy was in the living room, puzzling over a chessboard. Keller played a game with him and lost badly. “Can’t win ’em all,” he said, and tipped over his king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was going to checkmate you,” the boy said. “In a few more moves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could see it coming,” Keller told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back to the den. Garrity was selecting a cigar from his humidor. “Sit down,” he said. “I’m fixing to smoke one of these things. If you won’t kill me, maybe it will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You never know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I made the call, Mike, and it’s all taken care of. Be a while before the word filters up and down the chain of command, but sooner or later they’ll call you up and tell you the client changed his mind. He paid in full and called off the job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked some, then sat a while in silence. At length Keller said he ought to get going. “I should be at my hotel,” he said, “in case they call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be a couple of days, won’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably,” he said, “but you never know. If everyone involved makes a phone call right away, the word could get to me in a couple of hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calling you off, telling you to come home. Be glad to get home, I bet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s nice here,” he said, “but yes, I’ll be glad to get home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wherever it is, they say there’s no place like it.” Garrity leaned back, then allowed himself to wince at the pain that came over him. “If it never hurts worse than this,” he said, “then I can stand it. But of course it will get worse. And I’ll decide I can standthat, and then it’ll get worse again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing to say to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess I’ll know when it’s time to do something,” Garrity said. “And who knows? Maybe my heart’ll cut out on me out of the blue. Or I’ll get hit by a bus, or I don’t know what. Struck by lightning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It could happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything can happen,” Garrity agreed. He got to his feet. “Mike,” he said, “I guess we won’t be seeing any more of each other, and I have to say I’m a little bit sorry about that. I’ve truly enjoyed our time together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So have I, Wally.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wondered, you know, what he’d be like. The man they’d send to do this kind of work. I don’t know what I expected, but you’re not it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stuck out his hand, and Keller gripped it. “Take care,” Garrity said. “Be well, Mike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at his hotel, Keller took a hot bath and got a good night’s sleep. In the morning he went out for breakfast, and when he got back there was a message at the desk for him:Mr. Soderholm-please call your office. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-man-keller-1/page-32.html","bookId":2312,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM"}
