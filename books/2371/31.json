One of the best animators in Hollywood was Friz Freleng, but he had worked mostly in motion pictures, and had done very little television. I sent him the pilot script and asked him if he would be interested in animating the opening sequence. He was, and he created a brilliant opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hired Dick Wess, a talented composer, to write the music for the first season, but after hearing it, I felt it was wrong for the show. Instead, I used a bright, upbeat melody written by Hugo Montenegro for the Jeannie theme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottle that I selected for Jeannie\u0027s home was a Jim Beam liquor decanter, which we painted in bright colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first day of rehearsal went smoothly. We had a reading of the pilot script with the cast and our director, Gene Nelson, and I asked the actors if they needed any changes, or if they were comfortable with their lines. I wanted to make sure the actors were satisfied because I wanted no ad-libbing when they started to shoot. Everyone was happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI Dream of Jeannie was ready to start creating its magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, less than an hour after production on the pilot began, my secretary said, \"Mr. Nelson is calling from the set.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not wait to hear the good news. \"Gene - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m quitting. Get someone else. Sorry.\" He started to hang up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! Wait a minute!\" I was panicky. \"Stay right where you are. I\u0027m on my way down there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree minutes later, I was on the set. I took Gene aside. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. That\u0027s the problem. I can\u0027t work with actors who don\u0027t know their lines. Larry Hagman doesn\u0027t know his lines and Bill Daily doesn\u0027t know his lines, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay right here.\" I was furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Larry over to the side. \"How dare you come on this set the first day of shooting and not know your lines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me in surprise. \"What are you talking about? I know my lines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The director says you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, all I did was to expand on them a little. I had some ideas, and I just added a few things here and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Larry! Listen to me and listen carefully. We have a tight schedule. We have a lot of pages to shoot every day. You\u0027ll say the lines exactly as they\u0027re written. Is that clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Yeah, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Bill Daily aside. \"What excuse do you have for not knowing your lines?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I\u0027m sorry, Sidney. I - I\u0027ve never had to learn lines before. I always worked in clubs like The Improv. I did a comedy act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not The Improv,\" I snapped. \"If you want to stay in this show, you\u0027ve got to memorize your lines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to Gene Nelson. \"There\u0027s been a little misunderstanding, Gene. I think after today, everything is going to be fine. I want you to stay with the show. Larry will be great. I\u0027m going to tape Bill\u0027s dialogue and let him play it in the car on his way to and from the studio, so he can learn it. Will you give it another chance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause. \"I\u0027ll try, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opening scene of the pilot was filmed at Zuma Beach, thirty miles northwest of Los Angeles. The scene consisted of Larry, as an astronaut, stranded on a deserted island when his spacecraft malfunctions. He sees a bottle, uncorks it, and finds a genie inside. Since he has freed her, by the rules of the genie game, he is now her master. She blinks in a rescue ship and he thinks he has gotten rid of her, but she has no intention of leaving him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene went well. The day went well and we were all pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way back to the studio, in a company limousine, I got my first glimpse of Larry Hagman\u0027s ambition. We had stopped at a red light next to a car full of tourists. Larry rolled down the window of the limousine and, in a loud voice, yelled out at them, \"Someday you\u0027ll all know who I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarry had some emotional problems to deal with. His mother was Mary Martin, a top Broadway star, with whom he had a difficult relationship. She had been busy with her career, so Larry was raised by his father, Ben, in Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the time he lived with his grandmother and traveled back and forth to New York, to visit his mother. He wanted to show his mother that he could also be a star. Someday you\u0027ll all know who I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the pilot was finished but had not yet aired, I received a call from Mary Martin. \"Sidney, I would love to see the pilot. Is there any way you could arrange it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on my way east to work on The Patty Duke Show, so I arranged for the pilot of Jeannie to be screened for her in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the projection room were Mary Martin, a few executives from Screen Gems, and John Mitchell, who was head of sales for Screen Gems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the screening started, Mary Martin went up to John Mitchell, took his hand, and said, \"I hear you\u0027re the best salesman in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see John stand visibly taller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard so much about you,\" Mary Martin went on. \"They say that you\u0027re a genius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Mitchell tried not to blush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Screen Gems is very lucky to have you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe barely managed to stammer out the words \"Thank you, Miss Martin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screening began. When the show had ended, the lights came on. Mary Martin turned to John Mitchell and said, \"Anybody could have sold that show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched John shrink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeannie opened to mixed reviews. The critics were mostly dismissive, but the audience was not. The show had a loyal following from the beginning and it grew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to use guest stars on this show also. Farrah Fawcett did a segment, as well as Dick Van Patten, Richard Mulligan, Don Rickles, and Milton Berle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote a script about a fake fortune-teller, called \"Bigger than a Bread Box and Better than a Genie.\" I asked Jorja to play the part of a fortune-teller. It was in the spring and Natalie was coming to visit us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJorja said, \"Why don\u0027t you give Natalie a part in the show? She could play one of the characters in the seance scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"I think she\u0027d enjoy that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Natalie arrived, I asked, \"How would you like to be on television?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t mind,\" my mother said coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jorja is going to star as a fortune-teller and you can be one of the characters in the seance scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Fine.\" She was very composed about her debut on national television.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote a few lines for Natalie to read and left them with her. While I was working at the studio, Jorja rehearsed her in her part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning I auditioned Queenie Smith, a wonderful actress. I decided that she should have Natalie\u0027s lines, so I wrote some new lines for Natalie and when I got home that evening, I gave them to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read them and said, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was puzzled. \"No - what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t read these lines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because my character would never say this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis from a seventy-year-old woman who sold dresses in Chicago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI argued with her, but I could not take the lines away from her and I had to write something else for Queenie Smith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene went well. Colonel Chuck Yeager played himself in the episode. Natalie was so good that no one knew she was not a professional actress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarry had met her at dinner, so when he found out that she was going to be in the show, he jokingly said, \"Ahh, I see a little bit of nepotism here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, Larry,\" I told him. \"Fair is fair. When your mother comes to town, I\u0027ll be happy to use her in the show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe network had moved Jeannie from Saturday night to Monday night. It was only the beginning. The following year it was Tuesday night. The next year Monday, and the next year Tuesday. Fortunately our audience was loyal enough to find us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, after Natalie had returned to Chicago, \"Bigger than a Bread Box\" appeared on television. She called me the day after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been getting phone calls all morning. I\u0027m a star.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had shot a dozen shows and the studio and network were very pleased with them. Jorja and I were at a friend\u0027s house for dinner when I received a telephone call from Barbara Eden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sidney, I have to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, Barbara, I\u0027ll be in the studio in the morning and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I have to see you tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you when I see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her the address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arrived an hour later. I took her into the den. She was near tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to replace me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stunned. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a moment for this to sink in. \"Congratulations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to do this to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t done anything to me. You\u0027re staying on the show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me in surprise. \"But how - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning I asked Gene Nelson to come to the office. \"Gene, we have a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard,\" he said. \"Barbara\u0027s pregnant. What are we going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to raise the camera higher. We\u0027ll shoot her above the waist, cover her with more veils, and use long shots. We can manage. I don\u0027t want to replace her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was thoughtful for a moment. \"Neither do I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we managed to finish the season from the third week to the eighth month of her pregnancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were storm clouds brewing in the east, so I flew back to New York to see if I could help calm things down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn and Ethel Ross had found out that Patty and Harry Falk continued to secretly meet. Determined not to let it develop into a romance, the Rosses arranged for the show to be moved to California for its third season. In a sense it was a good move for me, because I no longer had to be bicoastal. But trouble was looming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I came back to California, I found a beautiful house for Jorja and me to rent in Thousand Oaks. I knew Patty and the Rosses were looking for a place, so I suggested that they look at the house I was going to take, and if they liked it, I would let them have it. They did like it and they moved in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNASA was very cooperative with the Jeannie production. We toured Edwards Air Force Base and the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and met several of the astronauts. Many of them watched the show and were fans. They let us use their facilities at Edwards, where I took a flight in a Gemini simulator and sampled the dehydrated food. It was terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ratings for Jeannie remained high the first year, but all was not well on the set. The problem was Larry Hagman. I planned to use more guest stars, but Larry was always antagonistic toward them. He would be sullen and ignore them, and spend time sulking in his dressing room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to be the star and he wanted it now. It was Barbara who was getting all the magazine covers and interviews. Larry wanted to show the world that he could be as successful as his mother. The result was that he put himself and everyone else under tremendous pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not aware of it then, but every morning Larry opened a bottle of champagne and began drinking. It never affected his work on the set. He always knew his lines and was never less than adroit. But the pressure began to show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning, after a reading, I asked the actors if there were any problems. All of them said they were satisfied. When I got back to my office there was a call from Gene Nelson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need your help, Sidney. Larry\u0027s in his dressing room, crying. He won\u0027t come out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to Larry\u0027s dressing room and we talked for a long time. Finally, I said, \"Larry, I\u0027m going to do everything I can to help you. I\u0027ll write scripts where the plots will revolve around you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, I began to write scripts to build up Larry\u0027s character and make him more prominent. But when an actor is in a show with a scantily dressed actress as beautiful and enticing as Barbara Eden, it is very difficult for him to become the star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarry became more and more miserable, and it was upsetting everyone on the set. Barbara was very patient with him. I finally had another talk with Larry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Larry, do you like this show?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re not happy doing it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure you do. You want to be in a show where you\u0027re the star.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a very important part of this show, Larry. But if you want to stay in it, you have to take the pressure off yourself. I think you should see a psychiatrist. And I wouldn\u0027t wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"You\u0027re right. I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short while later, he told me he had made regular appointments to see a psychologist. It helped to a degree, but the tension was still there. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-other-side-of-me/page-31.html","bookId":2371,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM"}
