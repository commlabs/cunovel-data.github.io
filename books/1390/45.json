Then they went their ways, nor was it long or ever Hamdir stumbled, and thrust down his hand to steady himself, and spake therewith —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Naught but a true thing spake Erp, for now should I have fallen, had not hand been to steady me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A little after Sorli stumbled, but turned about on his feet, and so stood, and spake —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yea now had I fallen, but that I steadied myself with both feet.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And they said they had done evilly with Erp their brother.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But on they fare till they come to the abode of King Jormunrek, and they went up to him and set on him forthwith, and Hamdir cut both hands from him and Sorli both feet. Then spake Hamdir —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Off were the head if Erp were alive; our brother whom we slew on the way, and found out our deed too late.” Even as the Song says, —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Off were the head\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If Erp were alive yet,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Our brother the bold,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whom we slew by the way,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The well-famed in warfare.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now in this must they turn away from the words of their mother, whereas they had to deal with stones. For now men fell on them, and they defended themselves in good and manly wise, and were the scathe of many a man, nor would iron bite on them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But there came thereto a certain man, old of aspect and one-eyed,51 and he spake —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No wise men are ye, whereas ye cannot bring these men to their end.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the king said, “Give us rede thereto, if thou canst.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He said, “Smite them to the death with stones.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In such wise was it done, for the stones flew thick and fast from every side, and that was the end of their life-days.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now has come to an end the whole root and stem of the Giukings. 52\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e NOW MAY ALL EARLS\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e BE BETTERED IN MIND,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e MAY THE GRIEF OF ALL MAIDENS\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e EVER BE MINISHED,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e FOR THIS TALE OF TROUBLE\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e SO TOLD TO ITS ENDING.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1417/43275.html","bookId":1390,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:12:08 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:12:08 AM"}
