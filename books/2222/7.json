Free vodka martinis, shaken, not stirred. Strippers, too. Very tasteful. They danced to songs from the James Bond movies—Goldfinger, Diamonds Are Forever, Goldeneye.

I thought about it as I went into the “family room,” slipped a Toots Thielemans CD on the machine, and listened to his jazz harmonica from nineteen speakers strategically placed in eight rooms and my basement. I thought about it as I ate a dish of leftover beef lo mein in the kitchen. I thought about it as I paced the empty living room and the dining room—at least it will be a dining room once I buy a table and a few chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to me that I hadn’t thrown a single dinner party in the past two years without inviting Nina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, I’m going to get those guys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I couldn’t bring myself to sue them. I couldn’t sue cops—I used to be a cop. I couldn’t file a complaint with the Justice Department for the same reason. Besides, my inner voice reminded me, you and the FBI aren’t exactly like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed fingers on two hands and held them up—and shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep talking to yourself this way, the next thing you know you’ll be collecting cats.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could call the ACLU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah. I support most of what they do, but sometimes I just want to smack ‘em upside the head. Dammit, stop talking to yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, kitty, kitty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Arrgggggg!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting close to slapping myself silly when I decided to sleep it off. I showered, shaved, brushed my teeth, and went to bed. The dream came quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass door of the convenience store swung open. The suspect didn’t see me. I tucked the recoil pad of the shotgun against my shoulder and sighted down the barrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Police. Drop the gun. Put your hands in the air.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe suspect turned toward me. He was holding a paper bag in his left hand and an S\u0026amp;W .38 in his right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For God’s sake drop the gun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe suspect raised his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fired once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wide-awake when the phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s Nina, calling to forgive you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nina,” I said into the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a slight pause, followed by a woman’s voice I didn’t recognize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rushmore McKenzie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s calling, please?” I was expecting a sales pitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. McKenzie, my name is G. K. Bonalay. I’m an attorney representing Merodie Davies.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4/page-7.html","bookId":2222,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM"}
