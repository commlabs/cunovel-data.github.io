Oh, My! What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas—at least that’s Delilah Street’s hope. With Sin City’s vampire and werewolf mobs wanting to cash in her chips once and for all, she’s retreating with her partner Ric Montoya and half-wolfhound Quicksilver to her Kansas birthplace. Unfortunately, when it comes to finding trouble, there’s no place like home. . . . \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t take long before Delilah realizes she’s not in Vegas anymore. Zombie cowboys and spectral cattle drives are kicking up dust, the local weather girls are total witches who forecast perfect storms, and some Hollywood fanatic is recasting zombies as the greatest stars of the silver screen. And speaking of silver, Delilah’s special affinity for the all-purpose monster-repellent leads her posse straight down a silver brick road—and into a notso- fun house of mirrors—putting her face-to-face with her dicey past and a mystery woman named Lilith, who’s a real dead ringer for Delilah. The key word being dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/silver-zombie-delilah-street-4.jpg","author":"Carole Nelson Douglas","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/silver-zombie-delilah-street-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:49 PM"}
