Gravel spilled down the long rock face. When Emily looked over the side, all she could see was deep, infinite darkness. She glanced over her shoulder then and saw Aria getting out of the car. “Emily!” she cried. “Oh my God!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey nudged Emily closer to the edge, and Emily let out a scream. Kelsey was going to do to Emily exactly what Mona had tried to do to Spencer, what Tabitha had tried to do to Hanna, what Ali had tried to do to all of them. Except this time, A would live . . . and A’s victim would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” Emily glanced imploringly at Kelsey. “You don’t want to do this. Maybe we can talk this over. Figure it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s nothing to figure out,” Kelsey said in a deflated voice. “This is the way it has to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emily!” Aria screamed, running closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she wasn’t close enough. Kelsey’s fingers curled around Emily’s shoulder. Her breath was hot in her ear. Her whole body seemed to stiffen, as though preparing to push Emily over. Emily shut her eyes, realizing these were her last few seconds of being alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” she whispered one more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, suddenly, Kelsey released her grip from Emily’s arm. Emily turned in time to see Kelsey walking to the edge of the precipice. She caught Emily’s eye, but the crazy, dangerous look was gone. She seemed exhausted and incredibly sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good-bye,” Kelsey said in the most pathetic voice Emily had ever heard. There were tears in her eyes. Her hands were shaking so violently they smacked against her waist. A thin trickle of blood dripped from her nose. She looked over the edge and took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kelsey!” It took Emily only a second to realize what was happening. “Don’t jump!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey ignored her, inching forward until her toes dangled over the edge. More rocks cascaded into the quarry. “It’s too late. I’m so sick of how shitty life is.” She was slurring her words so badly Emily could barely understand her. “I’m so sick of everything.” She shut her eyes and took a step into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Emily wrapped her arms around Kelsey’s waist. Kelsey tried to elbow her away, but Emily mustered up all her strength and ripped Kelsey backward. They both staggered onto the grass. Kelsey grunted, trying to break free. Emily pulled her even tighter. Her ankle turned once more, and all of a sudden, she was on the wet, slick ground with Kelsey on top of her. Pain cracked through her head and her tailbone. Coldness from the rocks seeped straight through her coat and into her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blacked out for a few moments, hearing only faint sobs and the vague sounds of footsteps. When she came to, Hanna was leaning over her. “Emily? Emily! Oh my God!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily blinked hard. Kelsey was no longer on top of her. She looked around frantically, afraid Kelsey had thrown herself into the quarry, but the girl was only a few feet away, curled into a ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” Aria appeared above Emily, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I-I don’t know,” Emily said dazedly. And then everything swarmed back to her. The fear. The certainty that she had been about to die. How Kelsey knew everything. Tears streamed down her face. Her body heaved and bucked. Her sobs sounded messy and ugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna and Aria knelt down and hugged her tight. “It’s okay,” they whispered. “You’re safe now. We promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” another voice said a few feet away. Emily opened her eyes and saw a third figure squatting next to Kelsey. “Wake up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s jaw dropped. It was Spencer. She’d doubted Spencer and double-crossed her, and she’d come anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guys?” Spencer looked up and pushed her blond hair away from her face. “Look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved out of the way for the girls to see. Kelsey’s back was arched, her head was flung to the side, and her arms and legs danced as though they were being pumped with a million volts of electric power. Bile bubbled out of her mouth. Cords stood out prominently on her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong with her?” Hanna screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m calling 911.” Aria pulled out her phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think she’s OD’ing.” Spencer kneeled down to Kelsey’s face. “She must have taken something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stood up weakly and staggered to Kelsey’s bag, which was still sitting on the driver’s seat of her car. Inside was the vial of pills, half empty. “This.” She showed the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer looked at them and nodded. “Easy A.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ambulance screamed up the gulch road minutes after Aria’s call. EMTs surrounded Kelsey and immediately started treatment, telling the girls to step back. Emily hugged her chest, feeling cold and numb. Aria watched the EMTs with a hand over her mouth. Hanna kept shaking her head and saying, “Oh my God.” Spencer looked like she was going to be sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, the ambulance driver, an athletic woman with shoulder-length brown hair, walked over to the girls. “What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think she was trying to kill herself,” Emily answered, her voice still weak. “I guess she took too many pills . . . and she was going to jump into the gulch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe EMTs checked Emily for any injuries, but besides feeling bruised and banged up, she was fine. Then they loaded Kelsey in the ambulance and drove off. Emily silently watched the red lights swirl down the hill. She listened to the sirens until the sound disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deafening silence followed. Emily walked over to Spencer, who was staring across the huge ravine. This was the same view she’d looked out upon over a year ago, just when Mona was about to kill her. It didn’t seem like a coincidence that they were back here, fighting A again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” Emily said quietly. “I shouldn’t have doubted you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay,” Spencer answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I told her everything.” Emily shut her eyes. “I told Kelsey what you did at Penn. How you sent her to juvie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer whipped her head up. All kinds of emotions played across her face. “You did?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily frowned. “She didn’t mention that when she talked to you tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer shook her head. “Everything moved so fast. We just screamed at each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily placed her head in her hands. “I’m so sorry. I never should have . . .” She trailed off, choking with sobs. Everything felt so wrong. “I’m a terrible friend. I wasn’t there for you.” She meant it in more ways than one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, it’s okay.” Spencer touched Emily’s shoulder. “I get it. And it was a horrible thing I did. Maybe I deserved it, too, after what I said to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind howled. Far off, Emily thought she could still hear the sirens. Hanna and Aria crunched over, quiet and solemn. “Kelsey’s going to tell everyone what we did to Tabitha,” Hanna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one will believe her,” Spencer said. “She’s on drugs. They’ll think she hallucinated the whole thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But she has proof,” Hanna argued. “She has that picture of Tabitha dead on the beach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What picture?” Emily shrieked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer reached for her phone, then shrugged and seemed to change her mind. “It’s a long story. Honestly, I should delete it. Pretend I never got it. But even a picture of Tabitha doesn’t prove we did anything. It might even make her look guilty. Who takes a picture of a dead body and doesn’t report it? Everyone will think she’s just . . . crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn airplane flew silently overhead, its red light blinking on and off. A bird let out a long, hollow call somewhere in the ravine. Everyone turned back toward Aria’s car, feeling shaken but slightly relieved. But then, Kelsey’s words whipped through Emily’s mind once more. You let it happen. You’re a horrible person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust because no one believed Kelsey didn’t mean it hadn’t happened. Emily was a horrible person. That guilt would never go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 34\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFAMILY STICKS TOGETHER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna awoke the next morning to the sound of Dot’s nails scratching against her bedroom door. “I’ll be there in a second, sweetie,” she moaned, sitting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun streamed through the windows of the Juliet balcony. Birds chirped in the trees. It seemed like a perfectly pleasant morning . . . until Hanna remembered what had happened the night before. Kelsey. Floating Man. The ambulance taking her away. She’d looked so fragile. So helpless. Once again, they’d narrowly escaped A ruining their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was over now. She grabbed her iPhone and scrolled through her texts. Strangely, Liam hadn’t written her a note this morning—that was a first. Had he gotten home okay? It was 9:23 A.M., a little early, but she could call him, right? She dialed his number, but it went to voice mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wake up, sleepyhead,” Hanna cooed after the beep. “I hope I can see you today. I miss you already. Call me back when you get this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter changing into a pair of skinny jeans and a Petit Bateau T-shirt, she walked down three flights of stairs to the kitchen carrying Dot in her arms. Her father sat at the breakfast bar, looking over a pile of spreadsheets. Kate hunched over half a grapefruit at the table, staring at the paper. When she saw Hanna enter, she gave her a strange look. Hanna pretended to fix a tag on Dot’s collar. Kate had probably found out that Hanna ditched the play and was pissed, but the last thing Hanna wanted was a petty fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate wouldn’t stop staring, though, even as Hanna let out Dot, poured herself a cup of coffee, and added a splash of soy milk. “What?” Hanna snapped finally. God, it wasn’t like it had been Kate’s Broadway debut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um . . .” Kate looked down at the Style section of the newspaper and pushed it toward Hanna with one finger. Hanna stared at it. When she saw the image on the open page, she spit up a mouthful of coffee all over the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you all right?” Mr. Marin turned and slid off the stool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.” Hanna dabbed the coffee with a napkin. “Just fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was far from fine. She looked at the image on the newspaper page again, praying she was imagining things. Three pictures of Liam’s handsome, smiling face stared back at her. In the first one, he had his arm around a thin blond girl with a pointy nose. In the second, he was kissing a dark-haired girl in a swingy jersey dress. And in the third, he was walking down a busy Philly street, hand-in-hand with a short-haired girl wearing oversized sunglasses and a Burberry trench. A Real-Life Romeo, In Love With Love, said the caption next to the montage. Liam Wilkinson is one of Philly’s most eligible bachelors . . . and he loves playing the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hard, thick ball lodged in Hanna’s throat. The photo caption named each of the girls Liam was with and when he’d been seen with them. One of the photos was from earlier this week, on a day Hanna and Liam hadn’t seen each other. And the short-haired girl, whose name was Hazel, was described as “Liam’s long-term girlfriend he hopes to marry someday.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ruthless-pretty-little-liars-10/page-34.html","bookId":2386,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:41 AM"}
