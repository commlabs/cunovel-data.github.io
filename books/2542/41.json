What else had happened in the chapel? The torn wallpaper. What had that meant? The medallion - broken, like a spearhead pointing at the altar. And, on the altar, the open Bible. \"God.\" His voice was trembling, eager. He was so close - so close. \" If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out.\" Ego, the thought recurred. \" If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out.\" Ego. He stopped, his inner senses heightening with awareness. He was almost there. Something; something. \" If thy right eye - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tape!\" he cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whirled and rushed for the doorway. Edith ran after him as he plunged into the corridor and over to the staircase. He was halfway down before she\u0027d reached the landing, springing down the steps with vaulting leaps. Edith descended as quickly as she could and ran across the entry hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was at the great-hall table, listening to the tape recorder. She bit her lip involuntarily as she heard Lionel\u0027s voice. \" -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecausing brief systemic shock.\" Fischer made a grumbling sound and shook his head as he pressed the REVERSE button and turned the spool back, pressed the PLAY button again. \"Dynamometer fourteen hundred and sixty,\" Lionel\u0027s voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer made an impatient sound and reversed the spool again, waited, pushed the button for PLAY position. Edith heard Florence\u0027s voice saying, \" Get out of this house before I kill you all.\" Fischer snarled and punched the REVERSE button again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe switched to PLAY. \"Here too long,\" Florence\u0027s voice said deeply, supposedly the voice of her Indian guide. \"Not listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot understand. Too much sick inside.\" There was a pause. Fischer leaned across the table tensely, unaware that he was doing so. \"Limits,\" said the voice. \"Nations. Terms. Not know what that mean. Extremes and limits. Terminations and extremities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith flinched as Fischer cried out with a savage glee. He reversed the tape and played it again. \"Extremes and limits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerminations and extremities.\" Fischer snatched up the tape recorder and held it high above his head in triumph. \"She knew!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe shouted. \"She knew! She knew!\" He flung the tape recorder across the room. Before it had crashed to the floor, he was running for the entry hall. \"Come on!\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer sprinted across the entry hall and down the corridor, followed by Edith. With a howl like that of an attacking Indian, he flung open the chapel door and leaped inside. \"Belasco!\" he roared. \"I\u0027m here again! Destroy me if you can!\" Edith ran in beside him. \"Come on!\" he yelled. \"Both of us are here now! Finish us! Don\u0027t leave the job half done!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassive silence fell, and Edith heard how strangely Fischer breathed. \"Come on,\" he mumbled to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouted suddenly, \" Come on, you lousy bastard! \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith\u0027s gaze leaped toward the altar. For a moment she could not believe her hearing. Then the sounds grew louder, clearer, unmistakable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproaching footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew back automatically, eyes fixed on the altar. The footsteps were louder now. She was unconscious of Fischer\u0027s hand restraining her. She gaped at the altar. The sounds were getting louder every second. The floor began to shake. It was as though an unseen giant were approaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith whimpered, pulling constantly at Fischer\u0027s grip. The footsteps were almost deafening now. She tried to lift her hands to shield her ears but could lift only one. The chapel seemed to shudder with the thundering noises coming closer, closer. She jerked back hard, her cry of panic engulfed by the titanic, crashing footsteps. Closer; closer. We\u0027re going to die, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re going to die!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed as a violent explosion filled the chapel; closed her eyes involuntarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeathly silence made her open them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lurched back, gasping. Fischer held her. \"Don\u0027t be afraid.\" His voice was taut with excitement. \"This is a special moment, Edith. No one\u0027s ever seen his nibs before; not unless they were about to die, that is. Take a good look, Edith. Meet Emeric Belasco. \u0027 The Roaring Giant.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith gaped at the figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelasco was enormous; dressed in black, his features broad and white, framed by a jet-black beard. His teeth, bared in a savage grin, were those of a carnivore. His green eyes glowed with inner light. Edith had never seen such a malignant face in her life. Deep within the frozen dread she felt, she wondered why they weren\u0027t being murdered at this very moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me something, Belasco,\" Fischer said. Edith didn\u0027t know whether to feel reassurance or terror at the brazen insult in his tone. \"Why didn\u0027t you ever go outside? Why did you \u0027eschew the sunlight,\u0027 as you put it? Didn\u0027t care for it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Or was it better hiding in the shadows? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure started toward them. Released, Edith drew back quickly, horrified to see Fischer move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You walk with a labored tread, Belasco,\" Fischer said. \"You dominate your movements at a cost, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouted abruptly, fiercely, \"Don\u0027t you, Belasco?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith\u0027s mouth fell open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelasco had stopped moving. His features were ablaze with fury, but it seemed, somehow, a fury of frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at your lips, Belasco,\" Fischer said, still advancing. \"Spastic pressure holds them together. Look at your hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpastic tension holds them fisted at your sides. Why is that, Belasco? Is it because you\u0027re a fraud?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mocking cackle rang out in the chapel. \"Roaring Giant!\" he shouted. \"You? My ass! You bullshit artist! You sawed-off little freak!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith caught her breath. Belasco was retreating! She rubbed a shaking hand across her eyes. And it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did look smaller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evil?\" Fischer said. He moved at Belasco steadily, a look of ruthless animosity on his face. \"You, you funny little bastard?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hell-house/page-41.html","bookId":2542,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:29 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:29 AM"}
