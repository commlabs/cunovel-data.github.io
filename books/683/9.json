it is, I am sure, just as your dear father would have wished it, and as it would have pleased him best.’ \u0026nbsp;He paused, and Harold said in a low voice:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I tried hard, sir, to do what I thought he would like; and what you would.’ \u0026nbsp;The Squire went on more cheerfully:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I know that, my boy! \u0026nbsp;I know that well. \u0026nbsp;And I can tell you that it is not the least of the pleasures we have all had in your success, how you have justified yourself. \u0026nbsp;You have won many honours in the schools, and you have kept the reputation as an athlete which your father was so proud of. \u0026nbsp;Well, I suppose in the natural order of things you would go into a profession; and of course if you so desire you can do that. \u0026nbsp;But if you can see your way to it I would rather that you stayed here. \u0026nbsp;My house is your home as long as I live; but I don’t wish you to feel in any way dependent. \u0026nbsp;I want you to stay here if you will; but to do it just because you wish to. \u0026nbsp;To this end I have made over to you the estate at Camp which was my father’s gift to me when I came of age. \u0026nbsp;It is not a very large one; but it will give you a nice position of your own, and a comfortable income. \u0026nbsp;And with it goes my blessing, my dear boy. \u0026nbsp;Take it as a gift from your father and myself!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold was much moved, not only by the act itself but by the gracious way of doing it. \u0026nbsp;There were tears in his eyes as he wrung the Squire’s hand; his voice thrilled with feeling as he said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Your many goodnesses to my father’s son, sir, will, I hope, be justified by his love and loyalty. \u0026nbsp;If I don’t say much it is because I do not feel quite master of myself. \u0026nbsp;I shall try to show in time, as I cannot say it all at once, all that I feel.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold continued to live at Normanstand. \u0026nbsp;The house at Camp was in reality a charming cottage. \u0026nbsp;A couple of servants were installed, and now and again he stayed there for a few days as he wished to get accustomed to the place. \u0026nbsp;In a couple of months every one accepted the order of things; and life at Normanstand went on much as it had done before Harold had gone to college. \u0026nbsp;There was a man in the house now instead of a boy: that was all. \u0026nbsp;Stephen too was beginning to be a young woman, but the relative positions were the same as they had been. \u0026nbsp;Her growth did not seem to make an ostensible difference to any one. \u0026nbsp;The one who might have noticed it most, Mrs. Jarrold, had died during the last year of Harold’s life at college.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the day came for the quarterly meeting of the magistrates of the county of Norcester, Squire Rowly arranged as usual to drive Squire Norman. \u0026nbsp;This had been their habit for good many years. \u0026nbsp;The two men usually liked to talk over the meeting as they returned home together. \u0026nbsp;It was a beautiful morning for a drive, and when Rowly came flying up the avenue in his T-cart with three magnificent bays, Stephen ran out on the top of the steps to see him draw up. \u0026nbsp;Rowly was a fine whip, and his horses felt it. \u0026nbsp;Squire Norman was ready, and, after a kiss from Stephen, climbed into the high cart. \u0026nbsp;The men raised their hats and waved good-bye. \u0026nbsp;A word from Rowly; with a bound the horses were off. \u0026nbsp;Stephen stood looking at them delighted; all was so sunny, so bright, so happy. \u0026nbsp;The world was so full of life and happiness to-day that it seemed as if it would never end; that nothing except good could befall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold, later on that morning, was to go into Norcester also; so Stephen with a lonely day before her set herself to take up loose-ends of all sorts of little personal matters. \u0026nbsp;They would all meet at dinner as Rowly was to stop the night at Normanstand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold left the club in good time to ride home to dinner. \u0026nbsp;As he passed the County Hotel he stopped to ask if Squire Norman had left; and was told that he had started only a short time before with Squire Rowly in his T-cart. \u0026nbsp;He rode on fast, thinking that perhaps he might overtake them and ride on with them. \u0026nbsp;But the bays knew their work, and did it. \u0026nbsp;They kept their start; it was only at the top of the North hill, five miles out of Norcester, that he saw them in the distance, flying along the level road. \u0026nbsp;He knew he would not now overtake them, and so rode on somewhat more leisurely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Norcester highroad, when it has passed the village of Brackling, turns away to the right behind the great clump of oaks. \u0026nbsp;From this the road twists to the left again, making a double curve, and then runs to Norling Parva in a clear stretch of some miles before reaching the sharp turn down the hill which is marked ‘Dangerous to Cyclists.’ \u0026nbsp;From the latter village branches the by-road over the hill which is the short cut to Normanstand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Harold turned the corner under the shadow of the oaks he saw a belated road-mender, surrounded by some gaping peasants, pointing excitedly in the distance. \u0026nbsp;The man, who of course knew him, called to him to stop.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘What is it?’ he asked, reining up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘It be Squire Rowly’s bays which have run away with him. \u0026nbsp;Three on ’em, all in a row and comin’ like the wind. \u0026nbsp;Squire he had his reins all right, but they ’osses didn’t seem to mind ’un. \u0026nbsp;They was fair mad and bolted. \u0026nbsp;The leader he had got frightened at the heap o’ stones theer, an’ the others took scare from him.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Without a word Harold shook his reins and touched the horse with his whip. \u0026nbsp;The animal seemed to understand and sprang forward, covering the ground at a terrific pace. \u0026nbsp;Harold was not given to alarms, but here might be serious danger. \u0026nbsp;Three spirited horses in a light cart made for pace, all bolting in fright, might end any moment in calamity. \u0026nbsp;Never in his life did he ride faster than on the road to Norling Parva. \u0026nbsp;Far ahead of him he could see at the turn, now and again, a figure running. \u0026nbsp;Something had happened. \u0026nbsp;His heart grew cold: he knew as well as though he had seen it, the high cart swaying on one wheel round the corner as the maddened horses tore on their way; the one jerk too much, and the momentary reaction in the crash! . . .\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With beating heart and eyes aflame in his white face he dashed on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was all too true. \u0026nbsp;By the side of the roadway on the inner curve lay the cart on its side with broken shafts. \u0026nbsp;The horses were prancing and stamping about along the roadway not recovered from their fright. \u0026nbsp;Each was held by several men.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And on the grass two figures were still lying where they had been thrown out. \u0026nbsp;Rowly, who had of course been on the off-side, had been thrown furthest. \u0026nbsp;His head had struck the milestone that stood back on the waste ground before the ditch. \u0026nbsp;There was no need for any one to tell that his neck had been broken. \u0026nbsp;The way his head lay on one side, and the twisted, inert limbs, all told their story plainly enough.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Squire Norman lay on his back stretched out. \u0026nbsp;Some one had raised him to a sitting posture and then lowered him again, straightening his limbs. \u0026nbsp;He did not therefore look so dreadful as Rowly, but there were signs of coming death in the stertorous breathing, the ooze of blood from nostrils and ears as well as mouth. \u0026nbsp;Harold knelt down by him at once and examined him. \u0026nbsp;Those who were round all knew him and stood back. \u0026nbsp;He felt the ribs and limbs; so far as he could ascertain by touch no bone was broken.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just then the local doctor, for whom some one had run, arrived in his gig. \u0026nbsp;He, too, knelt beside the injured man, a quick glance having satisfied him that there was only one patient requiring his care. \u0026nbsp;Harold stood up and waited. \u0026nbsp;The doctor looked up, shaking his head. \u0026nbsp;Harold could hardly suppress the groan which was rising in his throat. \u0026nbsp;He asked:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Is it immediate? \u0026nbsp;Should his daughter be brought here?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘How long would it take her to arrive?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Perhaps half an hour;

But this was no time for sorrow, or for thinking of it. \u0026nbsp;That would come later. \u0026nbsp;All that was possible must be done; and to do it required a cool head. \u0026nbsp;He called to one of the lads he knew could ride and said to him:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Get on my horse and ride as fast as you can to Normanstand. \u0026nbsp;Send at once to Miss Norman and tell her that she is wanted instantly. \u0026nbsp;Tell her that there has been an accident; that her father is alive, but that she must come at once without a moment’s delay. \u0026nbsp;She had better ride my horse back as it will save time. \u0026nbsp;She will understand from that the importance of time. \u0026nbsp;Quick!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The lad sprang to the saddle, and was off in a flash. \u0026nbsp;Whilst Harold was speaking, the doctor had told the men, who, accustomed to hunting accidents, had taken a gate from its hinges and held it in readiness, to bring it closer. \u0026nbsp;Then under his direction the Squire was placed on the gate. \u0026nbsp;The nearest house was only about a hundred yards away; and thither they bore him. \u0026nbsp;He was lifted on a bed, and then the doctor made fuller examination. \u0026nbsp;When he stood up he looked very grave and said to Harold:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I greatly fear she cannot arrive in time. \u0026nbsp;That bleeding from the ears means rupture of the brain. \u0026nbsp;It is relieving the pressure, however, and he may recover consciousness before he dies. \u0026nbsp;You had better be close to him. \u0026nbsp;There is at present nothing that can be done. \u0026nbsp;If he becomes conscious at all it will be suddenly. \u0026nbsp;He will relapse and probably die as quickly.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All at once Norman opened his eyes, and seeing him said quietly, as he looked around:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘What place is this, Harold?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Martin’s—James Martin’s, sir. \u0026nbsp;You were brought here after the accident.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Yes, I remember! \u0026nbsp;Am I badly hurt?
