{"id":108239,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Complications,\" Jacob read. \"I don\u0027t like the sound of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not as bad as it sounds,\" Bella shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella and I walked silently to biology. I was trying to focus myself on the moment, on the girl beside me, on what was real and solid, on anything that would keep Alice\u0027s deceitful, meaningless visions out of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not meaningless,\" Jacob muttered, \"don\u0027t underestimate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe passed Angela Weber, lingering on the sidewalk, discussing an assignment with a boy from her Trigonometry class. I scanned her thoughts perfunctorily, expecting more disappointment, only to be surprised by their wistful tenor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, so there was something Angela wanted. Unfortunately, it wasn\u0027t something that could be easily gift-wrapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She must like the guy,\" Bella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This should be interesting,\" Jacob chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will only work if the guy likes her back though,\" Bella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Angela is cool... who wouldn\u0027t like her,\" Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt strangely comforted for a moment, hearing Angela\u0027s hopeless yearning. A sense of kinship that Angela would never know about passed through me, and I was, in that second, at one with the kind human girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does he mean by that... your yearning isn\u0027t hopeless, Edward!\" Bella huffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was oddly consoling to know that I wasn\u0027t the only one living out a tragic love story. Heartbreak was everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Argh,\" Bella groaned. \"Only if you keep thinking that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next second, I was abruptly and thoroughly irritated. Because Angela\u0027s story didn\u0027t have to be tragic. She was human and he was human and the difference that seemed so insurmountable in her head was ridiculous, truly ridiculous compared to my own situation. There was no point in her broken heart. What a wasteful sadness, when there was no valid reason for her not to be with the one she wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, wasteful,\" Bella muttered, thinking that Edward\u0027s was wasteful too, though he did have more of a reason to be so cautious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy shouldn\u0027t she have what she wanted? Why shouldn\u0027t this one story have a happy ending?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to give her a gift�� Well, I would give her what she wanted. Knowing what I did of human nature, it probably wouldn\u0027t even be very difficult. I sifted through the consciousness of the boy beside her, the object of her affections, and he did not seem unwilling, he was just stymied by the same difficulty she was. Hopeless and resigned, the way she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, people, have faith in yourselves,\" Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella, however, was thoughtful. She wondered if this was a mirror of how she and Edward felt... both of them not fully realizing what they other felt. She was sure that her book self couldn\u0027t have known how much he loved her... there was no possible way for her to know that. And she could see clearly that Edward didn\u0027t understand how much she lo... er... however she felt about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped that train of thought as something else seemed to go through her. She was wondering how strongly did she feel about this guy that she had yet to meet... and she longed for that meeting to happen already. Jacob started reading then, drawing her concentration back to the book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I would have to do was plant the suggestion��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plan formed easily, the script wrote itself without effort on my part. I would need Emmett\u0027s help��getting him to go along with this was the only real difficulty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuman nature was so much easier to manipulate than vampire nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to watch out for this guy, Bells, he\u0027s definitely a speciesist,\" Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" Bella rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pleased with my solution, with my gift for Angela. It was a nice diversion from my own problems. Would that mine were as easily fixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mood was slightly improved as Bella and I took our seats. Maybe I should be more positive. Maybe there was some solution out there for us that was escaping me, the way Angela\u0027s obvious solution was so invisible to her. Not likely�� But why waste time with hopelessness? I didn\u0027t have time to waste when it came to Bella. Each second mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Banner entered pulling an ancient TV and VCR. He was skipping through a section he wasn\u0027t particularly interested in��genetic disorders��by showing a movie for the next three days. Lorenzo\u0027s Oil was not a very cheerful piece, but that didn\u0027t stop the excitement in the room. No notes, no test-able material. Three free days. The humans exulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds kind of boring to me,\" Bella mumbled and Jacob looked at her oddly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter to me, either way. I hadn\u0027t been planning on paying any attention to anything but Bella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not pull my chair away from hers today, to give myself space to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I sat close beside her like any normal human would. Closer than we sat inside my car, close enough that the left side of my body felt submerged in the heat from her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get it! She\u0027s hot!\" Jacob said and laughed when Bella blushed and glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a strange experience, both enjoyable and nerve-racking, but I preferred this to sitting across the table from her. It was more than I was used to, and yet I quickly realized that it was not enough. I was not satisfied. Being this close to her only made me want to be closer still. The pull was stronger the closer I got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had accused her of being a magnet for danger. Right now, it felt like that was the literal truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella rolled her eyes but chuckled at this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was danger, and, with every inch I allowed myself nearer to her, her attraction grew in force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Mr. Banner turned the lights out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was odd how much of a difference this made, considering that the lack of light meant little to my eyes. I could still see just as perfectly as before. Every detail of the room was clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s cool,\" Jacob said. \"I wish I could see in the dark like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why the sudden shock of electricity in the air, in this dark that was not dark to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shock of electricity?\" Bella raised an eyebrow. What was he talking about and why did that make her think of the first time he touched her in the second chapter (the first time he talked to her in the books)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it because I knew that I was the only one who could see clearly? That both Bella and I were invisible to the others? Like we were alone, just the two of us, hidden in the dark room, sitting so close beside one another��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand moved toward her without my permission. Just to touch her hand, to hold it in the darkness. Would that be such a horrific mistake? If my skin bothered her, she only had to pull away��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yanked my hand back, folded my arms tightly across my chest and clenched my hands closed. No mistakes. I\u0027d promised myself that I would make no mistakes, no matter how minimal they seemed. If I held her hand, I would only want more��another insignificant touch, another move closer to her. I could feel that. A new kind of desire was growing in me, working to override my self-control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob and Bella were thinking the complete opposite thing here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella folded her arms securely across her own chest, and her hands balled up into fists, just like mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feeling this too, aren\u0027t you?\" Jacob questioned, \"and I know it didn\u0027t happen...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I think I am feeling this,\" Bella answer before he could say any more. \"I wonder what it means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems like you\u0027re calling to each other somehow,\" Jacob said, and then he bit his lip. It seemed like some kind of instinctual reaction that went way beyond human... whatever that means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you thinking? I was dying to whisper the words to her, but the room was too quiet to get away with even a whispered conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie began, lightening the darkness just a bit. Bella glanced up at me. She noted the rigid way I held my body��just like hers��and smiled. Her lips parted slightly, and her eyes seemed full of warm invitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr perhaps I was seeing what I wanted to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back; her breathing caught with a low gasp and she looked quickly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made it worse. I didn\u0027t know her thoughts, but I was suddenly positive that I had been right before, and that she wanted me to touch her. She felt this dangerous desire just as I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween her body and mine, the electricity hummed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella blushed, still not sure what this all meant, but had a good idea. She was also wondering what would happen if he did touch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t move all through the hour, holding her stiff, controlled pose as I held mine. Occasionally she would peek at me again, and the humming current would jolt through me with a sudden shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... stop looking at him,\" Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt I can help it,\" Bella said. \"Besides, he\u0027s looking at me nonstop... I should be allowed to look too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hour passed��slowly, and yet not slowly enough. This was so new, I could have sat like this with her for days, just to experience the feeling fully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the electricity was pleasant,\" Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently,\" Bella said evenly, but she was still blushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a dozen different arguments with myself while the minutes passed, rationality struggling with desire as I tried to justify touching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Mr. Banner turned the lights on again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bright fluorescent light, the atmosphere of the room returned to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella sighed and stretched, flexing her fingers in front of her. It must have been uncomfortable for her to hold that position for so long. It was easier for me��stillness came naturally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now you\u0027re trying to mimic the vampires,\" Jacob said shaking his head, trying to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they are the coolest thing around,\" Bella smiled when he made a face at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckled at the relieved expression on her face. \"Well, that was interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Umm,\" she murmured, clearly understanding what I referred to, but making no comment. What I wouldn\u0027t give to hear what she was thinking right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like to know that too,\" Bella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t have guessed that by your smug expression,\" Jacob chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. No amount of wishing was going to help with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Bella and Jacob were chuckling at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we?\" I asked, standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a face and got unsteadily to her feet, her hands splayed out as if she were afraid she was going to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could offer her my hand. Or I could place that hand underneath her elbow��just lightly��and steady her. Surely that wouldn\u0027t be such a horrible infraction��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would that be a mistake?\" Bella questioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even with hearing his thoughts, I can\u0027t really understand most of his thinking,\" Jacob shrugged. \"Though it\u0027s clear that he\u0027s afraid of touching you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was very quiet as we walked toward the gym. The crease was in evidence between her eyes, a sign that she was deep in thought. I, too, was thinking deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne touch of her skin wouldn\u0027t hurt her, my selfish side contended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could easily moderate the pressure of my hand. It wasn\u0027t exactly difficult, as long as I was firmly in control of myself. My tactile sense was better developed than a human\u0027s; I could juggle a dozen crystal goblets without breaking any of them; I could stroke a soap bubble without popping it. As long as I was firmly in control��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re always in control, so it will be fine,\" Bella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not always in control... we\u0027ve seen him out of control,\" Jacob said anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella just frowned at that and Jacob read on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella was like a soap bubble��fragile and ephemeral. Temporary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long would I be able to justify my presence in her life? How much time did I have? Would I have another chance like this chance, like this moment, like this second?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would not always be within my arm\u0027s reach��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella turned to face me at the gym\u0027s door, and her eyes widened at the expression on my face. She didn\u0027t speak. I looked at myself in the reflection of her eyes and saw the conflict raging in my own. I watched my face change as my better side lost the argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s to say what the better said is, Edward?\" Bella mumbled to herself but Jacob heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand lifted without a conscious command for it to do so. As gently as if she were made of the thinnest glass, as if she were fragile as a bubble, my fingers stroked the warm skin that covered her cheekbone. It heated under my touch, and I could feel the pulse of blood speed beneath her transparent skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough, I ordered, though my hand was aching to shape itself to the side of her face. Enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t sound too controlled now,\" Jacob muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s touch is gentle... it\u0027s not hurting me,\" Bella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But his mind doesn\u0027t seem to have control over his actions,\" Jacob countered. \"His instincts do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what instinct is he following now?\" Bella raised her eyebrows. \"It\u0027s not to hurt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Jacob mumbled, \"but there still is an instinct in him that wants to hurt you... don\u0027t forget that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" Bella sighed. \"But that isn\u0027t the only instinct he has towards me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was difficult to pull my hand back, to stop myself from moving closer to her than I already was. A thousand different possibilities ran through my mind in an instant��a thousand different ways to touch her. The tip of my finger tracing the shape of her lips. My palm cupping under her chin. Pulling the clip from her hair and letting it spill out across my hand. My arms winding around her waist, holding her against the length of my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself to turn, to move away from her. My body moved stiffly�� unwilling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let my mind linger behind to watch her as I walked swiftly away, almost running from the temptation. I caught Mike Newton\u0027s thoughts��they were the loudest��while he watched Bella walk past him in oblivion, her eyes unfocused and her cheeks red. He glowered and suddenly my name was mingled with curses in his head; I couldn\u0027t help grinning slightly in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad Mikey,\" Jacob said, trying to chuckle again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand was tingling. I flexed it and then curled it into a fist, but it continued to sting painlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I hadn\u0027t hurt her��but touching her had still been a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like fire��like the thirsting burn of my throat had spread throughout my entire body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next time I was close to her, would I be able to stop myself from touching her again? And if I touched her once, would I be able to stop at that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Bella answered, there was no doubt in her, though Jacob wasn\u0027t totally convinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more mistakes. That was it. Savor the memory, Edward, I told myself grimly, and keep your hands to yourself. That, or I would have to force myself to leave��somehow. Because I couldn\u0027t allow myself near her if I insisted on making errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and tried to steady my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett caught up to me outside the English building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Edward.\" He\u0027s looking better. Weird, but better. Happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah... and him being happy is weird,\" Jacob chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Em.\" Did I look happy? I supposed, despite the chaos in my head, I felt that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWay to keep your mouth shut, kid. Rosalie wants to rip your tongue out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to see her try... and then get beaten down,\" Jacob chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not very nice,\" Bella glared at him and he shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Sorry I left you to deal with that. Are you angry with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw. Rose\u0027ll get over it. It was bound to happen anyway.\" With what Alice sees coming��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t mention that,\" Jacob flinched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice\u0027s visions were not what I wanted to think about right now. I stared forward, my teeth locking together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I searched for a distraction, I caught sight of Ben Cheney entering the Spanish room ahead of us. Ah��here was my chance to give Angela Weber her gift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben Cheney,\" Bella mumbled and got out her year book to look at him. He was cute enough, though not her type at all. Still she studied the picture, if Angela and Ben liked each other she wanted them to be together in this reality, too. She thought that things might be different now that she knew what Edward was thinking about her, so she might have to be the one to help Ben and Angela out... argh... that wasn\u0027t really her strong point. Oh well, it will have to happen someway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped walking and caught Emmett\u0027s arm. \"Hold on a second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I don\u0027t deserve it, but would you do me a favor anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" he asked, curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder my breath��and at a speed that would have made the words incomprehensible to a human no matter how loud they\u0027d been spoken��I explained to him what I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me blankly when I was done, his thoughts as blank as his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sound interesting,\" Jacob chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" I prompted. \"Will you help me do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him a minute to respond. \"But, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon, Emmett. Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho are you and what have you done with my brother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella and Jacob both chuckled at this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you the one who complains that school is always the same? This is something a little different, isn\u0027t it? Consider it an experiment��an experiment in human nature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me for another moment before he caved. \"Well, it is different, I\u0027ll give you that�� Okay, fine.\" Emmett snorted and then shrugged. \"I\u0027ll help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned at him, feeling more enthusiastic about my plan now that he was on board. Rosalie was a pain, but I would always owe her one for choosing Emmett; no one had a better brother than mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw,\" Jacob said in teasing voice but Bella smiled at what Edward had just said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett didn\u0027t need to practice. I whispered his lines to him once under my breath as we walked into the classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen was already in his seat behind mine, assembling his homework to hand in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett and I both sat and did the same thing. The classroom was not quiet yet; the murmur of subdued conversation would continue until Mrs. Goff called for attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in no hurry, appraising the quizzes from the last class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Emmett said, his voice louder than necessary��if he were really speaking only to me. \"Did you ask Angela Weber out yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... I get it,\" Jacob said laughing. \"This should work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of papers rustling behind me came to an abrupt stop as Ben froze, his attention suddenly riveted on our conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela? They\u0027re talking about Angela?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hm... it definitely makes it easy that Edward knows what he\u0027s thinking,\" Bella muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. I had his interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, shaking my head slowly to appear regretful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Emmett improvised. \"Are you chicken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced at him. \"No. I heard that she was interested in someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward Cullen was going to ask Angela out? But�� No. I don\u0027t like that. I don\u0027t want him near her. He\u0027s��not right for her. Not��safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got that right,\" Jacob chuckled and Bella glared at him. \"What? You want him to go out with Angela?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" Bella rolled her eyes and Jacob laughed louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t anticipated the chivalry, the protective instinct. I\u0027d been working for jealousy. But whatever worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to let that stop you?\" Emmett asked scornfully, improvising again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob laughed even more at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not up for the competition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at him, but made use of what he gave me. \"Look, I guess she really likes this Ben person. I\u0027m not going to try to convince her otherwise. There are other girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reaction in the chair behind me was electric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" Emmett asked, back to the script.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lab partner said it was some kid named Cheney. I\u0027m not sure I know who he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s rude... the guy\u0027s right behind you,\" Jacob muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... Jake, that\u0027s the point,\" Bella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Jacob rolled his eyes. \"I\u0027m just saying it makes him sound like a stuck up...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" Bella rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit back my smile. Only the haughty Cullens could get away with pretending not to know every student at this tiny school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen\u0027s head was whirling with shock. Me? Over Edward Cullen? But why would she like me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward,\" Emmett muttered in a lower tone, rolling his eyes toward the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right behind you,\" he mouthed, so obviously that the human could easily read the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I muttered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob and Bella were laughing at this again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned in my seat and glanced once at the boy behind me. For a second, the black eyes behind the glasses were frightened, but then he stiffened and squared his narrow shoulders, affronted by my clearly disparaging evaluation. His chin shot out and an angry flush darkened his golden-brown skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh,\" I said arrogantly as I turned back to Emmett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thinks he\u0027s better than me. But Angela doesn\u0027t. I\u0027ll show him��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s that problem solved,\" Jacob chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you say she was taking Yorkie to the dance, though?\" Emmett asked, snorting as he said the name of the boy that many scorned for his awkwardness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a group decision apparently.\" I wanted to be sure that Ben was clear on this. \"Angela\u0027s shy. If B��well, if a guy doesn\u0027t have the nerve to ask her out, she\u0027d never ask him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like shy girls,\" Emmett said, back to improvisation. Quiet girls. Girls like��hmm, I don\u0027t know. Maybe Bella Swan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob laughed at this line of teasing as Bella blushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned at him. \"Exactly.\" Then I returned to the performance. \"Maybe Angela will get tired of waiting. Maybe I\u0027ll ask her to the prom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, you won\u0027t, Ben thought, straightening up in his chair. So what if she\u0027s so much taller than me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... it\u0027s because he\u0027s short... poor guy,\" Jacob chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose that\u0027s not a problem you have to deal with,\" Bella said, Jacob seemed pretty tall for his age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all,\" Jacob said. \"I think I might even have grown an inch since yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure you did, Jake,\" Bella rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she doesn\u0027t care, then neither do I. She\u0027s the nicest, smartest, prettiest girl in this school�� and she wants me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked this Ben. He seemed bright and well-meaning. Maybe even worthy of a girl like Angela.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it looks like there\u0027re three humans that he might think highly of,\" Jacob chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Emmett a thumbs up under the desk as Mrs. Goff stood and greeted the class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I\u0027ll admit it��that was sort of fun, Emmett thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled to myself, pleased that I\u0027d been able to shape one love story\u0027s happy ending. I was positive that Ben would follow through, and Angela would receive my anonymous gift. My debt was repaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow silly humans were, to let a six inch height differential confound their happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is a pretty big difference,\" Jacob said. \"That guy must be a midget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake!\" Bella reprimanded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Jacob sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy success put me in a good mood. I smiled again as I settled into my chair and prepared to be entertained. After all, as Bella had pointed out at lunch, I\u0027d never seen her in action in her gym class before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Bella groaned and Jacob laughed in anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike\u0027s thoughts were the easiest to pinpoint in the babble of voices that swarmed through the gym. His mind had gotten far too familiar over the last few weeks. With a sigh, I resigned myself to listening through him. At least I could be sure that he would be paying attention to Bella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was just in time to hear him offer to be her badminton partner; as he made the suggestion, other partnerings ran through his mind. My smile faded, my teeth clenched together, and I had to remind myself that murdering Mike Newton was not a permissible option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hm... I\u0027m not so sure about that,\" Jacob laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not,\" Bella said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Mike��you don\u0027t have to do this, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll keep out of your way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey grinned at each other, and flashes of numerous accidents��always in some way connected to Bella��flashed through Mike\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob started chuckling and Bella groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike played alone at first, while Bella hesitated on the back half of the court, holding her racket gingerly, as if it was some kind of weapon. Then Coach Clapp ambled by and ordered Mike to let Bella play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Bella moaned, didn\u0027t the coach understand yet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh oh, Mike thought as Bella moved forward with a sigh, holding her racquet at an awkward angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer Ford served the birdie directly toward Bella with a smug twist to her thoughts. Mike saw Bella lurch toward it, swinging the racket yards wide of her target, and he rushed in to try to save the volley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the trajectory of Bella\u0027s racquet with alarm. Sure enough, it hit the taut net and sprung back at her, clipping her forehead before it spun out to strike Mike\u0027s arm with a resounding thwack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob was howling with laughed and Bella turned bright red and held her head in her hands. That was a new all time low for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really are awful,\" Jacob choked out some time later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, now can you continue reading,\" Bella tried to sound as if this wasn\u0027t bothering her, but she was still red and her voice was too weak to pull that off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOw. Ow. Ungh. That\u0027s going to leave a bruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Jacob said, his dying laughter starting again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella was kneading her forehead. It was hard to stay in my seat where I belonged, knowing she was hurt. But what could I do, if I were there? And it didn\u0027t seem to be serious�� I hesitated, watching. If she intended to continue to try to play, I was going to have to manufacture an excuse to pull her out of class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Overreaction,\" Bella rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coach laughed. \"Sorry, Newton.\" That girl\u0027s the worst jinx I\u0027ve ever seen. Shouldn\u0027t inflict her on the others��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore laughter for Jacob, but Bella was pleased that the coach seemed to get it better now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his back deliberately and moved to watch another game so that Bella could return to her former spectator\u0027s role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOw, Mike thought again, massaging his arm. He turned to Bella. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, are you?\" she asked sheepishly, blushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ll make it.\" Don\u0027t want to sound like a crybaby. But, man, that hurts!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crybaby,\" Jacob laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike swung his arm in a circle, wincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll just stay back here,\" Bella said, embarrassment and chagrin on her face rather than pain. Maybe Mike had got the worst of it. I certainly hoped that was the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least she wasn\u0027t playing anymore. She held her racquet so carefully behind her back, her eyes wide with remorse�� I had to disguise my laugh as coughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s funny? Emmett wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know... if you were in Emmett\u0027s Gym class, I bet he would have liked you from the first day,\" Jacob teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" Bella hissed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell you later,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella didn\u0027t venture into the game again. The coach ignored her and let Mike play alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breezed through the quiz at the end of the hour, and Mrs. Goff let me go early. I was listening intently to Mike as I walked across the campus. He\u0027d decided to confront Bella about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica swears they\u0027re dating. Why? Why did he have to pick her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t recognize the real phenomenon��that she\u0027d picked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go overboard with that,\" Bella rolled her eyes, it was more of a phenomenon that he had picked her after a hundred years after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what?\" she wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Cullen, huh?\" You and the freak. I guess, if a rich guy is that important to you...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella was glaring at the book, she didn\u0027t like this assumption at all, but what was really getting to her was how very wrong Mike was... Edward was so much more than just a rich guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gritted my teeth at his degrading assumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s none of your business, Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefensive. So it\u0027s true. Crap. \"I don\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to,\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy can\u0027t she see what a circus sideshow he is? Like they all are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella was glaring more at the book than before, not liking his way of thinking at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he stares at her. It gives me chills to watch. \"He looks at you like��like you\u0027re something to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella and Jacob both tensed a little at that... it wasn\u0027t good that Mike was able to notice that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed, waiting for her response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face turned bright red, and her lips pressed together like she was holding her breath. Then, suddenly, a giggle burst through her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You laughed?\" Jacob looked at her incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... the irony of that must have gotten to me,\" Bella said. \"I\u0027m sure it was a nervous laugh if that makes you feel any better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t,\" Jacob said and then started reading again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she\u0027s laughing at me. Great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike turned, thoughts sullen, and wandered off to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned against the gym wall and tried to compose myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she have laughed at Mike\u0027s accusation��so entirely on target that I began to worry that Forks was becoming too aware�� Why would she laugh at the suggestion that I could kill her, when she knew that it was entirely true? Where was the humor in that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was wrong with her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s wrong with me,\" Bella huffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg to differ,\" Jacob chuckled, though he was giving her an odd look, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she have morbid sense of humor? That didn\u0027t fit with my idea of her character, but how could I be sure? Or maybe my daydream of the giddy angel was true in the one respect, in that she had no sense of fear at all. Brave��that was one word for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not brave,\" Bella mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers might say stupid,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I guess you\u0027re stupid then,\" Jacob chuckled and Bella glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut I knew how bright she was. No matter what the reason, though, this lack of fear or twisted sense of humor wasn\u0027t good for her. Was it this strange lack that put her in danger so constantly? Maybe she would always need me here��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like that, my mood was soaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I could just discipline myself, make myself safe, then perhaps it would be right for me to stay with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she walked through the gym doors, her shoulders were stiff and her lower lip was between her teeth again��a sign of anxiety. But as soon as her eyes met mine, her rigid shoulders relaxed and a wide smile spread across her face. It was an oddly peaceful expression. She walked right to my side without hesitation, only stopping when she was so close that her body heat crashed over me like a tidal wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe happiness I felt in this moment was, again, without precedent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" I said, and then��because with my mood suddenly so light I couldn\u0027t resist teasing her��I added, \"How was gym?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Argh... did he have to mention that?\" Bella groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep,\" Jacob chuckled. \"Besides, isn\u0027t it better that you know he\u0027s watching you... not as creepy that way at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" Bella shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile wavered. \"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a poor liar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True,\" Jacob and Bella both said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" I asked, about to press the issue��I was still concerned about her head; was she in pain?��but then Mike Newton\u0027s thoughts we so loud they broke my concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate him. I wish he would die. I hope he drives that shiny car right off a cliff. Why couldn\u0027t he just leave her alone? Stick to his own kind��to the freaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does he mean, his own kind?\" Jacob asked. \"He doesn\u0027t know that Edward is a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose he means rich?\" Bella said slowly, not sure of the answer herself. \"That or he instinctively knows that Edward is different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Bella demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes refocused on her face. She looked at Mike\u0027s retreating back, and then at me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Newton\u0027s getting on my nerves,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth fell open, and her smile disappeared. She must have forgotten that I\u0027d had the power to watch through her calamitous last hour, or hoped that I hadn\u0027t utilized it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More likely the latter,\" Bella said, after all he had demonstrated that gift quite well during their last few encounters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t listening again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s your head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re unbelievable!\" she said through her teeth, and then she turned away from me and stalked furiously toward the parking lot. Her skin flushed dark red��she was embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got that right,\" Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, no one asked him to watch me in Gym,\" Bella grumbled, her clumsiness was always a sore spot for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept pace with her, hoping that her anger would pass soon. She was usually quick to forgive me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were the one who mentioned how I\u0027d never seen you in Gym,\" I explained. \"It made me curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer; her eyebrows pulled together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came to a sudden halt in the parking lot when she realized that the way to my car was blocked by a crowd of male students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder how fast they\u0027ve gone in this thing��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook at the SMG shift paddles.

Jacob do you want me to leave,\" Bella chuckled as Jacob was practically drooling at the description of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I want you to get me into the Cullen garage sometime in the future,\" Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do realize that\u0027s Rosalie\u0027s car...\" Bella said smirking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Argh,\" Jacob groaned. \"Why did you have to remind me of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was exactly why it was better for Rosalie to only use her car out of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wound through the throng of lustful boys to my car; after a second of hesitation, Bella followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ostentatious,\" I muttered as she climbed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of car is that?\" she wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An M3.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. \"I don\u0027t speak Car and Driver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Bella!\" Jacob groaned. \"You should know that at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Bella shrugged, chuckling at his behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a BMW.\" I rolled my eyes and then focused on backing out without running anyone down. I had to lock eyes with a few boys that didn\u0027t seem willing to move out of my way. A half-second meeting my gaze seemed to be enough to convince them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that car really that special?\" Bella rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob just stared at her incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it is,\" Bella mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you still angry?\" I asked her. Her frown had relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely,\" she answered curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t have brought it up. Oh well. I could try to make amends, I supposed. \"Will you forgive me if I apologize?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about that for a moment. \"Maybe��if you mean it,\" she decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if you promise not to do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t hold your breath,\" Jacob chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know... that\u0027s never going to happen,\" Bella chuckled too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t going to lie to her, and there was no way I was agreeing to that. Perhaps if I offered her a different exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about if I mean it, and I agree to let you drive this Saturday?\" I cringed internally at the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... that works,\" Bella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe furrow popped into existence between her eyes as she considered the new bargain. \"Deal,\" she said after a moment of thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow for my apology�� I\u0027d never tried to dazzle Bella on purpose before, but now seemed like a good time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh great,\" Bella mumbled, blushing already. The thought of him actually trying to dazzle her was too much for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared deep into her eyes as I drove away from the school, wondering if I was doing it right. I used my most persuasive tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m very sorry I upset you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heartbeat thudded louder than before, and the rhythm was abruptly staccato.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened, looking a little stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI half-smiled. It seemed like I\u0027d gotten it right. Of course, I was having a bit of difficulty looking away from her eyes, too. Equally dazzled. It was a good thing I had this road memorized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Bella said, snapping out of her daze... she liked thinking of them both being dazzled by each other... but still, \"He\u0027s not even looking at the road!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he has it memorized... that\u0027s just as good,\" Jacob laughed at her expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is not good at all!\" Bella snapped, note to self, no dazzling in the car... um... while it\u0027s moving at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll be on your doorstep bright and early Saturday morning,\" I added, finishing the agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked swiftly, shaking her head as if to clear it. \"Um,\" she said, \"it doesn\u0027t help with the Charlie situation if an unexplained Volvo is left in the driveway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not going to take his car,\" Bella said, how little she understood him in this book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, how little she still knew me. \"I wasn\u0027t intending to bring a car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella blinked at that and then smiled, it was nice knowing they could think alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How��\" she started to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI interrupted her. The answer would be hard to explain without a demonstration, and now was hardly the time. \"Don\u0027t worry about it. I\u0027ll be there, no car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her head on one side, and looked for a second like she was going to press for more, but then she seemed to change her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it later yet?\" she asked, reminding me of our unfinished conversation in the cafeteria today; she\u0027d let go of one difficult question just to return another that was more unappealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, isn\u0027t that nice of her,\" Jacob chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose it is later,\" I agreed unwillingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI parked in front of her house, tensing as I tried to think of how to explain��without making my monstrous nature too evident, without frightening her again. Or was that wrong? To minimalize my darkness?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited with the same politely interested mask she\u0027d worn at lunch. If I\u0027d been less anxious, her preposterous calm would have made me laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you still want to know why you can\u0027t see me hunt?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, mostly I was wondering about your reaction,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I frighten you?\" I asked, positive that she would deny it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to smile, and failed. \"I apologize for scaring you.\" And then my smile vanished with the momentary humor. \"It was just the very thought of you being there��while we hunted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob shivered at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mental picture was too much��Bella, so vulnerable in the empty darkness; myself, out of control�� I tried to banish it from my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you don\u0027t have to send it our way,\" Jacob snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Extremely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because��?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, concentrating for one moment on the burning thirst. Feeling it, managing it, proving my dominion over it. It would never control me again��I willed that to be true. I would be safe for her. I stared at the welcome clouds without seeing them, wishing I could believe that my determination would make any difference if I were hunting when I crossed her scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we hunt��we give ourselves over to our senses,\" I told her, thinking through each word before I spoke it. \"Govern less with our minds. Especially our sense of smell. If you were anywhere near me when I lost control that way��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob and Bella both shivered at that. No, she could definitely never see him hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head in agony at the thought of what would��not what could, but what would��surely happen then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened to the spike in her heartbeat, and then turned, restless, to read her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella\u0027s face was composed, her eyes grave. Her mouth was pursed just slightly in what I guessed was concern. But concern for what? Her own safety? Or my anguish? I continued to stare at her, trying to translate her ambiguous expression into sure fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your anguish, I\u0027m sure,\" Jacob mumbled. \"She puts others before herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to make it sound like a bad thing,\" Bella sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gazed back. Her eyes grew wider after a moment, and her pupils dilated, though the light had not changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breathing accelerated, and suddenly the quiet in the car seemed to be humming, just like in the darkened biology room this afternoon. The pulsing current raced between us again, and my desire to touch her was, briefly, stronger even than the demands of my thirst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... this really is pretty freaky,\" Jacob muttered and Bella rolled her eyes, curious to know what this really meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throbbing electricity made it feel like I had a pulse again. My body sang with it. Like I was human. More than anything in the world, I wanted to feel the heat of her lips against mine. For one second, I struggled desperately to find the strength, the control, to able to put my mouth so close to her skin��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella froze in place... waiting in anticipation... heart hammering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob shifted uncomfortably and was wary about how dangerous that would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sucked in a ragged breath, and only then did I realize that when I had started breathing faster, she had stopped breathing altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes, trying to break the connection between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella sighed sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella\u0027s existence was tied to a thousand delicately balanced chemical processes, all so easily disrupted. The rhythmic expansion of her lungs, the flow of oxygen, was life or death to her. The fluttering cadence of her fragile heart could be stopped by so many stupid accidents or illnesses or��by me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not believe that any member of my family would hesitate if he or she were offered a chance back��if he or she could trade immortality for mortality again. Any one of us would stand in fire for it. Burn for as many days or centuries as were necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can\u0027t go back,\" Bella said sadly, which meant that if they were ever going to be equal she would have to change...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of our kind prized immortality above anything else. There were even humans who craved this, who searched in dark places for those who could give them the blackest of gifts��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot us. Not my family. We would trade anything to be human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Jacob said, and he believed what Edward was saying, it really did explain why they did what they did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut none of us had ever been as desperate for a way back as I was now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the microscopic pits and flaws in the windshield, like there was some solution hidden in the glass. The electricity had not faded, and I had to concentrate to keep my hands on the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy right hand began to sting without pain again, from when I\u0027d touched her before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, I think you should go inside now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe obeyed at once, without comment, getting out of the car and shutting the door behind herself. Did she feel the potential for disaster as clearly as I did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... I\u0027m sure I felt the electricity... and noticed that you don\u0027t want to touch me,\" Bella sighed, \"I\u0027m probably just following your lead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid it hurt her to leave, as it hurt me to let her go? The only solace was that I would see her soon. Sooner than she would see me. I smiled at that, then rolled the window down and leaned across to speak to her one more time��it was safer now, with the heat of her body outside the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to see what I wanted, curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill curious, though she\u0027d asked me so many questions today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh there\u0027re so many more questions I have for you,\" Bella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own curiosity was entirely unsatisfied; answering her questions today had only revealed my secrets��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks like he\u0027s thinking the same thing,\" Jacob chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d gotten little from her but my own conjectures. That wasn\u0027t fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow it\u0027s my turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer forehead puckered. \"Your turn to what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask the questions.\" Tomorrow, when we were in a safer place, surrounded by witnesses, I would get my own answers. I grinned at the thought, and then I turned away because she made no move to leave. Even with her outside of the car, the echo of the electricity zinged in the air. I wanted to get out, too, to walk her to her door as an excuse to stay beside her��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more mistakes. I hit the gas, and then sighed as she disappeared behind me. It seemed like I was always running toward Bella or running away from her, never staying in place. I would have to find some way to hold my ground if we were ever going to have any peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s most definitely true,\" Bella said. \"I wonder what he\u0027s going to ask me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it looks like you\u0027re going to have to wait a long time to figure out,\" Jacob said putting the book down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Bella said looking at the clock, it was nine. \"We still have some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not why,\" Jacob chuckled. \"It\u0027s because that was the end of the book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Bella said. \"That can\u0027t be the end... there so much more... I don\u0027t know what happens!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, Bells, that\u0027s it,\" Jacob shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there at note or anything like that?\" Bella asked, picking up the book and noticing a small note and read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry that this was all that I could give you, but this was all I could write before you got to school. But there is no need to worry; your story goes on for a long time after this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella frowned as she read this, how could this person end the book here but promise that there is a lot more for her to find out? \"Who is this SM person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... I\u0027m not sure, but it\u0027s the person that left me the note in the first place,\" Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I figured,\" Bella rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So... um... what do we do now?\" Jacob asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure,\" Bella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re planning on meeting this Edward guy for real, aren\u0027t you,\" Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Bella looked at him suspiciously. He had promised at one time that he wouldn\u0027t let that happen. She hoped he had changed his mind because there was no way she would allow that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how do you plan on meeting him at first?\" Jacob questioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um...\" Bella said, she didn\u0027t think of that but he was right... the first meeting really was something that she had to think about... Edward was, after all going to be deathly attracted to her. \"I suppose we\u0027ll just have to think of something.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-5-midnight-sun-twilight-2/page-12.html","bookId":2027,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:00 PM"}
