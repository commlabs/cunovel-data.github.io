Give ’em to ya for face value.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re my hero, Chopper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChopper finished his meal and shoved the plate away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dessert?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah. Spoil my dinner. So, you workin’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean, working?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doin’ one of your Robin Hood things, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a manner of speaking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I figured. Only, you gotta say, man. If you workin’, you gotta speak up. Otherwise, a brother think you’re just shootin’ the shit to be polite, just trying to be, whatchacallit, politically correct—see a cripple and figure you gotta feed ’im a meal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you mean ‘differently abled’? And when have you ever known me to be politically correct just for the sake of being politically correct about anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I’m sayin’ is, you wanna know shit, just ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. What I want to know is this—what’s new?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChopper looked at me like I had just asked him if it was raining outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, McKenzie, whaddaya mean, what’s new? I got Queen Latifah on DVD yesterday. That’s what’s new.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean, is there anything happening out there that’s disrupting the status quo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChopper stared out the window as if he were searching for something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gangs fighting over turf, but that is status quo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard a big shipment is coming in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A big shipment of what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell, Chopper, I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drugs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s always pharmaceuticals changin’ hands, but nothin’ big. Nothin’ bigger than usual, anyway. You’re lookin’ for what’s unusual, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I ain’t heard of nothin’ that’s unusual.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing at all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only thing I heard about that’s different is cigarettes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cigarettes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guys bringin’ in a load of cigarettes. Supposed to be a big load of name brands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That can’t be right,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only big shipment I know of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Smuggling cigarettes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big business in cigarettes,” Chopper said. “Gettin’ bigger. ’Specially with cigarette taxes goin’ up to pay for all them state deficits. Buy smokes in Kentucky where it’s three cents a pack, sell ’em in New York where it’s a buck-fifty, pocket the difference.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is the cigarette tax in Minnesota?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forty-eight cents a pack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doesn’t seem worth it. All that trouble to make a lousy half buck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do the math, man. Four-eighty a carton multiplied by say, a hundred thousand cartons. Maybe three days work drivin’ ’em up here. I’d like a taste of that. And if you do it, like, say, every week …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see your point. Tell me more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know any more, man. I ain’t in that line of work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the guys bring them in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard wiseguys from New York.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must have looked like an idiot, sitting there with my mouth hanging open. Chopper waved his hand in front of my eyes and called my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, Chopper,” I said. “Just so you know, ‘wiseguys from New York’ is what you call a significant detail. Do you have any more? Details, I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChopper laughed out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think the cupboard is bare, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know when they’re coming in or where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. But I know a guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And this guy is who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChopper reached into his saddlebag and retrieved a cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chill, man,” he said. “I’ll take care of your ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChopper punched in a series of numbers, put the phone to his ear, and waited while it rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yo, my man … Yeah, it’s me. Hey, you get those tickets, man? Were them good seats? Wha’ did I tell ya? … Fuck yeah, man. Anytime. You know my number … Hey, listen, listen. What you were talkin’ about the other day, about them smokes … Yeah, man, but I was thinkin’, I wouldn’t mind a taste of that … Whaddaya mean, do I have a store? … That’s just wrong, man. I can move volume. You don’t need no fuckin’ store to move volume … I got my own Web site. I could use the Internet … Fuckin’ wiseguys, they ain’t never heard of the new economy, man? … Let me negotiate with ’em … No, no, no, no, no man, no, no, man, that ain’t … Fuck, like I’m gonna put you on the spot over fuckin’ cigarettes? … I don’t give a fuck if they’re name brands … No, you’re right, you’re right, when you’re right you’re right, man … Where? Where we … Yeah, I know it … No, I ain’t never been there, I mean, fuck … You got a location but no time … I hear that, I hear that … Yeah, yeah … No shit, man. You call me now. You gonna call me? … All right, my man. Yeah … Be cool.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2/page-69.html","bookId":2224,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM"}
