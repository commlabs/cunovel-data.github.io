Dody and Fontaine were sitting at the kitchen island having their morning coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, you saucy minx,\" Fontaine said. \"Did that filthy scoundrel keep you out all night? Why, I do declare, he has sullied your reputation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed Fontaine\u0027s cheek. \"I have indeed been sullied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDody hugged me. \"Darling, that is simply delightful. Nothing puts the pink in a girl\u0027s cheeks like a good roll in the straw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hay,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, what?\" She looked at me, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. So did I miss anything over here last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine shook his head. \"Hardly, but I want every creepy hetero detail from your evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI poured myself a coffee, gazing up at the ceiling without really seeing it. Last night had been a slice of heaven, but I didn\u0027t want to share the details. I wanted to enjoy my lovely thoughts without Fontaine\u0027s crass editorial commentary. I wanted to dwell in the bliss of my wanton behavior before my brain kicked in with the inevitable reprimands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine held up his hands. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s all. I\u0027m too sleepy to talk about it right now. Take me shopping later and I\u0027ll tell you more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deal,\" Fontaine answered quickly. \"And Penny wants you to call her. She said something about doing the laundry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trotted up to my room, a spring in my step. I fluffed the pillows and plopped down on my bed, noticing that today it did not seem so maddeningly, mockingly empty. Last night had been sensational. And not just the first time either, which was a little urgent. (Hardly his fault considering the way I\u0027d left him earlier that evening.) The second time was pure perfection, like floating on a silky mink raft in a pool of bubbly pink champagne, eating Swiss chocolates while Bradley Cooper massaged my feet. It was that good. By the third time, we were tired, so we had the lazy Sunday morning kind, when you have nothing to do but lie in bed and pass the time. I had forgotten sex could actually be fun. Just fun. I stretched, feeling twinges in muscles that had not been exercised in far too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dialed Penny, and she answered almost immediately. We tumbled excitedly over one another\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess what!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess what!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I slept with Des.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m pregnant!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny and I haven\u0027t giggled like that since sixth grade, when Scott Nickelson skateboarded right into a mailbox because she flashed him with her training bra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell me last night?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know last night. I peed on the stick this morning. How did you end up in bed with Des?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe volleyed questions back and forth in our own brand of sister-speak. I was excited for her - and grateful that I could be. I asked about due dates and baby names and what the future grandparents had said when she told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t told anybody yet. Just you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027m kind of scared. It\u0027s really early yet. Something could go wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dody always tells me that worrying about something doesn\u0027t do any good. It only makes you worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re quoting Dody now? We need to get you out of there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nuh-uh, not now. Ask me again in a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens in a week?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By then I\u0027ll have discovered some incriminating evidence against Des and have to leave Bell Harbor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like he murdered the Pullmans and has them buried under the deck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Precisely. So are you going to tell Mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. I\u0027d like to wait until the end of the first trimester. So don\u0027t tell her, OK? Don\u0027t tell anybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to you, little mommy, talking about trimesters. I\u0027m so proud of you. And I promise I won\u0027t tell anyone, as long as you don\u0027t tell Mom about me and Des. I don\u0027t need her judgments right now. Deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I hear you guys are going shopping?\" Jasper asked. I was sitting in the kitchen putting on my sandals while Fontaine tapped his foot and jangled keys in the doorway. He wore a white polo shirt and mint-colored chinos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine nodded. \"Yes, after we check on the construction at my house. They\u0027re installing the trim, and I need to make sure they\u0027re using the right wood. Why?\" Fontaine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Mom coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she and Anita are painting protest signs for their rally against putting in a second traffic light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper sat down next to me. \"Remember how you told me that weddings and rings and stuff were expensive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached over and touched his arm. \"I never should\u0027ve said that, Jas. I was in a bad mood that day. I think Beth is wonderful, and you\u0027re smart to scoop her up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper nodded. \"I know. But I was wondering if you\u0027d help with the ring part. I mean, help me pick out something that looks nice but isn\u0027t going to break my bank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSentimentality overtook me. I threw my arms around his neck. \"Oh, Jasper! I\u0027d be honored.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tensed. \"Jeez, Sadie. It\u0027s not that big a deal. What\u0027s up with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at Fontaine, who answered, \"Sadie finally got laid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper nodded, as if that explained everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilly Mason, fourth-generation owner of Mason\u0027s jewelry store, greeted us at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Fontaine. Are you looking for some new cuff links?\" They gave each other a double air kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish. But today we\u0027re here for something extra special. My brother here thinks it\u0027s time to tie the knot. We need something sparkly and fabulous that costs like something shabby and dull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilly nodded. \"I\u0027m sure we can find something wonderful.\" She sat Jasper down in a velvet chair and pulled out a laminated chart, explaining about color, cut, clarity, and carats until he glazed over completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, what\u0027s the difference between color and clarity?\" Jasper asked for the third time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we browse a little?\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilly nodded. \"Why don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper peered into one display case. \"What about these over here?\" he asked hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are anniversary bands,\" Tilly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re for anniversaries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper looked at me, silently pleading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of ring does Beth want?\" Fontaine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I never asked her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you haven\u0027t talked about this at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I want it to be a surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A surprise? Then how do you know she\u0027s going to say yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smacked Fontaine in the arm. \"Fontaine! Of course she\u0027ll say yes. Don\u0027t ask him that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper\u0027s face flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Fontaine, now look what you\u0027ve done,\" I scolded, putting an arm around Jasper. \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll say yes. She\u0027s madly in love with you. I can tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine hugged him from the other side. \"Of course she will. I didn\u0027t mean that. So how are you going to ask her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask her?\" Jasper went from pouty to confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. How are you going to propose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. I don\u0027t know. I figured we\u0027d go out to dinner or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, no!\" Fontaine stomped his expensive Italian sandal. \"That\u0027s so ordinary. It has to be more romantic than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper shook his head. \"Beth isn\u0027t into all that sort of stuff. She doesn\u0027t care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every girl cares,\" Fontaine admonished. \"The proposal story is one she\u0027ll tell over and over, so you need to make it good. Put some effort into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, Fontaine. This is why I hate to tell you stuff. You blow it way out of proportion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He does,\" I had to agree. \"But he\u0027s right about this one, Jas. It should be something memorable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me asking her to spend the rest our lives together isn\u0027t memorable enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if you\u0027re sitting at some dingy restaurant,\" Fontaine scoffed. \"And don\u0027t even think about putting the ring inside a dessert or a glass of champagne. I can\u0027t imagine what misguided Neanderthal came up with that idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, you guys! Come on. Could we stick to one thing at a time here? First I have to find a ring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilly walked around to where we were bickering and set a tray of diamond rings on the counter. \"Why don\u0027t you look these over? I think you might find something you like. That would at least give us a starting point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe bent over the tray in a synchronized motion. There were a variety of styles, some beautiful and simple, others garishly large, and a few with diamazoid specks so tiny they looked like smudges on the band. Jasper zeroed in on one right in the center of the tray. It was gorgeous. Not too large, not too small, not too plain, not too elaborate. He picked it up. It sparkled in the light, sending prisms in every direction. We continued to look around the store, but he kept coming back to that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love this one, Sadie. But it\u0027s too expensive,\" Jasper whispered. \"I\u0027ve been saving up to buy my own restaurant, you know, but if I spend so much on a ring, it\u0027ll put me back months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought the price was reasonable, but then again, I had pretty extravagant taste. My own engagement ring had been ostentatious and flashy, like my husband. It was sitting in a drawer back in Glenville. I couldn\u0027t possibly wear it, but I also couldn\u0027t bear the thought of getting rid of it. Someday, when all the bad karma of my marriage had evaporated, I planned to have the diamonds reset into a necklace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you could save up for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"Yeah, I guess I\u0027m going to have to. The pretty ones are expensive and the cheap ones are stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI patted his shoulder. \"We can keep looking.\" But Mason\u0027s was the only jewelry store in Bell Harbor, and Jasper went on home, sad and dejected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of Jasper\u0027s blue mood, I floated around for the rest of the day on cloud ten. Richard called to say the kids were doing great and having a wonderful time. He didn\u0027t pick a fight or say anything irritating, which was remarkable considering the phone call lasted nearly five minutes. And I had a date to look forward to! At Des\u0027s that morning, before he left for work and I did the walk of shame back to Dody\u0027s, he had invited me out to dinner again. I had a brand new outfit, chosen by Fontaine, of course, and more frilly new unmentionables, chosen by myself. I had to draw the line at letting my cousin pick out my underwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at precisely four o\u0027clock that afternoon, Des called. I was on the sunporch with Dody where she was knitting a holster for her gun and telling me about the most fascinating e-mail she\u0027d gotten from a Nigerian prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sadie, hi. I can\u0027t really talk right now. I\u0027m swamped at work,\" Des said. \"But I have to cancel our dinner. My cousin Charlie is stranded at the airport and needs to spend the night at my house. The next flight doesn\u0027t leave until seven in the morning so I\u0027m kind of obligated to help out. I\u0027m really sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI deflated like a day-old birthday balloon. The unheard-of-relative-stranded-at-the-airport excuse? I wanted to believe him, but I didn\u0027t trust myself to ask for details. It could be legitimate. Or not. And I didn\u0027t have the courage to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s OK. We can do it another time.\" I was angry at the tremble in my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I work the next two nights, but we can do dinner after that. OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. OK.\" My tongue felt thick. I swallowed hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027m really sorry. I had fun last night, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you? Good for you, you big dumb jerk. \"That\u0027s great,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot! Ambulance is here. I have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up, chucking my phone against the table, where it bounced and clattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, dear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Nothing. Des is cancelling dinner for tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" She knit one, purled two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His cousin is in town and he has to pick him up from the airport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s a shame. But Harry and I are going to a curling exhibition tonight. You should come with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tempting as that is, Dody, I think I\u0027ll pass. I\u0027ve got stuff to do. I bought some organizing books today so I\u0027ll just read those tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure? Oh, dear. You look so sad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m fine. I just miss the kids.\" I wanted to cry, the way the kids did when they bumped their heads or scraped a knee. But I was an adult. And big girls don\u0027t cry because someone cancels dinner plans. Even if it is someone they had just slept with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine refused to let me mope or drown myself in sangria. He wouldn\u0027t even let me lie on the sofa in my bathrobe and eat the jar of Marshmallow Fluff I\u0027d found in Dody\u0027s pantry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need exercise and fresh air, sugar pie. And you need to stop wallowing. If he says his cousin was stranded at the airport, believe him. Innocent until proven guilty, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not how it worked with Richard.\" I slapped away Fontaine\u0027s hands as he tried to pull the robe from my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Des is not Richard. There\u0027s no comparison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know? I mean, what do we really know about this guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hah!\" He yanked away the robe. \"We know enough. Now put on your shoes. You\u0027re coming with me to walk the dogs. I can\u0027t take them both by myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly I did as I was told and soon found myself being yanked down the beach by Fatso. It was dark, with a bright full moon lighting our way. We could see into the various cottages as we made our way toward the pier, and Fontaine relished pointing out gross decorating choices made by the neighbors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do we need the dogs on leashes?\" I finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine shrugged. \"We don\u0027t. I figured I couldn\u0027t get you out of the house any other way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped short, the dog nearly jerking my arm from my socket. \"Are you serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you feel better, getting some fresh air?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached over and unhooked Fatso from the leash and he bolted away. \"Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine let Lazyboy loose and we continued walking. The lights from Des\u0027s house came into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think you\u0027d feel better if you got a look at this cousin Charlie so you\u0027d know Des wasn\u0027t lying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped walking again. \"Tell me you did not lure me out here so I could peek in Des\u0027s windows!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the translucent glow of Fontaine\u0027s teeth as he grinned. \"Of course I did. I don\u0027t give a shit about the dogs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around and started walking back to Dody\u0027s, but Fontaine grabbed my wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, girlfriend. You know you want to take a look. And we\u0027re already here. Once you see this Charlie guy you\u0027re going to feel loads better. Trust me. Have I ever steered you wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Puh! Not this time, I promise. And we have the cloak of darkness to hide our deeds. But if we stand here arguing, he\u0027ll see us for sure. Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine grabbed my wrist, pulling twice as hard as Fatso had. We ran up to the edge of Alberta Schmidt\u0027s house, right next to the Pullmans\u0027, and crouched down in the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdiocy-induced nausea gurgled in my gut. \"Fontaine! What if he catches us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll tell him we were just taking a walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On his deck? This is ridiculous!\" I hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman\u0027s laughter floated through the darkness, and I froze. It sounded as if it came from Des\u0027s place. The sliding door from his family room to the deck was wide open, with light pouring out. Music was playing too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom where we hid, we could barely see into the kitchen window. Fontaine shoved me back against the deck post as Des\u0027s head appeared. He must have been standing at the sink. He was talking, but we couldn\u0027t hear him clearly. Then he laughed at something and turned around. I felt filthy and ludicrous, spying on someone I\u0027d been in bed with less than twenty-four hours before. Is this what I had been reduced to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine pointed at Des\u0027s deck, indicating we should get closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine nodded just as frantically, giving me a rough shove and pushing me out into the shaft of light coming from inside Des\u0027s house. I nearly squawked with fear and took three giant leaps, bringing me to the edge of his deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t breathe for fear he\u0027d hear me! What the hell was I doing? This was insane! I was insane. Damn you, Fontaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine took a look toward the window, then leaped, landing next to me and bumping against the lattice surrounding the base of Des\u0027s deck. It gave a horrific crack, and my chest exploded with fear. I punched Fontaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe squatted in the shadow, catching our breath. I could hear the woman talking, but not loud enough to make out the words. It didn\u0027t really matter what she said anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that\u0027s Cousin Charlie\u0027s wife,\" Fontaine whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine pointed up. \"Let\u0027s look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head again. I was not going to pop up like a prairie dog to peek into Des\u0027s house! Listening was bad enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine scowled and rose up, his eyes peeping over the edge. I heard him gasp. And I knew I would have to look for myself. I rose up on trembling legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was young and blonde and stood near the doorway with a glass of wine in her hand. Instant jealousy seared through every vein in my body. This was no one\u0027s wife. She was a plaything, a human bauble, to be admired and stroked. She must have been all of a size two, wearing a short little skirt and a tank top. Chunky bracelets adorned one wrist, and her hair was in a loose ponytail draped over one shoulder. If I were a man, I\u0027d bring her home too. Skinny bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDes came into view, and the earth dropped beneath me, like that moment a roller coaster begins its plummeting descent. He smiled broadly and poured more into her glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggled. \"Hey, are you trying to get me drunk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t pretend it\u0027s the first time,\" he said, tapping her pert little nose with his finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might have puked right then and there if not for the sound of familiar barking. Fontaine ducked and pulled me back down into the shadow. Lazyboy and Fatso bounded toward us, proving once and for all that dogs have no concept of time. We\u0027d been with them ten minutes earlier, but they leaped around in a crazed barking frenzy as though we\u0027d just returned from an intergalactic space mission! If we shushed them, Des would hear. If we ran, they\u0027d chase us, and he\u0027d spot us for sure!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine clutched my arm, digging his nails into my skin. I heard the screen door slide open. Never in my life have I so wished to spontaneously combust. This was about to become the worst moment of my life, and I\u0027ve had some mighty horrendous moments. Footsteps fell on the wood of the deck and the railing creaked. Dody\u0027s traitorous hounds bounded up the steps. I pressed myself against the lattice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease, God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease, God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are these your dogs?\" The sex kitten\u0027s voice had a sultry huskiness to it. She sounded sensual, self-assured, and well-read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they\u0027re my neighbor\u0027s,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, there he goes again! Just the neighbor. That was me. But she was no recruiter. He couldn\u0027t try that line on me again. This girl was built for one thing only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine\u0027s breath was wheezing in and out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re so cute. Look, they\u0027re all drooly and hairy. Kind of like you.\" She giggled again at her own incredibly lame joke while I hyperventilated and fought down the half jar of Marshmallow Fluff trying to spew back up my esophagus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDes told them to sit. \"This one is Lazyboy. This one is Fatso.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, go ahead. Exploit my dogs for the purposes of your insatiable sex drive, you horny bastard!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine used the distraction to grab my wrist and pull me around to the side of the house. We scuttled toward the road, trampling through Joanna Pullman\u0027s carefully cultivated garden beds. Once at the road we took off running as if werewolves were on our heels. Then we burst into Dody\u0027s house and collapsed inside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t catch my breath. But if I could\u0027ve, I only would have used it to cry. And I didn\u0027t want to cry. Not over this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sadie, I\u0027m sorry,\" Fontaine began, but I cut him off with a flip of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Save it, Fontaine. It doesn\u0027t matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it matters. And it\u0027s probably not what it looked like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s precisely what it looked like. He stood me up for a better offer. But it\u0027s no big deal. He\u0027s a free agent. I just wish he hadn\u0027t lied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There has to be another explanation,\" Fontaine argued. \"Maybe that was his cousin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Look, I\u0027ve been through this before. I know the signs. We had one night together. It\u0027s not like he owed me something. He told Dody he didn\u0027t have a girlfriend. Maybe that\u0027s because he doesn\u0027t want one.\" I stood up, feeling one million years old. \"I\u0027m going to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying on my lumpy mattress, I marveled at my self-control. I didn\u0027t feel that bad. Liking him had been so intense it was almost a relief to know he was no better than any other man. He was another lying sack of shit. Last night had been useful - the way going to the chiropractor was useful. Or getting your car tires rotated. I\u0027d been serviced. Now I was good for another hundred thousand miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as minutes turned to hours, feelings tore away at my emotional paralysis. It grew, a blazing inferno ignited by a simple spark. It\u0027s not as if I thought we were exclusive, but he shouldn\u0027t have lied! Was he whispering in her ear right now, telling her she was beautiful? Would he toast her a bagel for breakfast and try to undo her buttons while she got dressed? Probably, that despicable Scottish prick. He should be deported! Where was the number for the INS? I mean, seriously, didn\u0027t we have enough shitty, rotten, American guys around without importing foreign assholes from abroad? Our homeland security sucked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it! She was a baby! He was a pedophile! I bet he lured her into his car with Pop Rocks. I bet he trolled around the high school parking lot in his lab coat saying, \"Why, yes, little girl, I am a doctor.\" Bastard. That rat-fucking bastard. And to think I had actually let my guard down!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was Dody\u0027s fault, and Penny\u0027s and Fontaine\u0027s. They were all complicit, feeding me bullshit about there being good, honest, loyal men out there. What a crock of shit. He was no better than Richard. Cousin Charlie, my ass. How stupid did he think I was? Did he not realize I could see his house from my deck! God, not only did he treat me shitty, he wasn\u0027t even subtle about it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the heels of anger came denial. A glorious place to visit, but a dangerous place to live. It couldn\u0027t be true. He was sincere and trustworthy and dependable. There must be some sort of explanation. But the only explanation I kept coming back to was that tonight he picked her over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy morning, I had reached acceptance. This was really for the best after all. It was bound to happen sooner or later, and honestly, the suspense of waiting for him to cheat would have been a burden. At least I\u0027d seen the man behind the mask early on, before I got too attached. And if nothing else, this experience taught me unequivocally that dating was not for the faint-hearted or the gullible. I was better off without some man cluttering up my life. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1/page-16.html","bookId":2788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM"}
