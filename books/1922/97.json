So we\u0027re going to my place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at my twisted hands, thinking about how I might need protection from Gideon, too. \"I\u0027ve been down this road with Cary before, Gideon. I can\u0027t just hole up at your place and hope he comes out of it on his own. He needs me to be around more than I have been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva.\" Gideon brought me my clothes and crouched in front of me. \"I know you need to support Cary. We\u0027ll figure out how tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cupped his face. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you, too, though,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed to his feet. Moving back to the dresser, he pulled open his drawers and grabbed clothes for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, I began to dress. \"Listen...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled a pair of low-slung jeans on. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel tons better now that I know the score, but Corinne is still going to be a problem for me.\" I paused with my shirt in my hands. \"You wanna nip her hopes in the bud real quick. Stow the guilt, Gideon, and start weaning her off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on the edge of the bed to pull on his socks. \"She\u0027s a friend, Eva, and she\u0027s in a rough spot. It\u0027s a cruel time to cut her off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think carefully, Gideon. I have exes in my past, too. You\u0027re setting the precedent now for how I\u0027ll handle them. I\u0027m taking my cues from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood with a scowl. \"You\u0027re threatening me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I prefer to see it as coercion. Relationships work both ways. You\u0027re not her only friend. She can find someone more appropriate to lean on in her time of crisis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe grabbed what we needed and walked back into the living room. I saw the mess left behind - an aqua-hued bra beneath an end table and blood spray on my cream sectional\u0026nbsp; - and I wished Cary was still around to smack some sense into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m digging into it with him tomorrow,\" I bit out, my jaw tight with anger and worry. \"Goddamn it, I should\u0027ve decked him when I had the chance. I should\u0027ve knocked him out cold, and then locked him up in his room until he gets his brain working again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon\u0027s hand at the small of my back rubbed soothingly. \"It\u0027ll be better to do that tomorrow, when he\u0027s alone and hungover. More effective that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus was waiting for us when we got downstairs. I was about to climb into the back of the limo when Gideon cursed under his breath, stopping me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I forgot something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me get my keys.\" I reached for the overnight bag Gideon was holding, which had my purse inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need. I have a set.\" He shot me an unapologetic grin when my brows rose. \"I had copies made before I gave them back to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027d paid attention\" - he kissed the top of my head - \"you might\u0027ve noticed that you\u0027ve had the key to my place on your key ring since I returned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped after him as he darted past the doorman and back into the building. I remembered the torment of those four days when I\u0027d thought we\u0027d broken up and the excruciating pain I\u0027d felt when those keys slid out of the envelope and into my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d had the key to being with him all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking my head, I looked around at my adopted city, loving everything about it and feeling grateful for the crazy well of happiness I\u0027d found here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon and I still had so much work ahead of us. As much as we loved each other, it was no guarantee that we\u0027d survive our personal wounds. But we communicated, we were honest with each other, and God knew we were both too stubborn to quit without a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon reappeared just as two large, beautifully groomed poodles walked by with their equally coiffed owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed into the limo. As we pulled away from the curb, Gideon tugged me onto his lap and cuddled me close. \"We had a rough night, but we got through it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we did.\" Tipping my head back, I offered my mouth for a kiss. He obliged me with one that was slow and sweet - a simple reaffirmation of our precious, complicated, maddening, necessary connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCupping his nape, I ran my fingers through his silky hair. \"I can\u0027t wait to get you back in bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a sexy little growl and attacked my neck with tickling nips and kisses, banishing our ghosts and their shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least for a little while... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-97.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
