{"id":80116,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\u003cp\u003eStuttering Stan takes me to the principal\u0027s office. Very neat, everything in its place. A shining computer in one corner. Diplomas on the walls. A small plaque on her desk, MRS. LYNNE REED, PRINCIPAL, just in case anyone is in any doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy\u0027s already outside, waiting her turn. I\u0027m sitting across from Mrs. Reed, gaze glued to the floor, waiting for her to start in on me. She transferred here the year that I started, and I was one of the first students she had to discipline, just a couple of days into her new job. I\u0027ve had to explain myself to her a lot of times since then, though in my defense it\u0027s been a while since I was last hauled before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reed flicks through a file, slowly. I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s about me. I try not to fidget. My face is red and I keep my hands tucked under my legs, in case she spots them trembling. I shouldn\u0027t be worried. I\u0027m in trouble, sure, but Dad won\u0027t give me any grief, not when he hears what it was about. Still, I\u0027m in the wrong and Mrs. Reed isn\u0027t the sort of person who makes you feel at ease in a situation like this. She looks like something from an ancient movie, black cape, silver hair, thin-rimmed glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like it when my students fight,\" she finally says, putting the file aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nancy started it,\" I say evenly, careful not to sound like I\u0027m whining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll let Miss Price state her case once I\u0027m through with you,\" Mrs. Reed says. \"I suspect her story will differ significantly from yours. Please tell me what happened, and try to be honest if you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to spin it, but that last line stings me. It\u0027s like she\u0027s challenging me. So I decide to hit her with the facts. If I\u0027m going down, I might as well go down with my dignity intact, not whimpering and making up stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was having a dig at Tyler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tyler Bayor?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Nancy stuck her nose in and told me I was being racist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I scowl. \"I mean, yeah, in a way I was, but nothing bad. I said something about his kind not being civilized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was stupid,\" Mrs. Reed murmurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bristle but don\u0027t retort. Because she\u0027s right - it was stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" I mutter, \"Nancy squared up to me. I told her to butt out. She didn\u0027t. Then she slapped me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She struck first?\" Mrs. Reed asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Everyone saw her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you hit back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I let her slap me a few times. I tried to make a joke out of it. But then she cut me and I lost it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. Is there anything else you wish to add?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about stopping there, but Mrs. Reed is looking at me archly, like she still doesn\u0027t think I\u0027m capable of telling the truth. \"I made some gorilla noises,\" I sigh, my blush deepening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reed hums, picks up my file again and glances through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know your father,\" she says out of the blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad?\" I frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she says. \"We share concerns about our nation\u0027s disintegrating morals and have attended many of the same meetings over the years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink, confusion turning into outright bewilderment. Dad has never talked about Mrs. Reed. I can\u0027t imagine where they could have run into each other, except at parent-teacher evenings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father is an upstanding member of the community,\" Mrs. Reed continues, and I have to choke back a scornful laugh. \"He works tirelessly for the things he believes in. Always there to lend his support when it is needed, giving selflessly of his time and energy. We need people like him. People like you. People who want to make Britain great again, who are prepared to fly in the face of public apathy and political correctness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pauses to make sure I\u0027m on her wavelength. And I am. Mrs. Reed must share Dad\u0027s low opinion of foreigners. I wouldn\u0027t have thought someone in her position could be as small-minded and bigoted as my old man, but thinking back to the meetings he\u0027s made me attend, there were all sorts present. I guess racists come from every walk of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not where we fight our battles,\" Mrs. Reed says as I gape at her. \"You achieve nothing by stirring up trouble like this. You merely hand ammunition to those who wish to undermine our cause. When you get into difficulties of this nature, it reflects poorly on your father, and by extension on the rest of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t fighting any battles,\" I wheeze. \"I was just having a go at Tyler and then Nancy got in my way and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reed smiles gently. \"I know it can be frustrating when people like Nancy interfere. Like your father, I am critical of this government\u0027s immigration policies. They have let in too many people of Nancy\u0027s caliber, and afforded them far too prominent a voice. But we must fight sensibly for a sensible Britain. When you are older, you can vote and campaign and express your concerns politically. The tide is turning. Public opinion is swinging our way, and will continue to do so, but only if people can trust us, if we behave calmly and responsibly. We must rise above insults and petty fights. We\u0027re better than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can return to class now,\" Mrs. Reed says. \"I\u0027ll have a talk with Miss Price. Since she slapped you first, I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll be able to convince her to let the matter drop. But, to be safe, tomorrow I want you to take her to one side and apologize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \" I start to object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s that or a suspension,\" Mrs. Reed snaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fall silent. I wasn\u0027t going to argue about the apology. I was going to say that this isn\u0027t fair. I thought she was going to chew me a new arsehole. I didn\u0027t expect her to sympathize with me. I wasn\u0027t fighting for a cause. I\u0027m not like my dad. I don\u0027t give a stuff about any of that crap. I expected her to bawl me out, suspend me, maybe expel me. Instead she\u0027s commending me. For making gorilla noises to a black girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s wrong. I lost my head and did something I shouldn\u0027t have. That was bad, but this is worse. It\u0027s disturbing to think that a woman in Mrs. Reed\u0027s position would praise me for losing my temper and saying such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how dumb would I need to be to criticize my principal for being a racist? She\u0027s giving me a get-out-of-jail-free card. I\u0027d have to be a moron or a martyr to turn that down. And I\u0027m neither.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" I mutter and get up and go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t look at Nancy as I pass. I can\u0027t meet her eyes. She probably thinks it\u0027s because I\u0027m upset at having been punished. But it\u0027s not. It\u0027s because I\u0027m ashamed that Mrs. Reed thinks I\u0027m a racist. And because I\u0027m worried that she might be right. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-11.html","bookId":2450,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:45 PM"}
