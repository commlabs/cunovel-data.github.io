{"id":1323,"no":85,"title":"WESTSIDER BEVERLY SILLS","content":"WESTSIDER BEVERLY SILLS\n\u003cbr\u003e Opera superstar\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 9-30-78\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Probably no opera singer since Caruso has made so great an impact on the American public as Beverly Sills. Even today, the mention of her name can automatically sell out a concert hall anywhere in the U.S. She has become bigger than her art, for while a few younger singers can reach the notes more easily, Sills generates a certain intense excitement into all her roles that makes every show she appears in not just an opera, but an event.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her star vehicle this fall is an early 19th-century opera, Il Turco In Italia (The Turk in Italy), written by Gioacchino Rossini prior to his masterpiece, The Barber of Seville.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Il Turco, presented by the New York City Opera for eight performances in September through November, is a subtle comedy about a flirtatious, Sophia Loren-type character (Sills) with a jealous husband. The audience will miss none of the Italian humor because this production of Il Turco is in English.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I love to do English translations,\" said Miss Sills last week in a telephone interview. \"I believe the whole art of opera is based on communication. I don\u0027t see how people can appreciate a comedy in a language that four fifths of the audience doesn\u0027t understand. There\u0027s only snobbery about foreign languages in this country — not in Europe. In America, an opera is like a museum piece. But I think the great classics like Boheme and Traviata don\u0027t need to be translated because everyone knows what they\u0027re about.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She performs regularly with the New York City Opera even though the State Theatre-based company is able to pay only a tiny fraction of what singers receive at other great opera houses around the world. \"I made my career with them,\" she explained. \"I sing there because of loyalty, and because I love to.\" She has already made plans to retire from singing in 1980 and to become codirector of the New York City Opera with Julius Rudel, the present director.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Right now she is busy studying three other roles. On December 7 she will headline the Metropolitan Opera\u0027s new production of Donizetti\u0027s Don Pasquale, which will run until January 20. In March she will star in a world premiere for the New York City Opera, Miss Haversham\u0027s Fire, based on the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations. In June she will go to San Diego to perform in yet another world-premiere opera, Juana La Loca by Gian Carlo Menotti.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Last season, Beverly hosted a popular television program called Lifestyles. This year, she said, \"I\u0027m doing something much bigger, as a result of that show\u0027s success. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t tell you what it is, because CBS will be making an announcement in mid-October.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Sills said she has no plans for another book. Her first, the self portrait Bubbles, has sold 130,000 copies in hardcover and many times that figure in paperback since it came out a year ago. \"Bubbles\" was her childhood nickname. She was born Belle Silverman in Brooklyn a few months before the stock market crash of 1929. At 3 she did her first radio broadcast; at 7 she was the star of a regular weekly radio show. In her early teens she joined a touring musical company and spent the next 10 years on the road. Then she was accepted by the New York City Opera.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In her first few seasons with the fledgling company, she showed few signs of the fame that was to come. Meanwhile, she and her husband, newspaper publisher Peter Greenough, had become the happy parents of two, a girl named Meredith (Muffy) and a boy, Peter Junior.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the heartbreak struck. When Muffy was 2, it was discovered that she suffered from a serious hearing impairment. A few months later, the couple learned that their son was severely mentally retarded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For the next year and a half, Beverly abandoned her singing career and spent all her time at home. When she returned to the New York City Opera, people noticed a distinct change. Somehow she seemed to have acquired a new dramatic power. In such roles as Cleopatra in Handel\u0027s Julius Caesar she dazzled both critics and public, and has done so ever since. In 1969, when she made her debut at La Scala in Milan — Europe\u0027s foremost opera house — the Italian press labeled her \"La Fenomena.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Because of a long-standing disagreement with Rudolph Bing, the managing director of the Metropolitan Opera, it was not until 1975, after Bing\u0027s retirement, that she made her debut at the Met. The occasion caused the largest advance ticket sale in the company\u0027s history.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For the pat eight years, Sills and her family have lived on Central Park West. \"I just feel that we get all the sunshine here,\" she said. Muffy has just started her freshman year at college in upstate New York and plans to become a veterinarian. Beverly\u0027s husband Peter divides his time among various business projects and the National Foundation for the March of Dimes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her advice for young singers trying to break into opera? \"Keep auditioning,\" Beverly replied emphatically, \"no matter how many times you\u0027re turned down. I tried out for the New York City Opera nine times before they took me. And auditions themselves are valuable: they give you the experience of a performance.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45030.html","bookId":46,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 3:00:40 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 3:00:40 AM"}
