Go back to a home where I\u0027m nothing but a burden? Or go back to the campus with you and have some fun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick some dirt out from underneath my fingernail. \"I\u0027m just making sure, before you get too committed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes my hands and gives them a swing. \"I want to go with you, okay, so go say good-bye to your dad so we can hit the road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ll be right back.\" I head across the front lawn for the door when Ethan\u0027s truck pulls up in my driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk up to his window and rest my arms on it. \"So you got my message I take it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks like he just came from work, grease on his face and clothes, and his dark hair has some shavings of rust in it. \"Yeah, I figured I\u0027d come and say good-bye to both of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slant my head to the side and pierce him with an accusing gaze. \"Don\u0027t try and pretend that you\u0027re here for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe places his hand over his heart, faking hurt. \"My heart is breaking and you\u0027re making jokes. Wow, you really are evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah,\" I back up so he can open the door and climb out. \"I\u0027ll give you two a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ve overestimating what\u0027s going on between the two of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I wouldn\u0027t have to if one of you would tell me what\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs and then rounds the back of the truck. Rolling my eyes, I walk into the house to tell my dad I\u0027m leaving and that I plan on coming back in a couple weeks to meet up with Dean. After a long talk on the phone with him - and I\u0027m sure a lot of persuading from Caroline - we decided to meet up here, when Dean can take off work, and give my dad an ultimatum. It\u0027s probably one of the hardest things I\u0027ll have to do, because I know there will be things said during the conversation that will hurt me. I\u0027m going to push through it, though, because now I understand what I can handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find him on the couch, eating a microwave dinner, with a six-pack on the table in front of him. He\u0027s watching the television, with a cigarette in his hand, and he barely notices me enter the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey Dad,\" I say from the doorway. \"I\u0027m getting ready to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rips his eyes from the television, startled, and I wonder if he was even watching it or if he was dwelling in his thoughts. \"Oh, okay, well drive safely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rub my sweaty palms together and walk into the room. \"Dean and I are going to be coming back in a few weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sets his tray down and grabs a beer. \"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pat my hands on the sides of my legs uneasily. \"We want to talk to you about something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sets the beer down. \"I thought Dean was still here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, feeling guiltier about leaving. \"He went home a week or two ago... but Dad, can you try and take care of yourself a little bit better?\" I take a deep breath and throw a hint out into the open. \"And maybe stop drinking so much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glances at the row of beers in front of him like he just realized they were there. \"Oh, I don\u0027t drink that much, do I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and sit down on the couch beside him. \"You didn\u0027t used to, but now it\u0027s kinda all you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bobs his head up and down. \"Alright, I\u0027ll try to cut back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know he won\u0027t, but hopefully Dean and I will be able to convince him to go to rehab where he can get the help and counseling that he needs. I give him a hug, even though he winces. Then I walk away, hoping he\u0027ll be okay, but knowing that until he makes the decision to change all I can do is try to help him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-1/page-25.html","bookId":1861,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:09 PM"}
