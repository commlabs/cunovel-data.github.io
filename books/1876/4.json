Miss Vanilla. Ha! If he only knew. I breathe deeply and finally decide to get up. It\u0027s a little after six in the morning. I hear Emma in the kitchen. When I emerge I see her dressed in work clothes, sipping a cup of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I say rather groggily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, look who\u0027s home. Edward was looking for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Yeah, I had to work late last night.\" She glances at me over the rim of her cup. \"I told him to come by in a couple of hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, the new boss is a pain in the ass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"Maybe a little.\" I take a cup and fill it with coffee. I feel her eyes on my back while I do it and I start to wonder what she\u0027s thinking. \"Why do you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t know.\" She tears a piece of toast in half and offers me a piece of her breakfast. I take it. \"He has you working odd hours, is dragging you out to the Island again, and I\u0027m not going to see you for the rest of the summer. He\u0027s a pain in the ass, Anna.\" She\u0027s laughing, as she turns and puts her empty mug in the sink. Glancing in the mirror, she checks her make-up and heads for the door. She shouts, \"Check in once in a while so I know you\u0027re safe. Your boss gives me the creeps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I reply and the door slams shut. I\u0027m staring at her toast. Something bothers me, something she said, but I don\u0027t know what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the sensation, I jump in the shower. I take my time getting dressed and then pack. When I pull open my negligee drawer, I wonder if I should take anything. What Cole suggested last night killed me. A one-night stand. I slam the drawer shut. There is no way I\u0027m sleeping with him. Whatever I thought happened, didn\u0027t. It is that simple. He sees me as a tryst and nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rings, and breaks my thoughts. I walk toward the door telling myself that this is necessary, but when I yank open the door, Edward is standing there with a huge bouquet of yellow roses. My mouth opens into a little O and I can\u0027t talk. I feel like scum. He hands me the flowers. I smile at him sadly, but he mistakes my emotion as something good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, baby,\" he kisses my cheek and pushes past me into the apartment. \"I remember you saying you love yellow roses, and well, I thought since you were going away for a while, that you could take them with you to remember me by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGazing at the flowers, I say, \"Edward... these are lovely. Thank you, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns and looks back at me. Taking the flowers from my hands, he places them on top of my suitcase in the hallway, before reaching for me. He slides his arms around my waist and pulls me to him. I feel like I\u0027m hugging an eel. I can\u0027t muster the strength to pretend anymore. This relationship has run its course and I want out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles huge, and turns, saying, \"Emma has a vase here. She said you could take it with you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, stop.\" But he doesn\u0027t. He\u0027s smiling like he\u0027s happy, totally ignoring that my mood doesn\u0027t match his. I push away from him, but he\u0027s walking away from me to get the vase. I follow him into the kitchen. \"Please stop. I need to tell you something,\" my voice is too loud, too curt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightens and turns to look at me. His eyes sweep over me and he shakes his head like he\u0027s missed something, \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry babe. I didn\u0027t see it before. You\u0027re all shaken up because you\u0027re going to miss me.\" Reaching for me, he takes my hands in his and says, \"I love you, babe. It won\u0027t be that long. We can - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut him off, \"This isn\u0027t working out.\" I blurt it out while tugging my hands away. The way he came through the door and continues to speak makes it very hard for me to say anything. I realize that he keeps doing this to me - when I try to talk, he talks over me. It\u0027s like he\u0027s trying to control the relationship and keep it from ending. But after I\u0027ve yelled at him, I think I\u0027m wrong. Edward looks like I\u0027ve hit him with a frying pan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sound apologetic, \"I really like you, but I just think we\u0027re a mismatch. We\u0027re too alike in some ways, and not enough in others. In the long run, we\u0027ll both be sorry for it. I can\u0027t do that to you. I think we need to take some time to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See other people. Sure, why not?\" He shrugs, sounding angry. His fingers ball into fists and he turns like he wants to punch the wall, but he doesn\u0027t. Instead he takes a deep breath and tries to shake off the rage building inside of him. I\u0027ve never seen him so angry. I never thought he had it in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding his head high, he turns back to me, \"Just tell me why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did,\" I say. I feel nervous now and I don\u0027t know why. Something about him makes me step away, \"We won\u0027t make each other happy. You\u0027re vanilla, Edward, and I\u0027m sticky. You said so yourself - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps toward me, hands out, \"Baby, I said I could change that for you. I could - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you can\u0027t. You can\u0027t change who you are, what you want, what turns you on. We\u0027re not the same, Edward. We never will be. It just wasn\u0027t meant to be.\" He stands there silently, looking completely shocked. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward nods, but says nothing as he heads toward the door. I feel horrible. The tightness in my throat is making it impossible to swallow. I want to say something to him, comfort him, but that will only make it worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he pulls the door open, he turns and looks at me, \"We could have been great, you know. You could have learned to like the way I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him for a moment, and then say, \"But I want more that...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glances up at me, \"So, there\u0027s someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell no, there is not someone else. I feel the retort bubbling inside of me, but I shake my head and say, \"No. I\u0027m not seeing anyone else. I\u0027m not sleeping with anyone else. It\u0027s been me and you this whole time and we haven\u0027t had sex once. Every time I\u0027m with you, I feel like you don\u0027t want me, that I\u0027m not good enough for you.\" I am scared to tell him how much more I want, how much more I need. He doesn\u0027t know, but I think he suspects. \"I can\u0027t do it anymore. I\u0027ve had this relationship before. It doesn\u0027t end well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinks slowly. The sadness fades from his eyes. His gaze meets mine and he says, \"I love you, Anna. I always will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me go.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-4.html","bookId":1876,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:12 PM"}
