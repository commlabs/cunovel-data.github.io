When she went to big girls\u0027 school, her mum probably bought a supply of tags which had lasted a lifetime. Griffin\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;less of a musicals fan than his Super\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;said he recognised Carol from his spell on the Ob Pub Squad, but official identification was necessary. Models\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that was the deceased\u0027s profession on the tax books\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;habitually shared and stole fab gear, so there was a slim chance another bird was kitted up in her clobber. Timmy Lea was packed off to the morgue with WPC Rogers to view the body. Bellaver said he could go home after that, provided he didn\u0027t stray too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore leaving, Timmy asked Kate something she\u0027d heard before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Will she come back? Like you did? As a...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made fang-teeth with curled forefingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It doesn\u0027t work like that, Mr Lea. She\u0027d have to have drunk vampire blood before, ah, death.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face fell, hope squashed. He got in the Austin with Rogers, who lifted her veil to drive. B Division cars had slightly tinted windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Did anyone tell him how Carol died?\u0027 she asked Bellaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellaver looked at Regan, who shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then how does he know?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Pimps\u0027 intuition?\u0027 Bellaver suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegan made fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Another thing,\u0027 said Kate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellaver looked at her, glumly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How do we know Carol\u0027s attacker didn\u0027t make her drink his blood before draining her?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a longstanding irritation to the police that, by law, autopsy couldn\u0027t be carried out until three days post mortem on the off-chance the deceased might turn. That had happened, but rarely. The three-day delay meant coppers twiddling their thumbs before they knew whether or not they were on a murder enquiry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We couldn\u0027t be that lucky,\u0027 Bellaver said, \u0027but someone will sit shiva just in case. She was white-lips.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite-lips. She knew the expression. A victim drained to death without the benefit of the Dark Kiss. No tell-tale vampire blood about the mouth. There were other callous terms: throwaways, non-returnable bottles, dolly mixtures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I suppose the bastard could have wiped her off with a hankie just for jollies,\u0027 mused Bellaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost, if not all, new-borns passed through a transitional state indistinguishable from death. Kate\u0027s lasted only six hours. Three days seemed to be a cut-off point. The few who turned after then were brain-damaged ghouls, bereft of personality or intellect. Different clergymen cited the fact that Christ rose on the third day to characterise vampires as blessed or blasphemous. Legal precedents had been hashed over for eighty years. Turning someone against their will was a crime, but not murder. It sometimes led to lengthy, expensive lawsuits, referred to in chambers as Tepes v Westenra cases. The boon of potential immortality was weighed against the social opprobrium and medical inconvenience which came with turning vampire. Even with the National Health, a frighteningly high proportion of newborns didn\u0027t survive their first year. Among the fatal perils: allergy to sunlight, rapid ageing, out-of-control shapeshifting, self-destructive mania and a wasting condition whereby a new-born\u0027s body literally ate itself from the inside. Oh, and being murdered by Drakky Bashers. Kate argued that vampires who were profligate with bestowing the Dark Kiss on short-lived get should be subject to the penalty of law, which added to her already considerable unpopularity among the more traditionally arrogant, high-handed and thick-headed undead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead girl might resurrect and identify her assailant. Kate couldn\u0027t see it happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Timmy, they had a rough itinerary of Carol Thatcher\u0027s last hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday afternoon, she had been with the plastic surgeon Sir John Rowan. Timmy tried half-heartedly to pretend she had a consultation about mole removal, then admitted it was sex for cash. Sir John was one of Carol\u0027s regulars. Bellaver blanched at the list of ministers, big shots, famous entertainers, diplomats and crooks Timmy came up with. He envisioned another Keeler Affair\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the kind of scandal-festooned investigation which gets vast press coverage, but also leads to officers on the case being quietly demoted to traffic duty in Welwyn Garden City. Carol generally shied away from vampires. Timmy thought she\u0027d never been bitten (before), but she was a sometime professional arm-ornament for Baron Meinster, a disciple of Dracula who proclaimed himself the late Count\u0027s successor. The Baron took the trouble to appear in public with a succession of glamour gals, especially since his 1953 conviction for \u0027importuning for immoral purposes\u0027 in gents\u0027 conveniences around Chelsea. Meinster was in Rome just now, reputedly prostrate at the feet of Helmut Berger\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;so he was off the list of suspects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter leaving Sir John\u0027s space age penthouse, Carol went shopping at Biba in Kensington, buying more clothes to sew tags in and never wear, toting them back to her Chelsea flat in an \u0027I\u0027m Bleeding Britain\u0027 bag. She met Timmy at the Prospect of Whitby in Wapping, where they tallied up her week\u0027s take over fish and chips and a pint. Timmy didn\u0027t mind talking\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;bragging\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;about sex, but blushed like a convent girl when the subject of the money was raised. At the riverside pub, they met Clive Landseer, a young man with no visible source of income, and his latest discoveries, white-blonde male and female twins who \u0027came together\u0027. Timmy was in awe of Clive, who\u0027d been tossed out of several posh schools and talked like a toff. He\u0027d also recently turned. The five of them went to a \u0027scene\u0027, which is to say a party, thrown (but not attended) by the Persian-American millionairess Syrie Van Epp on the Fevre Dream, a Mississippi riverboat reassembled on the Thames as a floating pleasure palace. Timmy dropped more names from pop music, fashion, industry and films. There were vampires among this in-crowd. Sebastian Newcastle, now a tycoon, bloated and replete after his hostile take-over of the Cyril Lord carpet empire. Herbert von Krolock, Baron Meinster\u0027s amusing ex. Mrs Michaela Cazaret, collector of art and artists. Paul Durward, the pop singer. Canon Copely-Syle, Black Cardinal in the Church of Satan, a frequent, combative guest on Late Night Line-Up. And Professor Caleb Croft, with a retinue of favoured students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate would love to pin Carol on Croft. Again, they couldn\u0027t be that lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe professor was most likely the biggest monster on the guest list. But she didn\u0027t see him being tripped up by a clumsy lust-murder. He\u0027d been getting away with far worse for centuries. As a prime specimen of vampire behaviour B.D., he was the poster boy for rapine. Born Lord Charles Croydon, he\u0027d been an eighteenth-century Hellfire Club rake. Even before turning, he used up and threw away wenches, relying on title and connections to evade the gallows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, there were drugs at the party. Half the guests were on Bowles-Ottery Pellets, which Bellaver guessed one of Croft\u0027s bright young things had likely brought along to spread the goodwill. Of course, there was sex. Kate felt sorry for Timmy, who spent more time totting up Carol\u0027s fees than having anything like a good time. Even he couldn\u0027t keep track of who went with who, though he reckoned Clive tried to get Carol together with the twins to put on a show for a newspaper columnist who \u0027liked to watch\u0027. He knew Carol nipped into a private berth with one or more members of the band Forever More, just for kicks. More seriously, she balled the Emir Abdulla Akaba with Plainview Oil picking up the tab. A busy night\u0027s work. Timmy got seasick, though the boat was solidly moored. He didn\u0027t say so, but Kate supposed Clive Landseer put something amusing in Timmy\u0027s gin fizz. He was lucky not to wake up tattooed and ring-sore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellaver wasn\u0027t happy with the jet set dramatis personae. The sort of people it was hell to have as witnesses, let alone suspects. Being famous, beautiful, wicked and rich in various combinations meant they all felt the rules\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not to mention the law\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;didn\u0027t apply to them. Just getting them to answer questions would be a colossal chore. Most would be too spacey to provide evidence which would stand up in court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, Timmy came round to where he\u0027d come in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he last saw Carol, she was talking with Nolan, the photographer. He had a couple of tall, scary birds with him. Girls with hungry eyes. Not tarts, but your actual fashion models, too skeletony to get by in Carol\u0027s trade. Probably not vampires, since they\u0027d need to show up on film to make a living. Timmy said Nolan expressed an interest in shooting Carol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll tell you who wants shooting,\u0027 Bellaver muttered. \u0027The lot of them.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, Timmy lost track of Carol. There was nothing to say she didn\u0027t give Nolan the brush-off, latch on to Newcastle or Croft or Durward or Vampires Unknown, and stagger off down whatever tragic life-path led to Maryon Park. But Bellaver had to start somewhere and Thomas Nolan was elected. There was even a smidgen of evidence: Griffin came back from litter duty with a flattened cardboard package found near the body. It had contained a roll of photographic film, and not the cheap stuff they developed at Boot\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Super told Griffin to hop off and track down Nolan\u0027s gaff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWPC Rogers came back with the official word. Timothy Lea had verified the identification and gone off, pale and shaking. Carol Thatcher\u0027s pencilled name could be rubbed off the forms and replaced with biro ink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If she\u0027d got stabbed or overdosed, nobody\u0027d give five new pence,\u0027 Bellaver said. \u0027But she had to get fanged.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRogers\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a thin-faced, weirdly attractive woman\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;had colour in her cheeks. Kate wondered if she\u0027d nipped Timmy in the car. He was the type who\u0027d do whatever a woman in uniform told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGriffin came back. He\u0027d found the address of Nolan\u0027s studio. Pottery Lane, Notting Hill. Evidently, the photographer lived there too, over the shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Griffin had other news. He brought in a Super 7 transistor radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s the matter, lad? Can\u0027t bear to miss Two-Way Family Favourites?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lunchtime news was on. Kate recognised the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027...if this is indeed the first case of its kind since the War, and not merely the first case to have been publicly owned as such, we can take little comfort in that, for it was an inevitable consequence of government after government turning a blind eye to the escalation of the situation. A girl\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a young girl\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;is dead, has been sacrificed... Let her not die in vain, let us draw a line and say \"this far, and no further\".\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Enoch,\u0027 said Bellaver. \u0027Flaming Enoch.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snippet ended. In accordance with the BBC\u0027s policy of balance, a vampire clergyman\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Kate\u0027s old boyfriend Algernon Ford\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;came on next. Algy uttered sympathetic platitudes about the friends and family of the victim and insisted the fiendish, probably foreign culprit was unrepresentative of the long-established, patriotic British vampire community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Griffin, did I or did I not make it plain that certain details of this case should not reach the press?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You did, Super.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And yet those details are now on the wireless?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes they are, Super. None of our lads is responsible.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate knew it was unlikely that the information had come from inside B Division. It could have been Brent, the police surgeon, or whoever\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;she hadn\u0027t thought to ask\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;found the body in the first place. Most likely, it was a local copper. Every nick had some friendly officer willing to swap a pint for tit-bits. Kate had sources like that. Griffin was one of them when in the mood. This was more likely a malicious leak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027ll be Choley,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who?\u0027 asked Bellaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The desk sergeant with the black spot and the greasy fingers.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If so, he will rue the ruddy day. Griffin, you\u0027re too wet for what I have in mind. Rogers, go and dragoon someone terrifying, like Herrick or lawd-help-us Berkeley-Willoughby, then set them loose on these premises, fangs full out. I want this shop locked tighter than a fraidy cat\u0027s arsehole. Intimate that throats will be ripped if I hear any more of this on the news before we have the murderer clapped in silver in the dock at the Old Bailey.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGriffin nodded and took his radio away. Rogers went out in search of an attack dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Too late,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027The fraidy cat\u0027s out of the bag.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellaver looked sour but did not disagree. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-40.html","bookId":2295,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:16 PM"}
