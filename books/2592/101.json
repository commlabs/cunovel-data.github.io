It was lying on my desk, waiting for me to pick it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind was still picturing the field out by the interstate, and I answered the phone in a daze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear someone breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bret?” I heard a voice say faintly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Who is this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of wind and static interspersed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the phone away from my face and checked the incoming number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call was being made from Aimee Light’s cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is this?” I didn’t even realize I had fallen into my chair. My heart was beating too fast. I thought clenching my fist would control it. “Aimee?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePause, static, wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned forward and said a name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clayton?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was ice. “That’s one of my names.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up. “What do you mean? Is this Clayton or not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m everything. I’m everyone.” A static-filled pause. “I’m even you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis comment forced the fear to adopt a casual, friendly tone. I did not want to antagonize whoever this was. I would play dumb. I would pretend to be having a conversation with someone else. I had started shaking so hard that it was almost impossible to keep my voice steady. “Where are you?” I moved to the window. “I never got to see you again after you stopped by my office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes you did.” The voice was now oddly intimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused. “No . . . I mean, where would that have been?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you get the manuscript?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Yes, I did. Where are you?” For some reason I reached for a pen, but it dropped from my trembling hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he said this was so ghastly that I had to compose myself before returning to my fake clueless demeanor. The voice had scales and was horned. The voice was something that had emerged from a bonfire. The fear it caused was unraveling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait a minute,” I said. “Yeah, I think I did see you again. Were you in our house on Sunday night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ ‘Our’ house?” The voice feigned bewilderment. “That’s an interesting phrase. One highly open to interpretation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed the blinds. I sat in the chair again and then stood up just as quickly. I suddenly couldn’t help it. I decided to play along, my voice thick with urgency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this . . . Patrick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re a lot of people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So . . . what were you doing in our house the other night?” I asked casually. “What were you doing in my son’s room?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That night it wasn’t me, Bret. That night it was something else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What . . . was it then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something that is not an ally to our cause.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your cause? What cause? I don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you read the manuscript, Bret?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are any of you responsible for the boys?” I shut my eyes tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The boys?” I had interrupted his question with another question. The voice was on the verge of not behaving anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The missing boys. Are you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if the voice hadn’t anticipated this question. It was as if the voice assumed I knew where the particular truth of that situation led. “No, Bret. Again, you’re looking in the wrong place on that one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where should I be looking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Open your eyes. Stop groping for things that aren’t there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are the boys?” I asked. “Do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ask your son. He knows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fear curled into quick anger. “I don’t believe that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This will be your downfall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writer had left. The writer was scared and had run away and was now hiding somewhere, screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean by that? My downfall? Are you threatening me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see that a Detective Donald Kimball visited you,” the voice said airily. “Did he tell you about me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened to Aimee Light?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now we’re getting somewhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a better world than this one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you do to her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Bret. It’s what you did to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t do anything to her.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-101.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
