The Web of Ivy","content":"\u0026nbsp;My grandfather summoned me to his presence before noon. \u0026nbsp;I breakfasted with Oliver; my uncle did not honour us; it was his habit, his son informed me, to lie abed late. \u0026nbsp;The girl Evelyn Milne came down, slim and pale in her black gown; she gave us the chillest of “good mornings,” and sat silent and obscure through the meal. \u0026nbsp;Thrale waited on us; recalling all Oliver had said to me on the beach, I eyed the old man in the light of day—observing the brownness of his shrivelled skin, the bony hands serving us so deftly; and from time to time I saw him peer at me, his eyes gleam sinister; his face expressed nothing; his voice was thin and reedy. \u0026nbsp;The girl passed not a word with us, ere she rose from breakfast; she seemed a poor, scared, fluttering thing, afraid of Oliver and me. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How do we pass the day, cousin?” I asked, as Oliver pulled back his chair. \u0026nbsp;“Do we ride abroad?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thrale interrupted swiftly, “Will you pardon me, sir?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n p. 178“Surely, Thrale.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Your grandfather, sir, desires a word with you. \u0026nbsp;He asks you to remain here. \u0026nbsp;He’ll send for you when he’s ready for you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I nodded. \u0026nbsp;Oliver, without a word, marched out, leaving me to yawn the morning away by the fire. \u0026nbsp;Thrale, clearing the table, vanished presently; I sat waiting glumly; silence had fallen over the house. \u0026nbsp;The sunlight filtered through the dull panes, revealing the decay of the house, the tattered tapestries, the mouldering oak, the green-specked mirrors and the paintings dark with smoke and grime. \u0026nbsp;I pondered heavily, feeling the gloom descend once more upon me, and hearing stealthy footsteps through the house, and muttering voices. \u0026nbsp;The air of the room was thick with the musty odours of decay; the windows, when I would have opened them, proved bound with ivy. \u0026nbsp;I grew so weary that at last I would have pulled the bell-rope for Thrale, and asked him to bring me a book, or let me out into the air, until my grandfather should summon me. \u0026nbsp;I started to find Thrale was in the room and beckoning to me, “Your grandfather will see you now, sir,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I followed him readily up the stairs and down the corridor to my grandfather’s room. \u0026nbsp;He announced me with all formality, “Mr. John, p. 179sir,” and left me standing before the grim old figure in the brocaded gown. \u0026nbsp;He sat huddled by the fire, his jewelled hands seemed palsied, as he warmed them at the blaze; his lips scarcely to support his tobacco pipe—the air was heavy with smoke. \u0026nbsp;He pointed to the chair before him; when I sat down, he regarded me for awhile in silence. \u0026nbsp;He said at last, “Well, grandson—Bradbury swears you’re my grandson, and Bradbury has no cause to lie.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’m happy that you think so, sir,” I flashed, colouring.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He chuckled to himself, “You’ve Richard’s look,” he said. \u0026nbsp;“You’ve his evil temper—I’ve horsed him for it many a time. \u0026nbsp;Ay, and he’s dead—isn’t he?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For all I know. \u0026nbsp;Or overseas.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Or overseas!” he repeated slowly. \u0026nbsp;“Your mother now—does she know?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My mother thinks him dead.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “She was a fine, upstanding lass,” he said, pulling at his pipe. \u0026nbsp;“Ay, ay, years since. \u0026nbsp;And she wedded Richard—he-he—for all that Charles and his wife might do. \u0026nbsp;She feared and hated us all, except Richard. \u0026nbsp;She’s paying Charles coin for coin. \u0026nbsp;What’s she said of us to you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Little, and that’ll I’ll not say, sir, by your leave.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n p. 180His brow grew dark;
