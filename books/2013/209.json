Had always known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kicked aside a broken pot, watched it skid, roll, then wobble to a halt. King on your melting throne, you drew a breath, then let it go. And… never again. Simple. Easy. When you are the last of your kind, and you release that last breath, then it is the breath of extinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it rides the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Emroth, there was a scholar in Malaz City-a miserable old bastard named Obo-who claimed he was witness to the death of a star. And when the charts were compared again, against the night sky, well, one light was gone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The stars have changed since my mortal life, ghost.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Some have gone out?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As in… died V\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Bonecasters could not agree on this,’ she said. Another observation offered a different possibility. The stars are moving away from us, Hedge of the Bridgeburners. Perhaps those we no longer see have gone too far for our eyes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Obo’s star was pretty bright-wouldn’t it have faded first, over a long time, before going out?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps both answers are true. Stars die. Stars move away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So, did that Jaghut die, or did he move away?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your question makes no sense.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally? Hedge barked a laugh. You’re a damned bad liar, Emroth.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This,’ she said, ‘is not a perfect world.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swaths of colours sweeping overhead hissed softly, while around them the wind plucked at tufts of cloth and fur, moaning through miniature gullies and caverns of ice, and closer still, a sound shared by ghost and T’lan Imass, the crackling destruction of their footsteps across the plateau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnrack knelt beside the stream, plunging his hands into the icy water, then lifting them clear again to watch the runnels trickling down. The wonder had not left his dark brown eyes since his transformation, since the miracle of a life regained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man could have no heart if he felt nothing watching this rebirth, this innocent joy in a savage warrior who had been dead a hundred thousand years. He picked up polished stones as if they were treasure, ran blunt, calloused fingertips across swaths of lichen and moss, brought to his heavy lips a discarded antler to taste with his tongue, to draw in its burnt-hair scent. Walking through the thorny brush of some arctic rose, Onrack had then halted, with a cry of astonishment, upon seeing red scratches on his bowed shins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Imass was, Trull Sengar reminded himself yet again, nothing-nothing-like what he would have imagined him to be. Virtually hairless everywhere barring the brown, almost black mane sweeping down past his broad shoulders. In the days since they had come to this strange realm, a beard had begun, thin along Onrack’s jawline and above his mouth, the bristles wide-spaced and black as a boar’s; but not growing at all on the cheeks, or the neck. The features of the face were broad and flat, dominated by a flaring nose with a pronounced bridge, like a knuckle bone between the wide-spaced, deeply inset eyes. The heavy ridge over those eyes was made all the more robust by the sparseness of the eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough not particularly tall, Onrack nevertheless seemed huge. Ropy muscles bound to thick bone, the arms elongated, the hands wide but the fingers stubby. The legs were disproportionately short, bowed so that the knees were almost as far out to the sides as his hips. Yet Onrack moved with lithe stealth, furtive as prey, eyes flicking in every direction, head tilting, nostrils flaring as he picked up scents on the wind. Prey, yet now he needed to satisfy a prodigious appetite, and when Onrack hunted, it was with discipline, a single-mindedness that was fierce to witness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis world was his, in every way. A blend of tundra to the north and a treeline in the south that reached up every now and then to the very shadow of the huge glaciers stretching down the valleys. The forest was a confused mix of deciduous and coniferous trees, broken with ravines and tumbled rocks, springs of clean water and boggy sinkholes. The branches swarmed with birds, their incessant chatter at times overwhelming all else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong the edges there were trails. Caribou moved haphazardly between forest and tundra in their grazing. Closer to the ice, on higher ground where bedrock was exposed, there were goat-like creatures, scampering up ledges to look back down on the two-legged strangers passing through their domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnrack had disappeared into the forest again and again in the first week of their wandering. Each time he reappeared his toolkit had expanded. A wooden shaft, the point of which he hardened in the fire of their camp; vines and reeds from which he fashioned snares, and nets that he then attached to the other end of the spear, displaying impressive skill at trapping birds on the wing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-209.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
