But magical energy streams through the window, as it always does when a passageway between universes is opened. Tapping into that instinctively, I throw up a barrier between us and the guards. The bullets mushroom against it and drop harmlessly to the floor. As more troops flood into the room, I strengthen the barrier and start thinking about ways to make it a one-way shield, so that we can fire at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can do that, Juni barks a short command. The window pulses, then snaps out of existence. The flow of magic stops, and though a strong residue is left in the air, I now have to work off a dwindling supply. Altering the shield would take a lot out of me. Too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long can you hold that?\" Shark yells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A couple of minutes,\" I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pip!\" he roars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On it,\" she mutters, darting to the rear of the wall to my right. There\u0027s a corridor on the other side which bypasses the section of the building we came through. Shark was keeping it in reserve in case we needed an escape route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meera frees Prae Athim, the guards on the other side of the shield part to allow Juni Swan and a smirking Antoine Horwitzer to advance. They come to within a couple of centimetres of the barrier. Juni smiles crookedly at the shield, then at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice work, Grubbs,\" she gurgles, her voice a hoarse mockery of what it once was. \"But what more can you do in the absence of demonic energy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As much as you,\" I snarl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possibly,\" she chuckles. \"But I don\u0027t have to do anything. Not with so many finely armed humans to depend on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you pay them much?\" Shark sneers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Antoine recruited them on my behalf,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most humans have a price,\" Antoine chuckles. \"I\u0027ve always been adept at calculating such sums.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have your head for this, Horwitzer!\" Prae Athim screams, ripping the tape from her mouth and thrusting a finger at Antoine. \"You\u0027re finished!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly,\" he coos. \"You can\u0027t do anything to me. Your reign has come to its natural end. I run the Lambs now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why this way?\" she snarls. \"You were always power-hungry, but you\u0027d have squeezed me out eventually. Why betray us to monstrous fiends like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful,\" Juni growls. \"You don\u0027t want to hurt my feelings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the dawn of a new age,\" smiles Antoine. \"Our associates can provide us with the cure for lycanthropy, but that\u0027s only the tip of the iceberg. I was never much interested in that side of the business. While you were wasting money on werewolves, I was busy making it in other fields. We\u0027re already a major force, but when we move into areas of supernatural energy, we\u0027ll be in a class of our own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ready,\" Pip calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give us a minute,\" Shark says, then squares up to Juni. \"I never liked you. When you were Beranabus\u0027s assistant, all you ever did was complain. You\u0027re weak and petty, a disgrace to the Disciples.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuni stares impassively at Shark. \"Insult me all you like. You\u0027ll be dead soon. We\u0027ll see who\u0027s laughing then.\" She looks around and spots Meera. Her smile blossoms again. \"You had a lucky escape in Carcery Vale. You won\u0027t get away this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were in the Vale?\" Meera frowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Juni says. \"I was outside. I was sorely tempted to break into the cellar. I could smell the three of you and I knew Dervish was incapacitated. But my master warned me to be wary of Bec... of the Kah-Gash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s what this is about,\" I snarl, our suspicions-that the attacks were the work of Lord Loss and the Shadow-confirmed. \"You want the Kah-Gash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously,\" Juni sniffs. \"Did you think my master would stand by and let you wield the most powerful weapon ever known? That he\u0027d wait for you to learn how to use it, so you could destroy our universe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why try to kill us?\" I frown. \"The werewolves could have ripped Bec to pieces. Surely you need her and me-alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all,\" Juni sneers. \"Our new master deals in death. I\u0027m proof of that-he released my soul and let me walk among the living again. I\u0027m here to harvest your spirit, just as I would have harvested Bec\u0027s if she\u0027d been killed. It\u0027s simpler to let others do our dirty work, then steal your parts of the Kah-Gash as you perish. We weren\u0027t sure how powerful you might be, so-\" She gasps, clutches her chest and bends over. Takes several breaths, then stands again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t look too healthy,\" I laugh wickedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This body won\u0027t last long,\" she says. \"A shell for my soul to inhabit. I\u0027ll return to death soon, and return gladly. But rest assured, your uncle\u0027s in far worse shape. I saw him just before I came here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffen fearfully. \"You\u0027re lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she says. \"He was on a pleasure cruiser, although he didn\u0027t seem to be getting much pleasure out of it. My new master decided to deal with Bec personally, and since Dervish and Beranabus were with her, they\u0027re dead now, or will be soon. Just like you when your barrier crumbles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to press her for more information, but Shark grips my arm. \"We\u0027ve learnt all we need to know. Time to get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Dervish-\" I cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-will have to look after himself,\" Shark finishes. He yells at Pip, \"Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a small explosion. As the dust clears, Pip slips through a hole in the wall and the others push after her. I glance at Juni. She\u0027s smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My team will catch up with you outside,\" she says. \"And I\u0027ve another surprise lined up. I\u0027ll wait here. I don\u0027t need to be too close when you die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any last words for the board, Prae?\" Antoine asks. She hits him with some of the foulest insults I\u0027ve ever heard, but he doesn\u0027t even blink. He\u0027s loving this. It would be easy to blame myself for not seeing through him before, but he conned us all. Besides, there\u0027s no time for self-blame. If we reach the helicopter before Juni\u0027s soldiers, we might get out of here. We\u0027re not finished yet-if we\u0027re fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later!\" I snap at Juni, locking gazes with her, letting her see how serious I am. I mean to kill her the next time we meet, as slowly and painfully as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuni only laughs with mad delight at the threat, then waves mockingly. \"Run, run as fast as you can, but I\u0027ll catch you, little ginger-haired man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grubbs!\" Shark shouts. He\u0027s standing by the hole in the wall. Everyone\u0027s gone through except him and Meera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold Juni\u0027s gaze one last second, then turn my back on the mutant and her troops, and dive for safety. As I squeeze through the hole, I hear the sounds of dozens of feet scuffling out of the room as the soldiers set off to intercept us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe race is on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning as fast as we can, Timas in the lead. He\u0027s playing with the tiny console on his gun as he runs. He looks the least worried of us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you trusted that charlatan,\" Prae Athim pants, glancing over her shoulder at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told us you stole the werewolves,\" I growl. \"Based on your previous threat to kidnap Bill-E and me, why wouldn\u0027t we believe him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, he worked for you,\" Meera chips in. \"Why didn\u0027t you see this coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough!\" Shark huffs as Prae bristles. \"If they catch us before we make it outside, it doesn\u0027t matter who\u0027s to blame-we\u0027ll all be crapping bullets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe push on in silence. I\u0027m finding it difficult to keep up. Although I\u0027m fit, I\u0027m used to operating on magic. It\u0027s been a long time since I worked up a sweat. I\u0027m out of practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can hear Juni\u0027s guards, their cries to one another. They\u0027re keeping pace with us but can\u0027t break through. We have a slight advantage, but it\u0027s very slight. And if they make it to the yard before us, or if there are more out there already...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corridor feels much longer than it appeared on the map. I start to think we\u0027re in a maze, doomed to wander in circles until we run into Juni\u0027s troops and are mown down. I consider using magic to guide us out. But that would be a waste of energy. I have to hold it back. Use it only when the situation is truly desperate. Which probably won\u0027t be long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimas bursts through a door and sunlight streams in. Finding an extra burst of speed, we hurry through, out into the yard where we fought with the first group of guards. It\u0027s deserted except for James and Marian in the Farrier Harrier. As soon as they see us, James fires the engines up to full, readying the helicopter for a swift getaway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe race for the chopper. I picture myself clambering to safety along with everybody else. We lift off, zip out over the water, laughing at our narrow escape, leaving Juni behind to curse and rant. But in my heart I know it won\u0027t be that easy. And sure enough, before we\u0027ve taken six strides, Juni\u0027s troops hit the scene and the gunfire starts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePip LeMat is ahead of everyone, having overtaken Timas, so she should have been the safest. But she\u0027s the first to catch a spray of bullets. She hits the ground hard and doesn\u0027t move, blood already seeping from beneath her still form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShark and the others spin 180 degrees, even as Pip is falling, and open up with their own weapons. \"Run!\" Shark yells at Meera and me. \"Get out of here. We\u0027ll cover you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to protest, but Meera pushes me forward. \"Don\u0027t argue!\" she shouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t just leave them,\" I cry as half of Terry\u0027s head disappears. He remains standing a moment, then slumps forward. Leo takes a hit to the shoulder. He roars with pain, but continues to return fire. Prae Athim grabs Terry\u0027s gun and pitches in with the others, screaming manically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard what Juni said,\" Meera snarls. \"You\u0027re the only one who matters. If she gets her hands on you, we\u0027re done for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like we\u0027re not already!\" I shriek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the rest of us have to worry about is death,\" Meera says. \"From what Juni said, that\u0027s only the start for you. If the Shadow gets your piece of the Kah-Gash...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her helplessly. I know she\u0027s right, but these soldiers have become our friends. We can\u0027t simply abandon them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A barrier,\" I wheeze. \"We can construct a shield and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeera slaps me hard. \"Get in that helicopter or they\u0027ll have died for nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her numbly, then lurch forward. Bullets rip up the ground close by my feet, but I don\u0027t flinch. My eyes are filling with tears. I don\u0027t want to escape if the cost is losing Shark and his team, but Meera\u0027s right. We have no choice. The Kah-Gash mustn\u0027t fall into the Shadow\u0027s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m about halfway to the Farrier Harrier when a klaxon blares, overriding the noise of the helicopter and guns. I shouldn\u0027t stop, but I can\u0027t help myself. Pausing, I glance back and see Juni\u0027s men retreating into the building. At least a dozen have been killed or are lying wounded. But everyone else is ducking out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShark was crouched low, but now he stands and stares after the departing troops. He\u0027s as confused as I am. Then, as the squeal of the klaxon dies away, we hear something else. A grinding noise coming from the outer wall of the compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe whirl as one, just in time to see the wall split in several places. We should have seen this coming. Timas told us, when he was explaining about the grooves in the ground. Everything here is built out of metal panels which can be swiftly slid together-or just as easily slid apart. As we watch with a sickening sense of helplessness, panels roll back, leaving gaping holes in the wall. Seconds later I spot the first werewolf sniffing at the gap. Then it catches our scent and bounds ahead, followed by dozens more. They converge on us like giant locusts, screeching, howling, free at last to attack and kill. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wolf-island-the-demonata-8/page-11.html","bookId":2182,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:33 PM"}
