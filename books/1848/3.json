Once out of sight of the villagers, they veered off to the right, sending their horses at a furtive gallop into the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Jenny been watching, she might have caught a brief glimpse of them doubling back through the woods that ran beside the road right behind her. But at the time, she was occupied with the terrified pandemonium that had broken out among the citizens of Belkirk, which happened to lie directly in the path between England and Merrick keep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Wolf is coming!\" one of the women cried, clutching her babe protectively to her breast. \"God have pity on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Tis Merrick he\u0027ll strike at,\" a man shouted, his voice rising in fear. \" \u0027Tis the laird of Merrick he\u0027ll want in his jaws, but \u0027tis Belkirk he\u0027ll devour on the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the air was filled with gruesome predictions of fire and death and slaughter, and the children crowded around Jenny, clinging to her in mute horror. To the Scots, be they wealthy noble or lowly villager, the Black Wolf was more evil than the devil himself, and more dangerous, for the devil was a spirit, while the Wolf was flesh and blood—the living Lord of Evil—a monstrous being who threatened their existence, right here on earth. He was the malevolent specter that the Scots used to terrify their offspring into behaving. \"The Wolf will get you,\" was the warning issued to keep children from straying into the woods or leaving their beds at night, or from disobeying their elders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpatient with such hysteria over what was, to her, more myth than man, Jenny raised her voice in order to be heard over the din. \" \u0027Tis more likely,\" she called, putting her arms around the terrified children who\u0027d crowded against her at the first mention of the Wolf\u0027s name, \"that he\u0027ll go back to his heathen king so that he can lick the wounds we gave him at Cornwall while he tells great lies to exaggerate his victory. And if he does not do that, he\u0027ll choose a weaker keep than Merrick for his attack—one he\u0027s a chance of breeching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words and her tone of amused disdain brought startled gazes flying to her face, but it wasn\u0027t merely false bravado that had made Jenny speak so: She was a Merrick, and a Merrick never admitted to fear of any man. She had heard that hundreds of times when her father spoke to her stepbrothers, and she had adopted his creed for her own. Furthermore, the villagers were frightening the children, which she refused to let continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary tugged at Jenny\u0027s skirts to get her attention, and in a shrill little voice, she asked, \"Isn\u0027t you afeert of the Black Wolf, Lady Jenny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not!\" Jenny said with a bright, reassuring smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They say,\" young Tom interjected in an awed voice, \"the Wolf is as tall as a tree!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A tree!\" Jenny chuckled, trying to make a huge joke of the Wolf and all the lore surrounding him. \"If he is, \u0027twould be a sight worth seeing when he tries to mount his horse! Why, \u0027twould take four squires to hoist him up there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe absurdity of that image made some of the children giggle, exactly as Jenny had hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heert,\" said young Will with an eloquent shudder, \"he tears down walls with his bare hands and drinks blood!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yuk!\" said Jenny with twinkling eyes. \"Then \u0027tis only indigestion which makes him so mean. If he comes to Belkirk, we\u0027ll offer him some good Scottish ale instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My pa said,\" put in another child, \"he rides with a giant beside him, a Goliath called Arik who carries a war axe and chops up children…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heert—\" another child interrupted ominously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny cut in lightly, \"Let me tell you what I have heard.\" With a bright smile, she began to shepherd them toward the abbey, which was out of sight just beyond a bend down the road. \"I heard,\" she improvised gaily, \"that he\u0027s so very old that he has to squint to see, just like this—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screwed up her face in a comical exaggeration of a befuddled, near-blind person peering around blankly, and the children giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they walked along, Jenny kept up the same light-hearted teasing comments, and the children fell in with the game, adding their own suggestions to make the Wolf seem absurd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut despite the laughter and seeming gaiety of the moment, the sky had suddenly darkened as a bank of heavy clouds rolled in, and the air was turning bitingly cold, whipping Jenny\u0027s cloak about her, as if nature herself brooded at the mention of such evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was about to make another joke at the Wolf\u0027s expense, but she broke off abruptly as a group of mounted clansmen rounded the bend from the abbey, coming toward her down the road. A beautiful girl, clad as Jenny was in the somber gray gown, white wimple, and short gray veil of a novice nun, was mounted in front of the leader, sitting demurely sideways in his saddle, her timid smile confirming what Jenny already knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a silent cry of joy, Jenny started to dash forward, then checked the unladylike impulse and made herself stay where she was. Her eyes clung to her father, then drifted briefly over her clansmen, who were staring past her with the same grim disapproval they\u0027d shown her for years—ever since her stepbrother had successfully circulated his horrible tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSending the children ahead with strict orders to go directly to the abbey, Jenny waited in the middle of the road for what seemed like an eternity until, at last, the group halted in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father, who\u0027d obviously stopped at the abbey where Brenna, Jenny\u0027s stepsister, was also staying, swung down from his horse, then he turned to lift Brenna down. Jenny chafed at the delay, but his scrupulous attention to courtesy and dignity was so typical of the great man that a wry smile touched her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he turned fully toward her, opening his arms wide. Jenny hurtled into his embrace, hugging him fiercely, babbling in her excitement: \"Father, I\u0027ve missed you so! \u0027Tis nearly two years since I\u0027ve seen you! Are you well? You look well. You\u0027ve scarce changed in all this time!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently disentangling her arms from about his neck, Lord Merrick set his daughter slightly away from him while his gaze drifted over her tousled hair, rosy cheeks, and badly rumpled gown. Jenny squirmed inwardly beneath his prolonged scrutiny, praying that he approved of what he saw and that, since he\u0027d obviously stopped at the abbey already, the abbess\u0027s report had been pleasing to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo years ago, her behavior had gotten her sent to the abbey; a year ago, Brenna had been sent down here for safety\u0027s sake while the laird was at war. Under the abbess\u0027s firm guidance, Jenny had come to appreciate her strengths, and to try to overcome her faults. But as her father inspected her from head to toe, she couldn\u0027t help wondering if he saw the young lady she was now or the unruly girl she\u0027d been two years ago. His blue eyes finally returned to her face and there was a smile in them. \"Ye\u0027ve become a woman, Jennifer.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-3.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:09 PM"}
