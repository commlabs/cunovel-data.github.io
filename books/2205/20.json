He didn\u0027t return it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to pull me into the beyond. Evidently since I\u0027m soulless, I can\u0027t enter or leave it on my own, but you can take me there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a ridiculous plan,\" she snorted, casting pathetic glances at Paen. \"Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s ridiculous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very much so,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop doing that. Paen is on the edge as is,\" I whispered to Clare, jerking her hand to get her attention. \"My hands are full trying to keep him from attacking Pilar, without you baiting him into an action we\u0027ll all regret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it is silly. I don\u0027t know anything about this beyond place. I don\u0027t know why he thinks I\u0027m going to be able to find the statue,\" she said, frowning at Pilar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeppo sat on his shoulder, making occasional chirruping noises as Clare and I prepared to retrieve the statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not have to find it. The Beloved will find it. She was born of the light; she will have powers there,\" Pilar told her for the third time. \"Just do as you\u0027ve been instructed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but it\u0027s all so very silly,\" Clare said, stalling like mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at it this way,\" I told her. \"At least if we die, we\u0027ll die together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer look of outrage would have brought a mortal to her knees. \"I am not going to die!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that,\" I soothed, giving her hand a friendly squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should hope you do,\" she said, transferring her glare from me back to Pilar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faeries can\u0027t die,\" I added, smiling at her outraged snarl. \"Come on, Glimmerharp. Let\u0027s get this over with so we can take care of Caspar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClare swore colorful oaths at me as we turned and walked straight toward the rock face, where Pilar had indicated the nearest entrance to the beyond was. I was just about to ask her if she talked to her mother with that mouth when we hit a wall - or rather, I did. Clare passed through it, but I was held back by a field that didn\u0027t want to let me pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clare, you\u0027re going to have to pull,\" I said, pushing myself against the barrier between realities. \"I can\u0027t... seem... to get thr - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrapped a second hand around my wrist and yanked with a strength that was surprising. I was jerked clean through the barrier into the beyond, stumbling over a rock and falling to my knees, the shock of passing through it enough to strip the air from my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam? Are you all right? You disappeared. Paen\u0027s voice was warm and reassuring in my head, but it was different somehow - stretched, as if it came from a great distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m fine, I answered, getting to my feet, brushing the knees of my jeans as I took a quick look about. Just a little shaky. I don\u0027t think that was the most graceful entrance I\u0027ve ever made. Everything OK out there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Pilar and I are having a stare-down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho\u0027s winning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is. I don\u0027t think he has eyelids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe you should offer to arm-wrestle him, or have a spitting contest or something, I said, gathering up every warm emotion I could muster in the cold void of my soulless self, and sending them to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you, too, he said, and for a moment, he shared his warmth and light with me, reminding me again that I wasn\u0027t alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClare looked around us. \"This is certainly different. Where did all these trees and lovely flowers come from? And that brook? I know that brook wasn\u0027t there a few seconds ago,\" she said, pointing to a stream of silver that spilled over the rocks in a graceful display that promised refreshment and relaxation to any who paused to sit a while near it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in the beyond, now, Clare. Things are different here. Expect Disney music and dancing teacups at any moment. Put down that dove you found and come along. We have places to go, statues to rescue, demon lords to cream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where exactly are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To find the statue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that, silly,\" she said, snatching up a handful of wildflowers as I held out my hands, feeling for a familiar tingle that would herald a wrinkle. \"But where is the statue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evidently where Pilar stashed it, somewhere around Caspar\u0027s apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t he know where he put it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but things get shifted slightly in the beyond, so all he could say is that it would be somewhere near the apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s all the way back in town,\" she said, wandering over to where a silhouetted version of Pilar stood a few feet away from Paen. She waved her hand in front of his face. \"They can\u0027t see us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. What you\u0027re seeing is the representation of him in the beyond. His aura is black because he has been tainted by dark powers.\" A little frisson of something went up my left hand as I felt along the rock face. I moved over a step, running both hands along the minute stream of power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paen\u0027s aura isn\u0027t black,\" she said, looking at him. When you\u0027re in the beyond, people in the other reality appear shadowed slightly, as if you are viewing them through a thin veil, which I suppose is as good a simile as anything. \"But he was cursed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a soul now. Ah. Here it is.\" I slipped my fingers into the stream, gently pulling it apart until there was a shimmering portal wide enough to allow a person through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The statue?\" Clare asked, wandering over to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, the wrinkle. Come on, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027ll stay open once I go through it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrinkle? What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hauled her in after me. It was like walking through a faint field of electricity. One moment we were on the side of a cliff in the Lammermuir Hills; the next we were standing at the end of the street on which Caspar\u0027s apartment was located.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you do that?\" Clare asked, quickly stuffing a petal in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot her an exasperated look. \"Didn\u0027t you ever watch any Star Trek shows? It\u0027s a wrinkle in the time/space continuum. Or something like that - I\u0027m not quite sure what the technical name for it is. All I know is you can use the wrinkles to travel to another area in the beyond. You take that side of the street, I\u0027ll do this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeedless to say, Clare was too overwhelmed to do much but follow me as I searched the sidewalk and area surrounding the steps leading into Caspar\u0027s building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crapbeans,\" I said, shoving a garbage can back under the stone steps leading up to the doorway. I dusted off my hands, giving the building a wary look. \"I guess this means we\u0027re going to have to go inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooh,\" she said, her eyes big. \"Will he notice us, do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. He\u0027s a demon lord, so he shouldn\u0027t be able to see into the beyond, but he\u0027s also a god, so who knows what the extent of his powers are?\" I pushed down the feeling of dread that rose as I started up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, sweetheart?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warm glow of Paen\u0027s being filled me. I am now, I answered, smiling at him but unable to stop the sharp pang of regret. If only things were as they had been...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll get it back, love. We\u0027ll get them both back, he promised me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, sent a heartfelt prayer to let us all get through this without any more tragedies being inflicted, and opened the door to the apartments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have to press the buzz... oh!\" Clare sucked in her breath as she followed me into the building, rubbing her arms and shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not restricted by the boundaries of our reality in the beyond,\" I said, shivering as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaspar\u0027s apartment might be on the third floor, but his presence turned the inside of the building black as night, seeping into every corner, filling it with a veritable miasma of dense, inky being. The only light we had was that coming off of Clare and myself - Clare\u0027s pure soul providing a halo of light around her, while faint sunlight seemed to gently glow from my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No wonder my elf senses were going berserk here,\" I said, rubbing the back of my neck where the hairs were standing on end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClare said nothing, but grabbed my hand. We climbed the stairs in silence, carefully making our way through the darkness, doing our best to search each inch of the landings, stairs, and hallways as we came to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I said what seemed like an eternity later as I stood outside a door labeled 12-C. \"I guess we\u0027re going to have to go in and see if it\u0027s right under Caspar\u0027s nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no,\" Clare said, backing down the hallway. \"There is no way I\u0027m going into that apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think he can see into the beyond,\" I said, biting my lip. \"We should be safe enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Absolutely not. And I think you\u0027re insane for even thinking about going in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m not too wild about the idea myself, in case you hadn\u0027t noticed.\" I thought for a minute. \"What we need is a distraction, something to grab Caspar\u0027s attention in case he can see us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you going to do that?\" she asked, her face puckered with worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaen, my love, we need some help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it! You\u0027re in trouble, aren\u0027t you? Tell Clare to pull me in -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are not in trouble. We just need help. I need someone to capture Caspar\u0027s attention so we can check his apartment for the statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaen created and discarded any number of objections to the thought of us going into the apartment, but he wasn\u0027t the man I loved for nothing. Let me talk to Pilar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe huddled together in the darkness of the apartment hallway, vaguely aware when one of the mortal inhabitants passed by on their way to or from their homes, but mostly just aware of the profound sense of dread that seemed to soak into everything, ourselves included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo ahead, Sam, Paen told me eons later. Noelle is conducting a ritual to summon Caspar. It should keep his attention off you, but she says you\u0027ll only have about five minutes before she has to stop the ritual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect. Thank her for me, will you? Uh... you can\u0027t do the mind thing with her, can you? I asked, a little spike of jealousy going through me at the thought of someone else sharing something so intimate with Paen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver hear of a mobile phone, sweetheart? he said, laughing into my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew where Caspar was the second we slipped into the apartment. He was in the sitting room, the same lovely peach and cream room that had seemed so peaceful to me before, but was now a place of such horror my stomach clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whisper barely penetrated the blackness. I turned back to where Clare stood in the doorway, her arms clutched around herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I can go in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took one look at the terror in her eyes and went over to give her a reassuring hug. \"It\u0027s OK. I\u0027ve been here before, so it won\u0027t take me any time to go through the room I was in when Pilar zapped me. You just stay here, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" she said, hugging me tightly. \"If I was a faery - not that I am, but if I was - I\u0027d rub magic faery dust on you to keep you safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and didn\u0027t point out the fact that the front of my shirt glowed with the incandescent light from the faery dust which had rubbed on me when we hugged. Instead I mentally girded my loins, marched over to the sitting room door, and prayed that Noelle the Guardian had enough power to keep a demon lord occupied while I stood only a few feet away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needn\u0027t have worried. Caspar was there in the room, standing in the middle, but he was frozen, as if locked in that position. Little curlicues of dark power snapped around him, but I clearly didn\u0027t register on his consciousness as I scooted around him, heading for the chair I\u0027d sat on during my second visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe statue was tucked away behind a settee, still wrapped in the blue cloth. I snatched it up, uncovering just a bit of it to make sure it was really the statue before making a dash for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, I forgot to watch where I was going, and tripped over a small footstool that sat almost hidden away under a table. Almost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe statue flew from my hands as I fell to the floor, slamming up against the wall. My knees cracked painfully on the hardwood floor as I lunged forward to grab the statue before it could rebound, but to my complete and utter surprise, it didn\u0027t bounce off the wall like a proper brass statue of a falcon should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead it shattered in an explosion of brass-coated plaster, the pieces of the bird falling into large chunks on the hardwood floor with several large thunks, the biggest of which was made by a small black statue of a monkey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaspar roared a scream of anger behind me as he broke the bonds of the summoning and spun around to see me scrambling madly toward the Jilin statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You!\" he screeched, his voice literally causing the windows to erupt into a thousand little shards of glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy crap,\" I muttered, not taking the time to pick the monkey statue out of the debris of the bird - I just scooped it all up, hugged it to my chest, and bolted for the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run, Clare, he\u0027s on to us!\" I bellowed. She didn\u0027t stop to ask who; no doubt she caught a glimpse of the monstrosity behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaen, pull us out, I yelled, my skin erupting into pain as Caspar\u0027s tendrils of power lashed out and caught me, holding me fast at the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noooooo!\" Clare screamed, grabbing my arm to keep me from being pulled back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBless his heart, Paen didn\u0027t bother with asking unimportant questions - he simply merged himself with me, filling me, holding me, binding me to him, and what was most important at that moment, yanking both Clare and me out of the beyond, back onto the cliff shelf on the Lammermuir Hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw myself into Paen\u0027s arms, unmindful of the sharp corners of the bits of statue I held clutched to my body, so grateful to be away from Caspar, tears mingled with the kisses I pressed to his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clare,\" Finn shouted from the plain below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all right,\" she yelled back, going to the edge to wave at him. \"But that demon lord was awful! He was the most horrible thing I\u0027ve ever seen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind us, the stone groaned as if in protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was hideous, all black and twisted and misshapen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of a thousand souls in agony ripped through us as the fabric of being was shredded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I would die if I were ever to see him again, he was just that awful,\" Clare called to Finn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaspar stepped out of the beyond, power coiled around him like snakes, writhing and twisting, snapping at everything they could reach. The ground shook, as if protesting Caspar\u0027s presence in such a sacred spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you found my statue,\" he said, his voice filled with the promise of eternal torment. \"I will take it back now, if you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn immense cracking noise rent the air, causing everyone to cover their ears. The rocky shelf we stood on shattered, the stone crashing to the ground below, taking us with it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-vampires-get-the-blues-dark-ones-4/page-20.html","bookId":2205,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:54 PM"}
