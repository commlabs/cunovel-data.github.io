But I know they’re worried about my stupid bet. One black fucking night, I bet all my cash and savings on my win this year. Pete and Riley are worrying about it, especially Pete, who’s in charge of the finances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You. And your money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at her. “I’m going to win. I always do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips form a small smile too, and my mouth is drawn to that mouth of hers that tastes like peaches dipped in sugar. My blood heats when I notice how swollen and red her lips are from all our kissing, and the need to take that mouth in mine runs through me when she shudders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, she knows what I’m thinking about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear I don’t even want to be here today. Only because of her did I manage to get out of my suite today and into this plane. But I don’t feel like doing anything except her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to run today? To get ready for tomorrow?” she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re tired?” she prods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, I whisper, “So fucking tired I could barely pull myself out of bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she nods that dark, little head of hers in understanding, all the heaviness in my chest lifts for a moment, and she’s like a little sun in all my gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leans back on the seat, her shoulder up against mine, and she looks so badly slept because of me, I slide myself lower on the seat so my shoulder is close to where her head is. And she can rest it on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuietly, I pass her my iPod so she can hear Norah Jones’s “Come Away with Me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listens while lazily leaning her head on me, and I duck my head to try to listen with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerking as if she’s just thought of something, she grabs her iPod, finds a song, and passes it to me. Then the Gym Class Heroes’ song “The Fighter” begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes are glued to my profile as I listen, and if I’ve kissed her for four fucking days straight and she’s playing me a song about fighting, I’m fucking not doing something right. “You play me a song about a fighter?” I ask her in disbelief and annoyance at myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI toss her iPod aside with a scowl and then grab her by the hips and lift her onto my lap, hearing her breath catch when my erection bites into her juicy, little bottom. Bending my head down, I place my lips close to her ear. “Give me another one,” I demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shudders, and suddenly she starts shaking her head. “We can’t keep doing what we’re doing, Remy. You need your sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper. “Give me another song, Brooke.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart kicks when she obeys me and reaches for her iPod, and I feel like I’m finally getting a bone today. Taking it from her, I click PLAY and listen intently when the familiar song of “Iris” begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, this woman kills me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my head to meet her gaze while my heart beats fast and hard in my lap and in my chest. “Ditto,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe team up in the seating area is quiet, but they’re not looking at her and me. I slide my fingers in her hair and draw her head down so I can hungrily drag my lips along the seam of her lips. “To every lyric.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls back from me with a shudder that clearly tells me she doesn’t want to. “Remy . . . I’ve never had an affair before. I just won’t share you. You can’t be with anyone else while you’re with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I’m so wild about her, I can’t even think of anything else anymore. Dragging my thumb along the lower lip I just licked, I look into those golden eyes that seem both pleading and demanding of me and tell her, “We won’t be having an affair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t react for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so hungry for more of our kissing sessions that I crush her against me and trace my nose with the shell of her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I take you, you’ll be mine,” I promise her, trailing my thumb along her jaw as I gently kiss her earlobe. “You need to be certain.” Her gaze latches onto mine as I warn her, “I want you to know me first, and then, I want you to let me know if you still want me to take you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I already know I want you,” she protests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch her mouth as it moves, telling me she wants me, and the thought of her not knowing what she’s talking about feels like a wrench in my chest. Slowly, I stroke my hand down her bare arm, my voice thick and tormented. “Brooke, I need you to know who I am. What I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve had tons of women without this requisite,” she says pleadingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI engulf her ass in my hands and drag her deeper into my lap, memorizing the way she looks right now as I look into her eyes and will her to understand me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is my requisite with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes darken with pain, and she leans close to me and whispers, “We still can’t keep this up, Remy. Not when your championship is on the line. So you either come get me tonight to make love to me, or you leave me alone so we can both rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment I’m not sure I heard right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s telling me I can’t kiss my mouth . . . my woman . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s telling me I either fuck her and take her all, or I take nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she were any other woman in the world, I’d have fucked her the night I met her. Maybe I’d have fucked her another time. Then I’d have forgotten her. But she is Brooke Dumas and I am not messing it up with her if it kills me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” I say, smiling like I don’t feel as if I’d just swallowed down my own cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, I can’t have her on my lap. Her bottom lush and juicy and mine—but unavailable. Fuck me. Setting her aside, I reach for my iPod and look for something. Metallica. Marilyn Manson. Something crazy that will shut the fuck up all the protests sputtering in my head and the sensation in my chest of having lost some unknown battle before I even fought it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePAST\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOS ANGELES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI booked a suite for Brooke and Diane, and one of the ladies doesn’t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lady, to be exact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was caked with sweat and still panting from my workout when she massaged the back of my neck, leaning close enough to whisper in my ear, “Mind telling me why Diane and I are together in a suite, Remy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned my neck to one side, then the other, her fingers light on my jaw, but I still refused to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t do this, Remington.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting back a laugh, I turned and touched two fingers to her lips, holding her gaze for a long heartbeat. “Stop me. I dare you,” I told her, then I grabbed my towel and walked away to my suite to drown all my frustrations in a cold shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I’m in the LA Underground locker rooms, sitting on a bench at the end while Coach wraps my hands, some song in my ears, when I see Pete in my peripherals wave someone over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see Brooke heading over to me, at Pete’s insistence, and I immediately hook my finger on my headphone cord and pull them down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke holds my gaze as she quietly leans over and pauses my iPod, then she walks behind me to seize my shoulders and starts working on my knots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant I feel her fingers on my bare flesh, I groan and feel my body both tense with arousal and relax from the knowledge she’s with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven’t kissed her in what feels like a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss her in my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss the way she moans and the way her soft, silky mouth swells under mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss her touch; I want it badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Deeper,” I command her, and she goes in deeper with her fingers, using her thumb to roll over one of the larger knots. Relaxing my neck, I let my head hang and drag in a deep breath as she presses down until the knot disintegrates, and I groan from the pleasure of feeling the heat spread into my tissue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good luck,” she whispers into my ear before she draws back, and my skin feels taut as a drum cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand and look at her, and I don’t know why she’s so determined to make me fuck her that she keeps her kisses away from me until I do, but I’m going to make her cave in to me before I cave in to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not fucking her yet, no matter how ready I am to kill for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not touching that sweet pussy until it’s ready to be taken home—permanently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind me, Riley comes with my robe, and I spread out my arms and ram them into the sleeves while I keep my eyes on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Riptide!” I hear the call, and I bounce in place for a second, then trot out into the arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take my ring like I always do, but tonight’s not a normal one. Tonight, I fight—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Benny, the Black Scoooooorpion!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see him charge out of the walkway on the other side. That ugly black tat on his face, he storms out to the general booing of the crowd, but grins nevertheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembering the club incident, where he dared speak of my girl’s pussy, I remind myself I owe him a beating. The moment he takes the ring, he comes up to center, and so do I, fixing my gaze on his yellow eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis rage and my rage combine to create a powerful effect on the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fucking pussy needs a woman to defend him now?” he says, spitting on the mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh softly. “The bad news is, not even a woman can defend you from me now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tap knuckles, and the fighting bell rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe wait it out, both of us inspecting the other, and I want my little firecracker to see this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want her to see me beat the living daylights out of this dipshit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlicking my eyes to the side, I notice Brooke’s chair is empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScowling, I scan the arena and duck when Scorpion swings, then I come back and punch him, fast and hard, on the jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s calling out to a girl heading to the exit with one of Scorpion’s minions, while another of those motherfuckers holds her—Brooke—by the arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy blood runs cold, then hot in fury. I slam my fist into Scorpion’s jaw, shove him aside, grab the nearest rope and leap out of the ring onto the cement floor, leaving Scorpion spitting blood on the mat. The arena erupts with shouts and screams and the announcer yells through the speakers, “The victor, Scorpion! Scooooooorpiooooooon! Remington Tate has been disqualified from this round! Dis-qualified!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach Brooke as she struggles to break free, and she looks tiny and feisty in that motherfucker’s grip, making me livid. I grab the hands on her arms and thrust them back, delivering him a look that promises he will die because of me, then I yank her into my arms and forget about everything but that she’s safely nestled against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she fights me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. No! Remy, let me go, I need to follow her.” She twists in my grip and lightly hits my pecs, her expression twisting in pain. “Let go, Remy, let go, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clench her tighter against me and walk her to the exit, because I don’t think she realizes what’s going on. “Not now, Little Firecracker,” I softly warn her. She stops squirming and peeks over my arm at the angry faces of some of Riptide’s fans, and I use my shoulders to shove through the crowd as they start getting vicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bitch. It’s your fault, you stupid bitch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widen in horror as the crowd starts clawing angrily into the air, then she curls into me and lets me guide her out to the car. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/remy-real-3/page-14.html","bookId":2738,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:37:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:37:43 PM"}
