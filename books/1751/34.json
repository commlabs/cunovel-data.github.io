It emerged into the glitter of the great star cluster of Hercules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt poised gingerly in space, surrounded by suns and suns and suns, each centering a gravitational field that wrenched at the little bubble of metal. But the ship\u0027s computers had done well and it had pin-pricked squarely into position. It was within a day\u0027s journey-ordinary space-drive journey-of the Lagrange System.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis fact had varying significance, to the different men aboard ship. To the crew, it was another day\u0027s work and another day\u0027s flight pay and then shore rest. The planet for which they were aiming was uninhabited, but shore rest could be a pleasant interlude even on an asteroid. They did not trouble themselves concerning a possible difference of opinion among the passengers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crew, in fact, were rather contemptuous of the passengers, and avoided them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEggheads!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so they were, every one of them but one. Scientists, in politer terms-and a heterogeneous lot. Their nearest approach to a common emotion at that moment was a final anxiety for their instruments, a vague desire for a last check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd perhaps just a small increase of tension and anxiety. It was an uninhabited planet. Each had expressed himself as firmly of that belief a number of times. Still, each man\u0027s thoughts are his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the one unusual man on board ship-not a crewman and not really a scientist-his strongest feeling was one of bone-weariness. He stirred to his feet weakly and fought off the last dregs of space-sickness. He was Mark Annuncio, and he had been in bed now for four days, feeding on almost nothing, while the ship wove in and out of the Universe, jumping its light-years of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now he felt less certain of imminent death and he had to answer the summons of the Captain. In his inarticulate way, Mark resented that summons. He was used to having his own way, seeing what he felt like seeing. Who was the Captain to-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impulse kept returning to tell Dr. Sheffield about this and let it rest there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mark was curious, so he knew he would have to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was his one great vice. Curiosity!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also happened to be his profession and his mission in life. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-34.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
