{"id":93896,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003eLike a bedroom from one of those abandoned buildings you see on the news. Across one wall the words\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"NO FEAR\" were spray-painted. Spray-painted. Most of the curtains were down and one of the windows in the alcove was broken. There was a large hole in the plaster of one wall and another in the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the room was filthy. It wasn\u0027t just the motorcycle helmet and the traffic cones on the floor, or the stray bits of clothing draped over every piece of furniture, or the cups overflowing with cigarette butts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were cookie crumbs and ashes and potato chips mashed into the carpet, and mud on almost everything. Kaitlyn marveled at how they\u0027d managed to get it so dirty in such a short time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boy wearing only boxer shorts was standing up. He was big and lanky, with hair so short it was almost nonexistent, and dark, evil, knowing eyes. A skinhead? Kaitlyn wondered. He looked like the kind of guy you would hire as an assassin, and his mind felt like the red-haired man\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jackal Mac,\" Lydia whispered. \"His real name\u0027s John MacCorkendale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackal eyes, Kaitlyn thought. That\u0027s it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other boy was younger, Kaitlyn\u0027s age. He had skin the color of creamed coffee and a little, lean, quick body. His face was narrow, his features clean and sharp. The glasses perched on his nose did nothing to make him look less tough. A smart kid gone bad, Kait thought. The brains of the operation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t get a clear feeling about his mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Paul Renfrew, Renny,\" Lydia whispered- and ducked. Jackal Mac had thrown a size twelve combat boot at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn ducked, too. Then she stood frozen as the huge guy rushed toward them, all arms and legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here? What do you want?\" he snarled, right in Kaitlyn\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Lord, she thought. His tongue is pierced. It was, with what looked like a metal bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRenny had come, too, light as a sparrow, his eyes merry and malicious. He circled Kaitlyn, picked up a strand of her hair by the ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch! That burns!\" he said. \"But the curves are okay.\" He smoothed a hand over Kait\u0027s behind. \"I like her better in the flesh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn reacted without thinking. She whirled around and her hand made sharp contact with Renny\u0027s cheek. It knocked his glasses askew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t ever do that,\" she said through her teeth. It brought back every moment of loathing she\u0027d ever felt for a boy. Boys, with their big meaty hands and their big sloppy grins . . . she pulled her arm back in preparation for another slap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackal Mac caught her wrist from behind. \"Hey, she fights! I like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn jerked her hand out of his grasp. \"You haven\u0027t seen anything yet,\" she told them, and gave her best wolfish grin. It wasn\u0027t acting. This was genuine, from the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both laughed, although Renny was rubbing his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn turned on her heel. \"Come on, Lydia. Let\u0027s meet the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia had been crouching by the stairway. Now she straightened up slightly and hurried toward the second door Joyce had shouted at. It was the room Rob and Lewis had shared in the old days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was ajar; Lydia pushed it open. Kaitlyn braced herself for more destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t disappointed. Once again the curtains were down, although here they\u0027d been replaced by black sheets. There was a black candle burning on the dresser, dripping wax, and an upside-down pentagram scrawled on the mirror in lipstick. Glamour magazines lay open on the floor, and there was the inevitable scattering of clothing and garbage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a girl on each of the twin beds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laurie Frost,\" Lydia said. She didn\u0027t seem quite so afraid of the girls. \"Frost, this is Kaitlyn-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know her,\" the girl said sharply, sitting up. She had blond hair even lighter than Joyce\u0027s, and much messier. Her face was beautiful, although the permanently flared nostrils gave it a look of perpetual disdain. She was wearing a red lace teddy and as she raised a hand to flick hair out of her eyes Kaitlyn saw that she had long silvery nails. They were pierced with tiny rings like earrings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s one of them. The ones who ran away,\" Frost said in a menacing hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, yeah,\" the other girl said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need for Lydia to introduce her. Kaitlyn recognized her from a picture on a file folder in Mr. Z\u0027s office. Except that the picture had been of a pretty, wholesome girl with dark hair and a vivid face. Now she was still pretty-in a bizarre way. There were streaks of cerulean blue in her hair, and black smudges of makeup surrounding her eyes. Her face was hard, her jaw belligerent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSabrina Jessica Gallo, Kaitlyn thought. We meet at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you, too,\" Kaitlyn said. She kept her voice cool and returned Bri\u0027s stare boldly. \"And I\u0027m not running away now. I came back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBri and Frost looked at each other, then back at Kait. They burst into nasty laughter, Bri barking, Frost tittering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right back into the mousetrap,\" Frost said, flicking her long, silvery nails. \"It\u0027s Kaitlyn, right? What do they call you, Kaitlyn? Kaitykins? Kitty? Kit Cat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBri took it up. \"Kit Kat? Pretty Kitty? Pretty Pretty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dissolved into laughter again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to make the Kitty Kat welcome,\" Frost said. Her wide, pale blue eyes were spiteful but slightly unfocused. Kaitlyn wondered if she were hung over from something-or maybe that was just the way these people were. The Fellowship had sensed insanity in them, and what Kaitlyn sensed now was that each of them was a little bit off Aggressive, malicious-but not very focused. As if there were an inner fogginess in each of them. They weren\u0027t even properly suspicious; they weren\u0027t asking the right questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Kait wasn\u0027t sure what to do with them while they were pointing and giggling at her like kindergartners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sabrina and Frost, I said now!\" Joyce\u0027s voice came from the corridor, cracking like a whip. The girls kept giggling. Joyce pushed past Kaitlyn like a blond meteor and began yelling at them, picking clothes up off the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn shook her head, putting on an expression of genteel astonishment for Joyce\u0027s benefit. Then she turned to Lydia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ve seen enough,\" she said, and made an exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later Joyce came into Lydia\u0027s room. Her sleek hair was ruffled and she was flushed, but her aquamarine eyes were still hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can stay in this room today,\" she said to Kaitlyn. \"I don\u0027t want you going downstairs while I\u0027m doing testing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine with me. I didn\u0027t get any sleep last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck napping,\" Joyce said grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in a surprisingly short time, the upper floor was still. Lydia, Renny, and Bri had departed for school; Jackal Mac and Frost were presumably being tested. Gabriel\u0027s door was locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn lay down on her old familiar bed-and realized how tired she really was. She felt wrung out, drained not only of energy, but of emotion. She\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emeant to lie awake and make a plan, but she fell asleep almost instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke a long time later. Warm, diffuse afternoon light filled the room. Silence filled her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up and grabbed for the headboard as a wave of giddiness swept her. Breathing slowly, she held her head down until she felt steadier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she crept in stocking feet to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill silence. She went to the stairway and turned her head, ear pointed downstairs. No sound. She descended quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Joyce saw her, she\u0027d say she was hungry, and when was dinnertime anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Joyce didn\u0027t appear. The lower floor seemed deserted. Kaitlyn was alone in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, don\u0027t panic. This is terrific, the perfect opportunity. What do you want to look at first?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were a big ugly crystal, where would I be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne obvious place was the secret room in the basement. But Kaitlyn couldn\u0027t get in that; Lewis had always used PK to find the hidden spring in the panel. Another place was in Mr. Z\u0027s house in San Francisco, where he\u0027d kept it before. But Kaitlyn couldn\u0027t do anything about that today. Sometime she\u0027d have to find a way to get to San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now . . . well, Joyce hadn\u0027t wanted her to see the testing. So Kait would start with the labs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front lab was as she remembered it, weird machines, a folding screen with seashells appliquéd on it, chairs and couches, bookcases, a stereo. There was no graffiti. Kaitlyn looked briefly into each of the study carrels that lined the walls, but she knew already that the crystal could never fit into something so small. She found only more equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder what their powers are? she thought, envisioning each of the students she\u0027d met. I forgot to ask Lydia. Gabriel said something about Frost being clairvoyant, but the others-I\u0027ll bet they do something bizarre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to the back lab ... and found it locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAha!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had never been locked before. Kaitlyn found it extremely suspicious that it should be locked now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her jubilation changed to despair a minute later as she realized a basic truth. If it was locked, she couldn\u0027t get in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut wait, wait. Joyce had always kept a house key on top of the bulletin board in the kitchen, for anybody to grab when they were leaving the house. Sometimes people had the same locks on the inside doors of a house as the outside. If that key were still there ... and if it fit...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a moment she was in the quiet, darkening kitchen, fingers searching anxiously on the top of the bulletin board\u0027s frame. She found some dust, a dead fly ... and a key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEureka! Praying all the way, Kaitlyn hurried back to the lab. She held key to lock, almost dropping it in her nervousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s got to work, it\u0027s got to work. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key slipped in. It fit! She waggled it. It turned!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorknob turned, too. Kait pushed and the door was open. She stepped in and shut the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back lab was dim-it had been a garage and had only a small window. Kaitlyn blinked, trying to make out shapes. She didn\u0027t dare turn on a light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were bookcases here, too, and more equipment. And a steel room like a bank vault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Faraday cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn remembered Joyce telling her about it. It was for complete isolation in testing. Soundproof, electronically shielded. They had put Gabriel in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait remembered herself begging Joyce to promise she\u0027d never have to go in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth was dry. She tried to swallow, but her throat seemed to stick together. She walked toward the gray bulk of the steel vault, one hand lifted as if she were blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCool metal met her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were a crystal, I\u0027d be somewhere like this. Shielded, enclosed. With enough room for everybody to get in and crowd around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn\u0027s fingers slid over the metal. Her former tranquility in the face of danger was gone, and her heart wasn\u0027t just pounding, it was thundering. If the crystal was really in there, she had to see it. But she didn\u0027t really want to see it-and to be alone with that obscene thing ... in the dark. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn\u0027s skin was crawling and her knees felt unsteady. But her fingers kept searching. She found something like a handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can do it. You can do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, she thought the sound she heard was the vault door clicking. Then she realized it was somebody opening the lab door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does a spy do when she\u0027s caught?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait\u0027s stomach plummeted. She recognized the voice, even before she whirled around to see the figure silhouetted in the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight shone behind him. Broad shoulders, then body lines that swept straight down. A man wearing a greatcoat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you finding anything to interest you?\" Mr. Zetes asked, his gold-headed cane swinging in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God. The buzzing was back in Kaitlyn\u0027s ears and she couldn\u0027t answer. Couldn\u0027t move, either, although her heart was shaking her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to see what\u0027s inside there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay something, idiot. Say anything, anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dry lips moved. \"I-no. I-I was just-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Zetes stepped forward, snapped on the overhead light. \"Go on, take a closer look,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Kaitlyn couldn\u0027t look away from his face. The first time she\u0027d seen this man, she\u0027d thought him courtly and aristocratic. His white hair, aquiline nose, and piercing dark eyes made him look like some English earl. And if an occasional grim smile flashed across his face, she was sure that he had a heart of gold underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d found out differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, his eyes held her with an almost hypnotic power. Boring into her mind, gnawing. He looked more telepathic than Gabriel. His measured, imperious voice seemed to resound in her blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you want to see it,\" he said, and Kaitlyn\u0027s throat closed on her protests. He advanced on her slowly and steadily. \"Look at it, Kaitlyn. It\u0027s a very sturdy Faraday cage. Look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst her will, Kaitlyn\u0027s head turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s natural that you would be interested in it- and in what\u0027s inside. Have you seen that yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn shook her head. Now that she wasn\u0027t looking into those eyes, she found she could speak-a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Zetes-I wasn\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joyce told me that you had come back to join us.\" Mr. Z\u0027s voice was rhythmic . . . almost soothing. \"I was very pleased. You have great talents, you know, Kaitlyn. And a keen, inquiring mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke he unlocked the vault with a key, grasped the handle. Kaitlyn was speechless again with fear. Please, she was thinking. Please, I don\u0027t want to see, just let me go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now your curiosity can be satisfied. Go in, Kaitlyn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the steel door open. There was a single lamp inside, the battery-driven kind that clamps on walls. It gave enough light for Kaitlyn to see the object below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the crystal. A sort of tank, made of dark metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBewildered, forgetting herself, Kaitlyn took a step forward. The tank was almost like a Dumpster trash can, except that instead of being rectangular it had one side which slanted steeply. A door was set in that steeply slanting side. It looked like the door to a hurricane cellar, leading down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were all sorts of pipes, cables, and hoses attached to the tank. One machine beside it looked like the electroencephalograph Joyce had used to measure Kaitlyn\u0027s brain waves. There were other machines Kaitlyn didn\u0027t recognize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tank itself felt like a giant economy-size coffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What ... is it?\" Kaitlyn whispered. Dread was clogging her chest like ice. The thing gave off an aura of pure evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a piece of testing equipment, my dear,\" Mr. Zetes said. \"It\u0027s called an isolation tank. The ultimate Ganzfeld cocoon. Put a subject inside, and she is surrounded by perfect darkness and perfect silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo light or sound can penetrate. It\u0027s filled with water, so she can\u0027t feel the effects of gravity or her own body. There is no sensory stimulation of any kind. Under those conditions, a person-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould go insane, Kaitlyn thought. She recoiled from the tank violently, turning away. Just the idea of it, to be abandoned in utter darkness and silence, was making her physically sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Z\u0027s hand caught her, holding her lightly but firmly. \"Would be undistracted by outside influences, free to extend her psychic powers to the fullest. Just as you did when Joyce blindfolded you, my dear. Do you remember that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had turned to look at her, holding her terrified gaze with his. She hadn\u0027t missed his use of personal pronouns. Put a subject inside and she can\u0027t feel her own body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I said earlier, you have very great talents, Kaitlyn. Which I would like to see developed to their fullest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pulling her toward the tank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she couldn\u0027t resist. That measured voice, that precise grip . . . she had no will of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you heard of the Greek concept of arete, my dear?\" He had put aside his cane and was opening the hurricane-cellar door. \"Self-actualization, becoming all you can be.\" He was pushing her toward the open door. \"What do you think you can be, Kaitlyn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black hole gaped in front of her. Kaitlyn was going into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Zetes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was thin and distant in Kaitlyn\u0027s ears. All she could see was the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Zetes, I didn\u0027t realize you were here. What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pressure on Kait\u0027s neck eased and she could move of her own volition again. She turned and saw Joyce in the doorway. Gabriel and Lydia were behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Kaitlyn simply stood, blinking and trying to breathe. Mr. Z was going over to Joyce, talking to her in an undertone. Kaitlyn saw Joyce look up at her in surprise, then shake her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, but there\u0027s no help for it,\" Mr. Z said, with mild regret, as if saying \"I\u0027m sorry, but we\u0027ll have to cut expenses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s talking about my imminent demise, Kaitlyn realized, and suddenly she was talking, gabbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joyce, I\u0027m sorry.
