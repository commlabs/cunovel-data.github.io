No one makes fun of McDermott\u0027s revelatory statement or of his inability to react more aggressively with this chick. No one says anything but we are all thinking the same thought: Never pick up a Vassar girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you need is a chick from Camden,\" Van Patten says, after recovering from McDermott\u0027s statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh great,\" I say. \"Some chick who thinks it\u0027s okay to f**k her brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but they think AIDS is a new band from England,\" Price points out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s dinner?\" Van Patten asks, absently studying the question scrawled on his napkin. \"Where the f**k are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really funny that girls think guys are concerned with that, with diseases and stuff,\" Van Patten says, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not gonna wear a f**king condom,\" McDermott announces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have read this article I\u0027ve Xeroxed,\" Van Patten says, \"and it says our chances of catching that are like zero zero zero zero point half a decimal percentage or something, and this no matter what kind of scumbag, slutbucket, horndog chick we end up boffing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys just cannot get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, not white guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This girl was wearing a f**king glove?\" Price asks, still shocked. \"A glove?
