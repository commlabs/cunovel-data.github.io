His valet took one look at him and quickly tossed a towel over a footstool, so that Simon could sit and remove his boots. Then the servant excused himself to arrange a bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is more?” Eddington asked, wide-eyed. The elegantly tall earl moved to one of the wingbacks in front of the grate and smiled at the pretty maid who was stoking the fire into a hearty, welcoming blaze. She flushed prettily and bobbed a quick curtsy before retreating, leaving the two men alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mademoiselle Rousseau attempted to seduce me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Attempted?” There was laughter in the earl’s voice and Simon glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yesterday morning she was set on luring Mr. James to an ignoble end, and last night James and Desjardins were working in tandem while she was after me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Interesting,” the earl murmured. “What are your thoughts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArching a brow, Simon stood to remove his waistcoat and shirtsleeves. “My thoughts are that you will return my coin to me whether I complete the task agreed to or not. If they have set me as a target, our agreement will not be forfeit nor substituted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What leverage do you have to enforce this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon raised his fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddington shuddered. “Point taken.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Simon’s pugilistic expertise that had first caught the earl’s attention. Simon had taken down nearly a dozen men with only minor bruising to show for his efforts, and Eddington had immediately decided that he could use a man of such talent. Since Simon’s position as Lady Winter’s paramour was eliminated by her marriage, he gratefully accepted the employment. In short order, Simon proved he was as agile of mind as he was on his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think they mean to implicate you?” Eddington asked thoughtfully. “If you were accused of crimes against Franklin and your work for the English Crown was to become known, it would increase the animosity toward England with both the French and the Revolutionaries.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is certainly possible,” Simon agreed, pulling his shirt over his head and reaching for the fastenings of his breeches. “There were other oddities last night. While Desjardins and James were occupied with each other, Lysette waited with two other females.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who were they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not certain. Truly, I did not pay much attention to either of them, other than that they surrounded her as mother hens would. Lysette is not the type of woman that other women like. I know you collect what I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Curious.” Eddington set his elbows on the armrests and brought his steepled fingertips to his lips. “What do you intend to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am going to bathe, then sleep.” Simon moved toward the bathing chamber, where the splashing of water told him the tub was being readied. “After that, I will visit Mademoiselle Rousseau and ask her outright.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think she will tell you?” the earl called after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. But at least she will know that I am not ignorant of something being amiss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might wish to enlist aid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I might,” Simon said evasively, having already planned to do just that. However, that was not information he wished to share with the earl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will see to it,” Eddington offered. “I have asked Becking to remain in France while I am here. Might as well put him to good use.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent, my lord.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward awoke due to a ferocious spate of coughing. He sat up from his reclined position in a chair and glanced around the room, briefly surprised to find himself still in Corinne’s house. The last thing he remembered was listening to the physician’s orders to keep her cool if she turned feverish and to suction out her mouth and nose at regular intervals so that she could breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the clock on the mantel. It was shortly after nine in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing to his feet, Edward stretched muscles cramped by hours spent sleeping in a wingback. He was late for work, something he had never been in the entirety of his life. He needed to return home immediately, where he could draft a note to Franklin in explanation, bathe, and prepare for the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing quickly around the room for any of his belongings, Edward then moved to the door that separated the private sitting room he occupied from Corinne’s bedchamber. He knocked lightly, waited for an acknowledgment that did not come, and opened the door regardless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the sitting room was decorated in a mixture of various shades of cream and brown with stained wood molding and furnishings, the bedroom was far more feminine with its palette of pale pinks and burgundy with whitewashed wood and gilt. But both rooms were permeated with the soft floral scent that belonged to Corinne alone. It was innocent, not seductive, yet he was drawn to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he stepped deeper into the space, Edward’s gaze locked on the tiny form in the middle of the large four-poster bed. Her chest rose and fell in rapid, shallow breaths and black mucus bubbled from her nostrils. Furious, he rounded the chair where the housekeeper sat, intent on a scolding, and found the elderly woman sleeping and completely oblivious to the needs of her employer. The woman’s lace-fringed cap was askew and covering her lined brow, allowing messy gray curls to peek out from the left side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowling his frustration, Edward approached the bed and managed the onerous task of suctioning Corinne’s airways, inwardly thinking that he’d never been a nursemaid in his life. Even when he was the patient, he did not nurse himself to health. He hadn’t the time or funds to do more than work through whatever illness affected him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had finished, Edward dipped a clean cloth into the bowl of water on the nightstand and wiped it gently over Corinne’s pale face, admiring how beautiful she was even when afflicted. Her brows were perfectly arched, her mouth lushly curved, her cheekbones high and elegant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt pained him to see her so helpless and he knew that her staff of three servants—housekeeper, butler, and their son, the footman—were not enough to provide the care Corinne needed. If he wanted her alive, which there was no doubt he did, he would have to care for her himself. He could not afford to supplement her staff, even briefly, and he did not understand the nature of Comte Desjardins’s relationship with her enough to ask for assistance. It was also not his place to speak on Corinne’s behalf. They were strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn you,” he whispered, agitated by the complication she presented. A frown marred her brow in response to his gruff tone and he touched the line with the pad of his thumb, smoothing it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward sighed and left the room, taking the stairs to the main floor and searching out the kitchen. There, he found the butler and footman dealing with a driver making deliveries at the service door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. James,” the butler said, bowing. It was a lame bow, the man’s old frame twisted by what Edward suspected was arthritic pain. He doubted they would be able to manage the household, small as it was, without the assistance of their strapping son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Madame Fouche is sleeping upstairs,” Edward replied in a curt tone. “I saw to Mademoiselle Marchant myself, but she will need to be watched by someone awake and the orders of the physician followed every half hour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, of course.” The servant had the grace to flush, but not the sense to admit that he needed help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you can tend to her during the day, I will return to see to her at night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir,” the butler began, straightening as best he could. “Your offer, while generous, is not necessary, I assure you. There is no need to trouble yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward smiled grimly. “I will return this evening. If you still feel the same, I will leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing the man could say to that beyond repetitious protestations, so he simply bowed his head again and shot a warning look at his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor his part, Edward strode from the room at his customary brisk pace and collected his jacket from the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the clock again on his way out and sighed. He hated to be late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe courtesan’s house was small but elegant and located in an area of the city where only the most successful purveyors of the trade could afford to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe procession of carriages and riders on the street was steady, though not heavy, so lengthy observance of any household would be noted in short order. Because of this, the upper-floor chambermaid was hard pressed to slip from Solange Tremblay’s home and reach the unmarked carriage across the road in a timely manner. It was not easy, not with the housekeeper forever scolding her to complete three chores at once. Still, she was nothing if not wily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping her head bent low, she walked a small distance up the street, then crossed it and backtracked to the nondescript black equipage. She paused outside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black curtains were closed, preventing her from seeing who spoke to her. Not that she cared what he looked like. His coin was good and that was all she needed to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They have made no plans to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something sinister in the tone used to say the two words. It made her shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gloved hand was extended and in its palm rested a small purse. She accepted it and dipped a quick curtsy, although she doubted he could see it. “Merci beaucoup, m’sieur.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt always paid to be polite to those who paid you. She might argue with the housekeeper, but she was nothing but smiles to Mademoiselle Tremblay. If she was released from her position due to insubordination, L’Esprit would have no further use for her and she would lose both wages at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began walking back the way she had come, her steps hurried in an effort to return to her station before her absence was noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eL’Esprit watched the woman until she disappeared through the side gate leading to the servants’ entrance. She did not look back at him, a tiny detail he appreciated. It was so hard to find good help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back against the squab and rapped on the roof. The coachman set the carriage into motion with a sharp whistle. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-tempt-me-georgian-4/page-19.html","bookId":2661,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:39 AM"}
