You said de name in your sleep. And since you\u0027re sleeping with me, I want to know who he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I dreamed Simon or not? I wasn\u0027t certain. If I had, was that good or bad? If I hadn\u0027t, what the hell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the window, but the handprint was gone. Had it ever been there in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam sounded as if he was speaking through clenched teeth. When my gaze returned to his, I saw that he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Simon\u0027s my husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flicker of violence passed over his face. \"You didn\u0027t think you should mention a husband? I might do a lot of things, but I try not to fuck another man\u0027s wife if I can help it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m not -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I mean we\u0027re not -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He isn\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam got out of the bed and crossed the floor so fast I barely had time to take a step back. When I did, I hit the wall. He grabbed me by the forearms and dragged me onto my toes. His grip hurt, but I was too bewildered to protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t what?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr at least I didn\u0027t think so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam released me as if I were a hot potato; I would have fallen if I hadn\u0027t had the wall to hold me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\" He shoved a hand through his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure if he was apologizing for Simon\u0027s death or for manhandling me, but I understood his anger. In fact, his fury at the idea I was married made me view him in a different light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam Ruelle hadn\u0027t seemed the type to respect marriage vows, to take to heart the myth of one man, one woman, forever. If I\u0027d been wrong about that, I\u0027d been wrong about him. Which only confused me more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" I said. \"Forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t forgotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still love him. I could tell by de way you said his name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to ask how he knew so much about love, but I didn\u0027t The conversation only emphasized that we were practically strangers, and I wanted to keep it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll always love Simon. Death can\u0027t change what I feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me so hard, I got the feeling he wanted to open my head and peek inside, find out what made me tick. \"How did he die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to talk about this, especially naked, so I yanked the sheet off the bed and headed for the bathroom. Adam caught the tail end and held on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dream of him,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t so sure it had been a dream, but I couldn\u0027t tell Adam I\u0027d seen my dead husband outside his window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw a wolf,\" I blurted instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dreams aren\u0027t real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t so sure anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There.\" I pointed. \"At the window. Big, black, with weird blue eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Adam hadn\u0027t been nude, I wouldn\u0027t have noticed him tense. His gaze nickered to the window and back. Nevertheless, I was distracted by the ripple of muscle beneath skin, the wave along his abdomen like a softly flowing river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no wolf, cher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the howls in the swamp? The deaths? The tracks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you keep denying even the possibility that there\u0027s a wolf or ten out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because there isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave a frustrated little shriek and resisted the urge to kick him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to prove it? Tonight I take you. I know this swamp like I know my own name. If there\u0027s anything here that doesn\u0027t belong I\u0027d have seen it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless he was hiding something, and I kind of thought that he was. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t go tripping off merrily into the swamp with him in the dark. I might never be heard from again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe safe, Simon had said. What had he meant?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the loup-garou? From my feelings? Or from Adam?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what choice did I have? If I was going to fulfill my vow, I needed help. And the only help available was the only man who\u0027d made me feel alive since my whole world died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife certainly was a vicious bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked as another thought occurred to me, one that made me dizzy with dismay. Cursing, I collapsed on the bed. \"I\u0027m no damn good at this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSex required responsibility. Protection. My celibate lifestyle had kept me free of disease. I was also free from birth control, being both a widow and an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bed dipped as Adam sat beside me. His hip brushed mine, but he touched me nowhere else, and for that I was grateful. When he touched me I couldn\u0027t think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re pretty good at this, if you\u0027re askin\u0027 me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" My mind wasn\u0027t keeping up very well with the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you were no damn good, but you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled before I could stop myself. \"Thanks. But I meant at technicalities.\" His blank stare made me continue. \"Protection. We didn\u0027t use any.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the understanding spread across his face. I waited for the horror, the panic, the escape, but it didn\u0027t come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanna ask me have I been with a lot of women?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. My lame-ass equivalent of \"Hell, yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once I fucked tike rabbit, my father said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How... flattering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thought so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow would be the time to ask about his father. Then again, what did it matter how, when, or why Ruelle Senior had died?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, I was lookin\u0027 for love. What\u0027s that song? In all de wrong places.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sadness on his face made me want to touch him, but I knew where that would lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those days are gone,\" he murmured. \"Love isn\u0027t for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam contemplated my face. \"You aren\u0027t lookin\u0027 for love. We both know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right, so I dipped my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you. Shouldn\u0027t, but can\u0027t seem to help myself. I see that red hair,\" He picked up a strand and rubbed it between his fingers. \"Smell your skin, stare into your pretty green eyes, and I lose my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing wanted for my body was something new, and I kind of liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since I left de army, there\u0027s been no one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one?\" I found that hard to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one,\" he insisted. \"And in de army, they tested us regular for every old thing. I came out clean, cher, and clean I still am. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quirked a brow and my face heated. I\u0027d never had a conversation like this before, although if I planned to spend the rest of my life alone, with the occasional lover to take off the edge, I\u0027d have to get used to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was never anyone but Simon,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words until you hung in the air unspoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam touched my hair again. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was everything, and when he died - \" My throat closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A part of you went with him,\" he finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t bother to answer. Couldn\u0027t, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not natural to be alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure you are. You\u0027ll fall in love again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t ever want to feel the way I felt when he died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you feel nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had my shot. Simon was it for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think you can love twice in one lifetime?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my head, looked him straight in the eye. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied me for a second to ascertain that I meant what I said. He must have seen that I did, because he gave a sharp nod, as if we\u0027d sealed a bargain. I guess we had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re like a wolf,\" he murmured, \"mating for life. If one dies, de other is forever alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know so much about wolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Common knowledge, no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, suspicious though I wasn\u0027t sure why. He was right. The whole mating-for-life thing was common knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" I muttered. I\u0027d had another cheery thought. \"There\u0027s more to be concerned about than STDs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I needed was a baby. I could barely take care of myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around the sparse bedroom. Adam wasn\u0027t doing much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, I wasn\u0027t crazy about kids. I didn\u0027t long to be a mother. Maybe this made me a freak of nature, but that\u0027s how I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was an only child. I\u0027d never played well with others. Without brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, I\u0027d had neither a reason nor an inclination to babysit Kids just made me twitchy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon and I had decided all we needed was each other. We\u0027d planned to travel the world, sleep in tents until we couldn\u0027t anymore, then retire. Besides, if I wasn\u0027t going to have Simon\u0027s child, I certainly wasn\u0027t going to have anyone else\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" Adam murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make sure we were talking about the same thing, I asked, \"Can\u0027t what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No kidding.\" I lowered my gaze to his lap. \"You aren\u0027t exactly equipped for the process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant I can\u0027t get you, or anyone else, pregnant\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure what to say. I could ask what was wrong with him, but since he hadn\u0027t offered to tell me... should I? What was the etiquette for something like this? I didn\u0027t have a clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam stood and turned away, as if the conversation upset him. Maybe he\u0027d been wounded, although I hadn\u0027t seen any scars and I\u0027d seen pretty much everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps, unlike me, he\u0027d wanted children one day. Learning he\u0027d never have them would hurt and might account for some of the sadness in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question was: Did I believe him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied Adam\u0027s tense shoulders. A better question might be: Why would he lie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I couldn\u0027t come up with an answer, I went to him and slid my arms around his waist. \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he said the word, with that French twist, always made him sound just a tad sarcastic, which was probably the whole idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For us, that\u0027s a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned in my arms, taking me into his. \"Whatever you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re having a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam tilted his head. \"A what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn affair sounded too long-term and old-fashioned, a fling too flippant for the intensity of what we\u0027d shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure,\" I said. \"But whatever it is, it\u0027s about sex, not love, or kids, or anything but the moment Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What man would say no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowering his head, he kissed me, putting all of himself into the embrace. Only later, when we were back in bed, my heart still pounding, my chest still heaving after another bout of exactly what I\u0027d wanted, did I consider his response. Or rather his lack of one. Adam had the habit of answering every one of my questions with a question of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that wasn\u0027t really an answer at all, was it? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-16.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
