There was nothing to fear from Uruth Sengar-she had been usurped by events. By her youngest son, by the other sons who then betrayed Rhulad. By the conquest itself. The society of Edur women was now scattered, torn apart; they went where their husbands were despatched; they had surrounded themselves in Letherii slaves, fawners and Indebted. They had ceased to care. In any case, Feather Witch had had enough of all that. She was in Letheras once more and like that fool, Udinaas, she was fleeing her bondage; and here, in the catacombs of the Old Palace, none would find her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld storage rooms were already well supplied, equipped a morsel at a time in the days before the long journey across the oceans. She had fresh water, wine and beer, dried fish and beef, fired clay jugs with preserved fruits. Bedding, spare clothes, and over a hundred scrolls stolen from the Imperial Library. Histories of the Nerek, the Tarthenal, the Fent and a host of even more obscure peoples the Letherii had devoured in the last seven or eight centuries-the Bratha, the Katter, the Dresh and the Shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here, beneath the Old Palace, Feather Witch had discovered chambers lined with shelves on which sat thousands of mouldering scrolls, crumbling clay tablets and worm-gnawed bound books. Of those she had examined, the faded script in most of them was written in an arcane style of Letherii that proved difficult to decipher, but she was learning, albeit slowly. A handful of old tomes, however, were penned in a language she had never seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe First Empire, whence this colony originally came all those centuries ago, seemed to be a complicated place, home to countless peoples each with their own languages and gods. For all the imperial claims to being the birth of human civilization, it was clear to Feather Witch that no such claim could be taken seriously. Perhaps the First Empire marked the initial nation consisting of more than a single city, probably born out of conquest, one city-state after another swallowed up by the rampaging founders. Yet even then, the fabled Seven Cities was an empire bordered by independent tribes and peoples, and there had been wars and then treaties. Some were broken, most were not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImperial ambitions had been stymied, and it was this fact that triggered the age of colonization to distant lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe First Empire had met foes who would not bend a knee. This was, for Feather Witch, the most important truth of all, one that had been conveniently and deliberately forgotten. She had gained strength from that, but such details were themselves but confirmation of discoveries she had already made-out in the vast world beyond. There had been clashes, fierce seafarers who took exception to a foreign fleet’s invading their waters. Letherii and Edur ships had gone down, figures amidst flotsam-filled waves, arms raised in hopeless supplication-the heave and swirl of sharks, dhenrabi and other mysterious predators of the deep-screams, piteous screams, they still echoed in her head, writhing at the pit of her stomach. Revulsion and glee both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storms that had battered the fleet, especially west of the Draconean Sea, had revealed the true immensity of natural power, its fickle thrashings that swallowed entire ships-there was delight in being so humbled, coming upon her with the weight of revelation. The Lether Empire was puny-like Uruth Sengar, it held to airs of greatness when it was but one more pathetic hovel of cowering mortals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would not regret destroying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuddled now in her favoured chamber, the ceiling overhead a cracked dome, its plaster paintings obscured by stains and mould, Feather Witch sat herself down cross-legged and drew out a small leather pouch. Within, her most precious possession. She could feel its modest length through the thin hide, the protuberances, the slightly ragged end, and, opposite, the curl of a nail that had continued growing. She wanted to draw it out, to touch once again its burnished skin-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Foolish little girl.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHissing, Feather Witch flinched back from the doorway. A twisted, malformed figure occupied the threshold-she had not seen it in a long time, had almost forgotten-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hannan Mosag. I do not answer to you. And if you think me weak-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh no,’ wheezed the Warlock King, ‘not that. I chose my word carefully when I said “foolish”. I know you have delved deep into your Letherii magic. You have gone far beyond casting those old, chipped tiles of long ago, haven’t you? Even Uruth has no inkling of your Cedance-you did well to disguise your learning. Yet, for all that, you are still a fool, dreaming of all that you might achieve-when in truth you are alone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you want? If the Emperor were to learn that you’re skulking around down here-’\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-89.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
