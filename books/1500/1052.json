The young lady was no longer crying, her face pressed tightly against Su’s ice-cold cheeks, eyes instead looking at the cavern walls. She seemed extremely calm, her gemstone-like pupils still like a great sea. Her seemingly weak body was currently surging with abundant energy. Energy was already no longer being poured into Su’s body, at this moment, she finally gave up all hope, and that was why she became calm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe young lady sat there, leaning against the mountain wall, her left arm hugging Su’s body, silvery-gray long hair hanging down, covering Su’s head and his face, as if shielding him from the cold. Meanwhile, her right hand was placed on the ground at her side, her small hand clenched into a fist, clenched so tight it was shaking slightly. The rock below her fist also trembled, moreover becoming increasingly intense.

Meanwhile, more and more cracks appeared, and then soon afterwards, the rock surface to the young lady’s right was completely covered in cracks.

The energy flowing out from the young lady’s body wrapped around the rocks, melted them, extracted the metal within them, and then added the residue back into the cracks. A moment later, a heavy sword’s core already appeared. It floated in the air, entirely blazing while still adjusting the sword body’s composition. From time to time, metal liquid would rip out, adding other components separately.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe instant the heavy sword was completed, the sword’s temperature suddenly decreased, gradually dropping by Madeline’s hand.

It was Snow. Madeline didn’t feel that Snow’s outer form was sinister and terrifying, instead sensing an indescribable beauty. Snow’s form was precisely a form that possessed the greatest survival strength in this world. That was why in the eyes of ultra life forms, Snow was almost perfect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eAs soon as Snow appeared, she no longer advanced, instead maintaining a completely cautionary stance, staring at Madeline. Meanwhile, the young lady’s hand was tightly gripping the heavy sword, also staring at Snow. Right now, the distance between the two ultra life forms really was exceedingly close, even if Snow’s currently power was far from matching Madeline’s, a sudden attack might bring the young lady serious injuries. Meanwhile, Snow’s situation was even more dangerous, if Madeline acted out, she didn’t even a chance of escaping. Her vigilance was instinctive, especially under this type of situation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eMadeline suddenly said, “Continue, tell me a bit more!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“What do you want me to say?\" Snow was at a loss. She didn\u0027t know what she should say at all, moreover already regretting approaching Madeline greatly, even though it was what her mother told her to do again and again. Resisting Serendela’s scouting already exhausted most of Snow’s mental strength, the dangers during this period of time even more so countless. She also finally found some time to relax with great difficulty, but as a result, as soon as she relaxed, she involuntarily appeared, and what was even more frightening was that she was this close to Madeline.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHowever, this ‘What do you want me to say?’ could already be considered saying something. Madeline’s ears trembled slightly, capturing all of the sound. Snow’s voice was a bit strange, but it was even more so deep and pleasant to the ear, the deep charm simply identical to Su’s. Moreover, from Snow’s body, Madeline could see many traits that were the same as Su’s, for example, a body that was close to perfect, and then for example, the signature energy fluctuations. What was even more annoying was that Snow was also releasing a faint smell of Su’s, it smelled extremely good, but practically only Madeline could sense it. Snow’s body functions were also extremely lively and vigorous, clearly within three years old. After associating all of these characteristics together, this actually successfully diverted the young lady’s attention away from Valhalla to Snow. However, even though she clearly knew that it was Snow who helped her evade Valhalla’s detection, Madeline couldn’t bring herself to like her at all, instead feeling a strange faint loathing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“This is the third one already!

His people had already all departed, so what was the point in bickering over these things? Moreover, apart from the first eight years, he never belonged to her. From a certain meaning, Snow was Su’s legacy in this world, but the young lady didn’t like this at all. There was only one reason, the other half wasn’t her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eMadeline’s hand slowly relaxed, the nervous Snow also loosening up, but she still didn’t show the slightest bit of carelessness, even more so not daring to approach Madeline.

Mama told me to find you all, and then bring some things to you all. Finding you all wasn’t difficult, because… because I can sense him.” Snow raised a blade, pointing towards Su. Madeline immediately felt an out of sorts feeling, but she forcefully suppressed it. Ultra life forms often had natural connections with their paternal bodies, the more powerful the ultra life forms, the more true this was. This wasn’t for the sake of protecting the young, but rather for allowing the paternal body to find and hunt them down. In the endless lives of ultra life forms, they might produced countless offspring, but the number of star domains that could provide for ultra life forms were just that many.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eMadeline asked with a frown, “Something your mother brought?

She also told me that your name is Madeline. She said that as long as I can find the paternal body, I will definitely find you. As for mama right now… right now… she is already gone.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe young lady’s mind suddenly trembled for no reason, instinctively recalling the sky shocking explosion that happened in Dragon City that day.

This was already no longer important, this was what the young lady thought. This was half guessing, half speculated after seeing the truth, but soon afterwards, she lost interest in this, even the trace of jealousy at the bottom of her heart disappearing without a trace. What was the meaning in thinking about these things? His body was still ice-cold. Moreover, the young lady thought, she also had him in a different method, wasn’t it so? In the final moments, when Su mistakened her for betraying and deceiving him, he still didn’t choose to harm her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSnow also quietly watched. From start until now, most of her eyes never left Su’s body. That was her paternal body, but what left her perplexed was why her powerful paternal body would become so cold, so deathly still. In her heart, there shouldn’t be any life forms that could threaten her paternal body, so what was going on? Would her paternal body die under those apostles’ hands? However, the young lady apostle didn’t make Snow feel that much fear, to the extent where her aura wasn’t even as terrifying as her mother’s during the final moment, even more so unable to compare to that woman bathed in flames. Was this the most powerful apostle? If this really was the case, then how did she harm the paternal body?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Mama brought something for you two.” When she saw the young lady who suddenly went quiet, Snow couldn’t help but remind her.
