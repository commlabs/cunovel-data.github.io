It\u0027s a nice room, with rugs in the middle of several couches and chairs. I look down to the end of the room at the bed and I gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe massive canopy is something from Jane\u0027s perverse games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit down on the chair and pick up a book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t turn the page. I sit there, waiting and refusing to look back at the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a knock at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Jane\u0027s girls opens it. She nearly shoves my girl into the room and curtsies, leaving the room quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy girl is wide-eyed and clutching the robe she is naked under.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"Go sit by the fire, warm up.\" I\u0027m so nervous I forget to use my stupid accent. I can\u0027t stop staring at her legs or the way her hair is dripping down her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate that I like the fact she\u0027s nearly naked and it\u0027s our first time being in a room together in a long time. I remember why I\u0027m here before I accidentally offer her tea, which I know she hates. I point at the fire, \"Go.\" My tone is harsh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe backs up, looking terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to the fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe backs up more and then around the furniture. She drops to her knees on the thick rug and sits back on her heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch her, panicking inside and trying not to just tell her who I am. I know she isn’t ready for that yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything you want to talk about?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gets brave with her look, \"He will come for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes me smile that she thinks I will save her. I nod, \"I\u0027m counting on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have business. Is it warm enough in here?\" I don’t want to talk about me, the me she doesn’t know exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks like she comes to terms with that. She adjusts too easily to bad things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you from Australia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I didn’t want you getting your hopes up, if you recognized me. I\u0027m good at accents.\" I quickly make something up. I sound like an idiot. Jane did that on purpose. I bet the stupid Australian thing never even came up in therapy, she just wanted me to look like an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s why you asked me to dance in the bar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I wanted to see if you were the mess the files said you were.\" That is almost true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks like she knows how much of a mess she is, and still, the comment breaks her heart. She gives me a devastating smile, \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t move until I remember the other thing Jane and I talked about privately, \"I have a second offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivers, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don’t want to hear it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closes her eyes and shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be willing to forgo the beating if you were nice to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d rather be beaten? Am I so repulsive?\" I don’t know how to feel about her hating me. \"You would still rather have a beating, than have Stuart beaten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and I die a little bit inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand and put a hand out, \"Okay then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives me the sweetest look I have ever seen. She bats her lashes and sticks her lip out. It melts me, but I know it\u0027s her survivor instincts. She\u0027s the best at it. That look isn’t for me, not really. \"Those long lashes and pretty blue eyes won\u0027t work on me. Come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitates, \"I\u0027m not coming with you. You\u0027re going to beat me either way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I am. But it will be much easier if you just come willingly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gets up slowly and comes to me. I don’t mean to do it, my body does it all on its own. She gets close and my hand stretches out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes twitch and I know she senses something about it is familiar. She puts her hand in mine. I wrap my hand around hers and pull her slowly down to the back of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slows as we near the bed, \"No. No. No. No. No. No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am about to grab her and drag her from the room, running with her over my shoulder to a motel where we could hide out, and I could try to explain. Instead, I turn and give her a fierce look, \"It will be much worse if I have to drag you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lets out a sob but I push her onto the bed, \"Remove the robe and scoot down to the bottom. Hang your feet down the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your name?\" she whispers, terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it matter?\" I ask, hating that I have to give her my real name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I need a name to hate you properly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart breaks, \"Just call me Eli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dies inside a little as she lets the robe slip from her shoulders and climbs onto the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move her onto the bed better and strap her feet into place with the ankle boards. Her thighs are parted slightly. I attempt to avoid the view of her naked body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grips the bedding, trembling with nerves as I hook the toe straps in and force her feet to flex. Some people love getting their feet paddled, I don’t think she will be one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mutter, afraid of my own voice, \"I don’t want to mar that skin. Not yet. I\u0027m going to start the film now. Please feel free to be extra loud. It\u0027s better for the footage. At anytime, you can ask me to stop. Stuart will be punished then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab the wooden bite and walk around to her face. I put the bite in but she spits it out right away. I lean in, whispering, \"Unless you want to bite your tongue, I suggest you keep that in.\" She shakes her head, but I push it between her lips, \"I will tie it on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moans and cries and I fight the fact I might accidentally enjoy this. The bite in her lips and ties on her body are making me uncomfortable, in a good way. I walk back to the end of the bed, pick up the paddle and take a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, my mind is transported to a bad place. Seeing her tied and gagged and spread for me has me breathing heavily. Fuck Jane. She did this on purpose. I know she is watching to see if I let her off with a few whacks or just end up losing my self-control altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI enjoy paddling things like feet, a lot, but I maintain my composure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at those beautiful runner\u0027s feet and take my first swing. The crack of the paddle against her skin and cry that leaves her gagged mouth, make me instantly hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate myself but I hit her again and fucking love it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screams and cries, but I can see what it\u0027s doing to her body. Her cries become moans and her slit dampens. Her pussy lips spread slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit her again. She doesn’t know she likes it. She\u0027s traumatized. I hit her again. I should be stopping, or lessening, but I can see she can take it. She tenses, expecting the next hit but I don’t deliver. She squirms slightly, still in a daze from the agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait until she is exhaling the tension and deliver the hardest one. She cries out and I orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate myself. I drop the paddle and leave her unconscious body on the bed, tied and exposed. I leave her, like I did to Stuart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twelve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecember 29th\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart hobbles out onto the rooftop. His face is swollen and his ankle appears sore. I grimace, \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"Got hit by a damned truck on the way over to get a sandwich. Hands are all cut up. I couldn’t see out of the eye that was swollen still from the fight and stepped off the curb. Needed a sandwich and some fresh air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince, \"You alright?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"No. Got a couple more broken ribs and shit. I am out. Dr. Bradley wants me gone, says I pushed it too far and now this. She is setting up a germ water thing. That asshole Mike is doing the water torture. Next feeding time they want me to talk to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down, \"I think this is a mistake.\" I don\u0027t want Mike to see her like being dominated. I\u0027m hoping Jane missed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seems like she\u0027s in good spirits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes, \"She is a master of finding coping mechanisms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gotta go back, it\u0027s time for me to talk to her through the hole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince, \"So water torture is happening after that then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"I just wanted to make sure you were okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and my words are low, nearly a whisper, \"Nothing about this is okay. I\u0027ll be the one torturing her though. I\u0027m the one who started this.\" I let him lean on me and lead him back to his cell. He\u0027s silent as he slips back into the spot where the hole is. I know that hole too well. The little girl who was kept during my breaking was in that room. I shudder and feel it all for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk into the room with the monitors. Jane gives me a satisfied smile. I feel my lip twitch with the sneer it wants to give her, but I don’t. I focus on the reason I exist. My girl is laughing to herself in the cell. She has lost it. I think she\u0027s ready. Seeing her that way, confirms it for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the monitor, Stuart slides closer to the hole with his face and whispers, \"Em.\" I hear a whisper. She doesn’t move. She ignores him. He whispers again, \"Em. Did they hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must have heard it. She moves her head around, confused maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Em. Over here.\" He waves his hand through the hole, not that it matters. She can\u0027t see him. She can hear him only. We can only see with the night vision cameras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me dude. Stu.\" His voice is less of a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moves in his direction, dragging her injured body. It makes me sick for a moment, and then I remember the glisten of wetness, and the fact I had to change my pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\" she calls into the darkness, totally lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand reaches into her cell, brushing against her. I see her respond nervously for a moment and then grip to him, like she did me once. I hate that he\u0027s touching her, soothing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your phone, Em?\" Stuart whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"I put it down in a parking lot. Are you okay? Are you badly hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head \"They said they want your phone. They need to reach him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sits silent for a second. I smirk as she shakes her head, \"That doesn’t make any sense. The man with the faux hawk—his name is Eli. Before he caught me, I texted for help. I think my text went to Eli, like the guy holding us hostage is your boss. I sent it and then heard it deliver at the same moment, to his phone when he was chasing me. I think your boss is Eli.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-14.html","bookId":1889,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM"}
