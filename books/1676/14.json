Six was talking smack, so I decided to put her in her place. Can’t you tell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remain upside down, hovering four feet over the pool’s center. I can feel Six’s grip around my right ankle, and the sensation is the same as if she were literally holding me up with one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, totally. Got her right where you want her,” Sam replies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was about to make my move, you know. Biding my time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what do you think, Sam?” Six asks. “Should I let him have it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile breaks across Sam’s face. “Take it away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” I say just before she lets go and I fall headfirst into the water. When I resurface, Six and Sam are laughing hysterically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was only round one,” I say, climbing out. I peel off my shirt and slap it to the concrete. “You caught me off guard. Just wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened to being tough and rugged?” Sam asks. “Isn’t that what you said when you buzzed your head?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Strategy,” I say. “I’m just giving Six a false sense of security, then when she gets comfortable I’m going to pull the rug out from under her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha! Yeah, right,” Sam says, then adds, “God, I wish I had Legacies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix stands between us in her solid black one-piece bathing suit. She’s still laughing, and water runs down her arms and legs as she leans slightly forward and twists her hair to ring it out. The scar on her leg is still discolored, but it isn’t nearly as purple as it was the week before. She whips her hair back over her head. Sam and I are both mesmerized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, training this afternoon then?” Six asks. “Or do you still feel like I might get hurt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI puff my cheeks and release the air slowly. “Maybe I’ll take it easy on you. I mean, that scar on your leg still looks kinda nasty. But, yeah, we’re on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sam, is that a yes for you, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guys want me to train? Seriously?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. You’re one of us now,” Six says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, rubbing his hands together. “I’m in,” he says, grinning like a kid on Christmas morning. “But if you just want me for target practice, I’m going home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe start at two o’clock, but by the look of the gloomy sky I don’t anticipate training for very long. Sam bounces on the balls of his feet, wearing gym shorts and an oversized tee. He’s all knees and elbows, but if heart and determination could be counted, I think he’d be nearly the size of the Mogadorian I’d seen aboard the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo start, Six shows us what she’s learned of combat techniques, which is far more than I know. Her body moves fluidly and with the precision of a machine when she throws a kick or punch, or when she does a back flip to evade an attack. She shows us how to counterassault and the merits of skill and coordination, and drills the same maneuvers until they come instinctively. Sam eats it up, even when Six pounds him backwards and he flips head over heels or has the wind knocked out of him. She does the same to me, and even though I try laughing it off like I’m playing around, I work my hardest and she still kicks the crap out of me. I can’t fathom how she learned all this on her own. After my mouth is filled with grass and dirt for the second time, I realize just how much she can teach me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain begins a half hour later. A light drizzle at first, but soon the skies open, sending us indoors for cover. Sam paces through the house throwing kicks and punches at phantom enemies. I sit in the chair, my fist around my blue pendant, and stare out the front window for a very long time, simply watching it all happen while remembering that the last two storms I saw both raged because Six told them to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turn back I see that she’s sound asleep in the corner of the living room, curled around Bernie Kosar, holding him in her arms like a pillow. It’s how she always sleeps, wrapping herself into a ball on her side, her features losing their sharp edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white bottoms of her feet are aimed right at me, and I use telekinesis to lightly tickle the bottom of her right foot. She twitches it as though shooing a pesky fly. I tickle her again. She twitches her foot a little harder. I wait a few seconds and then, as softly as I can, I tickle the length of her foot, from her heel up to her big toe. Six pulls her foot back and kicks her leg straight out, the telekinetic force of which sends me flying into the nearest wall, leaving a hole revealing the interior wires and studs. Sam charges into the room and jumps into the perfect fighting position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened? Who’s here?” he yells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand, rubbing my elbow, which took the brunt of the hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jerk,” Six says, sitting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam looks from me to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guys are ridiculous,” he says, retreating back to the kitchen. “Your flirting just scared the hell out of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scared the hell out of me, too,” I say, ignoring the flirting comment; but he’s already gone and doesn’t hear it. Am I flirting? Would Sarah think that was flirting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix yawns, raising her arms to the ceiling. “Still raining?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Totally, but look on the bright side; the weather saved you from any further bruises.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. “The tough-guy routine is pretty tired, Johnny. And don’t forget what I can do with the weather.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wouldn’t dream of it,” I say. I try to change the subject. I hate myself for flirting with another girl. “Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask you: who’s the face in the clouds? Every time you whip up a storm I see this crazy, ominous face.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scratches the bottom of her right foot. “I’m not sure, but ever since I’ve been able to mess with the weather, it’s always the same face that appears. I assume it’s Loric.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, probably. And here I thought it might be a crazy ex-boyfriend you’ve yet to get over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because obviously I have a weakness for ninety-year-old men. You know me so well, John.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. Both of us smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night I cook dinner on a rusty but serviceable grill left on the back patio. Or try to cook, I guess. Since I took home economics with Sarah in Paradise, I’m the only one who knows how to make anything remotely resembling a meal. Tonight: chicken breasts, potatoes, and a frozen pepperoni pizza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re sitting on the living-room carpet in a triangle. Under the blanket Six has draped over her head and body, she wears a black tank top, and her pendant hangs in full view. The sight of it returns my mind to the vision I had. I long for a normal dinner around a table and a normal night’s sleep where I’m not tortured by my Loric past. Was that what it was like on Lorien before we left?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think about your parents a lot?” I ask Six. “Back on Lorien, I mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not that much anymore. I can’t even tell you what they look like, really. I remember how it felt being near them, though, if that makes any sense. I think about that feeling quite a bit, I guess. What about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick at a burned slice of pizza. I resolve never to cook frozen pizza on the grill again. “I see them a lot in my dreams. Which is really great, but at the same time it tears me up inside. Reminds me that they’re dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blanket slides off the top of Six’s head and rests on her shoulders. “What about you, Sam? Do you miss your parents right now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam opens his mouth and closes it. I can tell he’s considering telling Six that he thinks his dad was taken by aliens, abducted when he went out for milk and bread. Finally he says, “I miss them both, my mom and dad, but I know that I’m better off here with you guys. Considering what I know about everything, I don’t think I could be at home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know too much,” I say. I feel guilty he’s eating my terrible meal on the floor of an abandoned house instead of feasting on his mother’s food at a dining-room table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sam, I’m sorry you got caught up in this with us,” Six says. “But it’s nice that you’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blushes. “I don’t know what it is, but I feel a weird connection to the whole situation. Can I ask you something? How far away is Mogadore from Earth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think back to when Henri blew on the seven glass orbs, how they came to life. Soon we were looking at a floating replica of our solar system. “It’s a lot closer than Lorien is, why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam stands. “How long would it take to get there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A few months maybe,” Six says. “Depends on what type of ship you’re flying and what type of energy it uses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking in circles, Sam says, “I think the U.S. government has to have a ship built somewhere that can handle that distance. I’m sure it’s a prototype and top secret and hidden under a mountain that’s hidden under another mountain, but I was just thinking about what would happen if we couldn’t find your ship and needed to take the fight to them—go to Mogadore. We have to have a Plan B, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. What’s Plan A again?” I ask, biting my tongue. I can’t fathom fighting the whole planet of Mogadore on their own turf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Getting my Chest,” Six says. She pulls the blanket back over her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Training?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then what?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We go find the others, I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It just sounds like a bunch of running and not much of anything else. I think Henri or Katarina would have us doing something more productive somehow. Like studying how to kill certain enemies. Do you know what a piken is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those are those huge beasts that destroyed the school,” Six says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about a kraul?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those are the smaller animal things that attacked us in the gymnasium,” she answers. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the dream that I had in North Carolina, when you and Sam heard me speaking Mogadorian, those two names were mentioned, but I’d never heard of them before. Henri and I simply called them ‘the beasts.’” I pause. “I had another dream earlier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe you aren’t having dreams,” she says. “Maybe you’re having visions again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “It’s hard to tell the difference at this point. I mean, these dreams felt the same as the visions I had of Lorien, but I wasn’t on Lorien during these two,” I say. “Henri once said that when I have visions it’s because they hold some sort of personal significance to me. And that’s always been true—the past visions were always of things that had already happened. But I think what I witnessed in my dream this morning . . . I don’t know. It’s like I was seeing it as it was actually happening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wicked,” Sam says. “You’re like a TV.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix crumples her paper towel and tosses it up in the air above her head. Without thinking I set it on fire, and it wilts into nothing before landing on the carpet. Then Six says, “It’s not impossible, John. Some of the Loric have been known to do it. That’s what Katarina said, anyway.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-power-of-six-lorien-legacies-2/page-14.html","bookId":1676,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:53 AM"}
