Darkness obstructed Haven’s view of his face, but the glow from the moonlight illuminated his hands as he plucked the strings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a few steps forward, entranced as the music smoothed out and grew louder. It swirled all around her, goose bumps springing up as the melody seeped into her skin. Her stomach fluttered and limbs tingled, warmth spreading throughout her body. She closed her eyes, reveling in the foreign sensation, until the music stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven’s eyes snapped back open, and she could see his face then, still partially encased in the shadows. He frowned, staring at her with questions in his eyes, but she had no answers to give.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning on her heel, Haven ran back into the room and closed the door, pressing her back against it as the music started up once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, Carmine woke up earlier than usual and grabbed a bowl of cereal, his footsteps faltering in the family room. Dominic sat on the couch reading a Sports Illustrated, and Haven was beside him, neither of them speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Carmine could utter a single word, Haven leaped to her feet and scurried away. He watched her retreating form before taking the seat she’d vacated. “She acts like I’m diseased and she’s gonna catch something by coming near me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic nodded. “I noticed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven’t done anything.” He paused. “I don’t think, anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t realize how abrasive you come off,” Dominic said. “It’s the way you look at people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine shrugged. There wasn’t anything he could do about that. “Whatever. There’s obviously something wrong with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you taken the time to ask her what it might be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haven’t had a chance,” he said. “Like I said, she runs from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, maybe if you took an interest in her, she wouldn’t act sketchy around you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what you did—took an interest?” Carmine asked. “I’m not sure Tess would be happy about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic shoved him, spilling some of his cereal. “I was nice to her, bro. You should try it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine brushed some of the stray Lucky Charms from his lap, glaring at the wet patch where the milk had soaked into his pants. “Asshole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent DeMarco was an easily recognized man. The people in Durante knew him as the talented doctor and the dedicated single father, the wealthy bachelor women rigorously pursued. He’d accumulated a few wayward gray hairs, but he looked younger than his forty years. He was like his father that way. Antonio DeMarco had died at fifty when he looked more like a youthful thirty-five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenetics, Vincent thought, was a peculiar thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he was well known, few people saw the man behind the mask. Vincent felt like he lived two different lives, both equally real yet at odds with each other. He liked to believe he was the family man that others saw, but he was also deeply committed to a different type of family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA family not bonded by genetics, instead forged by spilled blood and sworn oaths. LCN, the government called it, short for La Cosa Nostra, but it was known by many different names: la famiglia, borgata, outfit, syndicate. It all meant the same. The Mafia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d taken a step back from the life years ago, moving away from Chicago and the center of the action, but there was no leaving the organization once it had you in its brutal grasp. He was kept on as an unofficial consigliere to the Don, Salvatore Capozzi. Vincent’s job was to play the middleman, to give advice when asked and come when called, and he did this obediently, taking care of whatever needed to be handled. But just because he was good at what he did, didn’t mean he enjoyed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent sat in the smoky den of the mansion in Lincoln Park, holding a full glass of scotch as he listened to the swarm of men debate business. There were twenty of them, but Vincent wasn’t sure why half were there. They had no say in how things were run, some of them so new they hadn’t earned their buttons. There was no reason to trust them—no reason to confide in them—considering there was no blood on their hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot to say he wanted them to be murderers. He envied their clear consciences and wished he could warn them all to turn away. Get out while they still could, because someday it would be too late . . . and that someday would probably end with a lengthy prison sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr a hollow-point bullet to the brain. Vincent hadn’t decided which outcome would be worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he couldn’t warn anyone. He’d sworn an oath to put the organization first, and if the organization wanted these dime-a-dozen thugs, Vincent would deal with his ill feelings silently. He’d initiated young—one of the youngest made men in history. Usually guys struggled for decades trying to prove themselves worthy, most never surviving long enough to see it happen. But not Vincent. He’d slipped right in the door while his father was in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t the youngest to do business with them, though. Kids were recruited fresh from high school, molded into vindictive soldiers to do the family’s bidding. The young ones incurred all the risk, while those at the top lavished in the fruits of their labor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood money. Hundreds had died to pay for the mansion in which they sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We cannot tolerate these things. They are savages.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiovanni was speaking, his thick accent making Vincent strain to pay attention. Sicilian by birth, he’d immigrated to America a decade before and moved up in rank to become their highest-producing Capo. Some of his crew was present, sitting off to the side. Vincent had a hard time remembering the names of the soldati, but one he was familiar with was Nunzio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNunzio had been lurking around for years. They called him Squint because of the way his eyes always seemed to be half-closed, his face frozen in a roguish scowl. He kept his head buzzed, a light dusting of brown hair showing, and his eyes were the dull color of cracked earth. The Don’s brother had taken him in as a baby, so Salvatore had a soft spot for the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men argued back and forth as Vincent swirled the scotch around in his glass, having no intention of drinking it. He remained quiet until the unmistakable voice of the Don chimed in, speaking directly to him. “What do you think, Vincent?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I want to go home. “I think being hasty will backfire. I don’t like the way the Russians conduct business, but they’ve yet to hurt any of our people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They will,” Giovanni warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If they do, it’ll be handled,” Vincent said, “but until that time comes, who are we to police another group?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent looked across the room at where the Don sat in his favorite chair. In his late sixties, Sal was shaped like a balloon and sounded perpetually full of helium. He’d been the underboss when Vincent’s father ran things and succeeded rule after he died. Antonio had dubbed him Salamander. “If you scare a salamander, he’ll drop his tail and run,” he had said. “No skin off his back. Two weeks later, he’s good as new.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSal mulled over Vincent’s words. “You’re right. Maybe they’ll take themselves out with their stupidity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquint laughed dryly, but tried to cover it with a forced cough when everyone looked his way. The guy beside him seemed annoyed by the outburst, another soldato whose name eluded Vincent. He thought it might be Johnny, one of about a hundred other Johnnys running around the streets. His looks certainly fit the name—generic, undistinguishable. Another number in the crowd, easily replaced, never missed. A tail, Vincent thought. Sal would drop him and keep going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Sal dismissed them with a wave of the hand, Vincent was the first out of his seat. He dumped the scotch and headed for the door, but Giovanni cut him off. “I think we are making a mistake, Doc. It will do us no good ignoring them now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not ignoring them,” Vincent said. “We’re just not going to instigate a fight. The last thing we need is violence on our streets over things that have nothing to do with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent headed for his rental car when Giovanni’s voice rang out once more. “Just because we do not know of anything does not mean they have not violated us. There will be war.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine pulled the last clean shirt off the hanger in his closet. The small piles of laundry had morphed into mountains, every piece of clothing he owned now dirty on the floor. Usually it wouldn’t have gotten that far, as he would have taken them to the local laundry service, but he had a problem—he was broke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strolled through the library to the other side of the floor and grabbed Dominic’s doorknob, his brow furrowing when it wouldn’t turn. He could hear voices inside and pounded on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic opened it. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine noticed Tess lying across the bed in one of Dominic’s shirts, and cringed at the mental image of what he’d interrupted. “I need some money. My clothes are dirty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want money?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, a loan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have a funny way of asking, bro,” Dominic said. “And how are you going to pay me back when you don’t have a job?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine shrugged. “I’ll figure it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, you will,” Dominic said. “You’ll figure out how to do your own damn laundry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slammed in Carmine’s face. Tess laughed inside the room as Carmine punched the wall before heading back to his bedroom. He grabbed his cell phone and dialed Dia’s home number, breathing a sigh of relief when she answered. “What do you want, Carmine?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What makes you think I want something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I know you,” she said. “You don’t call to chitchat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “My laundry needs done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want me to do your laundry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I don’t know who else to ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, how much money do you have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he heard was the sound of laughter before Dia hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrritated, he picked up armfuls of clothes and tossed them in the hamper before dragging it downstairs. As soon as he reached the laundry room, he heard the humming, soft and sweet like a lullaby. Haven stood in front of the dryer, folding clothes. She glanced at him apprehensively as she quieted, her eyes darting from him to his overfull hamper. He lugged it into the room and opened the washing machine hatch, shoving all the clothes into it. It overflowed, and he had to push on them to get the door closed. He looked around for some detergent and caught Haven’s eyes again as she gaped at him, holding a pair of pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t sure what her problem was, but he was too aggravated to deal with it. Another week had passed with her avoiding him, dodging from rooms before he could say hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, where’s the soap?” he asked. “You know, the Tide or whatever we use around here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven reached behind her and opened a small cabinet, pulling out a jug of laundry detergent. Carmine opened the washer again as he took it from her, and he was about to pour it straight in when Haven sharply inhaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intake of breath stalled him. “What?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sempre-forever-1/page-8.html","bookId":2784,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:27:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:27:53 PM"}
