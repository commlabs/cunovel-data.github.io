And when they do, I’ll shove it down his throat anyway. Because it’s good for him. If one day he decides to hate me for that? That’s okay too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause sometimes being a father is hard. And if it’s not? You’re not doing it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pour some Cheerios onto the tray and back up halfway across the room. “Hey, James, set it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens his mouth wide and keeps it open. I hold a single Cheerio between my fingers while I bend my knees and bounce my hand as if I were dribbling a basketball. “Three seconds left on the clock, down by one, Evans gets the ball. He fakes left, he drives in, he shoots. . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI toss the Cheerio in a high arc. It lands right in James’s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He scores! The crowd goes wild!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames holds both hands over his head. “Core!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I give him a high five. See—told you. Cool, right? I shovel a spoonful of cereal in my mouth and get ready for another shot. Then Kate comes into the kitchen, texting on her phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that worry about losing the baby weight? It was for nothing. Look at her—snug black yoga pants hug narrow hips, a navy Penn State T-shirt shows off her flat stomach and toned arms. Her hair’s pulled back into a ponytail, and a touch of shiny, strawberry-flavored lip gloss is her only makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGorgeous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate still has that simple, low-maintenance kind of beauty. She doesn’t have to work at being hot—she just is. I maneuver next to James’s high chair and wait for Kate to look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it’s deliberate. Children have the power to suck the sex drive out of a relationship like a hungry black hole. So it’s important to stoke the flame—keep the coals burning hot. And something about seeing a shirtless guy with a baby turns every woman on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrust me—I’ve been accosted at the beach enough times to know. It’s like female frigging Viagra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s different for guys. Not that a baby is a negative, necessarily—but seeing a chick with one doesn’t automatically make us want to bang her. Because deep, deep down all men are still little boys. We want all your attention on us. It’s just how it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel Kate’s eyes on me and I pop a piece of apple into James’s mouth. Then I stretch out my arms—flexing the muscles—giving her a good show. Oh, yeah—it’s working. She’s definitely wet. See how her head tilts and her eyes shine as she looks me up and down? How her lips part and she breathes just a little bit faster?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s remembering what we just finished doing—and thinking about when we’ll get to do it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mummy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate’s eyes shift to James. Her smile changes—no sexy, more sweet. “Hey, little man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe comes over and takes an apple slice for herself. “How are my two favorite guys doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So far, so good.” I nod toward the phone in her hand. “What’s up there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m texting Billy’s manager Steven and Alexandra’s address. The one he was given is for a pawnshop in the middle of the Bronx. You wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents are watching all the grandchildren for the weekend. Since Steven and my sister’s two trumps our one, the whole gang’s meeting at their place and taking a car to the airport together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play innocent. “Who me? Nope—I know nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t look as if she buys it. “He could’ve missed the car to the airport. Maybe the whole flight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, that would’ve been a shame.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be nice, Drew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s coming, isn’t he? I think letting your ex-boyfriend tag along to my bachelor party is above and beyond the call of nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate motions with her hands as she attempts to defend donkey dump. “You’re always complaining about how close I am with him, but maybe if you tried a little harder, he wouldn’t depend so much on me. And besides, Billy doesn’t have a lot of guy friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which makes perfect sense. He’s a pu**y—and females tend to flock together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate rolls her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames decides to join the conversation. “Poosy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, crap. That’s not good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still, I start to laugh. How can I not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate frowns at me. “Great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost kids speak their first word around the eleven-month mark. Because my son is a genius, his first word came at nine months. And it wasn’t Mama or Dada or anything typical like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames’s first word was shit. Kate was not pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween you and me, though, we got off easy. It could have been so much worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns to James and admonishes gently, “No, James.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, trying to understand. “No poosy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crack up harder. Now Kate is glaring. She puts her hands on her hips. “Yes—and that’s exactly what Daddy’s going to be getting if he doesn’t stop laughing right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames’s eyes go wide and he tries to warn me. “No poosy, Daddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I’m full-out laughing my ass off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate throws her hands up in the air. “Well, that’s just perfect! Now he’s going to spend the next two days with your parents talking like a foulmouthed little hooligan. What’s your mother going to think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sober slightly, still smiling, taking her hand in mine and holding it against my chest. “Considering she’s the woman who had to raise the first foulmouthed hooligan? I think she’ll have an enormous amount of sympathy for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate grins. “Which is totally deserved. I swear, between the two of you, I don’t know how I keep my sanity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the sex. If raisins are nature’s candy, screwing is its antidepressant. It’s the best way to maintain good mental health.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn orgasm a day keeps the psychiatrist away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate crosses her arms doubtfully. “Sure it is. That sounds an awful lot like when I was pregnant and you told me women who performed o**l s*x more often were less likely to develop preeclampsia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point my finger at her. “That was totally true! I read an article about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow awesome is that? If I wasn’t sure before, after that I was certain—God is definitely a guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In what magazine? Playboy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Men’s Health.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling left out, James tries to get another laugh out of me. “Poosy!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tied-tangled-4/page-10.html","bookId":1810,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:39 PM"}
