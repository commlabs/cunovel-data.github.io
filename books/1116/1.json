So, at this, the entrance to that which is within, those who stop to read may gain a hint of what is beyond. Only a little, though, to whet your appetite and make you wish for more, it is to be hoped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So, then, this is a tale of love, of witchcraft, and of fighting. A tale of a brave man, and as brave a maid. Herein may be found the doings of witch-finders, Puritans and Indians. Also there is set down the struggle of two men for the love of a woman, and it may be learned who won. You may read of the lifting of the great rock, of the killing of the serpent, of the battle at the fort, of the trial of death, and the bursting of the mighty press. This much and more, until the tale is at an end.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The author hopes you, reader, and the many of you who make up the public, will like the story. He has tried to make it interesting. If it serves to help you pass a pleasant hour or two, the writer will have accomplished his purpose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So, then, having had patience thus far, you may enter, and read.\n\u003cbr\u003e H.
