What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" Jonas said, \"that it sounds like a hell of a lot of work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it will be, but Tavi and I have little else to do. The preparations should be amusing. We have already started the research.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds magnificent,\" Verity said thoughtfully. \"But it\u0027ll cost a lot of money to organize something like that.\" She didn\u0027t say aloud that the idea was far less appealing today than it might have been yesterday. After last night, Verity was not feeling a great deal of interest in the Renaissance. But then, it wasn\u0027t her party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Money is not a problem,\" Caitlin said easily. \"I have the freedom to indulge myself. And I\u0027m glad you like my whimsical little notion, because I would very much like for you and Jonas to attend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks,\" Jonas said mildly. \"Sounds too rich for my blood. And Verity has to run the No Bull Cafe on Sunday evenings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In three weeks we\u0027ll start closing on Sundays,\" Verity pointed out, annoyed at the way he had answered for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe Laura Griswald mentioned your winter routine,\" Caitlin murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity sighed. \"It sounds fantastic, but I\u0027m afraid Jonas is right. You\u0027ll be entertaining people who are accustomed to moving in the social stratosphere. I\u0027d feel out of it, Caitlin. You can understand that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, what you\u0027re planning is going to be basically a business affair. You don\u0027t need me. I\u0027ll come for a visit afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaitlin leaned forward, her cool fingers touching Verity\u0027s hand. Her eyes were deep and filled with urgency. \"Please, Verity. I want you to come. It\u0027s important to me. I have no other close friends to invite except Tavi and yourself. The others who will be coming will all be strangers who will be indulging me out of a morbid curiosity. I would like to have you there as my friend. I\u0027ll pay for the rental of your costumes and I\u0027ll cover all your other expenses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caitlin, that\u0027s not necessary,\" Verity interrupted quickly, flicking a gjance at Jonas. She could see the disapproval in him and she felt momentarily trapped between two opposing forces. For an instant she had the unsettling sensation that she was merely a pawn being tossed back and forth between these two. But that was ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humor me, Verity. I\u0027m going to need you when I sell Bloodlust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dish clattered loudly as Tavi moved away from the table. Jonas said nothing but Verity could feel his aggressive anger. She knew he wanted nothing to do with Caitlin\u0027s Renaissance ball or the aftermath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, he didn\u0027t have to attend, Verity rationalized as she gave in to the appeal she saw in Caitlin\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew then that, for whatever reason, Caitlin needed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Verity said finally. \"If you really want me there, I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaitlin closed her eyes and nodded in relieved satisfaction. \"Thank you.\" She turned to Jonas. \"What about you, Jonas? Will you escort your employer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity hastened to get Jonas off the hook. \"I don\u0027t think this is going to be Jonas\u0027s idea of a fun time,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said lightly. \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027d rather go fishing with my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s definitely not my idea of a fun time,\" Jonas agreed harshly. \"But if Verity insists on attending, I\u0027ll come with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaitlin looked satisfied. More than satisfied, Verity decided with sudden perception. She looked almost triumphant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours later Verity was still trying to work through her astonishment over Jonas\u0027s willingness to accompany her to Caitlin\u0027s party. She got into the passenger seat of her compact while he tossed their bags onto the backseat and slid behind the wheel. She waved at Caitlin and Tavi, framed in the open doorway of the steel-gray house. Tavi did not wave or smile back. Caitlin lifted one hand in farewell and turned to go inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Jonas, let\u0027s have it. Why are you going to come with me to Caitlin\u0027s party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the same reason I came with you on this stupid little jaunt. I don\u0027t want you driving over here alone. I don\u0027t trust that woman. She wants something from you, Verity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friendship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas shook his head with great certainty. \"Caitlin Evanger doesn\u0027t need anyone\u0027s friendship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all need friends, Jonas,\" Verity said gently. \"Just because she gives the impression of great self-sufficiency, that doesn\u0027t mean Caitlin\u0027s an exception,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s got good old Tavi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity frowned, thinking about that. \"You know, now that you mention it, I don\u0027t quite understand that relationship. I know Tavi is a paid companion, but I get the feeling she\u0027s very attached to Caitlin. Did you notice how nervous she was this morning when she served breakfast? She was very tense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she had a bad night.\" Jonas was not concerned about Tavi. \"Forget those two, Verity. I want to talk about us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about us?\" she asked warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that you\u0027ve had a few hours to think about what I told you last night, do you still think I\u0027m crazy?\" he asked bluntly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never said you were crazy,\" she muttered defensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might not have said it, but don\u0027t try telling me the thought hasn\u0027t crossed your mind. Dammit, Verity, tell me the truth. Axe you afraid of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question took her by surprise. She thought about it. \"No, I\u0027m not afraid of you,\" she finally said honestly. \"I just don\u0027t understand what\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shot her a searching glance. \"I\u0027ll take what I can get for the moment. It\u0027s enough that you don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to turn into a werewolf some night when the moon is full. In the meantime, will you help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head came around in surprise. \"Help you do what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to conduct some tests,\" he said tersely. \"I want to see how far my control extends now that I\u0027ve got you to hold on to. We can use those dueling pistols of your dad\u0027s to start. I only touched one long enough the other night to get a sense of its authenticity. As soon as I felt the emotions attached to it, I dropped it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not before I felt you in that corridor with me. You were in that corridor again last night, honey. I saw you. You touched me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity gave a start. Shock widened her eyes. \"What corridor?\" Her breathless demand gave her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas smiled briefly and ferociously. \"I wondered if it would translate into your mind with the same imagery. Apparently it does. Interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas, please...\" The plea drifted to a halt. Verity didn\u0027t know what to ask for. She swallowed, her mouth going dry. Until now she had been certain the corridor was merely a quirk of her imagination. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-49.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
