Now, Leigh lives only for the hunt. Werewolves are her prey, and love is no longer an option. Leigh has been called to Wisconsin for something big. As long as it means killing fanged and furry demons, she\u0027s up for it. But the worst is yet to come, because something stronger and smarter than the average beast is on the prowl...and it\u0027s doing Leigh\u0027s work for her.
