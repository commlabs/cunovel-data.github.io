Three types of professionals arrived after my house blew up six weeks earlier: firefighters, police officers, and paramedics. Ray told me this. They didn\u0027t talk to Ray, who had dragged me out of sight into the woods, but I contacted them later once I had regained consciousness. I pleaded innocent to any knowledge of the explosion: its cause or the reason it was rigged. At that time they didn\u0027t tell me of any human remains found in the vicinity. That, of course, doesn\u0027t mean a body wasn\u0027t found. The police could have withheld that information from me. For all I know I am still under investigation for the explosion and whatever was discovered in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need a contact with the local police and I need it immediately. The paramedics and the hospital would have the remains of Yaksha, but if I do not go through the proper channels and authorities, they will show me nothing. With my extensive contacts and wealth, I can develop a contact, but it will take time. As I sit at my desk, thinking, a light on my phone begins to blink. It is an out-of-state call. I pick it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alisa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Agent Joel Drake-how nice of you to call.\" I make a decision immediately, figuring it is a sign from Krishna that the FBI man has phoned at this precise instant. Of course, I do not believe in signs, I am just desperate. I add, \"I\u0027ve been meaning to call you. There are some things we should discuss that I failed to bring up last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is interested. \"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a lead on who is behind the murders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes a moment. \"Are you serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I have a very good lead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will only tell you in person. Fly into Portland this afternoon and I\u0027ll pick you up at the airport. I guarantee you\u0027ll be glad you came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you said you wouldn\u0027t be leaving town for a few days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lied. Call the airlines. Book your flight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles. \"Hold on a second. I can\u0027t fly up to Oregon in the middle of an investigation. Tell me what you know and then we can talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I say firmly. \"You must come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The murderer is from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pitch my voice in my most beguiling manner. \"I know many things, Agent Drake. That one of the guys you found in the coliseum had a javelin through his chest, the other had his skull stabbed open, and every bone in the neck of the third was shattered. Don\u0027t ask me how I know these things and don\u0027t tell your FBI pals about me. Not if you want to solve this case and get all the credit. Think about it, Joel, you can be the big hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy knowledge stuns him. He considers. \"You mis?understand me, Alisa. I don\u0027t need to be a hero. I just want to stop the killing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is being sincere. I like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will stop if you come here,\" I say softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closes his eyes; I hear them close. My voice will not leave his mind. He wonders if I am some kind of witch. \"Who are you?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. I will hold while you book your flight. Take the earliest one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will have to tell my partners where I\u0027m going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Just the two of us are going to work on this. That\u0027s my condition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles again, this time without mirth. \"You\u0027re pretty gutsy for a young woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of the knife that stabbed me in the belly less than twelve hours ago. \"I have strong guts,\" I agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoel puts me on hold. A few minutes later he returns. His plane will land in three hours. I agree to meet him at the gate. After setting down the phone, I leave my office and crawl into bed beside Ray. He stirs and turns his back to me but doesn\u0027t wake. Portland is an hour and a half away. I have only ninety minutes to rest before I must take on the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoel looks tired when I pick him up at the airport. I don\u0027t imagine he got much sleep the previous night He immediately starts with his questions, but I ask him to wait until we are in my car. Once inside I put on music, a tape of my playing the piano. We drive toward Mayfair. I am still thinking how I should approach this matter. Since we are dealing with evi?dence that points toward a mysterious agency, I am not worried about staying conservative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is the pianist?\" he asks finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The music is haunting, and the pianist is wonder?ful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn appropriate choice of words. \"It\u0027s me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have asked me that twice today. I am always serious, Agent Drake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joel, please. Is Alisa your real name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Have you been researching me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bit I haven\u0027t turned up much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, you haven\u0027t turned up an Alisa Perne in your computers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s correct. What\u0027s your real name and who taught you to play such exquisite piano?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am self-taught. And I like to be called Alisa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t answered my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I answered one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares at me. For a few sentences I forgot to be careful how I pitched my voice, and the echo of my age creeps into it. My words and voice, I know, can throb like living ghosts. My music is not the only thing that is haunting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old did you say you were?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Older than I look. You want to know how I know about the murders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Among other things. You lied to me last night when you said you had not been in the Coliseum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is correct. I was there. I saw the three young men in the field killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get a good look at the killer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pauses. \"Do you know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But he is associated with a man I once knew. That man died in an explosion at my house six weeks ago. The reason I have brought you here is to help me trace the remains of that man. We are driving to the Mayfair Police Station now. I want you to ask them to open their files to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head. \"No way. You\u0027re going to answer my questions before I do anything to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or you will arrest me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile thinly. \"That will not happen. And I am not going to answer all your questions, just the ones I choose to answer. You have no choice but to cooperate with me. Like you said last night-you have no leads. And you are more in the dark than you admit. You have several people who seem to have been killed by a person of extraordinary strength. A person so strong, in fact, that he seems superhuman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t go that far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort softly. \"It takes a great deal of strength to snap every cervical in a man\u0027s neck. Isn\u0027t that what the autopsy showed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoel shifts uneasily, but I have his full attention. \"The autopsy isn\u0027t complete on any of the victims.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the LAPD medical examiner has told you about the guy\u0027s neck. It makes you wonder, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe speaks carefully. \"Yes. It makes me wonder how you know these things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach over and touch his leg. I have a very sensual touch, when I wish to flaunt it, and I must admit I find myself attracted to Joel. Not that I love him as I do Ray, but I wouldn\u0027t mind seducing him, as long as Ray wouldn\u0027t know. Having had ten thousand lovers, I don\u0027t share most mortals\u0027 illusions of the sacredness of fidelity. Yet I will not risk hurting Ray for sex, and I will not lie to him anymore. Joel feels the electricity of my fingers and shifts all the more. I like my boys fidgety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to say something?\" I ask, my hand still on his thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clears his throat. \"You are very alluring, Alisa. Particularly when you are being vague, or trying to be persuasive.\" He stares down at my hand as if trying to decide whether it is a priceless jewel or a spider that has crawled into his lap. \"But I am beginning to see through your facade.\" I remove my hand, not insulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all it is? A facade?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head. \"Where did you grow up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI burst out laughing. \"In the jungle! A place not unlike where these murders are happening. I watched as that young man\u0027s neck was snapped. A normal person couldn\u0027t do that. The person you are looking for is not normal. Nor was my friend who died when my house blew up. If we can find what became of him, his remains, then we can find your murderer-I hope. But don\u0027t ask me how these people are not normal, how they have such strength, or even why my house was blown up. I won\u0027t tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe keeps looking at me. \"Are you normal, Alisa?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pat his leg. \"It\u0027s all right. You go on thinking that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, I think, he knows too much about me already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen all this is over, I am going to have to kill Joel Drake. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/black-blood-the-last-vampire-2/page-3.html","bookId":2572,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:25 PM"}
