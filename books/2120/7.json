But not just any dress. This was a couture confection of thousands of chiffon rosettes hand-stitched together to create an ethereal, cloudlike elegance. The strapless bodice hugged her tiny twenty-two-inch waist, and her lustrous gold locks spilled over her creamy shoulders and toned lower back. It was a six- figure dress, a one-of-a-kind showstopper that only John Galliano could create. And it was hers, at least for one night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in the celebrity dressing department at Christian Dior. An exclusive showroom that was by invitation only. All around the racks that surrounded Mimi were dresses flown straight from the Paris runways--samples that only models and model-thin socialites could ever dream of wearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere was the Dior that Nicole Kidman wore to the Oscars, there was the gown Charlize Theron wore to the Golden Globes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stunning,\" the Dior publicist pronounced with a quick nod of her head. \"Absolutely, this is the one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi took a flute of champagne from the silver tray proffered by a white-gloved servant. \"Perhaps,\" she acknowledged, knowing that with the dress\u0027s fifty foot?long train, she would cause a commotion when she entered the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Bliss appeared in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi had invited her friend to join her, thinking it would be fun to have an audience watch her try on dresses. Mimi liked nothing more than to have a fawning friend envy her good looks and social privileges. She hadn\u0027t expected the publicist at Christian Dior to fall over herself and encourage Bliss to borrow a dress as well. But ever since Bliss had been signed by the Farnsworth Modeling Agency, and her face and figure had been emblazoned all over town in the \"Stitched for Civilization\" jeans advertising campaign that she had starred in with Schuyler Van Alen, the little Texas rose had become a bona fide New York celebrity--a fact Mimi had yet to forgive. Bliss had even been chosen as Vogue\u0027s \"Girl of the Moment,\" and there were Web sites devoted to her every move. Mimi had to face the awful truth: her friend was famous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys--what do you think of this?\" Bliss asked. Mimi and the publicist turned. Mimi\u0027s smile faded. The publicist ran over to Bliss Lwelleyn\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gorgeous!\" she declared. \"I only wish John were here to see you in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss was wearing a plush velvet dress of the darkest green almost black that dramatically offset her cascading reddish-gold curls. Her pale, ivory complexion looked almost translucent against the deep rich, dark jeweled color of the gown. It had a plunging, outrageously low neckline, cut from collarbone to belly button, revealing a generous amount of cleavage but stopping short of anything obscene. The bodice was embroidered with a thousand Swarovski crystals that twinkled against the fabric like stars in the night sky. It was a fantastic, entrance-making dress, the kind of dress that propelled unknown actresses into A-list movie stars, a contender against Elizabeth Hurley\u0027s famed Versace safety pins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it.\" Bliss nodded. She towered over Mimi in her jeweled stilettos, and the two of them looked at themselves in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst Bliss\u0027s severe yet sexy gown, Mimi in her pale- pink rosettes suddenly looked inconsequential, and Mimi\u0027s smile withered underneath the lights as Bliss twirled and danced around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It only looks heavy,\" Bliss said, lifting the hem. \"But it\u0027s so light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s made from Venetian silk--some of the best in the world,\" the Dior rep explained. \"Ten Belgian nuns went blind making it,\" she joked. \"So girls, I suppose we\u0027re all set?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi shook her head. There was no way in hell she would allow Bliss to steal the spotlight--her night--away from her. She had her heart set on being the single most beautiful girl in the room, and there was no way she would be able to do that if Bliss upstaged her in that insanely opulent gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisiting the celebrity dressing department had been her idea, but now Mimi had to opt for Plan B. She wouldn\u0027t be content with a gown from the runway--she had to have a gown custom- made and designed for herself only, by the master. Balenciaga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the showroom and crossed the street to grab a quick lunch at Fred\u0027s, the restaurant on the top floor of Barneys. The hostess seated them immediately in a comfy, four-person booth near the window, where they could be seen by the tony crowd. Mimi noted Brannon Frost, the Blue Blood editor in chief of Chic, seated across from them with her fourteen-year-old daughter, Willow, a freshman at Duchesne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss\u0027s color was high and her face glowed happily. She was still talking about the dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, totally, it looked great on you,\" Mimi said in a flat voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer friend\u0027s smile wavered, and Bliss swallowed a gulp of water to camouflage her disappointment. Mimi\u0027s disinterest was a cue that all discussion about Bliss\u0027s ball gown was now over. Bliss quickly regrouped. \"But yours was ah-ma-zing. Pink is so your color.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. I think I\u0027m going to look somewhere else. Dior is so outr?, don\u0027t you think? De trop, as they say. A little over the top. But of course, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re looking for, it\u0027s fabulous.\" She said condescendingly as she paged through the leather-bound menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where do you think you\u0027ll go?\" Bliss asked, trying not to feel the sting of Mimi\u0027s little barbs. She knew she had looked great in that dress, and that Mimi was just jealous--Mimi was always that way. The last time they went shopping, they had both found a gorgeous baby-lamb fur coat at Intermix, a trendy downtown boutique. Mimi had allowed Bliss to buy it, but only after she\u0027d disparaged wearing fur. \"But you go ahead, dear. I know some people don\u0027t care about the suffering of tiny little animals.\" In the end, Bliss had purchased the coat, but she had yet to wear it. Score one for Mimi Force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bitch was just green-eyed with envy. I rocked that dress, Bliss thought, then immediately felt ashamed to be thinking of her friend that way. Was Mimi really jealous? What did the beautiful Mimi Force have to be jealous about, ever? Her life was like, perfect. Maybe Bliss was reading too much into her reaction. Maybe Mimi was right--maybe the dress was too much. Maybe she shouldn\u0027t wear it after all. If only someone else had been with her at the showroom, someone like Schuyler, whom Bliss knew would be able to offer an honest opinion. Schuyler didn\u0027t even realize how pretty she was; she was always hiding in those bag-lady layers of hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know where I\u0027m going to find a ball dress,\" Mimi said airily. \"But I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll find something.\" She wasn\u0027t about to share the ace up her sleeve this time. God help her if Bliss got the same idea to ask the Balenciaga designer to make her a ball dress as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter arrived and took their orders, two steak au poivres. Rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bloody.\" Mimi smiled, showing just a hint of her fangs so that the waiter did a double take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raw,\" Bliss joked, handing back the menu, although she wasn\u0027t really kidding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" Mimi said, taking a sip of water and looking around the lively restaurant to see if anyone was looking at her. Yes. Several women--tourists, by the looks of their pastel cardigans and eighties-era scrunchies--seated in Siberia, were whispering and talking about her. \"That\u0027s Mimi Force. You know, Force News? Her dad\u0027s that gazillionaire? There was a story about her in last week\u0027s Styles. She\u0027s like, the new Paris Hilton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I was saying, it\u0027s not really about the dress. It\u0027s about a date,\" Mimi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A date?\" Bliss gagged. \"I didn\u0027t know we had to find dates for this thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi laughed. \"Of course you need a date, silly. It\u0027s a ball.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who are you taking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack, of course,\" Mimi replied promptly, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother?\" Bliss asked, shocked. \"Um, like, ew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a family thing,\" Mimi huffed. \"Twins always go as each other\u0027s dates. And besides, it\u0027s not like...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like?\" Bliss prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi had been meaning to say, It\u0027s not like he\u0027s really my brother, but this was neither the time nor place to explain their complicated and immortal romantic history and the bond between them. Bliss wouldn\u0027t understand. She didn\u0027t have full control of her memories yet and would not be coming out at the ball until next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Mimi said, as their entrees were set before them. \"Ooh. I think this one is still breathing.\" She smiled as she cut into her steak, releasing a river of red blood on the immaculate white plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA date, Bliss thought. A date for the Four Hundred Ball. Bliss knew there was only one guy in the world she wanted as an escort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what about you? Maybe you can take Jaime Kip,\" Mimi suggested. \"He\u0027s totally hot and so available.\" Actually, Jaime Kip had a girlfriend, but since she was a Red Blood, in Mimi\u0027s mind she didn\u0027t count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Mimi, I need to tell you something,\" Bliss whispered. She hadn\u0027t meant to confide in Mimi, but she couldn\u0027t keep her thoughts and hopes to herself any longer. Especially since they were talking about boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi raised an eyebrow \"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Dylan is alive,\" Bliss said, explaining in an almost incoherent rush how she had found herself half drowned in the Central Park lake, only to be rescued by a boy a boy whose face she never saw, but whose voice had been only too familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi looked pityingly on her friend. Through her father, Mimi had heard what had happened. Dylan had been attacked and killed by a Silver Blood. There had been no hope for his survival. They had never found his body, but Bliss\u0027s testimony to The Committee about the tragic evening had spelled out his fate loud and clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bliss, darling, I think that\u0027s really sweet how you think this guy, your so-called `savior,\u0027 was Dylan. But there\u0027s no way. You know as well as I do that...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That what?\" Bliss asked defensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Dylan\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words hung in the air between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s never coming back, Bliss. Ever.\" Mimi sighed and put down her knife and fork. \"So let\u0027s get serious. Do you want me to set you up? I think Jaime Kip is such a hottie.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-7.html","bookId":2120,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM"}
