I\u0027d call him an utterly remorseless sociopath, and I\u0027d like to see him live out his days as a guest of the state of New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You defended him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think he\u0027s entitled to a defense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got him off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think he\u0027s entitled to the best possible defense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t just defend him,\" I went on. \"You put the whole police department on trial. You sold the jury a bill of goods about Madison being a snitch for the local Bronx precinct, in return for which they let him deal dope and supplied him with stash confiscated from other dealers. Then they were afraid he would talk, though God knows who he would talk to or why, and they went to his mother\u0027s house not to arrest him but to murder him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite a scenario, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think cops use snitches?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course they do. They wouldn\u0027t make half their cases if they didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think they allow snitches to pursue their criminal careers in return for the help they provide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s part of how it works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think confiscated dope ever finds its way back onto the street? Don\u0027t you think some police officers, cops who\u0027ve already broken the law, will take extreme measures to cover their asses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In certain cases, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know for a fact, an irrefutable fact, that those cops didn\u0027t go to Warren\u0027s mother\u0027s house looking to kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a fact?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An irrefutable fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, no,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" Gruliow said. \"It was utter bullshit. They never used him as a snitch. They wouldn\u0027t use him to wipe their asses, for which I can\u0027t say I blame them. But the jury believed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did a good job of selling it to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be happy to take the credit, but it didn\u0027t take much selling. Because they wanted to buy it. I had a jury full of black and brown faces, and that ridiculous scenario I cooked up struck them as perfectly plausible. In their world, cops pull shit like that all the time, and lie like hell about it afterward. So why should they believe a word of police testimony? They\u0027d rather believe something else. I gave them an acceptable alternative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you put Warren Madison on the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a look, eyebrows raised, mouth on the verge of a smile. I\u0027d seen it before; it was his patented expression of disappointed skepticism, flashed in court at a difficult witness, in the hallways at an uncooperative reporter. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"do you seriously think the quality of life in this city is going to be measurably different for the rest of us if Warren Madison or anybody else is on or off its streets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said, \"but a cop has to believe that or it\u0027s hard to get to work in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a cop anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like being raised Catholic,\" I said. \"You never get over it. And I do think it makes a difference, not so much in terms of the people Madison\u0027s likely to kill but in the message people get when they see him walking around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t see him walking around, not unless they\u0027re in maximum security at Green Haven. That\u0027s where Warren is, and where he\u0027s likely to be until you and I are both long past caring. Remember what Torres said when he sentenced the kid for stabbing that Mormon boy in the subway? \u0027Your parole officer hasn\u0027t been born yet.\u0027 You could say that about Warren. He killed those drug dealers, and he was convicted, and he\u0027ll be behind bars as long as he lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t get him out from under those charges?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never even tried. He had other counsel. And I wouldn\u0027t have wanted the case. Killing a drug dealer is murder for profit, and there are plenty of other lawyers who can represent you. Shoot a cop and you\u0027re making a political statement. That\u0027s when a guy named Gruliow can do you some good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow no one remembers that Madison\u0027s serving time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. All they remember is Hard-Way Ray got him off. And the cops don\u0027t care whether he\u0027s locked up in Green Haven or out in Hollywood fucking Madonna. Their take on it is the same as yours, that I put the department on trial. I didn\u0027t, I put the system on trial, which is what I always do, in one sense or another. Whether it\u0027s civil-rights workers or draft resisters or Palestinians or, yes, Warren Madison, I put the system on trial. But not everybody sees it that way.\" He pointed at his plastic window. \"Some of them take it personally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I keep seeing that picture of you and Madison after the trial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Embracing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You figured what? Bad taste? Theatrical gesture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a memorable image,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever hear of a criminal lawyer named Earl Rogers? Very flamboyant and successful, represented Clarence Darrow when the great man was brought up on charges of jury tampering. In another case his client was charged with some particularly odious murder. I forget the details, but Rogers won an acquittal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when they read the verdict, the defendant rushed to shake hands with the man who got him off. Rogers wouldn\u0027t take his hand. \u0027Get away from me,\u0027 he cried out right there in the courtroom. \u0027You son of a bitch, you\u0027re as guilty as sin!\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that\u0027s theatrical,\" he said with relish. \"And bad taste, and ethically questionable at the very least. \u0027You\u0027re guilty as sin!\u0027 They\u0027re almost all of them guilty, for God\u0027s sake. If you don\u0027t want to defend the guilty, find another line of work. But if you do defend them, and if you\u0027re lucky enough to win, you can damn well shake their hands.\" He grinned. \"Or give \u0027em a hug, which is more my style than a handshake. And I felt like hugging Warren, I didn\u0027t have to fake it. It\u0027s goddam exhilarating when they say \u0027Not guilty.\u0027 It\u0027s moving. You want to hug somebody. And I liked Warren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Very charming man,\" he said, \"unless he had reason to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hungry,\" he announced around six. He called up a Chinese restaurant. \"Hi, this is Ray Gruliow,\" he said, and ordered several dishes, along with a couple of bottles of Tsing-tao, telling them not to forget the fortune cookies this time. \"Because,\" he said, \"my friend and I need to know what the future holds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up and said, \"You\u0027re in the program, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The program?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be coy, huh? You asked me in my own house if I was a fucking serial murderer. I ought to be able to ask you if you\u0027re a member of Alcoholics Anonymous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t being coy. People outside of AA don\u0027t generally call it \u0027the program.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to a few meetings a couple of years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here in the neighborhood. The basement of St. Luke\u0027s, on Hudson, and a little storefront on Perry Street. I don\u0027t know if they still have meetings there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody told me, \u0027Gruliow, get your ass out of here, you don\u0027t belong.\u0027 And I heard things I identified with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"It was more than I wanted to give up. I looked at the First Step and it said something about life being out of control. I forget how they phrased it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027We admitted we were powerless over alcohol- that it made our lives unmanageable.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it. Well, I looked at my life, and it wasn\u0027t unmanageable. There were nights I drank too much and mornings when I regretted it, but it seemed to me that was a price I could afford to pay. So I made a conscious effort to cut back on my drinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it worked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I\u0027m feeling the drinks I had just now. That\u0027s why I ordered food. I don\u0027t usually have this much to drink before dinner. I\u0027ve had some stress lately. I think it\u0027s only natural to drink more at times of stress, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said that sounded reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t have brought it up,\" he said, \"but I didn\u0027t want to order beer for you if you were the nondrinker I understood you to be, nor did I want to appear inhospitable.\" He slurred the last word just the least bit, and stopped himself from taking another stab at it. Shifting gears, he said, \"The woman you live with. How old is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to ask her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not thirty years younger than you, is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I guess you\u0027re not as much of a damned fool as I am,\" he said. \"When the club first met, Michelle was still in diapers. Jesus, she was the age Chatham is now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chatham\u0027s your daughter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed she is. I\u0027m even beginning to get used to her name. Her mother\u0027s idea, as you no doubt assumed. A man in his sixties does not name his daughter Chatham. I suggested to Michelle that if she wanted to name the kid after an English prime minister she should give some thought to Disraeli. It goes better with Gruliow than Chatham. Dizzy Gruliow. It has a nice ring, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she didn\u0027t like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t get it. She\u0027s half my age, for God\u0027s sake, but God help me if I treat her like a child. I have to treat her like an equal. I told her, making a joke of it, that I don\u0027t treat anybody like an equal, young or old, male or female. \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ve noticed.\u0027 You know something? I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going out to Sag Harbor tomorrow. I think the pressures of work are going to prove too great for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ate in the front room, with the plates balanced on our laps. He found a Coke for me and drank his two bottles of Chinese beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"It\u0027s funny. It was Homer\u0027s death that shocked me. He was a very old man by the time he died, older than anybody I\u0027d ever known, but I must have expected him to live forever. He wasn\u0027t the first to go, you know. He was the third.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a shock when Phil died, but a car crash, that\u0027s the kind of lightning that\u0027s always there. It\u0027s going to strike somebody sooner or later. Did you grow up in New York?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So did I. In the rest of the country you don\u0027t get through high school without having a friend or two die in a wreck. Every prom night you know there\u0027s going to be at least one car that doesn\u0027t make it around Dead Man\u0027s Curve. But kids don\u0027t drive in the city, so it\u0027s a form of population control we\u0027re spared here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, yes. There\u0027s always some form of attrition that thins out the ranks of the young males. Historically, war\u0027s always played that role, and did a fine job before the dawn of the nuclear age. Still, limited wars and local skirmishes take up the slack. In the ghettos, dope\u0027s the medium. Either they overdose on it or they traffic in it and shoot each other.\" He snorted. \"But I digress. If I ever write my memoirs that\u0027ll be the title. But I Digress.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-19.html","bookId":2330,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:24 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:24 AM"}
