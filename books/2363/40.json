I\u0027m always waking the old man up, Robert thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral answered on the sixth ring. \"Hello ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Admiral, I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert! What ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say anything. Your phone is probably bugged. I\u0027m going to make this fast. I just wanted to tell you not to believe anything they\u0027re saying about me. I\u0027d like you to try to find out what\u0027s going on. I may need your help later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Anything I can do, Robert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert replaced the receiver. No time for a trace. He saw a blue Fiat pull up outside the bar. Pier was at the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move over,\" Robert said. \"I\u0027ll drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier made room for him as he slid in behind the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we on our way to Venice?\" Pier asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh huh. We have a couple of stops to make first.\" It was time to spread some more chaff around. He turned onto Viale Rossini. Ahead was the Rossini Travel Service. Robert pulled over to the kerb. \"I\u0027ll be back in a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier watched him walk into the travel agency. I could just drive away, she.thought, and keep the money, and he would never find me. But the damn car is rented in my name. Cacchio!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the agency, Robert walked up to the woman behind the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good day. May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m Commander Robert Bellamy. I\u0027m going to do a bit of travelling,\" Robert told her. \"I\u0027d like to make some reservations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"That\u0027s what we are here for, signore. Where are you planning to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like a first-class airline ticket to Beijing, one way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a note. \"And when would you like to leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This Friday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good.\" She pressed some keys on the computer. \"There\u0027s an Air China flight leaving at seven forty p.m. Friday night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That will do nicely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed some more keys. \"There we are. Your reservation is confirmed. Will that be cash or ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m not through yet. I want to reserve a train ticket to Budapest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when would that be, Commander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next Monday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in what name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him strangely. \"You are flying to Beijing on Friday and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not finished,\" Robert said pleasantly. \"I want a one-way airline ticket to Miami, Florida, on Sunday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she was openly staring at him. \"Signore, if this is some kind of a ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert pulled out his ONI credit card and handed it to her. \"Just charge the tickets to this card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied it a moment. \"Excuse me.\" She went into the back office and came out a few minutes later. \"That will be perfectly all right. We will be happy to make the arrangements. Do you wish all the reservations under one name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Commander Robert Bellamy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert watched as she pressed more buttons on the computer. A minute later, three tickets appeared. She tore them off the printer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please put the tickets in separate envelopes,\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Would you like me to send them to ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take them with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Si, signore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert signed the credit card slip and she handed him his receipt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are. Have a nice trip ... trips ... er ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert grinned. \"Thanks.\" A minute later he was behind the wheel of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going now?\" Pier asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have just a few more stops to make,\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier watched him carefully scan the street again before pulling out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to do something for me,\" Robert told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it\u0027s coming, Pier thought. He\u0027s going to ask me to do something terrible. \"What is it?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had stopped in front of the Hotel Victoria. Robert handed Pier one of the envelopes. \"I want you to go to the desk and reserve a suite in the name of Commander Robert Bellamy. Tell them you\u0027re his secretary and that he\u0027ll be arriving in an hour, but that you want to go up to the suite and approve it. When you get inside, leave this envelope on a table in the room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him, puzzled. \"That\u0027s all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man made no sense at all. \"Bene.\" She wished she knew what the crazy American was up to. And who is Commander Robert Bellamy? Pier got out of the car and walked into the lobby of the hotel. She was a bit nervous. In the course of practising her profession, she had been thrown out of a few first-class hotels. But the clerk behind the desk greeted her politely. \"May I help you, signora?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the secretary to Commander Robert Bellamy. I wish to reserve a suite for him. He will be here in an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk consulted the room chart. \"We do happen to have one very nice suite available.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I see it, please?\" Pier asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. I\u0027ll have someone show it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn assistant manager escorted Pier upstairs. They walked into the living room of the suite and Pier looked around. \"Will this be satisfactory, signora?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier had not the faintest idea. \"Yes, this will be fine.\" She removed the envelope from her purse and laid it on a coffee table. \"I will leave this here for the Commander,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity got the better of Pier. She opened the envelope. Inside was a one-way plane ticket to Beijing in the name of Robert Bellamy. Pier put the ticket back in the envelope, left it on the table and went downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue Fiat was parked in front of the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any problem?\" Robert asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have just two more stops to make, and then we\u0027re on our way,\" Robert said cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next stop was the Hotel Valadier. Robert handed Pier another envelope. \"I want you to reserve a suite here in the name of Commander Robert Bellamy. Tell them he\u0027ll be checking in within an hour. Then ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I leave the envelope upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Pier walked into the hotel with more confidence. Just act like a lady, she thought. You\u0027ve got to have dignity. That\u0027s the fucking secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a suite available in the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like to look at it,\" Pier said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, signora.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn assistant manager escorted Pier upstairs. \"This is one of our nicest suites.\" It was beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier said haughtily, \"I suppose it might do. The Commander is very particular, you know.\" She took the second envelope out of her purse, opened it, and glanced inside. It contained a train ticket to Budapest in the name of Commander Robert Bellamy. Pier stared at it, confused. What kind of game is this? She left the ticket by the bed stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Pier returned to the car, Robert asked, \"How did it go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time it was the Hotel Leonardo da Vinci. Robert handed Pier the third envelope. \"I would like you to ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the hotel, a clerk said, \"Yes, indeed, signora, we have a lovely suite. When did you say the Commander will be arriving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In an hour. I would like to examine the suite to see if it is satisfactory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, signora.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe suite was more lavish than the other two Pier had looked at. The assistant manager showed her the huge bedroom with a large canopied bed in the centre. What a waste, Pier thought. In one night, I could make a fortune here. She took out the third envelope and looked inside. It contained an airplane ticket to Miami, Florida. Pier left the envelope on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assistant manager escorted Pier back to the living room. \"We have colour TV,\" he said. He walked over to the television set and turned it on. A picture of Robert leaped onto the screen. The anchorman\u0027s voice was saying: \"... and Interpol believes that he is presently in Rome. He is wanted for questioning in an international drug-smuggling operation. This is Bernard Shaw for CNN News.\" Pier was staring at the screen, transfixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assistant manager turned off the television set. \"Is everything satisfactory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Pier said slowly. A drug smuggler!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be looking forward to seeing the Commander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Pier joined Robert in the car downstairs, she looked at him with different eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now we\u0027re ready,\" Robert smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Hotel Victoria, a man in a dark suit was studying the guest register. He looked up at the clerk. \"What time did Commander Bellamy check in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has not been here yet. His secretary reserved the suite. She said he would be here within the hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man turned to his companion. \"Have the hotel staked out. Get reinforcements. I\u0027ll wait upstairs.\" He turned to the clerk. \"Open the suite for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree minutes later the clerk was opening the door to the suite. The man in the dark suit moved in cautiously, gun in hand. The suite was empty. He saw the envelope on the table and picked it up. The front of it read: \"Commander Robert Bellamy\". He opened the envelope and glanced inside. A moment later he was dialling the headquarters of SIFAR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cesar was in the middle of a meeting with Colonel Frank Johnson. Colonel Johnson had landed at Leonardo da Vinci airport two hours earlier, but he showed no signs of fatigue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As far as we know,\" Cesar was saying, \"Bellamy is still in Rome. We\u0027ve had more than thirty reports on his whereabouts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any of them check out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang. \"It\u0027s Luigi, Colonel,\" the voice on the telephone said. \"We\u0027ve got him. I\u0027m in his hotel suite at the Hotel Victoria. I have his airline ticket to Beijing. He is planning to leave Friday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCesar\u0027s voice filled with excitement. \"Good! Stay there. We will be right over.\" He hung up and turned to Colonel Johnson. \"I\u0027m afraid your journey was for nothing, Colonel. We\u0027ve got him. He\u0027s registered at the Hotel Victoria. They found an airline ticket in his name for Beijing on Friday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Johnson said mildly, \"Bellamy registered at the hotel in his own name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the plane ticket is in his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Colonel Cesar rose. \"Let\u0027s get on over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Johnson shook his head. \"Don\u0027t waste your time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bellamy would never ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone rang again. Cesar snatched it up. A voice said, \"Colonel? This is Mario. We\u0027ve located Bellamy. He\u0027s at the Hotel Valadier. He\u0027s taking a train Monday to Budapest. What do you want us to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get back to you,\" Colonel Cesar said. He turned to look at Colonel Johnson. \"They found a train ticket to Budapest in Bellamy\u0027s name. I don\u0027t understand what ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" His voice was pitched higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Bruno. We\u0027ve located Bellamy. He\u0027s registered at the Hotel Leonardo da Vinci. He\u0027s planning to leave Sunday for Miami. What shall I ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come back here,\" Cesar snapped. He slammed down the phone. \"What the hell is his game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Johnson said grimly. \"He\u0027s seeing to it that you\u0027re wasting a lot of manpower, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do now?\" \"We trap the bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were driving on the Via Cassia, near Olgiata, headed north toward Venice. The police would be covering all the major exits from Italy, but they would be expecting him to go west, to head for France or Switzerland. From Venice, Robert thought, I can take the hydrofoil to Trieste and make my way up to Austria. After that ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier\u0027s voice interrupted his thoughts. \"I\u0027m hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t had any breakfast or lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Robert said. He had been too preoccupied to think about eating. \"We\u0027ll stop at the next restaurant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier watched him as he drove. She was more puzzled than ever. She lived in a world of pimps and thieves, and drug smugglers. This man was no criminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped at the next town in front of a small trattoria. Robert pulled into the parking lot and he and Pier got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe restaurant was crowded with patrons, and noisy with conversation and the clatter of dishes. Robert found a table against the wall, and took a seat facing the door. A waiter approached and handed them menus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert was thinking: Susan should be on the boat by now. This may be my last chance to talk to her. \"Look over the menu.\" Robert rose. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier watched him walk over to the public telephone near their table. He put a coin in the slot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like to talk to the marine operator in Gibraltar. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho is he calling in Gibraltar? Pier wondered. Is that his get-away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Operator, I want to place a collect call to the American yacht, Halcyon, off Gibraltar. Whiskey Sugar 337. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes passed while the operators talked to each other and his call was accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert hear\u0027d Susan\u0027s voice on the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert! Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine. I just wanted to tell you ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you want to tell me. It\u0027s all over the radio and television. Why is Interpol hunting you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your time. I want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"It\u0027s political, Susan. I have evidence that some governments are trying to suppress. That\u0027s why Interpol is after me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier was listening intently to Robert\u0027s end of the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do to help?\" Susan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, honey. I just called to hear your voice once more in case ... in case I don\u0027t get out of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say that.\" There was panic in her voice. \"Can you tell me what country you\u0027re in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Italy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief silence. \"All right. We\u0027re not far from you. We\u0027re just off the coast of Gibraltar. We can pick you up at any place you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me. It\u0027s probably your only chance of escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t let you do that, Susan. You\u0027d be in jeopardy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonte had walked into the saloon in time to hear part of the conversation. \"Let me talk to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a moment, Robert, Monte wants to speak to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan, I haven\u0027t ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonte\u0027s voice came over the line. \"Robert, I understand you\u0027re in serious trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe understatement of the year. \"You might say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d like to help you out. They won\u0027t be looking for you on a yacht. Why don\u0027t you let us pick you up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Monte, I appreciate it. The answer is no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re making a mistake. You\u0027ll be safe here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was he so eager to help? \"Thanks, anyway. I\u0027ll take my chances. I\u0027d like to speak to Susan again ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Monte Banks handed the phone to Susan. \"Talk him into it,\" he urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan spoke into the phone. \"Please let us help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have helped me, Susan.\" He had to stop for a moment. \"You\u0027re the best part of my life. I just want you to know that I\u0027ll always love you.\" He gave a little laugh. \"Although always may not be such a big deal anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you call me again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly replaced the receiver. Why did I do that to her? Why did I do that to myself? You\u0027re a sentimental idiot, Bellamy. He walked back to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s eat,\" Robert said. They ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard your conversation. The police are looking for you, aren\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert stiffened. Careless. She was going to be trouble. \"It\u0027s just a little misunderstanding. I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t treat me like a fool. I want to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was watching her warily. \"Why should you help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePier leaned forward. \"Because you\u0027ve been generous to me. And I hate the police. You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like to be out on the streets, hounded by them, treated like dirt. They arrest me for prostitution, but they take me to their back rooms and pass me around. They are animals. I would do anything to get even with them. Anything. I can help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pier, there\u0027s nothing you ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Venice the police will catch you easily. If you stay at a hotel, they will find you. If you try to get on a ship, they will trap you. But I know a place where you will be safe from them. My mother and brother live in Naples. We can stay at their house. The police will never look for you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert was silent for a moment, thinking about it. What Pier said made a good deal of sense. A private house would be much safer than any other place, and Naples was a big port. It would be easy to get a ship out of there. He hesitated before he answered. He did not want to put Pier in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pier, if the police find me, they have orders to kill me. You would be considered an accomplice. You could be letting yourself in for trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very simple.\" Pier smiled. \"We won\u0027t let them find you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert returned her smile. He made up his mind. \"All right. Eat your lunch. We\u0027re going to Naples.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Frank Johnson said, \"Your men have no idea where he is headed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cesar sighed. \"Not at the moment. But it is only a matter of time before ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have time. Have you checked the whereabouts of his ex-wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His ex-wife? No. I don\u0027t see what ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you haven\u0027t done your homework,\" Colonel Johnson snapped. \"She\u0027s married to a man named Monte Banks. I would suggest that you locate them, and fast.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-doomsday-conspiracy/page-40.html","bookId":2363,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM"}
