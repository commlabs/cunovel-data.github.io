{"id":110703,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\u003cp\u003eTwenty-six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE to believe. The Strigoi were practically right next door to us, waiting for nightfall so that they could finish their escape. Apparently, in the chaos of the attack, some of the Strigoi had obscured their tracks while others had made it look as though they might have exited through any number of points on campus. Caught up in our own aftermath, no one had given it much thought. The wards had been restored. As far as we were concerned, the Strigoi were gone, and that was what mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we had an odd situation before us. Under normal circumstances - not that a massive Strigoi attack was normal - we would have never pursued them. Those kidnapped by Strigoi were usually written off as dead, and, as my mother had pointed out, guardians rarely knew where to look for Strigoi. This time, however, we knew. The Strigoi were essentially trapped. It presented an interesting dilemma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it wasn\u0027t a dilemma to me. I honestly couldn\u0027t figure out why we weren\u0027t in those caves right now, flushing out the Strigoi and looking for survivors. Dimitri and I hurried back, anxious to act on our news, but we had to wait until all the guardians gathered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not interrupt them,\" Dimitri told me as we were about to walk into the meeting that would decide our next course of action. We stood near the doorway, speaking in low voices. \"I know how you feel. I know what you want to do. But ranting at them isn\u0027t going to help you get your way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ranting?\" I exclaimed, forgetting to speak softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see it,\" he said. \"That fire\u0027s in you again - you want to tear somebody apart. It\u0027s what made you so deadly in the fight. But we\u0027re not fighting right now. The guardians have all the information. They\u0027ll make the right choice. You just have to be patient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of what he said was true. In preparation for the meeting, we had relayed all our information and then done some more searching. Investigation had revealed that several years ago, one of the Moroi teachers had taught a geology class and mapped the caves out, providing us with everything we needed to know about them. The entrance was five miles from the Academy\u0027s back borders. The caves\u0027 longest chamber was about half a mile long, the far side letting out about twenty miles from the dirt road on the map. It had been believed that landslides had blocked both entrances. Now, we realized, clearing those out wouldn\u0027t be too difficult with Strigoi strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wasn\u0027t sure I trusted what Dimitri said about the guardians making the right choice. Minutes before the meeting began, I appealed to my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" I told her. \"We have to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked me over. \"If there\u0027s a rescue, it\u0027s not going to be a \u0027we\u0027 thing. You aren\u0027t going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Because our numbers were so badass the first time that no guardians died?\" She flinched. \"You know I can help. You know what I did. I\u0027m a week away from my birthday and only a few months away from graduation. You think something magical\u0027s going to happen before then? I\u0027ve got a few more things to learn, yeah, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s big enough to stop me from helping. You guys need as much help as you can get, and there are plenty of other novices who are ready too. Bring Christian, and we\u0027ll be unstoppable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said quickly. \"Not him. You should have never gotten a Moroi involved, let alone one as young as him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you saw what he could do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t argue that. I saw the indecision on her face. She glanced at the time and sighed. \"Let me check something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know where she went, but she was fifteen minutes late for the meeting. By then, Alberta had already debriefed the guardians on what we\u0027d learned. Mercifully, she skipped the details about how we\u0027d gotten our data, so we didn\u0027t have to waste time explaining the ghost part. The caves\u0027 layout was examined in detail. People asked questions. Then decision time came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI braced myself. Fighting Strigoi had always meant relying on a defense strategy. We attacked only when attacked. Previous arguments for an offensive had always failed. I expected the same now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly it didn\u0027t come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne by one, the guardians stood up and expressed their commitment to going on the rescue mission. As they did, I saw that fire Dimitri had spoken of. Everyone was ready for a fight. They wanted it. The Strigoi had gone too far. In our world, there were only a handful of places that were safe: the Royal Court and our academies. Children were sent to places like St. Vladimir\u0027s with the certainty they would be protected. That certainty had been shattered, and we wouldn\u0027t stand for that, especially if we could still save lives. An eager, victorious feeling burned in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" said Alberta, glancing around. I think she was as surprised as I was, though she too had been in favor of a rescue. \"We\u0027ll plan the logistics and head out. We\u0027ve still got about nine hours of daylight to go after them before they leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" said my mother, standing up. All eyes turned to her, but she didn\u0027t bat an eyelash under the scrutiny. She looked fierce and capable, and I was immensely proud of her. \"I think there\u0027s one other thing we should consider. I think we should allow some of the senior novices to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis started a small outcry, but it only came from a minority. My mother gave an argument similar to what I had given her. She also maintained that novices would not be in the front lines but that we would serve more as backup should any Strigoi get through. The guardians had almost approved of this idea when she dropped another bomb on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we should bring some Moroi with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeleste shot up. She had a huge gash on the side of her face. It made the bruise I\u0027d seen on her the other day seem like a mosquito bite. \"What? Are you insane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother fixed her with a calm look. \"No. We all know what Rose and Christian Ozera did. One of our biggest problems with Strigoi is getting past their strength and speed to go in for the kill. If we bring fire-using Moroi, we have a distraction that will give us an edge. We can cut them down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA debate broke out. It took every ounce of self-control I had not to join in. I remembered Dimitri\u0027s words about not interrupting. Yet as I listened, I couldn\u0027t help my frustration. Every minute that passed was another minute we weren\u0027t going after Eddie and the others. It was another minute in which someone might die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to where Dimitri sat beside me. \"They\u0027re being idiots,\" I hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were on Alberta, as she debated a guardian who usually worked the elementary campus. \"No,\" murmured Dimitri. \"Watch. Change is happening before your eyes. People are going to remember this day as a turning point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was right. Once again, the guardians slowly signed on with the idea. I think it was part of that same initiative that made them want to fight in the first place. We had to get back at the Strigoi. This was more than our fight - it was the Moroi\u0027s too. When my mother said she\u0027d gotten a number of teachers to volunteer - they absolutely wouldn\u0027t allow students for this - the decision was made. The guardians were going after the Strigoi, and novices and Moroi would go with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt triumphant and exultant. Dimitri was right. This was the moment our world would change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not for four hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More guardians are coming,\" Dimitri told me when I once again expressed my outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In four hours, the Strigoi could have decided to have a snack!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need an overwhelming show of force,\" he said. \"We need every edge we can get. Yes, the Strigoi could kill a couple more before we get there. I don\u0027t want that, believe me. But if we go in unprepared, we could lose more lives than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy blood boiled. I knew he was right, and there was nothing I could do about it. I hated that. I hated being helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" he said, gesturing toward the exit. \"Let\u0027s take a walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. We just need to get you calmed down, or you\u0027ll be in no shape to fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Are you afraid of my possibly insane dark side coming out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m afraid of your normal Rose Hathaway side coming out, the one that isn\u0027t afraid to jump in without thinking when she believes something is right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a dry look. \"Is there a difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. The second one scares me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resisted the urge to elbow him. For half a heartbeat, I wished I could close my eyes and forget about all the hurt and bloodshed around us. I wanted to lounge in bed with him, laughing and teasing, with neither of us worried about anything else except each other. That wasn\u0027t real, though. This was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t they need you here?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Most of what they\u0027re doing now is waiting for the others, and they have more than enough people right now to help plan the attack. Your mother\u0027s leading that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed his gaze to where my mom stood, in the center of a group of guardians, pointing with sharp, forceful motions toward what looked like maps. I still never quite knew what to think about her, but watching her now, I couldn\u0027t help but admire her dedication. There was none of the dysfunctional annoyance I usually experienced around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took me on a loop around campus, and we surveyed some of the aftermath. Most of the damage wasn\u0027t to the campus itself, of course. It was to our people. Still, we could see some signs of the attack: damage to buildings, bloodstains in unexpected places, etc. Most noticeable of all was the mood. Even in full daylight, there was a darkness around us, a heavy sorrow that you could almost reach out and feel. I saw it on the faces of everyone we passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI half-expected Dimitri to take me through where some of the injured were. He steered clear of that, however, and I could guess why. Lissa was helping out there, using her powers in small doses to heal the wounded. Adrian was as well, though he couldn\u0027t do nearly as much as her. They\u0027d finally decided that it was worth risking everyone knowing about spirit. The tragedy here was too great. Besides, so much about spirit had gotten out at the trial that it had probably only been a matter of time anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri didn\u0027t want me near Lissa while she was using her magic, which I found interesting. He still didn\u0027t know if I really was \"catching\" her madness, but he apparently didn\u0027t want to take any chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me you had a theory about why the wards broke,\" he said. We\u0027d extended our circuit of campus, not far from where Jesse\u0027s society had met last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d nearly forgotten. Once I\u0027d pieced it together, the reason had been perfectly obvious. No one had really asked many questions about it, not yet. The immediate concerns had been to get new wards up and tend to our own people. The investigation would occur later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesse\u0027s group was doing their initiation right here by the wards. You know how stakes can negate wards because the elements go against each other? I think it\u0027s the same thing. Their initiation rights used all the elements, and I think they negated the wards in the same way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Magic is used all the time on campus, though,\" pointed out Dimitri. \"In all the elements. Why has this never happened before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the magic isn\u0027t usually happening right on top of the wards. The wards are on the edges, so the two don\u0027t usually conflict. Also, I think it makes a difference in how the elements are being used. Magic is life, which is why it destroys Strigoi and why they can\u0027t cross it. The magic in stakes is used as a weapon. So was the magic in the torture session. When it\u0027s used in that sort of negative way, I think it cancels out good magic.\" I shivered, recalling that sickening feeling I\u0027d felt when Lissa had used spirit to torment Jesse. It hadn\u0027t been natural.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri stared at a broken fence that marked one of the Academy\u0027s boundaries. \"Incredible. I never would have thought that was possible, but it makes sense. The principle really is the same as for the stakes.\" He smiled at me. \"You\u0027ve thought about this a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. It just sort of fell together in my head.\" I glowered, thinking of Jesse\u0027s idiotic group. Bad enough they\u0027d done what they did to Lissa. That was enough to make me want to go kick their asses (though not kill them anymore -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027d learned some restraint since last night). But this? Letting Strigoi into the school? How could something so stupid and petty on their part have led to this sort of disaster? It almost would have been better if they\u0027d tried to make this happen, but no. It had come about through their glory-seeking game. \"Idiots,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind picked up. I shivered, and this time it was from the chilly temperature, not my own unease. Spring might be coming, but it certainly wasn\u0027t here yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get back inside,\" Dimitri said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turned around, and as we walked toward the heart of the secondary campus, I saw it. The cabin. Neither of us slowed down or obviously looked at it, but I knew he was just as acutely aware of it as I was. He proved it when he spoke a moment later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose, about what happened - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned. \"I knew it. I knew this was going to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over at me, startled. \"That what was going to happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This. The part where you give me the huge lecture about how what we did was wrong and how we shouldn\u0027t have done it and how it\u0027s never going to happen again.\" Until the words left my mouth, I didn\u0027t realize how much I\u0027d feared he would say that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still looked shocked. \"Why would you think that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because that\u0027s how you are,\" I told him. I think I sounded a little hysterical. \"You always want to do the right thing. And when you do the wrong thing, you then have to fix it and do the right thing. And I know you\u0027re going to say that what we did shouldn\u0027t have happened and that you wish - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of what I might have said was smothered as Dimitri wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me to him in the shadow of a tree. Our lips met, and as we kissed, I forgot all about my worries and fears that he\u0027d say what we\u0027d done was a mistake. I even - as impossible as it seems - forgot about the death and destruction of the Strigoi. Just for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we finally broke apart, he still kept me close to him. \"I don\u0027t think what we did was wrong,\" he said softly. \"I\u0027m glad we did it. If we could go back in time, I\u0027d do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA swirling feeling burned within my chest. \"Really? What made you change your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re hard to resist,\" he said, clearly amused at my surprise. \"And ... do you remember what Rhonda said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another shock, hearing her brought up. But then I recalled his face when he\u0027d listened to her and what he\u0027d said about his grandmother. I tried to remember Rhonda\u0027s exact words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something about how you\u0027re going to lose something...\" I apparently didn\u0027t remember it so well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027You will lose what you value most, so treasure it while you can.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, he knew it word for word. I\u0027d scoffed at the words at the time, but now I tried to decipher them. At first, I felt a surge of joy: I was what he valued most. Then I gave him a startled look. \"Wait. You think I\u0027m going to die? That\u0027s why you slept with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, of course not. I did what I did because ... believe me, it wasn\u0027t because of that. Regardless of the specifics - or if it\u0027s even true - she was right about how easily things can change. We try to do what\u0027s right, or rather, what others say is right. But sometimes, when that goes against who we are...you have to choose. Even before the Strigoi attack, as I watched all the problems you were struggling with, I realized how much you meant to me. It changed everything. I was worried about you - so, so worried. You have no idea. And it became useless to try to act like I could ever put any Moroi life above yours. It\u0027s not going to happen, no matter how wrong others say it is. And so I decided that\u0027s something I have to deal with. Once I made that decision ... there was nothing to hold us back.\" He hesitated, seeming to replay his words as he brushed my hair from my face. \"Well, to hold me back. I\u0027m speaking for myself. I don\u0027t mean to act like I know exactly why you did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did it because I love you,\" I said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. And really, it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"You can sum up in one sentence what it takes me a whole speech to get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s that simple. I love you, and I don\u0027t want to keep pretending like I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t either.\" His hand dropped from my face and found my hand. Fingers entwined, we began walking again. \"I don\u0027t want any more lies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027ll happen now? With us, I mean. Once all of this is done ... with the Strigoi...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, as much as I hate to reinforce your fears, you were right about one thing. We can\u0027t be together again - for the rest of the school year, that is. We\u0027re going to have to keep our distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a little disappointed by this, but I knew with certainty he was right. We might finally have reached the point where we weren\u0027t going to deny our relationship anymore, but we could hardly flaunt it while I was still his student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur feet splashed through slush. A few scattered birds sang in the trees, undoubtedly surprised to see so much activity in daylight around here. Dimitri stared off into the sky ahead, face thoughtful. \"After you graduate and are out with Lissa ...\" He didn\u0027t finish. It took me a moment, but I realized what he was about to say. My heart nearly stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to ask to be reassigned, aren\u0027t you? You won\u0027t be her guardian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only way we can be together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we won\u0027t actually be together,\" I pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Us staying with her gives us the same problem - me worrying more about you than her. She needs two guardians perfectly dedicated to her. If I can get assigned somewhere at Court, we\u0027ll be near each other all the time. And in a secure place like that, there\u0027s more flexibility with a guardian\u0027s schedule.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA whiny, selfish part of me wanted to immediately jump in with how much that sucked, but really, it didn\u0027t. There was no option we had that was ideal. Each one came with hard choices. I knew it was hard for him to give up Lissa. He cared about her and wanted to keep her safe with a passion that almost rivaled my own. But he cared about me more, and he had to make that sacrifice if he still wanted to honor his sense of duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I said, realizing something, \"we might actually see more of each other if we\u0027re guarding different people. We can get time off together. If we were both with Lissa, we\u0027d be swapping shifts and always be apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trees were thinning up ahead, which was a shame, because I didn\u0027t want to let go of his hand. Still, a surge of hope and joy began to blossom in my chest. It felt wrong in the wake of such tragedy, but I couldn\u0027t help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all this time, after all the heartache, Dimitri and I were going to make this work. There was always the possibility he could get assigned away from the Court, but even so, we\u0027d still manage to get some time off together every once in a while. The time apart would be agony, but we would make it work. And it would be better than continuing to live a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it was really going to happen. All of Deirdre\u0027s worries about me coping with conflicting pieces of my life would be for nothing. I was going to have it all. Lissa and Dimitri. The thought that I could be with both of them was going to make me strong. It would carry me through this Strigoi attack. I\u0027d tuck it away in the back of my mind, like a good luck charm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri and I didn\u0027t say anything else for a while. Like always, we didn\u0027t have to. I knew he was feeling the same happy buzz I was, despite that stoic exterior. We were almost out of the forest, back in sight of the others, when he spoke again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be eighteen soon, but even so...\" He sighed. \"When this comes out, a lot of people aren\u0027t going to be happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, they can deal.\" Rumors and gossip I could handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also have a feeling your mother\u0027s going to have a very ugly conversation with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re about to face down Strigoi, and my mother\u0027s the one you\u0027re scared of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see a smile playing at his lips. \"She\u0027s a force to be reckoned with. Where do you think you got it from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"It\u0027s a wonder you bother with me then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re worth it, believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me again, using the last of the forest\u0027s shadows for cover. In a normal world, this would have been a happy, romantic walk the morning after sex. We wouldn\u0027t be preparing for battle and worrying about our loved ones. We\u0027d be laughing and teasing each other while secretly planning our next romantic getaway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t live in a normal world, of course, but in this kiss, it was easy to imagine we did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and I reluctantly broke apart and left the woods, heading back toward the guardians\u0027 building. Dark times were ahead of us, but with his kiss still burning on my lips, I felt like I could do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven face down a pack of Strigoi. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-26.html","bookId":2062,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:24 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:24 AM"}
