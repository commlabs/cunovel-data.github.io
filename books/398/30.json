{"id":24729,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII THE DRUM-HEAD MARRIAGE","content":"\u0026nbsp;That same day, about four o\u0027clock in the afternoon, the two generals were bending over a large map of the department of the Lower Rhine. Charles sat writing at a little distance from them, dressed in a becoming coat of dark blue, with pale blue facings and collar, and wearing the red cap of the staff secretaries. This cap[Pg 182] was what he had found in the package referred to by the general. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two generals had just decided that the following day, the 21st of December, the troops should pass over the curved line which divides Dawendorff from the heights of Reichsoffen, Froeschwiller and Woerth, where the Prussians were intrenched; these heights once carried, communication with Weissembourg would be cut off, and Haguenau, thus isolated, would be compelled to surrender. The army was to march in three columns, two to attack in front, and the third, traversing the woods and uniting with the artillery, to attack the Prussians on the flank.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As fast as they arrived at each decision, Charles wrote them down and Pichegru signed them; then the division commanders, who were waiting in another room, were called, and each departed to rejoin his regiment, and to hold himself in readiness to execute the order he had just received.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While they were thus engaged, word was brought to Hoche that the battalion of the rear-guard, having been unable to find quarters in the village, refused to bivouac in the fields, and showed signs of insubordination. Hoche asked the number of the battalion, and learned that it was the third.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well,\" he said, \"go and tell the third battalion for me that it will not have the honor of sharing in the first attack,\" and he calmly continued to issue his orders.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A quarter of an hour later four soldiers from the mutinous battalion entered, and, in the name of their comrades, asked the general\u0027s pardon, and requested permission for the battalion, which was about to bivouac on the spot indicated, to march first against the enemy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That cannot be,\" said Pichegru; \"the battalion of the Indre deserves a reward, and they are to march first, but you shall be second.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The last orders had just been issued when an organ-grinder began to play the first strains of the \"Marseillaise,\" \"Allons enfants de la patrie,\" beneath the general\u0027s window.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 183]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hoche paid no attention to the serenade, but Pichegru, at the first notes of the organ, listened attentively, then went to the window and opened it. An organ-grinder was persistently turning the handle of a box which he carried in front of him; but as darkness had set in, he could not distinguish the man\u0027s features. On the other hand, as the courtyard was full of persons going and coming, Pichegru probably did not care to run the risk of exchanging a word with him. He therefore drew back, and closed the window, although the tune still went on. But, turning to his young secretary, he said: \"Charles, run down to the organ-grinder. Say \u0027Spartacus\u0027 to him, and if he replies \u0027Kosciusko\u0027 bring him up here. If he makes no reply, I have made a mistake, and you can leave him where he is.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Charles rose and went out without asking any questions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The organ continued to play the \"Marseillaise\" perseveringly and Pichegru listened attentively. Hoche looked at Pichegru, expecting some explanation of this mystery. Then the organ stopped suddenly in the midst of a measure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pichegru nodded smilingly to Hoche. A moment later the door opened, and Charles entered, followed by the organ-grinder. Pichegru looked at him for a moment without speaking; he did not recognize the man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The person whom Charles had brought into the room was a little below medium height and wore the Alsatian peasant\u0027s costume. His long black hair hung straight down over his forehead, and he wore a broad-brimmed hat. He looked about forty-five years old.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My friend,\" said Pichegru to the musician, \"I think this child has made a mistake, and that I have no business with you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"General, there can be no mistake in a watchword, and if you have any business with Stephan Moinjski, here he is.\" With these words he raised his hat, threw back his hair, and drew himself up to his full height; and, save for the hair and the black beard, Pichegru saw before him the same man with whom he had talked at Auenheim.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 184]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Stephan?\" asked the general.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, general,\" replied the spy, \"I know nearly all that you bade me find out.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then put aside your organ and come here. Listen, Hoche; this is some information in regard to the enemy. I am afraid,\" he added, turning to Stephan, \"that you have not taken enough time to make your search very thorough.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I do not know about Woerth, because an inhabitant of that town has agreed to give us information about it when we arrive at Froeschwilier; but I can tell you all you want to know about Froeschwiller and Reichsoffen.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Go on.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The enemy have abandoned Reichsoffen, in order to concentrate upon Froeschwiller and Woerth. Having learned that the junction of your two armies has been effected, they have concentrated upon those two points, which they intend to defend to the utmost. These two positions, which have excellent natural fortifications, have been covered with fresh works; intrenchments have been dug and bastions and redoubts have been erected. The enemy, both at the bridge of Reichsoffen, which they intend to defend as well, and on the heights of Froeschwiller and Woerth, number about twenty-two thousand men, and have thirty pieces of artillery, five of which have been detached for use at the bridge. And now,\" continued Stephan, \"as your first attack will probably be made at Froeschwiller, here is a plan of the ground occupied by the enemy. The force under the command of the Prince de Condé occupies the village. I have no grudge against these men, for they are French. Once master of the heights, you command the city, and consequently it is yours. As for Woerth, I promise nothing as yet; but I may say I hope to show you how to take it without a struggle.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two generals examined the plan, which was made with the accuracy of a skilled engineer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 185]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Upon my word, general,\" said Hoche, \"you are fortunate in having spies who are capable of becoming officers of merit.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My dear Hoche,\" said Pichegru, \"this citizen is a Pole; he is not a spy, he is revenging himself.\" Then, turning to Stephan, he said: \"Thanks! you have kept your word, and amply; but your work is only half accomplished. Will you engage to find us two guides who know their way so thoroughly that they could not lose it, even on the darkest night? You will walk near one of them, and you will kill him on the first sign of hesitation on his part; I will walk near the other. As you probably have no pistols, here are two.\" And the general gave a couple of pistols to Stephan, who received them with mingled pride and joy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will find guides to be depended upon,\" he said, with his customary laconism. \"How much time can you give me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Half an hour; three-quarters at the outside.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The pretended musician shouldered his organ, and turned toward the door; but before he reached it, Faraud, the Parisian, slipped his head through the opening.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh! I beg your pardon, general; upon the word of a sergeant, I thought you were alone,\" he said. \"But I will go out again, and knock gently, as they used to do in the days of the old tyrant, if you wish.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No,\" replied Pichegru; \"since you are here, never mind; come in.\" Then, turning to General Hoche, he said: \"General, let me present one of my braves to you. He is afraid of wolves, it is true, but not of Prussians; he took two of them prisoners this morning, and it was for that that I had those stripes put on his sleeve.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Heavens!\" said Faraud. \"More generals! I shall have two witnesses instead of one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"May I remind you, Faraud,\" said Pichegru, in that kindly tone he adopted toward his soldiers when he was in a good humor, \"that this is the second time that I have had the pleasure of seeing you to-day?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 186]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, general,\" replied Faraud; \"days of happiness do come sometimes, and days of ill-luck at others; there are times when one simply can\u0027t help turning trumps.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose,\" said Pichegru, laughing, \"that you did not come here merely to talk transcendental philosophy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"General, I came to ask you to be my witness.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your witness!\" exclaimed Pichegru. \"Are you going to fight a duel?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Worse than that, general; I am going to be married.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good! And to whom?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The Goddess of Reason.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are in luck, you rascal\u0027,\" said Pichegru; \"she is the prettiest and the best girl in the army. How did it happen? Come, tell us all about it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh! it is very simple, general. I do not need to tell you that I am a Parisian, do I?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I know it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, the Goddess of Reason comes from Paris, too. We are from the same quartier. I loved her, and she did not repulse me when the procession of the \u0027Country in Danger\u0027 passed with its black flags and its rolling drums. Then citizen Danton came to our faubourg, saying, \u0027To arms! The enemy is only four days\u0027 march from Paris.\u0027 I was a carpenter\u0027s apprentice, but all this upset me. The enemy only four days\u0027 march from Paris! The country in danger! \u0027Faraud,\u0027 I said, \u0027you must repulse the enemy, you must save the country.\u0027 I threw away my plane, caught up my gun, and went off to enlist under the flag of our municipality. The same day I went to the Goddess of Reason, and told her that, as her sweet eyes had driven me to desperation, I was going to be a soldier in order to get finished off quickly; then Rose said to me—her name is Rose Charleroi—well, then, Rose Charleroi, the same as used to take in fine washing, said to me: \u0027As truly as there is but one God, whom they are going to dethrone also, from what I hear, if my poor mother were not sick, I should enlist also!\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 187]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Ah! Rose,\u0027 said I, \u0027women do not enlist\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Yes, they do,\u0027 she replied, \u0027as vivandières.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Rose,\u0027 I answered, \u0027I will write you once a fortnight, to let you know where I am; and if you enlist, enlist in my regiment.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Agreed!\u0027 she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We clasped hands, embraced each other, and away went Faraud. After Jemmapes, where my regiment was cut to pieces, they put us with the volunteers of the Indre and brought us up the Rhine. Whom did I see six or eight weeks ago but Rose Charleroi! Her poor mother was dead, and she had been chosen as the best and most beautiful girl of the quartier to be the Goddess of Reason in some celebration or other, and after that, upon my word, she kept her promise to me, and descended from her pedestal to enlist. I attempted to embrace her. \u0027Idle, lazy fellow,\u0027 she said to me, \u0027not even a corporal?\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027What would you have, Goddess? I said to her; \u0027I am not ambitious.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Well, I am ambitious,\u0027 she said; \u0027don\u0027t come near me until you are a sergeant, unless it be to get something to drink.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027On the day that I am a sergeant will you marry me?\u0027 I asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027I swear it on the flag of the regiment.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She has kept her word, general. We are to be married in ten minutes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In the courtyard, under your windows, general.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And who is to marry you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The drummer of the regiment.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What, a drum-head marriage?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, general; Rose wants everything to be regular.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Excellent,\" said Pichegru, laughing. \"I recognize the Goddess of Reason there! Tell her that, since she has asked me to be her witness, I will give her a dowry.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A dowry, general?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 188]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, a donkey with two barrels of brandy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh! general, it is your fault that I don\u0027t dare ask anything else of you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Tell me what it is, anyway.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, it is for my comrades rather than myself. The day ought to end as it began, with a ball.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" said Hoche, \"as the second witness, I will pay for the ball.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And the town-hall will do for a ballroom,\" said Pichegru. \"But you must tell them all that the ball must finish at two o\u0027clock in the morning, as we are to march at half-past two; we have twelve miles to go before daybreak. You are warned; those who wish to sleep may sleep, and those who wish to dance may dance. We will witness the marriage from the balcony; when all is ready we will know it by the rolling of the drums.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Intoxicated with all these promises, Faraud hastened downstairs, and soon the buzz of preparations could be heard in the courtyard. The two generals, once more alone, definitively arranged the plans for the following day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One column, which was to start at once, under the orders of Colonel René Savary, was to make a forced march, so as to reach the village of Neuwiller, back of Froeschwiller, about noon. On hearing the first firing they were to march upon Froeschwiller, and attack the Prussians in the rear. A second column, under Macdonald, was to cross the Zeuzel at Niederbronn. The two generals were to march with this column. The third was to make a demonstration at the bridge of Reichsoffen, and endeavor to carry it. If it was impregnable, the column was merely to keep the enemy busy while the other two columns turned the enemy\u0027s position. This third column was to be under command of Abatucci.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n These arrangements were scarcely completed before the rolling of a drum informed the generals that they were needed to complete the wedding-party, and they lost no time in showing themselves upon the balcony.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 189]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As they came out, a tremendous cheer was raised; Faraud saluted in his own peculiar manner, and the Goddess of Reason became as red as a cherry. The whole staff surrounded the couple. It was the first time that this singular ceremony, which was afterward repeated so frequently during the three revolutionary wars, had taken place in the Army of the Rhine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come!\" said Faraud, \"to your post, Spartacus.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The drummer, thus adjured by Faraud, got upon a table, before which the bride and groom placed themselves.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a long rolling of the drum; then Spartacus cried in a loud voice, so that no one present might lose a word of what was said: \"Listen to the law! Whereas, it is not always possible in the field to find an official with stamped paper and floating scarf to open the doors of Hymen, I, Pierre-Antoine Bichonneau, called Spartacus, head drummer of the battalion of the Indre, proceed lawfully to unite in marriage Pierre-Claude Faraud and Rose Charleroi, vivandière of the twenty-fourth regiment.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spartacus here interrupted himself by rolling his drum, which was imitated by all the drummers of the battalion of the Indre and the twenty-fourth regiment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then, when the sound had ceased, he said: \"Draw near, you who are to be united in matrimony.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The couple came a step nearer to the table.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In the presence of the citizen-generals Lazare Hoche and Charles Pichegru, the battalion of the Indre, the twenty-fourth regiment, and any one else who happens to be present in the courtyard of the town-hall, in the name of the Republic, one and indivisible, I unite you and I bless you!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spartacus executed another roll of the drum, while two sergeants of the battalion of the Indre held a banner, intended to do duty as a canopy, over the heads of the bride and groom; after which Spartacus resumed: \"Citizen Pierre-Claude Faraud, you promise your wife protection and love, do you not?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 190]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The deuce!\" said Faraud.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Citizeness Rose Charleroi, you promise your husband constancy, fidelity, and a little mouthful to drink now and then, do you not?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" replied Rose Charleroi.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In the name of the law, you are married! The regiment will adopt your numerous offspring. Wait now; don\u0027t go away!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A rolling of twenty-five drums was heard, which ceased suddenly at a sign from Spartacus. \"Without that you would not have been happy,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two generals applauded laughingly, and nothing was heard in the courtyard except cheers and hurrahs, which gradually gave place to the clinking of glasses.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3318/90786.html","bookId":398,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 3:43:15 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 3:43:15 PM"}
