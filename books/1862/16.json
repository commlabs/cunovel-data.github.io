Mary-Lynnette felt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher arms grabbed from behind. Something was pulling her hands together-somethingstrong. Then she felt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe bite of cord on her wrists, and she realized what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTied up-I\u0027m going to be helpless-I\u0027ve got todosomething fast....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought, trying to wrench herself away, trying to kick. But it was already too late.

Ithurt. Her shoulders gave a shriek of agony as she was dragged backward\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eup against a tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop fighting,\" a voice snarled. A thick, distorted voice she didn\u0027t recognize. She tried to see\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho it was, but the tree was in the way. \"If you relax itwon\u0027t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. Mary-Lynnette kept fighting, but it didn\u0027t make any difference. She could feel the deeply furrowedbark\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof the tree against her hands and back-and now she couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, oh, God-1 can\u0027t get away.

Use your brain instead of getting hysterical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette stopped struggling. She stood panting and tried to get control of her terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you. It only hurts when you fight. A lot of things are like that,\" the voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette twisted her head and saw who it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart gave a sick lurch. She shouldn\u0027t havebeen surprised, but she was-surprised and infi nitely\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edisappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jeremy,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that it was a different Jeremy than the one she knew. His face was the same, his hair, his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclothes-but there was something weird about him, something powerful and scary and ...unknowable. His\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes were as inhuman and flat as a shark\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to hurt you,\" he said in that distorted stranger\u0027s voice. \"I only tied you up because I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t want you to interfere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s mind was registering different things in different layers. One part said, MyGod, he\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrying to be friendly, and another part said, Tointerferewith what? and a third part just kept saying Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Ash. He was lyingverystill, andMary-Lynnette\u0027s wonderful new eyes that could seecolors\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein moonlight saw that his blond hair was slowly soaking with blood. On the ground beside himwas a club\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emade of yew - made of the hard yellow sapwood. No wonder he was unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if he\u0027s bleeding he\u0027s not dead-oh, God, please,he can\u0027tbe dead-Rowan said that only staking and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eburning kill vampires....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to take dare of him,\" Jeremy said. \"And then I\u0027ll let you go, I promise. Once I explain\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeverything, you\u0027ll understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette looked up from Ash to the strangerwith Jeremy\u0027s face. With a shock, she realized what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe meant by \"take care of.\" Three words that were just part of life to a hunterto a werewolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now I know about werewolves. They\u0027re killers and I was right all along. I was right and Rowan was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll only take a minute,\" Jeremy said-and hislips drew back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s heart seemed to slam violently inside her chest. Because his lips went farther up than\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eany human\u0027s lips could. She could see his gums, whitish-pink. And she could see why his voice didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esound like Jeremy\u0027s-it was his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite teeth in the moonlight. The teeth from herdream. Vampire teeth were nothing compared to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incisors at the front were made for cutting fleshfrom prey, the canines were two inches long, the teeth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebehind them looked designed for slicing and shearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette suddenly remembered-somethingVic Kimble\u0027s father had said three years ago. He\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid that a wolf could snap off the tail of a full-grown cow clean as pruning shears. He\u0027d been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomplaining that somebody had let a wolf-dog crossbreed looseand it was going after his cattle....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that of course it wasn\u0027t a crossbreed, Mary-Lynnette thought. It was Jeremy. I saw him everyday\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat school-and then he must have gone hometo look like this. Tohunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust now, as he stood over Ash with his teeth all exposed and his chest heaving, Jeremy looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecompletely, quietly insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" Mary-Lynnette burst out.\"Whydo youwant to hurt him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy looked up-and she got another shock. His eyes were different. Before she\u0027d seen them flash\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhite in the darkness. Now they had no whites at all. They were brown with large liquid pupils. Theeyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof an animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it doesn\u0027t need to be a full moon, she thought. He can change anytime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you know?\" he said. \"Doesn\u0027t anybody understand?This ismy territory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh.Oh ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it was as simple as that. After all their brainstorming and arguing and detective work. In the end it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas something as basic as an animal protectingits range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a hunting range, it is small,\" Rowan had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were taking my game,\" Jeremy said. \"My deer, my squirrels. They didn\u0027t have any right to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edothat. I tried to make them leave-but they wouldn\u0027t.They stayed and they kept killing....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped talking-but a new sound came fromhim. It started out almost below the range of MaryLynnette\u0027s hearing-but the deep rumbling of itstruck some primal chord of terror in her. It was asuncanny\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand inhuman as the danger-hum of an at tacking swarm of bees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowling. He was growling. And it wasreal.The snarling growl a dog makes that tells you to turn and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erun. The sound it makes before it springs at yourthroat....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeremy!\" Mary-Lynnette screamed. She threwherself forward, ignoring the white blaze of pain in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher shoulders. But the cord held. She was jerked back. And Jeremy fell on Ash, lunging down, head\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edarting forward like a striking snake, like a biting dog, like every animal that kills with its teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette heard someone screaming \"No!\"and only later realized that it was her. She was fight ing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith the cord, and she could feel stinging and wetness at her wrists. But she couldn\u0027t get free andshe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t stop seeing what was happening in frontof her. And all the time that eerie, vicious growling that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereverberated in Mary-Lynnette\u0027s own head and chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when things went cold and dear. Some part of Mary-Lynnette that was stronger than the panic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etook over. It stepped back and looked at the entire scene by the roadside: the car, which was still\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eburning, sending clouds of choking white smokewhenever the wind blew the right way; the limpfigure of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh on the pine needles; the blur of snarling motion that was Jeremy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeremy!\" she said, and her throat hurt, but hervoice was calm-and commanding. \"Jeremy-before\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou do that-don\u0027t you want me tounderstand? You said that was what you wanted. Jeremy,help me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long second she thought in dismay that it wasn\u0027t going to work. That he couldn\u0027t even hear her. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen his head lifted. She saw his face; she saw the blood on his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t scream, don\u0027t scream, Mary-Lynnette toldherself frantically. Don\u0027t show any shock. You have to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekeep him talking, keep him away from Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her back her hands were working automatically, as if trying to get out of ropes was something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey\u0027d always known how to do. The slick wetness actually helped. She could feel the cords slide a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please help me understand,\" she said again, breathless, but trying to hold Jeremy\u0027s eyes. \"I\u0027m\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour friend-you know that. We go back a long way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy\u0027s whitish gums were streaked with red. He still had human features, but there was nothing at all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehuman about that face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, though-slowly-his lips came down tocover his gums. He looked more like a person andless like an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanimal. And when he spoke, his voicewas distorted, but she could recognize it as Jere my\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do go back,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve watched you sincewe were kids-and I\u0027ve seen you watching\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette nodded.She couldn\u0027tgetany words out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always figured that someday, when we wereolder-maybe we\u0027d be together. I thought maybe I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould make you understand. About me. About everything. I thought you were the one person who might\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enot be afraid....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not,\" Mary-Lynnette said, and hoped hervoice wasn\u0027t shaking too badly. She was saying it to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea figure in a blood-spattered shirt crouching over a torn body like a beast still ready to attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryLynnette didn\u0027t dare look at Ash to see how badly hewas hurt. She kept her eyes locked on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy\u0027s. \"And I think I can understand. You killed Mrs. Burdock, didn\u0027t you? Because she was on your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eterritory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nother; \" Jeremy said, and his voice was sharpwith impatience. \"She was just an old lady-she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t hunt. I didn\u0027t mind having her in my range. Ieven did things for her, like fixing her fence andporch\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor free.... And that\u0027s when she told methey were coming. Those girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust the way she told me, Mary-Lynnette thought, with dazed revelation. And he was there fixing the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efence-of course. The way he does odd jobs for everybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told her it wouldn\u0027t work.\" Mary-Lynnette couldhear it again-the beginnings of a snarling growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy was tense and trembling, and she could feel her self start to tremble, too. \"Three more hunters in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethislittle place ... I told her, but she wouldn\u0027t listen. She couldn\u0027t see. So then I lost my temper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t look at Ash, don\u0027t call attention to him,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette thought desperately. Jeremy\u0027s lips were drawing back again as if he needed something to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eattack. At the same time the distant part of hermind said, So that\u0027s why he used a picket\u003dAsh was right;it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas an impulse of the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, anybody can lose their temper,\" she said, and even though her voice cracked and there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere tears in her eyes, Jeremy seemed to calm a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afterward, I thought maybe it was for the best,\" he said, sounding tired. \"I thought when the girls\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efound her, they\u0027d know they had to leave. I waited for them to do it. I\u0027m good at waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring past her, into the woods. Heart pounding, Mary-Lynnette grabbed the opportunity todart\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea look at Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, he\u0027s not moving at all. And there\u0027s so muchblood....I\u0027ve never seen so much blood....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twisted her wrists back and forth, trying to find some give in the cords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I watched, but they didn\u0027t go away,\" Jeremy said.Mary-Lynnette\u0027s eyes jerked back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Instead youcame. I heard Mark talking to Jade in the garden. She said she\u0027d decided she was going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike it here. And then ... I got mad. I made a noise and they heard me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was changing. The flesh was actually moving in front of Mary-Lynnette\u0027s eyes. His cheekbones\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere broadening, his nose and mouth jutting. Hairwas creeping between his eyebrows, turning them into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea straight bar. She couldsee individual coarse hairs sprouting, dark against pale skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to be sick....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong, Mary-Lynnette?\" He got up and she saw that his body was changing, too. It was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estilla human body, but it was too thin-stretched out.As if it were just long bones and sinews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s wrong,\" Mary-Lynnette got out in a whisper. She twisted violently at her cords-and felt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it. Now keep him distracted, keep him moving away from Ash....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" she said breathlessly. \"What happenedthen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew I had to send them a message. I cameback the next night for the goat-but you were there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain. You ran away from me into the shed.\" Hemoved closer again and the moonlight caught his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes-and reflected. The pupils shone greenish-orange. Mary-Lynnette could only stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat shadow in the clearing-those eyes I saw. Nota coyote.Him.He was following us everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very thought made her skin creep. But there was another thought that was worsethe picture of him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekilling the goat. Doing it carefully, methodically-as a message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was why he didn\u0027t eat the heart and liver,Mary-Lynnette realized. He didn\u0027t kill it for foodit wasn\u0027t a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enormal werewolf killing. And he\u0027s not a normal werewolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t at all like what Rowan had described-a noble animal that hunted to eat. Instead he was ... a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emad dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf all people,Ash had it right. Him and his jokes about rabies ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so beautiful, you know,\" Jeremy said suddenly. \"I\u0027ve always thought that. I love your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right in her face. She could see the individual pores in his skin with coarse hairs growing out of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem. And she couldsmellhim-the feral smell ofa zoo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out to touch her hair, and his handhad dark, thick fingernails. Mary-Lynnette could feelher\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes getting wider. Say something ...say some thing ... don\u0027t show you\u0027re afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew how Mrs. Burdock\u0027s husband was killed,\" she got out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She told me a long time ago,\" Jeremy said almost absently, still moving his fingers in her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d changed so much that his voice was getting hard to understand. \"I used little sticks from my models\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...you know I make models. And a black iris forhim.Ash.\" Jeremy said the name with pure hatred. \"I saw\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim that day with his stupid T-shirt. The Black IrisClub . . . my uncle belonged to that once. Theytreated\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim like he was second-class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were inches from Mary-Lynnette\u0027s; she felt the brush of a fingernail on her ear. Suddenlyshe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad the strength to give a violent wrench behind her back-and one hand came free. She froze, afraid that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy would notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I threw the goat on the porch and ran,\" Jeremysaid, almost crooning the words as he petted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryLynnette. \"I knew you were all in there. I was somad-I killed that horse and I kept running. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmashed the gas station window. I was going to bum it downbut then I decided to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes,and yes, and yes, Mary-Lynnette thought, even as she carefully worked her other wrist free,even as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe stared into Jeremy\u0027s crazy eyes andsmelled his animal breath. Yes, of course it was youwe heard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erunning away-and you didn\u0027t fall into the hole in the porch because you knew it was there, because you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere fixing it. And yes, you were the one who smashed the window-who else would hate the gas station\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut somebody who worked there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0Her fingers eased the cord off her other wrist. She felt a surge of fierce triumph-but she controlled her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexpression and clenched her hands, trying to thinkof what to do. He was so strong and so quick ... if she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust threw herself at him, she wouldn\u0027t have a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And today you all came to town together,\" Jeremy said, finishing the story quietly, through a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emouth so inhuman it was hard to believe it could speak English. \"I heard the wayhe was talking toyou. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknew he wanted you-and he wanted to change you into one of them. I had to protect you from that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette said almost steadily, \"I knew youwanted to protect me. I could tell, Jeremy.\" She was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeeling over the furrowed hemlock bark behind her.How could she attack him when she didn\u0027t even have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea stick for a weapon? And even if shehad,wood was no good. He wasn\u0027t a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy stepped back. Relief washed over Mary-Lynnette-for one second. Then she saw with horror\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat he was plucking at his shirt, pulling it off. And underneath ...there was no skin. Instead there was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehair. A pelt that twitched and shivered in the night air. \"I followed you here and I fixed your car so you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t leave,\" Jeremy said. \"I heard you say youwanted to be a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeremy-that was justtalk....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on as if she hadn\u0027t spoken. \"But that was a mistake. Werewolves are much better. You\u0027ll\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstand when I show you. The moon looks so beautiful when you\u0027re a wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh,Godand so that was what he meant by pro tecting her, by making her understand. He meant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echanging her into something like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need a weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan had said silver was harmful to werewolves,so the old silver-bullet legend must be true. But she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t haveasilver bullet. Or even a silver dagger ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA silver dagger... a silverknife ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Jeremy the station wagon was almost invisible in the clouds of smoke. And by now the smoke\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad the red glow of uncontrolled fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s too dangerous, Mary-Lynnette thought. It\u0027sabout to go. I\u0027d never make it in and out....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy was still talking, his voice savage now.\"You won\u0027t miss the Night World. All their stupid\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erestrictions-no killing humans, no hunting too often. Nobody tells me how to hunt. My uncle tried,but I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etook care of him-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the creature-it wasn\u0027t really a personanymore-broke off and turned sharply. Mary-Lynnette\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaw its lips go back again, saw its teeth parted and ready to bite. In the same instant she sawwhy-Ash\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting up, even though his throat was cut. Lookingaround dazedly. He saw Mary-Lynnette, and his eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed to focus. Then he looked at the thing Jeremy had become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You-get away from herl\" he shouted in a voiceMary-Lynnette had never heard before. A voice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efilledwith deadly fury. Mary-Lynnette could see himchange position in a swift, graceful motion, gathering\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis muscles under him to jump\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the werewolf jumped first. Springing like ananimal-except that Jeremy still had arms, and onehand\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewent for the yew club. The club smashed sideways into Ash\u0027s head and knocked him flat. And then it fell,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebouncing away on the carpet of needles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe werewolf didn\u0027t need it-it was baring itsteeth. It was going to tear Ash\u0027s throat out, like the horse,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike the hiker ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette was running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot toward Ash. She couldn\u0027t help him barehanded. She ran toward the car, into the clouds of choking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, it\u0027s hot. Please let me just get there....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel the heat on her cheeks, on her arms. She remembered something from an elementary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eschool safety class and dropped to her knees, scrambling and crawling where the air was cooler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she heard the sound behind her. The most eerie sound there is-a wolf howling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt knows what I\u0027m doing. It\u0027s seen that knife everytime I pry off my gas cap. It\u0027s going to stop me....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw herself blindly into the smoke and heat,and reached the car. Orange flames were shooting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecrazily from the engine, and the door handle burnedher hand when she touched it. She fumbled,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewrenching at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen,open...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door swung out. Hot air blasted around her. If she\u0027d been completely human she wouldn\u0027t havebeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eable to stand it. But she\u0027d exchanged blood withfour vampires in two days, and she wasn\u0027t completely\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehuman anymore. She wasn\u0027t Mary-Lynnette any more ...but was she capable of killing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlames were licking up beneath the dashboard. Shegroped over smoking vinyl and shoved a hand under\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe driver\u0027s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFind it! Find it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers touched metal-the knife. The silverfruit knife with the Victorian scrolling that she\u0027d borrowed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom Mrs. Burdock. It was very hot. Her handdosed on it, and she pulled it from under the seatand\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned ... just as something came flying at her from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe turning was instinctive-she had to face whatwas attacking her. But what she would always know\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafterward was that she could have turned withoutpointing theknife at what was attacking her. There was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea moment in which she could have slanted it backward or toward the ground or toward herself. And if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe\u0027d been the Mary-Lynnette of the old days,she might have done that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t. The knife faced outward. Toward the shape jumping at her. And when the thing landed on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etop of her she felt impact in her wrist and all theway up her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distant part of her mind said, It went in cleanlybetween the ribs....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then everything was very confused. Mary-Lynnette felt teeth in her hair, snapping for her neck. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efelt claws scratching at her, leaving welts on her arms. The thing attacking her was hairy and heavy and it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t a person or even a half-person. It was a large, snarling wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still holding the knife, but it was hard to keep her grip on it. It jerked around, twisting her wrist\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein an impossible direction. It was buried in the wolf\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor just an instant, as the thing pulled away, she got a good look at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beautiful animal. Sleek and handsome, but withcrazy eyes. It was trying to kill her with its last panting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, you hate me, don\u0027t you? I\u0027ve chosen Ashover you; I\u0027ve hurt you with silver. And now you\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edying. You must feel so betrayed....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette began to shake violently. She couldn\u0027t do this anymore. She let go of the knife and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epushed and kicked at the wolf with her arms andlegs. Half scrambling and half scooting on her back, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emanaged to get a few feet away. The wolf stood silhouetted against a background of fire. She couldsee it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egather itself for one last spring at her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a very soft, contained poof. The entirecar lurched like something in agony-and then the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efireball was everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette cringed against the ground, halfblinded, but she had to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0027s what it looks like. A car going up inflames. Not the kind of big explosion you hear in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emovies. Justa poof. And then just the fire, going up and up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heat drove her away, still crawling, but she couldn\u0027t stop looking. Orange flames. That was allher\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estation wagon was now. Orange flames shooting every which way out of a metal skeleton on tires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf didn\u0027t come out of the flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette sat up. Smoke was in her throat,and when she tried to yell \"Jeremyl\" it came out as a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehoarse croak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf still didn\u0027t come out. And no wonder, with a silver knife in its chest and fire all around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette sat, arms wrapped around herself,and watched the car bum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have killed me. Like any good hunter. I had to defend myself, I had to save Ash. And thegirls\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... he would have killed all of them. And thenhe\u0027d have killed more people like that hiker.... He was crazy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand completelyevil, because he\u0027d do anything to get what he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she\u0027d seen it from the beginning. Somethingunder that \"nice guy\" exterior-she\u0027d seen it over and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover, but she\u0027d kept letting herself get convinced it wasn\u0027t there. She should have trusted her feelingsin the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efirst place. When she\u0027d realized that she\u0027dsolved the mystery of Jeremy Lovett and that it wasn\u0027t a happy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was shaking but she couldn\u0027t cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire roared on. Tiny sparks showered upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t care if it was justified. It wasn\u0027t like killingin my dream. It wasn\u0027t easy and it wasn\u0027t naturaland I\u0027ll\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever forget the way he looked at me.... Then she thought,Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been so paralyzed she\u0027d almost forgotten him. Now she turned around, almost too frightened to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elook. She made herself crawl over to where he was still lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much blood... how can he be all right? But if he\u0027s dead ... if it\u0027s all been for nothing ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Ash was breathing. And when she touched hisface, trying to find a clean place in the blood, he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoved. He stirred, then he tried to sit up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay there.\" Jeremy\u0027s shirt and jeans were on the ground. Mary-Lynnette picked up the shirt and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edabbed at Ash\u0027s neck. \"Ash, keep still....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to sit up again. \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll protectyou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lie down,\" Mary-Lynnette said. When he didn\u0027t, she pushed at him. \"There\u0027s nothing to do. He\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sank back, eyes shutting. \"Did I kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette made a choked sound that wasn\u0027t exactly a laugh. She was trembling with relief-Ash\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould breathe and talk, and he even sounded like hisnormal fatuous self. She\u0027d had no idea how good\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethatcould sound. And underneath the swabbing shirt she could see that his neck was already healing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhathad been gashes were becoming flat pink scars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVampire flesh was incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh swallowed. \"You didn\u0027t answer my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You didn\u0027t kill him. I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes opened. They just looked at each other for a moment. And in that moment Mary-Lynnette\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknew they were both realizing a lot of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Ash said, \"I\u0027m sorry,\" and his voice had never been less fatuous. He pushed the shirt awayand sat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eup. \"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know who reached first, but they were holding each other. And Mary-Lynnette was thinking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout hunters and danger and laughing at death. About all the things it meant to really belong to the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd about how she would never look in the mirror and see the same person she used to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least it\u0027s over now,\" Ash said. She could feel his arms around her, his warmth and solidity, his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esupport. \"There won\u0027t be any more killings. It\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, and so were a lot of other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first sob was hard to get out. So hard thatshe\u0027d have thought there would be a pause beforethe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enext-but, no. There was no pause between that one and the next, or the next or the next. She cried for a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elong time. And the fire burned itself out and the sparks flew upward and Ash held her all the while. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-16.html","bookId":1862,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:55 PM"}
