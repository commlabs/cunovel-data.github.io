With one condition: that your father keep it a secret until the old emperor passed away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek stared at the scroll case. The leather was beautifully worked, decorated with the crossed keys of the papal seal. But even so, it looked too small to change so much. \"You\u0027ve got to be joking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s signed, witnessed, and sealed with lead. With the power of heaven it names you as your father\u0027s heir.\" Volger smiled. \"A bit more impressive than a few gold bars, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One document gives me an empire? I don\u0027t believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can read it if you want. Your Latin is better than mine, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek turned away, gripping the parapet. A sharp edge of broken stone cut into his fingers. Suddenly he could hardly breathe. \"But ... all this happened two years ago? Why didn\u0027t he tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger snorted. \"Aleksandar, you don\u0027t trust a mere boy with the greatest secret in the empire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mere boy ... The moonlight on the snow was suddenly too bright, and Alek squeezed his eyes shut, his whole life unwinding inside him. He\u0027d always been an impostor in his own house, his father unable to leave him anything, his distant relatives wishing he\u0027d never been born. Even his mother - she was the cause of it all. She\u0027d cost him an empire, and somewhere deep down that fact had always stood between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could the abyss that had defined his life disappear so suddenly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was, it hadn\u0027t. The emptiness was still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too late,\" Alek said. \"My parents are dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Making you first in line for the throne.\" The wildcount shrugged. \"Your granduncle may not know about this letter, but that doesn\u0027t change the law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one knows about it!\" Alek cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I certainly wish that were true. But you saw how doggedly they\u0027ve hunted us. The Germans must have found out somehow.\" Count Volger shook his head slowly. \"Rome is filled with spies, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek took the scroll case, his fist closing tight around it. \"So this must be why my parents were ...\" For a moment he wanted to throw it from the battlements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That isn\u0027t true, Alek. Your father was killed because he was a man of peace, and the Germans wanted war. You are simply a postscript.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek took a deep breath, trying to fit himself into this new reality. Everything that had happened in the last two years had to be rethought - all of these plans his father had made, knowing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely, a small thing troubled him most. \"All this time, Volger, you\u0027ve treated me like ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The son of a lady-in-waiting?\" Volger smiled. \"A necessary deception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My compliments,\" Alek said slowly and evenly. \"Your contempt was most convincing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am your servant.\" Volger took one of Alek\u0027s hands in both of his and bowed. \"And you have proved yourself worthy of your father\u0027s name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek pulled away. \"So what do we do with this ... piece of paper? How do we let people know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t,\" Volger said. \"We keep your father\u0027s promise and say nothing until the emperor dies. He\u0027s an old man, Alek.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But while we hide, this war goes on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek turned away. The freezing wind still blew against his face, but he could hardly feel it. He\u0027d spent his whole life wishing for an empire, but he\u0027d never realized the price would be so high. Not just his parents, but the war itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered the soldier he\u0027d killed. Over the next years there would be thousands more dead - tens of thousands. And he could do nothing but hide here in the snow, clutching this piece of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis frozen wasteland was his kingdom now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alek,\" Volger said softly, gripping his arm. \"Listen ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ve heard enough for one night, Count.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, listen. Do you hear that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek glared at the man, then sighed and closed his eyes again. There was the sound of Bauer chopping wood, the moan of the wind, the ticking of the Stormwalker\u0027s metal parts still cooling. And somewhere out on the edge of his awareness ... the rumble of engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes sprang open. \"Aeroplanes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger shook his head. \"Not at this altitude.\" He leaned out over the parapets and scanned the valley floor, muttering, \"They can\u0027t have followed us. They can\u0027t have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Alek was sure the sound came from the air. He squinted into the icy wind, until finally he saw a shape forming in the moonlit sky. But what he saw made no sense at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was huge, like a dreadnought flying through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a zeppelin!\" Alek shouted. \"They\u0027ve found us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wildcount looked up. \"An airship, certainly. But that doesn\u0027t sound like a zeppelin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek frowned, listening hard. Other noises, tremulous and nonsensical, trickled over the distant hum of engines -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;squawks, whistles, and squeaks, like a menagerie let loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airship lacked the symmetry of a zeppelin: The front end was larger than the stern, the surface mottled and uneven. Clouds of tiny winged forms fluttered around it, and an unearthly green glow clung to its skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Alek saw the huge eyes... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God\u0027s wounds,\" he swore. This wasn\u0027t a machine at all, but a Darwinist creation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d seen monsters before, of course - talking lizards in the fashionable parlors of Prague, a draft animal displayed in a traveling circus - but nothing as gigantic as this. It was like one of his war toys come to life, a thousand times larger and more incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are Darwinists doing here?\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolger pointed. \"Running from danger, it would seem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek\u0027s eyes followed the gesture, and he saw the jagged trails of bullet holes down the creature\u0027s flank, flickering with green light. Men swarmed in the rigging that hung from its sides, some wounded, some making repairs. And alongside them climbed things that weren\u0027t men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the airship passed, almost overhead, Alek half ducked behind the parapets. But the crew seemed too busy to notice anything below them. The ship slowly turned as it settled into the valley, dropping below the level of the mountains on either side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that godless thing coming down?\" Alek asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They seem to have no choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast creature glided away toward the white expanse of glacier - the only place in sight large enough for it to land. Even wounded, it fell as slowly as a feather. Alek held his breath for the long seconds that it remained poised above the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crash unfolded slowly. White clouds rose up in the skidding airship\u0027s wake, its skin rippling like a flag in the wind. Alek saw men thrown from their perches on its back, but it was too far away for their cries to reach him, even through the cold, clear air. The ship kept sliding away, farther and farther, until its dark outline disappeared behind a shroud of white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The highest mountains in Europe, and the war reaches us so quickly.\" Count Volger shook his head. \"What an age we live in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think they saw us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In all that chaos? I\u0027d think not. And this ruin won\u0027t look like much from a distance, even when the sun comes up.\" The wildcount sighed. \"But no cooking fires for a while. And we\u0027ll have to set a watch until they leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if they don\u0027t leave?\" Alek said. \"What if they can\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then they won\u0027t last long,\" Volger said flatly. \"There\u0027s nothing to eat on the glacier, no shelter, no fuel for a fire. Just ice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek turned to stare at Volger. \"But we can\u0027t leave shipwrecked men to die!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I remind you that they\u0027re the enemy, Alek? Just because the Germans are hunting us doesn\u0027t make Darwinists our friends. There could be a hundred men aboard that ship! Perhaps enough to take this castle.\" Volger\u0027s voice softened as he peered into the sky. \"Let\u0027s just hope no rescue comes for them. Aircraft overhead in daylight would be a disaster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek looked out across the glacier again. The snow thrown up by the crash was settling around the airship, revealing that it lay half on one side, like a beached fish. He wondered if Darwinist creations died from the cold as quickly as natural beasts. Or men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hundred of them out there ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at the stables below - food enough for a small army. And medicine for the wounded, and furs and firewood to keep them warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t sit here and watch them die, Count. Enemies or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you been listening?\" Volger cried. \"You\u0027re heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. Your duty is to the empire, not those men out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek shook his head. \"At the moment there isn\u0027t much I can do for the empire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. But if you keep yourself alive, soon enough you\u0027ll gain the power to stop this madness. Don\u0027t forget: The emperor is eighty-three, and war is unkind to old men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith those last words Volger\u0027s voice broke, and suddenly he looked ancient himself, as if the last five weeks had finally caught up with him. Alek swallowed his answer, remembering what Volger had sacrificed - his home, his rank - to be hunted and hounded, to go sleepless listening to wireless chatter. And with safety finally at hand, this obscene creature had fallen from the sky, threatening to wreck years of planning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder he wanted to ignore the airbeast dying on the snows a few kilometers away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Volger.\" Alek took his arm and led him down from the cold and windy parapet. \"We\u0027ll watch and wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll probably repair that godless beast,\" Volger said on the stairs. \"And leave us behind without a second glance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway across the courtyard, Volger brought Alek to a sudden halt, his expression pained. \"We\u0027d help them if we could. But this war could leave the whole continent in ruins. You see that, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek nodded and led the count into the great hall of the castle, where Bauer was piling wood into the fireplace. Seeing the food laid out and ready to cook, Volger let out a tired sigh and told the other men about the crashed airship - another week without fires, and long, cold watches every night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut eating in a castle, even a cold one, was still a pleasure after all those meals huddled in the Stormwalker\u0027s iron belly. The storerooms held luxuries that none of them had enjoyed for weeks: smoked fish for dinner, dried fruit and canned peaches for dessert. The wine was excellent, and when Alek offered to take the first watch, the others drank to him deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one talked about rescuing the airmen. Perhaps the other three assumed that the monstrous creature would fly away again. They hadn\u0027t seen the bullet holes in its flanks, or the men hanging wounded and lifeless in the rigging. Instead they talked like soldiers, discussing how to defend the castle against an aerial attack. Bauer and Klopp argued about whether the Stormwalker\u0027s cannon could elevate high enough to hit an airship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek listened and watched. He\u0027d slept most of the day, taking the controls only after sunset, when Klopp\u0027s old eyes always gave out. It was barely midnight now, and it would be dawn before he needed sleep. But the others were worn down by the day\u0027s journey and the freezing cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had fallen asleep, Alek made his way quietly up to the parapets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airship lay in a dark lump on the glacier\u0027s featureless white. It looked smaller now, as if slowly deflating. No fires or lamps were visible, just the strange glow he\u0027d noticed earlier. Tiny pinpricks of light moved in the wreckage, like green fireflies buzzing about the giant creature\u0027s wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek shivered. He\u0027d heard awful stories about the Darwinists\u0027 creations: half-breeds of tigers and wolves, mythological monsters brought to life, animals that spoke and even reasoned like humans, but had no souls. He\u0027d been told that when godless beasts were created, the spirits of demons occupied them - pure evil given flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he\u0027d also been taught that the emperor was wise and kind, that the Austrian people loved him, and that the Germans were his allies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek descended the tower stairs and crept past the sleeping men into the storerooms. The medicine kits were easy to find, eight satchels marked with red crosses. He took three, but didn\u0027t weigh himself down with any food. That could come later, if the airship really was grounded for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChanging into his commoner disguise, Alek ignored the furs, choosing the most ragged leather coat he could find. From the weapons room he took a Steyr automatic pistol and two eight-round clips. Hardly the sort of weapon a Swiss villager would carry, but Volger was right about one thing - this was still a war, and these Darwinists were the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he chose a pair of snowshoes. Alek wasn\u0027t sure how the contraptions were supposed to help him walk, but Klopp had exalted upon seeing them - something about his mountain campaigns back in the Balkan Wars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe iron bolt of the castle gate slid silently aside, and the huge door swung open with an easy push. It was so simple to walk out, throwing his hard-won safety to the cold wind. Certainly it felt nobler than hiding here, waiting to inherit an empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf a kilometer out onto the snows Alek realized that he had finally snuck past his old fencing master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snowshoes looked absurd, like tennis rackets strapped to his boots. But they worked, keeping his feet from breaking through the brittle surface into the powdery snow beneath. His long, sliding steps carried him quickly back along the Stormwalker\u0027s footprints, until he was far enough away that his tracks weren\u0027t visible from the castle walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smooth, almost featureless glacier was easy going, and in an hour he drew close enough to hear the Darwinists\u0027 shouts as they worked on their wounded airship. He climbed up the valley\u0027s side, until he reached a ledge overlooking the vast shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek stood at the edge, astonished by what he saw below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wreck looked like a corner of hell bubbling up through the snow. Flocks of winged creatures coiled around hollows in the wilting gasbag. Crewmen moved across the great beast\u0027s skin, accompanied by bizarre double-snouted, six-legged dogs that sniffed and pawed at every bullet hole. The green lights he\u0027d seen from the castle covered the creature. They were crawling, like glowing maggots on dead meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the stench! Rotten eggs and cabbage, and a salty smell disturbingly close to the fish he\u0027d had for dinner. Alek wondered for a moment if the Germans were right after all. These godless beasts were an insult to nature itself. Perhaps a war was worth ridding the world of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A VAST FORM STRETCHES OUT.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet he couldn\u0027t take his eyes from the creature. Even lying wounded it looked so powerful, more like something from legend than the work of men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour searchlights flared to life, illuminating one flank of the creature. Alek could see now why the beast had rolled sideways during the crash: The gondolas hanging from its underside had escaped being flattened against the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteeling himself, he climbed down to the glacier, heading toward the unlit side of the creature. Only a few men worked there, though the damage looked just as bad. Drawing nearer, Alek stepped lightly, his snowshoes shushing in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he stole down the length of the airship, the green glow seemed to be bleeding out onto the ice. Surely the beast was dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been a fool to think he could help. Perhaps he should just leave the medicines somewhere and slip away... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft moan came from the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek stole closer to the sound, the air growing warm around him. His stomach twisted. This was living heat from the creature\u0027s body! Fighting nausea, he went a few steps nearer, trying not to look at the green lights crawling beneath the creature\u0027s skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young airman lay in the darkness, curled against the beast\u0027s flank. His eyes were closed and his nose bloody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek crouched beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airman was just a boy, with fine features and sandy hair. The collar of his flight suit was caked with blood, and his face looked deathly pale in the soft green light. He had to have been slumped here on the ice for the hours since the crash, the giant creature\u0027s warmth keeping him alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek opened one of the medical satchels, fishing through the bottles for smelling salts and rubbing alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved the salts under the boy\u0027s nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barking spiders!\" the boy croaked in a high voice, his eyes fluttering open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek frowned, wondering if he\u0027d heard the words right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you well?\" he ventured in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bit scrambled in the attic,\" the boy said, rubbing his head. He sat up slowly, taking in the scene around them, and his glassy eyes widened. \"Blisters! We came down hard, didn\u0027t we? The poor beastie looks a bloody wreck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re rather bloody yourself,\" Alek said, twisting open the bottle of rubbing alcohol. He dampened a bandage and held it against the boy\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow! Stop that!\" The boy pushed the bandage away and sat up straight, his gaze becoming clearer. He looked suspiciously at Alek\u0027s snowshoes. \"Who are you, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here to help. I live nearby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up here? In all this barking snow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Alek cleared his throat, wondering what to say. He\u0027d always been hopeless at any sort of lying. \"In a village, of sorts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy narrowed his eyes. \"Wait a wee minute - you talk like a Clanker!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ... I suppose I do. We speak a dialect of German in this part of Switzerland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy stared at him another moment, then sighed and rubbed his head. \"Right, you\u0027re Swiss. The crash must\u0027ve knocked me silly. For a squick there I thought you were one of those bum-rags who shot us down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek raised an eyebrow. \"And then landed here so I could tend to your bloody nose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said it was a wee bit daft,\" the boy said, yanking the alcohol-soaked bandage from Alek\u0027s hand. He pressed it against his nose and winced. \"But thanks for your trouble. It\u0027s lucky you came along, or my bum would\u0027ve been frostbit to blazes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek raised an eyebrow, wondering if the boy always talked this way, or if he was still groggy from the crash. Even bloody and bruised, he had an odd sort of swagger, as if he crash-landed in giant airships every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Alek said. \"A frostbitten bum would\u0027ve been unfortunate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy smiled. \"Give us a lift, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey grasped hands and pulled each other up, the other boy still unsteady. But when he gained his feet, he bowed triumphantly, pulled off a glove and held out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Midshipman Dylan Sharp, at your service.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeryn waited for the strange Swiss boy to shake her hand. After a moment\u0027s hesitation he finally reached out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name\u0027s Alek,\" he said. \"Pleased to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeryn smiled, though her head was aching. The boy was about her age, with reddish-brown hair and sharp, handsome features. His leather coat had once been posh, but it was threadbare now. A twitchiness animated the boy\u0027s dark green eyes, as if he were ready to bound away on his ridiculous shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll very odd, Deryn thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you\u0027re quite all right?\" Alek asked. His English was dead proper, even with the Clanker accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right enough,\" Deryn said. She stamped feeling back into her feet, wondering when the dizziness was going to go away. Her attic had been scrambled, that was certain. She couldn\u0027t recall the exact moment of the crash, only the descent - the snow rising up, the airship rolling over, threatening to crush her if she didn\u0027t climb fast enough ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeryn glanced down at her safety line; it was stretched and frayed but still attached to the ratlines. She must have been dragged alongside as the airbeast skidded across the snow. If the ship had rolled over any farther, she\u0027d have wound up a greasy squick beneath the whale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wee bit dizzy, is all,\" she added, looking up at the bullet-holed membrane. The bitter-almond smell of leaking hydrogen filled her muzzy head. \"Not half as bad as this beastie here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, your ship looks terrible,\" Alek said. His eyes were wide, like he\u0027d never seen a fabricated creature before. Maybe that explained his twitchiness. \"Do you think you can fix it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeryn stepped back for a better view of the wreck. Hardly anyone was working here on the starboard flank. But up on the spine men were silhouetted against searchlight beams reaching into the sky. The gondolas must have wound up on the other side of the wreck, so the repair work had started over there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeryn knew she should be helping them, and finding out what had happened to Newkirk and Mr. Rigby, but her hands felt too weak to climb. The cold had seeped into her bones while she\u0027d lain unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eventually.\" Her eyes scanned the bleak terrain. \"But I wouldn\u0027t fancy staying here very long! Maybe your people could help us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy\u0027s eyes widened a bit. \"My village is quite far from here. And we don\u0027t know anything about airships.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not. But this looks like a big job. We\u0027ll need lots of rope, maybe machine parts. The engines on this side must be smashed to blazes. You Swiss are good with gears, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid we can\u0027t help.\" Alek pulled a bunch of leather satchels from his shoulder. \"But I can give you these. For your wounded men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed the satchels to Deryn. She opened one and peered inside: bandages, scissors, a thermometer in a leather case, and a dozen tiny bottles. Whoever Alek\u0027s people were, they knew how to get proper supplies up the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said. \"But where did you get these?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I have to go.\" The boy took a step backward. \"I\u0027m expected home soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, Alek!\" she cried, making him jump. Living up here, he probably wasn\u0027t used to strangers. But she couldn\u0027t let him wriggle away like this. \"Just tell me where your village is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The other side of the glacier.\" He made a gesture toward the horizon, in no particular direction. \"Quite far away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeryn wondered if he was hiding something. Of course, to live in a shivery wasteland like this, you\u0027d have to be a bit cracked in the attic. Or were his people outlaws of some kind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems like an odd place to have a village,\" she said carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s not what you\u0027d call a large village. Just me and ... my extended family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeryn nodded slowly, still smiling. So Alek was changing his story now. Was there a village or wasn\u0027t there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took another step backward. \"Listen, I\u0027m not really supposed to be this far from home. I just happened to be out hiking when I saw your ship come down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out hiking?\" Deryn said. \"In all this barking snow? At night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I often hike on the glacier at night.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-leviathan-1/page-18.html","bookId":1574,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:57:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:57:00 PM"}
