It was far enough from the Mall that the tourist crowds were always thinner there. In spring it was a wonderful place to enjoy the cherry blossoms. He\u0027d always been a devotee of Jefferson the man, as well, and it was good to sit in the midst of all that neoclassical marble and look up at the man\u0027s wise bronze face and imagine what he would have done in a given situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter today, though, he imagined he would feel differently about the place. He would remember it as where he\u0027d been forced to concede defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom Banks was waiting for him when he arrived. The CIA director looked pleased with himself, of course. No matter what kind of horror show this had become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your man failed,\" Banks said, with barely disguised glee. \"He\u0027s dead, dead, dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He got three of the four,\" Hollingshead said, when the two of them were close enough that they could speak without being overheard. \"Really, all in all a good show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a cripple, sure,\" Banks said, with a chuckle. \"Rupert, old boy, old chum, old pal.

But for my personal satisfaction I\u0027ve got to hear it from your lips,\" Banks insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I, Rupert Hollingshead, do affirm that as of this moment the CIA should have full jurisdiction over all secret projects resulting from or evolving from Project Darling Green. The Central Intelligence Agency shall be fully responsible for all further activity, oversight, and secrecy concerning said projects and the Defense Intelligence Agency will have no access to any work product or intelligence product resulting therefrom or associated therewith without the CIA\u0027s prior approval and knowledge. There. Is that enough? Or must I sign something in blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanks grinned like a feral cat. \"I\u0027ve been waiting years for this, Rupert. This project of yours should never have happened in the first place. No sane mind could have approved it, and keeping it going this long was utter stupidity. And now I get to clean up after you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t seem very put out,\" Hollingshead observed, \"for a man whose workload has just increased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it gives me a chance to do something else I\u0027ve wanted to do for a long time. Hang you out to dry. When the president hears about what you did-what you signed off on-he\u0027s going to demote you down to ensign at the very least. He\u0027ll be fucking pissed, to be blunt about it. And you and your stupid bow ties will never darken my doorstep again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of this. All of this, because you hate me,\" Hollingshead said, shaking his head. \"Because our two agencies don\u0027t get along. All the deaths, all the misery-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spare me, you old fuck,\" Banks said. He turned on his heel and walked away, then. He didn\u0027t even bother with the traditional handshake. Hollingshead watched him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned and with a sigh settled his bulk onto a marble bench where he could look on Jefferson\u0027s face. Maybe for the last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his cellular phone from his pocket and put it to his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s done,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngel\u0027s voice on the other end sounded downcast. Perhaps she\u0027d come to have high hopes for Chapel as well. \"He just took over? Just like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bought Camp Putnam for a song, yes,\" Hollingshead replied. \"No questions asked. He seemed anxious to get on with things.\" The ghost of a smile touched his lips. \"It\u0027s almost enough to make me feel sorry for him. He has no idea what he\u0027s just inherited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Director Hollingshead?

Nobody expects anything from a cripple. They just lie there, being a drain on everybody else\u0027s hard work. But that\u0027s fine. Because you\u0027re a war hero, right? You earned the right to do nothin\u0027 all day but feel sorry for yourself. You made that sacrifice. Don\u0027t matter you got two perfectly good legs. You\u0027re all depressed. You\u0027re traumatized. So you\u0027re crippled in the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got shot. I got shot three times,\" Chapel told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not know if he was speaking out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness surrounded him. Darkness filled his body, an aching kind of darkness he couldn\u0027t understand. He desperately needed to go to the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man whose body\u0027s crippled, sure, people can look at that and pity him. They can feel sorry for him. A man who\u0027s crippled in the head, people can\u0027t see that. They don\u0027t understand it. Now you and me, we both know about trauma. We both know what it\u0027s like to wake up in the middle of the night and be back there, back in the mud and the fire and hearing the screams. We understand that. Nobody else ever will. They\u0027ll see you lyin\u0027 in this bed, with two perfectly good legs, and they\u0027ll say, he\u0027s just lazy. He\u0027s just milking it. Our tax dollars are payin\u0027 for him to sleep all day and eat Jell-O.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapel was lying in a pool of something wet. Had he soiled himself? The shame of it was too much to bear. He wanted to just curl up and go back to sleep. He wanted to sleep forever. He had a feeling that was an attainable goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen your damn eyes when I talk to you, boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Top,\" Chapel said, the start of a protest he didn\u0027t know how to finish. He tried to open his eyes, tried to obey orders. It was so hard, though. His eyelids felt like they had been cemented shut. \"Top . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m gonna keep yellin\u0027 at you. I\u0027m not gonna stop. Because I\u0027m no cripple. I got one arm, one leg, and one eye, but I refuse to be a cripple. Cripples don\u0027t work no more. I still got work to do, and you\u0027re it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying, Top.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know you are.

They only accept one hundred percent success. How\u0027s those eyes comin\u0027 along? They open yet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took every ounce of his strength. It was like trying to rip a phone book in half. But Chapel opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t see much, just blurry shapes and shadows. The light hurt when it hit the back of his eye sockets. It felt like each individual beam of light was drilling into his skull. But his eyes were open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the blurry shapes were moving. They moved around him, bent over him. They were people, looking down at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" someone said. \"He\u0027s awake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell is he still alive?\" someone else asked. \"He must have lost a gallon of blood already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t last much longer,\" the first voice said, though it didn\u0027t sound sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get Reinhard. If we have to kill him ourselves, Reinhard will know how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOULDER, COLORADO: APRIL 14, T+65:12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapel was lying on a cement floor in a pool of his own blood. It ran down his side, under his legs, and into a drain in the floor. He could hear it dripping away. He could feel it oozing out of his gunshot wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shirt was off. He could look down and see the wound, caked in gore. He had two smaller wounds in his chest, just tiny pinpricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis artificial arm had been removed. It lay on a table on the far side of the room. The silicone skin had been completely cut off, revealing the complex assemblage of pistons and actuators underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis good arm was handcuffed to a pipe that ran along the wall behind him. The cuff around his wrist was loose enough that it didn\u0027t cut off the circulation to his good hand, but not so loose he could slip out of it. He wasn\u0027t going anywhere, even if he did feel strong enough to stand up. Which he didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were all facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for anything else, all he had were suppositions and theories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe judge had shot him twice in the chest-that must have been where the pinpricks came from. The judge must have hit him with a tranquilizer gun. Chapel remembered Jeremy Funt\u0027s story of how Malcolm was recaptured after his escape. William Taggart had taken him down with a tranquilizer gun. Most likely, Chapel thought, the judge had been given such an unusual weapon in case he needed to use it against Quinn. The judge would have known about the unpredictable nature of chimeras and been armed accordingly. The fact he hadn\u0027t been given a high-powered revolver instead meant that the judge had wanted to make sure he kept Quinn alive-at least long enough to serve his intended purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the judge had known about Quinn\u0027s presence in his security detail. He\u0027d known everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wound in Chapel\u0027s side was serious. It would eventually cause him to bleed out. It was only a flesh wound, though-Quinn\u0027s bullet had cut through his skin and muscle but failed to penetrate his abdominal cavity. If it had hit any major organs, Chapel would already be dead. He\u0027d gotten off pretty easy, actually. If the wound had been properly treated and bandaged, he would be on his feet and ready for action even now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had treated it or bandaged it in any way. He\u0027d been handcuffed in this little room and left to bleed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were four men in the little room with him. Security guards in black suits. They wore their sunglasses again-apparently they were done with following Chapel\u0027s orders. When he begged them for help, for a bandage, for water, they didn\u0027t even glance in his direction. Two of them were playing cards. The other one just stared out the room\u0027s sole window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapel had to fight constantly to stay conscious. He did not know if he was always successful-he might have blacked out once or twice by the time Reinhard came into the little room and checked on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head of the judge\u0027s security detail poked and prodded at the wound in Chapel\u0027s side, reopening the crust of blood there. Chapel could feel fresh blood leak from the wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the judge?\" Chapel asked, not expecting any kind of answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReinhard surprised him. \"He\u0027s in Boulder, at a press conference. Covered in blood-your blood. But otherwise fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Press conference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earlier today, the judge was attacked by a mysterious assassin, didn\u0027t you know that? Hundreds of people on the highway saw it. If it wasn\u0027t for a brave war hero who was guarding him, the judge would have been killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapel forced words out of his dry throat. \"Awful shame, though, that the war hero who took the bullet for the judge died before they could get him to a hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReinhard nodded, looking impressed. \"You\u0027ve figured most of this out, haven\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapel took a deep breath before saying anything more. \"This was all a false flag operation,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" Reinhard asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The judge is up against a tough confirmation hearing in the Senate because he\u0027s supposed to be soft on terrorism. An assassination attempt by some domestic terrorist group would give him a great platform to wave the flag around and talk tough, make himself look bloodthirsty. But you and I know better. We know this whole thing was a setup. But you can be trusted not to talk. As for me, the judge doesn\u0027t know what I would do. So he\u0027s going to make sure I don\u0027t ruin this for him. You can\u0027t kill me yourself, though. That would look wrong when they did the autopsy. So you\u0027re going to let me bleed to death, then turn my body over to the local coroner. Nobody will think to look for traces of tranquilizer in my blood, because there won\u0027t be enough blood left to test. The cause of death will be obvious so no uncomfortable questions will be asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReinhard laughed. \"You\u0027re smarter than we thought. When you just walked into this, we kind of thought you were an idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapel tried to shrug. Hard to do with only one shoulder, and that arm handcuffed. \"No. Not an idiot. Just predictable. It was my job to track down the chimeras. I would go wherever they did.\" He rested for a while before speaking again. \"Tell me one thing. Are you working for Banks? Or for Hollingshead? Which of them is the Voice that gives the chimeras their instructions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReinhard sighed. \"You know, all this talking is going to drain your strength. Why don\u0027t you just try to sleep, now? Just close your eyes and drift off. You\u0027ve earned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reverse echo of Top\u0027s remembered voice in his head made Chapel smile. \"I\u0027ve slept enough. Let\u0027s talk some more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got things to do,\" Reinhard told him, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapel\u0027s only chance was to keep the man engaged. To talk him around. \"That\u0027s a pretty sweet posting you\u0027re looking at, huh? Head of security for a Supreme Court justice. It\u0027s too bad you won\u0027t live to see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReinhard sneered. \"Idle threats, now? That\u0027s what you\u0027ve been reduced to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll die first. But I\u0027ll have the satisfaction of knowing you\u0027ll go with me. Or didn\u0027t they tell you about Laughing Boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapel smiled. Reinhard was still listening. That was good. \"I don\u0027t know his actual name. Creepy guy, with a scar on the back of his head. Laughs all the time. Have you met him? If you\u0027re working with Banks, I\u0027d bet that Laughing Boy was your go-between. He cleans up after the chimeras.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, \u0027cleans up\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the chimeras are carrying some kind of germ warfare virus. I mean, come on. They must have told you that much. Laughing Boy finds everybody who\u0027s been in contact with one of them. He kills them and burns the bodies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit. You\u0027re just trying to scare me. It won\u0027t work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Believe what you want. Did you have much physical contact with Quinn, though? Did you shake his hand? Maybe pat him down at some point? Laughing Boy doesn\u0027t take any chances.\" Chapel looked over at the black-suited men playing cards on the far side of the room. \"What about you guys?\" he called out, raising his voice as much as he could. \"Did any of you touch Quinn? Were any of you in car three when he went berserk? I bet they didn\u0027t tell you about the virus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the guards looked up and stared at Chapel. \"Reinhard,\" he said, \"what\u0027s he on about? Nobody told us about a virus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReinhard scowled. \"Shut up,\" he said. \"Williamson. Hand me that duct tape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother of the guards tossed a roll of tape to Reinhard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough bullshit,\" Reinhard said. Then he tore off a generous piece of tape and pressed it tight over Chapel\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for talking his way out of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guards went back to their game. The one who had spoken kept staring at Reinhard and at Chapel, but he didn\u0027t get up from where he sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapel wondered how much longer it would take to bleed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOULDER, COLORADO: APRIL 14, T+65:48\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing but darkness outside the room\u0027s little window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTools hung from hooks on the walls-saws, hammers, mattocks, and hedge clippers. A toolshed, then. Most likely Chapel had been taken to the judge\u0027s wife\u0027s place in the mountains above Boulder. The judge had said that was the undisclosed location, the safehouse where he would wait for Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere didn\u0027t seem like a lot of point in figuring out his location, but he couldn\u0027t just lie there and wait to die. He was an intelligence operative, so he spent the last of his time trying to gather information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were three guards in the shed, as well as Reinhard. The guards were named Williamson, Reynolds, and Hook. Hook kept winning whatever game they were playing. Apparently Reynolds owed him a fair amount of money. Chapel thought Hook might be cheating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he could talk, he could have tried to drive a wedge between Hook and Reynolds. Convince Reynolds he was being taken by a cheat. Get them to fight each other. It would make a great diversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept he couldn\u0027t talk. He couldn\u0027t create the diversion. And even if he had a diversion, what then? He was handcuffed to a pipe. He still had some strength in his body-he hadn\u0027t succumbed to anemia quite yet-but even at his strongest he would never have been able to break the pipe or pull his hand free of the cuffs. They were designed to hold stronger prisoners than him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Reinhard would leave the room, Chapel could try to catch Williamson\u0027s attention somehow. Maybe he could convince the guard to remove his duct tape, convince him that Chapel had a cure for the virus, that he could save Williamson from Laughing Boy . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Reinhard wouldn\u0027t leave the shed. And as long as he remained, Williamson was more afraid of his boss than he was of the virus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he could . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf things were just slightly different . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReinhard\u0027s walkie-talkie crackled with loud static that ramped up to a nasty whine of feedback. Looking annoyed, the chief guard grabbed the unit out of his jacket and switched it to a new channel. He started to put it back in his pocket, but it crackled to life again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . . say again,\" Chapel heard, \"say again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Movement . . . the trees,\" a new voice said on the walkie-talkie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is this?\" Reinhard asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReynolds looked up from his game and shrugged. \"Sounds like Praczek, kind of. Isn\u0027t he out by the road?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReinhard grunted in frustration. He put the walkie-talkie to his ear. \"Praczek, come in. Praczek, this is Reinhard. Report right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly static answered him. Reinhard set the walkie-talkie down on the table next to Chapel\u0027s artificial arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounded like something, maybe,\" Hook said. \"Sounded like there was somebody out in the trees. If Praczek saw something-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" Reinhard said. \"We hear something more, I\u0027ll worry about it then. There\u0027s nobody out there. Praczek was probably just jumping at shadows.\" He grabbed the walkie-talkie again. \"Praczek, report in. Everybody, report in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor long tense seconds all the guards stared at the walkie-talkie, but nothing but static came through. Reinhard repeated his request for reports, but still there was nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So there\u0027s a fault in my set, that\u0027s all,\" Reinhard said, while his guards stared at him. \"Maybe my battery is dying. Reynolds, give me yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReynolds took his own walkie-talkie out of his jacket pocket and handed it over. Reinhard played with it for a while, adjusting its various knobs and dials. Every time he switched it on, however, it got nothing but static.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there\u0027s somebody out there, maybe they got to Praczek and Foster,\" Hook said, rubbing at his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe this Laughing Boy guy,\" Williamson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" Reinhard shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Chapel\u0027s head a little fantasy played out. He saw Army Rangers parachuting into the woods, scrambling to take up positions. He saw them moving in to take out the guards Reinhard had stationed around the house. He saw them breaching the door of the toolshed, bursting in with battering rams and flashbangs and M4 carbines at the ready. He saw them come to rescue him. To take him home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a nice little fantasy. It was also bullshit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapel was a silent warrior. He knew that Hollingshead wouldn\u0027t send Rangers in to rescue him-if Hollingshead even knew he was still alive. If Hollingshead even wanted him to be alive, which Chapel had come to seriously doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was probably nothing. He hated to admit it, but Reinhard was probably right-it was most likely just a radio malfunction. Praczek\u0027s original message, about movement in the trees, was probably about some animals he\u0027d seen moving around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Praczek, damn it, report now,\" Reinhard said into his walkie-talkie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly red light flicked across the shed\u0027s window. Just a glimmer. Then a moment later it came back, much stronger, bright red light illuminating the trees as if they\u0027d caught fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in the toolshed jumped at the sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReinhard\u0027s eyes were wide. He visibly regained control of himself. Then he pointed at the others. \"You three go check that out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want us to go out there?\" Williamson asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chimera-a-jim-chapel-mission-jim-chapel-1/page-25.html","bookId":1585,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:17:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:17:52 AM"}
