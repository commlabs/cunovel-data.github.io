It had taken the young warrior some time to get used to this position, but as commander of the Baenre lizard riders, he spent many hours watching the city from this high vantage point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA movement to the side, behind a cluster of stalactites, put Berg\u0027inyon on the alert. He lowered his ten foot long death lance with one hand; the other held the lizard\u0027s bridle while resting on the hilt of his ready hand crossbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the son of House Baenre, \" he said aloud, figuring that to be enough of a threat to defeat any possible foul play. He glanced around, looking for support, and moved his free hand to his belt pouch and his signal speculum, a shielded metal strip heated on one side and used to communicate with creatures using infravision. Dozens of other House Baenre lizard riders were about and would come rushing to Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the son of House Baenre, \" he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youngest Baenre relaxed almost immediately when his older brother Dantrag, emerged from behind the stalactites, riding an even larger subterranean lizard. Curious indeed did the elder Baenre look with his ponytail hanging straight down from the top of his upside down head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As am I, \" Dantrag replied, skittering his sticky footed mount beside Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing up here?\" Berg\u0027inyon asked. \"And how did you appropriate the mount without my permission?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDantrag scoffed at the question. \"Appropriate?\" he replied. \"I am the weapon master of House Baenre. I took the lizard, and needed no permission from Berg\u0027inyon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe younger Baenre stared with red glowing eyes, but said nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forget who trained you, my brother, \" Dantrag remarked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe statement was true; Berg\u0027inyon would never forget, could never forget, that Dantrag had been his mentor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you prepared to face the likes of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden again?\" The blunt question nearly sent Berg\u0027inyon from his mount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would seem a possibility, since we are to travel to Mithril Hall, \" Dantrag added coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerg\u0027inyon blew a long and low sigh, thoroughly flustered. He and Drizzt had been classmates at Melee Magthere, the Academy\u0027s school of fighters. Berg\u0027inyon, trained by Dantrag, had gone there fully expecting to be the finest fighter in his class. Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the renegade, the traitor, had beaten him for that honor every year. Berg\u0027inyon had done well at the Academy, by every standard except Dantrag\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you prepared for him?\" Dantrag pressed, his tone growing more serious and angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Berg\u0027inyon glowered at his brother, sitting astride the hanging lizard, a cocky grin on his handsome face. Dantrag had forced the answer for a reason, Berg\u0027inyon knew. Dantrag wanted to make certain that Berg\u0027inyon knew his place as a spectator if they should happen to encounter the rogue Do\u0027Urden together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Berg\u0027inyon knew, too, why his brother wanted the first try at Drizzt. Drizzt had been trained by Zak\u0027nafein, Dantrag\u0027s princi\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;pal rival, the one weapon master in Menzoberranzan whose fight\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ing skills were more highly regarded than those of Dantrag. By all accounts, Drizzt had become at least Zak\u0027nafein\u0027s equal, and if Dantrag could defeat Drizzt, then he might at last come out from under Zak\u0027nafein\u0027s considerable shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have fought us both, \" Dantrag said slyly. \"Do tell me, dear brother, who is the better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerg\u0027inyon couldn\u0027t possibly answer that question. He hadn\u0027t fought against, or even beside, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden for more than thirty years. \"Drizzt would cut you down, \" he said anyway, just to peeve his upstart sibling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDantrag\u0027s hand flashed faster than Berg\u0027inyon could follow. The weapon master sent his wickedly sharp sword across the top strap of Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s saddle, easily cutting the binding, though it was enchanted for strength. Dantrag\u0027s second hand came across equally fast, slipping the bridle from the lizard\u0027s mouthpiece as Berg\u0027inyon plummeted from his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe younger brother turned upright as he fell. He looked into that area of innate magic common to all drow, and stronger in drow nobles. Soon the descent had ceased, countered by a levitation spell that had Berg\u0027inyon, death lance still in hand, slowly rising back up to meet his laughing brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatron Baenre would kill you if she knew that you had embarrassed me so in front of the common soldiers, Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s hand flashed in the silent code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter to have your pride cut than your throat, Dantrag\u0027s hands flashed in reply, and the older Baenre walked his mount away, back around the stalactites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside the lizard again, Berg\u0027inyon worked to retie the top strap and fasten together the bridle. He had claimed Drizzt to be the better fighter, but, in considering what Dantrag had just done to him, a perfectly aimed two hit attack before he could even begin to retaliate, the younger Baenre doubted his claim. Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he decided, would be the one to pity if and when the two fighters faced off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought pleased young Berg\u0027inyon. Since his days in the Academy, he had lived in Drizzt\u0027s shadow, much as Dantrag had lived in Zak\u0027nafein\u0027s. If Dantrag defeated Drizzt, then the Brothers Baenre would be proven the stronger fighters, and Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s rep\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;utation would rise simply because of his standing as Dantrag\u0027s pro\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tegee. Berg\u0027inyon liked the thought, liked that he stood to gain without having to stand toe to toe against that devilish purple eyed Do\u0027Urden again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the fight would come to an even more promising con\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;clusion, Berg\u0027inyon dared to hope. Perhaps Dantrag would kill Drizzt, and then, weary and probably wounded, Dantrag would fall easy prey to Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s sword. Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s reputation, as well as his position, would rise further, for he would be the logical choice to replace his dead brother in the coveted position as weapon master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young Baenre rolled over in midair to find his place on the repaired saddle, smiling evilly at the possibilities afforded him in this upcoming journey to Mithril Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerlys, \" the drow whispered grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerlys Horlbar?\" Jarlaxle asked, and the mercenary leaned against the rough wall of the stalagmite pillar to consider the star\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tling news. Jerlys Horlbar was a matron mother, one of the two high priestesses presiding over House Horlbar, the twelfth house of Men\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;zoberranzan. Here she lay, dead, under a pile of rubble, her tentacle rod ruined and buried beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is good we followed him, the soldier\u0027s flicking fingers remarked,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;more to placate the mercenary leader than to make any pertinent revelations. Of course it was good that Jarlaxle had ordered that one followed. He was dangerous, incredibly dangerous, but, seeing a matron mother, a high priestess of the Spider Queen, lying dead,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;sliced by a wicked sword, the mercenary had to wonder if he, too,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;had underestimated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can report it and absolve ourselves of responsibility, another of Bregan D\u0027aerthe\u0027s dark band signaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, that notion struck Jarlaxle as sound advice. The matron mother\u0027s body would be found, and there would be a serious inquiry, by House Horlbar if by no one else. Guilt by association was a very real thing in Menzoberranzan, especially for such a seri\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ous crime, and Jarlaxle wanted no part of a covert war with the twelfth house, not now, with so many other important events brew\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jarlaxle let the circumstances lead him down another avenue of possibility. As unfortunate as this event seemed, the mer\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;cenary might still turn it to profit. There was at least one wild card in this game that Matron Baenre played, an unknown factor that could take the impending chaos to new levels of glory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBury her once more, the mercenary signaled, deeper under the pile this time, but not completely. I want the body found, but not for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hard boots making not a sound, his ample jewelry quiet, the mercenary leader started from the alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre we to rendezvous? one soldier flashed to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle shook his head and continued on, out of the remote alley. He knew where to find the one who had killed Jerlys Horlbar,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and knew, too, that he could use this information against him, per\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;haps to heighten his slavish loyalty to Bregan D\u0027aerthe, or perhaps for other reasons. Jarlaxle had to play the whole thing very carefully,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he knew. He had to walk a narrow line between intrigue and war\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;fare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone in the city could do that better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUthegental will be prominent in the days to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDantrag Baenre cringed when the thought drifted into his mind. He understood its source, and its subtle meaning. He and the weapon master of House Barrison Del\u0027Armgo, House Baenre\u0027s chief rival, were considered the two greatest fighters in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatron Baenre will use his skills, the next telepathic message warned. Dantrag drew out his surface stolen sword and looked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt flared a thin red line of light along its impossibly sharp edge, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe two rubies set into the eyes of its demon sculpted pommel flared with inner life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDantrag\u0027s hand clasped the pommel and warmed as Khazid\u0027hea,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Cutter, continued its communication. He is strong and will fare well in the raids on Mithril Hall. He lusts for the blood of the young Do\u0027Urden,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the legacy of Zak\u0027nafein, as greatly as you do, perhaps even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDantrag sneered at that last remark, thrown in only because Khazid\u0027hea wanted him on the edge of anger. The sword considered Dantrag its partner, not its master, and knew that it could better manipulate Dantrag if he was angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter many decades wielding Khazid\u0027hea, Dantrag, too, knew all of this, and he forced himself to keep calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None desire Drizzt Do\u0027Urden\u0027s death more than I, \" Dantrag assured the doubting sword. \"And Matron Baenre will see to it that I, not Uthegental, have the opportunity to slay the renegade. Matron Baenre would not want the honors that would undoubtedly accom\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;pany such a feat to be granted to a warrior of the second house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword\u0027s red line flared again in intensity and reflected in Dantrag\u0027s amber eyes. Kill Uthegental, and her task will become easier,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Khazid\u0027hea reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDantrag laughed aloud at the notion, and Khazid\u0027hea\u0027s fiendish eyes flared again. \"Kill him?\" Dantrag echoed. \"Kill one that Matron Baenre has deemed important for the mission ahead? She would flay the skin from my bones!\" But you could kill him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDantrag laughed again, for the question was simply to mock him, to urge him on to the fight that Khazid\u0027hea had desired for so very long. The sword was proud, at least as proud as either Dantrag or Uthegental, and it wanted desperately to be in the hands of the indisputably finest weapon master of Menzoberranzan, whichever of the two that might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must pray that I could, \" Dantrag replied, turning the tables on the impetuous sword. \"Uthegental favors his trident, and no sword. If he proved the victor, then Khazid\u0027hea might end up in the scabbard of a lesser fighter.\" He would wield me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDantrag slid the sword away, thinking the preposterous claim not even worth answering. Also tired of this useless banter,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Khazid\u0027hea went silent, brooding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword had opened some concerns for Dantrag. He knew the importance of this upcoming assault. If he could strike down the young Do\u0027Urden, then all glory would be his, but if Uthegental got there first, then Dantrag would be considered second best in the city,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a rank he could never shake unless he found and killed Uthegental. His mother would not be pleased by such events, Dantrag knew. Dantrag\u0027s life had been miserable when Zak\u0027nafein Do\u0027Urden had been alive, with Matron Baenre constantly urging him to find and slay the legendary weapon master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Matron Baenre probably wouldn\u0027t even allow him that option. With Berg\u0027inyon coming into excellence as a fighter,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Matron Baenre might simply sacrifice Dantrag and turn the coveted position of weapon master over to her younger son. If she could claim that the move was made because Berg\u0027inyon was the better fighter, that would again spread doubt among the populace as to which house had the finest weapon master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe solution was simple: Dantrag had to get Drizzt. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/starless-night-legacy-of-the-drow-2/page-8.html","bookId":2128,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:02 PM"}
