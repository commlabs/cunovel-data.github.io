I had a horrible headache from the transition. Or perhaps it was from the heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are several miles outside of Cairo, actually. This should be the temple of Ankh-al-Sekhem\u0027s apprentice. He served as a high priest under Ramses the Second and died in the Tenth Dynasty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is his tomb?\" I glanced around at the brilliant gold-leafed paintings on the walls. Lit torches cast unholy shadows across them. An alabaster sarcophagus stood in the center of the temple. Hieroglyphics decorated all four sides, no doubt a curse upon whoever disturbed the apprentice\u0027s grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not help shuddering. The crown prince drew a small knife from a scabbard inside his jacket. \"Katerina, your assistance is required.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized what he intended to do. \"No. I will not let you take my blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, Duchess. I do hope it will not come to that.\" He laughed as he used the blade to break the wax seal on the sarcophagus. \"You must help me lift the lid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must we open it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where else do you think the apprentice hid the sword? It is buried with him. I\u0027m sure of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelieved he did not intend to resurrect the Egyptian, I helped him shove the heavy lid to the side. I took a torch from the wall and held it over the open sarcophagus, giving Danilo light to examine the body inside. The heat from the flames was oppressive in the tiny space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apprentice\u0027s mummified body had been wrapped in linen that had long since dried in the arid desert climate. No gold ornaments adorned his body. The only thing of value buried with the unfortunate man was a scroll that was clasped in his calcified hand. The fingers broke off as Danilo pried the scroll out. He unrolled it and held it up to the light, his face first triumphant, then clouded with disappointment. \"It is not here.\" He threw the scroll to the floor and turned back to the tomb. He reached in and pulled at the linens. \"The sword must be in here with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does the scroll say?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is rubbish. A prayer to the gods.\" He pulled great frayed lengths of linen out of the sarcophagus. He was destroying the mummy. If the Egyptian authorities discovered us, we could be arrested. \"What has he done with it?\" Danilo shouted. \"It must be in here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThick black smoke began to pour out around the sarcophagus. The dim light the torch gave us was not enough to help see through the smoke. I was too frightened to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid Egyptian,\" Danilo snarled. \"Does he think he can frighten us with his tricks? Katerina, it\u0027s merely levers and chemicals. A way to frighten off grave robbers. Pay no attention to it. Bring the light closer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped toward his voice, finding him leaning over the sarcophagus. \"Shine the light in here,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held the torch over his head. There was nothing left of the mummy of Ankh-al-Sekhem\u0027s apprentice except a pile of shredded linen at the bottom of the alabaster tomb. \"There is no sword, Danilo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn!\" He banged the side of the sarcophagus with his palms and stared into the dark tomb for several moments before finally speaking. \"Well, there\u0027s only one other thing to do, then.\" He drew out his blade again. \"I will need your hand, Katerina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sharp teeth gleamed as he smiled. \"I\u0027m afraid you have no say in the matter.\" He grabbed my wrist and twisted it, wrenching my palm up. With a quick slice, he opened my palm, the blood rushing to fill the cut. My hand throbbed in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo closed his eyes as he raised my hand to his lips. \"The strength of Isis, the heart of Isis, the power of Isis is mine,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he drank my blood, I felt dizzy, and the room began to spin. The talisman around my neck grew warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA horrible moan, low and deep, rose out of the sarcophagus and grew into a screech. All of the black smoke in the room gathered in the center, creating a whirlwind. The smoke was being drawn back into the sarcophagus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I cried as I pulled my hand out of Danilo\u0027s grasp. \"We must get out of here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" the crown prince shouted. He glared at the smoke. \"Apprentice! Show yourself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the black smoke, the ancient Egyptian rose. No longer wrapped in the burial linens, he was little more than a shrunken corpse. There were no eyes in the sockets in his face, only black holes. But I could still recognize him. Ankh-al-Sekhem had tricked us. This had been his tomb. Not that of his apprentice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smoke turned into a swarm of insects, black moths and scarabs. I tried to shield my face with my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Konstantin Pavlovich.\" The undead Egyptian\u0027s voice was hoarse. \"I will have my revenge upon you at last!\" He reached for me with a cold, clawlike hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumbled backward in fright. \"Danilo! Do something!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He should be under your control, Katerina! Use the talisman! Make him return inside the sarcophagus!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Egyptian was not under my control. I had not raised him from the dead. He had used ancient black magic and my blood to return from the Graylands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnkh-al-Sekhem\u0027s laughter was raspy. \"You are both powerful, but not that powerful. The prayer your vain crown prince recited brought me back. It needed only your blood to add to the magic and set off the spell.\" He climbed out of his sarcophagus, surprising me with his sudden agility. \"And now, at last, I can seek my revenge upon you, Konstantin Pavlovich!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crown prince pulled me out of the way just in time and ran to the next chamber, a room crowded with stacked piles of sarcophagi. The chamber opened up onto a long hall lined with more mummies. I didn\u0027t know where to run. We were surrounded by the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot escape me!\" the Egyptian wheezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had nowhere left to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katerina, we must work together if we are to defeat him,\" Danilo said. \"Give me your hand!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! There must be some other way!\" I shouted. \"Sheult Anubis!\" I raised my hands and drew a cloak of shadows around us. It was the only spell I knew as a necromancer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as soon as the shadows began to gather, Ankh-al-Sekhem waved the bony fingers on the hand he had left. \"Clever, young duchess. But not clever enough.\" His magic caused the shadows to scatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had nothing left with which to protect us. Except the Talisman of Isis. I held it to my bleeding hand and closed my eyes. \"The blood of Isis, the strength of Isis, the power of Isis is mine,\" I whispered. My hand burned and it took everything I had to hold on to the talisman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katerina, what are you doing?\" Danilo shouted. He held his knife out, as if he could defend us against Ankh-al-Sekhem with it. But the Egyptian necromancer smiled as the blade flew out of Danilo\u0027s hand and skittered across the stone floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a low, rumbling vibration as the temple shook. Most of the moths and scarabs had scattered, although there were a few with broken wings fluttering helplessly at my feet. With my incantation, the dead insects became my servants. They heralded the arrival of Danilo\u0027s and my new allies, the mummies that had been buried in the temple with Ankh-al-Sekhem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHissing and moaning, the mummies shuffled into the burial chamber. Most of them had been sacrificed ritually to accompany the necromancer in his death. They were ready to reap their vengeance upon Ankh-al-Sekhem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs dozens of scrabbling dried mummies clawed their way toward us, I tried to stay calm. I had to keep them under my control or we\u0027d be dead. \"Defend us!\" I shouted to my new minions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancient necromancer was able to deflect those first attacks, but the mummies continued to come after him. Danilo laughed. \"Very clever, Katerina. Now we must go while he is distracted.\" He pulled me by the arm down the long hallway. We saw light at the end and hoped it was a doorway to the outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will never learn where the Morning Star is hidden!\" Ankh-al-Sekhem yelled after us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as we made it into the fresh air, Danilo pushed the stone door shut and sealed Ankh-al-Sekhem inside his tomb, along with the angry undead mummies. We could no longer hear his screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank down into the sand, clutching the talisman to me. My breathing was ragged and uneven. Why had I helped Konstantin instead of the Egyptian? Wasn\u0027t one evil necromancer just as bad as the other? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3/page-22.html","bookId":2655,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:15 AM"}
