The Green-Curtained Room","content":"\u0026nbsp;When my sight cleared, I found myself in a long, low grey room—grey from the smoke and the stone walls. \u0026nbsp;It was lit by a curious hanging lamp of iron, black with soot and oil; a fire of peat smouldered on the deep hearth; for furniture the room had in it a long table black with age, and grease, and oil dribbling from the lamp; heavy black chairs were set on either side of the hearth and at the table, and a black press standing against the wall, its brass fittings green and corroded. \u0026nbsp;The brass candlesticks upon the chimney-piece were green and corroded, too; the curtain drawn before the window was green and moth-eaten; the floor was sanded; the rafters above were black with soot and dusty cobwebs. \u0026nbsp;My captor pulling me forward,—as the old woman waited by the door presently to admit the other rider—dropped me like a sack of meal on to a chair; and straddled before the fire, stretching his arm cramped by the weight of me all that while in saddle. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Blinking up at him I saw him for a huge fellow; p. 66he must have stood six feet in height, and was of a great breadth of shoulder and depth of chest. \u0026nbsp;As his sleeve slipped back from his hairy forearm I saw its swelling muscles, and understood ruefully the ease with which he had held me. \u0026nbsp;His face was handsome in a rough, bold way, though coarse and besotted; his chin and jaws were blue-black from the razor; his hair black and curling; his eyes blood-shot from drink. \u0026nbsp;He wore a battered brown hat, a rough, brown riding coat, with leather breeches and mud-splashed riding boots; his soiled cravat was held by a brooch of flashing red stones. \u0026nbsp;Looking up at him, understanding the strength of the man, for something of good humour in his coarse drunken face I did not fear him, as I feared the crone, whose evil green eyes had glittered at me when my captor thrust me into the house. \u0026nbsp;He grinned down at me, and growled, “So you’re well enough for the time, eh, young sir?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well enough but what’s your purpose with me?

\u0026nbsp;How long am I to wait in this stinkin’ den?”—at which Mother Mag cackled sardonically, choked and spat, lying back against the chimney-piece red-eyed and gasping.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He did not say what hour,” Martin answered, indifferently. \u0026nbsp;“How should he know what hour the coach would come, or we be here? \u0026nbsp;Sit down by the fire, man. \u0026nbsp;Get your pipe; there’s tobacco in the jar on the shelf.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Am I to be kept here all night, when by break o’ day I should be about my business?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Martin lifted his glass as though to admire its colour in the lamp-light. \u0026nbsp;“Go then, my friend,” he said smoothly. \u0026nbsp;“Oh, go by all means! \u0026nbsp;Only blame yourself, not me, for aught that may happen in the course of a day or so. \u0026nbsp;You’d make p. 71a pretty figure in the cart, Roger, and ’twould need a double rope to hold your body.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Damn you!” roared Roger, swinging up his hand, but Martin’s eyes, watching him intently, and the smile flickering still upon his lips, the big man swung round once more and pointed to me. \u0026nbsp;“You’re makin’ a sweet song o’ hangin’, Martin,” he muttered. \u0026nbsp;“You’re sayin’ what your precious gentleman may do or mayn’t, as the case may be. \u0026nbsp;Peach on me, you mean—if so be I don’t wait for him, and if so be I don’t do as I’m told. \u0026nbsp;Only, don’t you be forgettin’, that ’twas him as told us to hold up old Skinflint’s coach, and nab the lad there. \u0026nbsp;And that’s robbery by the King’s highway,—and get that into your head, and keep it there. \u0026nbsp;And, by God, Martin, if he’s got his claws on me, I’ve got my claws on to him from this night forth; and if he talks of hangin’, there’s others—ay, there’s others. \u0026nbsp;You, Martin, and old Mag here, and him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Pish, man,” said Martin, coolly, though his look was livid. \u0026nbsp;“Who’d listen to you?
