As would most other battles of any kind on your planet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs I have said earlier, this does not mean men and women should give up sex, or that sex is part of a hu-man being’s lower nature. It means that sexual energy alone, when not raised to higher chakras and combined with the other energies that make one a whole person, produces choices and outcomes that do not reflect the whole person. These are often less than magnificent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Whole of You is magnificence itself, yet any-thing less than the Whole of You is less than magnifi-cent. So if you want to guarantee that you’ll produce a less-than-magnificent choice or outcome, make a deci-sion from your root chakra center only.

In fact, it’s the biggest one.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI see.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to learn about Divine Dichotomy and understand it thoroughly if you are to live in our uni-verse with grace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDivine Dichotomy holds that it is possible for two apparently contradictory truths to exist simultaneously in the same space.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow on your planet people find this difficult to ac-cept. They like to have order, and anything that does not fit into their picture is automatically rejected. For this reason, when two realities begin to assert them-selves and they seem to contradict one another, the im-mediate assumption is that one of them must be wrong, false, untrue. It takes a great deal of maturity to see, and accept, that, in fact, they might both be true.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet in the realm of the absolute-as opposed to the realm of the relative, in which you live-it is very clear that the one truth which is All There Is sometimes pro-duces an effect which, viewed in relative terms, looks like a contradiction.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is called a Divine Dichotomy, and it is a very real part of the human experience. And as I’ve said, it’s virtually impossible to live gracefully without accepting this. One is always grumbling, angry, thrashing about, vainly seeking “justice,” or earnestly trying to reconcile opposing forces which were never meant to be recon-ciled, but which, by the very nature of the tension be-tween them, produce exactly the desired effect.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe realm of the relative is, in fact, held together by just such tensions. As an example, the tension between good and evil. In ultimate reality there is no such thing as good and evil. In the realm of the absolute, all there is is love. Yet in the realm of the relative you have created the experience of what you “call” evil, and you have done it for a very sound reason. You wanted to experi-ence love, not just “know” that love is All There Is, and you cannot experience something when there is noth-ing else but that. And so, you created in your reality (and continue to do so every day) a polarity of good and evil, thus using one so that you might experience the other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd here we have a Divine Dichotomy—two seem-ingly contradictory truths existing simultaneously in the same place. Specifically:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is such a thing as good and evil.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll there is is love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThank You for explaining this to me. You’ve touched on this before, but thank You for helping me understand Divine Dichotomy even better.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’re welcome.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, as I said, the greatest Divine Dichotomy is the one we are looking at now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is only One Being, and hence, only One Soul. And, there are many souls in the One Being.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHere’s how the dichotomy works: You’ve just had it explained to you that there is no separation between souls. The soul is the energy of life that exists within and around (as the aura of) all physical objects. In a sense, it is that which is “holding” all physical objects in place. The “Soul of Cod” holds in the universe, the “soul of man” holds in each individual human body.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe body is not a container, a “housing,” for the soul; the soul is a container for the body.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat’s right.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet there is no “dividing line” between souls—there is no place where “one soul” ends and “another” begins. And so, it is really one soul holding all bodies.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCorrect.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet the one soul “feels like” a bunch of individual souls.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIndeed it does—indeed I do—by design.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCan You explain how it works?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhile there is no actual separation between souls, it is true that the stuff of which the One Soul is made manifests in physical reality at different speeds, produc-ing different degrees of density.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDifferent speeds? When did speed come in?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of life is a vibration. That which you call life (you could just as easily call it God) is pure energy. That energy is vibrating constantly, always. It is moving in waves. The waves vibrate at different speeds, producing differ-ing degrees of density, or light. This, in turn, produces what you would call different “effects” in the physical world—actually, different physical objects. Yet while the objects are different and discreet, the energy which produces them is exactly the same.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLet Me go back to the example that you used of the air between your living room and dining room. It was a good use of imagery that just popped right out of you. An inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom guess where.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, I gave it to you. Now you said that there was no specific place between those two physical locations where the “air of the living room” stopped and the “air of the dining room” began. And that is true. Yet there is a place where the “air of the living room” becomes less dense. That is, it dissipates, becomes “thinner.” So, too, the “air of the dining room.” The further from the dining room you go, the less you smell dinner!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow the air in the house is the same air. There is no “separate air” in the dining room. Yet the air in the din-ing room sure seems like “other air.” For one thing, it smells different!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo because the air has taken on different character-istics, it seems as though it is different air. But it is not. It is all the same air, seeming different. In the living room you smell the fireplace, in the dining room you smell dinner. You might even go into one room and say, “Whew, it’s stuffy. Let’s get some air in here,” as if there was no air at all. And yet, of course, there’s plenty of air. What you are wanting to do is change its charac-teristics.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo you bring in some air from the outside. Yet that is the same air, too. There is only one air, moving in, around, and through everything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is cool. I totally “get” this. I love the way You explain the universe to me in ways I can totally “get.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, thank you. I’m trying here. So let Me go on.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePlease.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLike the air in your house, the energy of life—what we’ll call the “Soul of Cod”—takes on different charac-teristics as it surrounds different physical objects. In-deed, that energy coalesces in a particular way to form those objects.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs particles of energy join together to form physical matter, they become very concentrated. Mashed up. Pushed together. They begin to “look like,” even “feel like,” distinct units. That is, they begin to seem “sepa-rate,” “different,” from all the other energy. Yet this is all the same energy, behaving differently.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is this very act of behaving differently which makes it possible for That Which Is All to manifest as That Which Is Many.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs I explain in Book 1, That Which Is could not ex-perience Itself as What It is until It developed this ability to differentiate. So That Which Is All separated into That Which Is This, and That Which Is That. (I’m trying to make this very simple now.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe “clumps of energy” which coalesced into dis-creet units that held in physical beings are what you have chosen to call “souls.” The parts of Me that have become the lot of You are what We are talking about here. Thus, the Divine Dichotomy:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is only One of us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are Many of us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhoa—this is great.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’re telling Me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShall I go on?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo, stop here. I’m bored.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, go on!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOkay.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow as energy coalesces, it becomes, as I said, very concentrated. But the further one moves from the point of this concentration, the more dissipated the energy becomes. The “air becomes thinner.” The aura fades. The energy never completely disappears, because it cannot. It is the stuff of which everything is made. It’s All There Is. Yet it can become very, very thin, very sub-tle—almost “not there.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen, in another place (read that, another part of Itself) it can again coalesce, once more “clumping to-gether” to form what you call matter, and what “looks like” a discreet unit. Now the two units appear separate from each other, and in truth there is no separation at all.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is, in very, very simple and elementary terms, the explanation behind the whole physical universe.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWow. But can it be true? How do I know I haven’t just made this all up?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour scientists are already discovering that the building blocks of all of life are the same.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey brought back rocks from the moon and found the same stuff they find in trees. They take apart a tree and find the same stuff they find in you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI tell you this: We are all the same stuff.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe are all the same energy, coalesced, compressed in different ways to create different forms and different matter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNothing “matters” in and of itself. That is, nothing can become matter all by itself. Jesus said, “Without the Father, lam nothing.” The Father of all is pure thought. This is the energy of life. This is what you have chosen to call Absolute Love. This is the God and the Goddess, the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. It is the All-in-All, the Unmoved Mover, the Prime Source. It is that which you have sought to understand from the beginning of time. The Great Mystery, the Endless Enigma, the eternal truth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is only One of Us, and so, it is THAT WHICH YOU ARE.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/633.html","bookId":36,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:46:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:46:31 AM"}
