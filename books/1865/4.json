We\u0027re also anticipating further growth next quarter for Blake Industries, considering the new Armstrong account you\u0027ve acquired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin stroked his fingers rhythmically across the sleek mahogany conference table. \"That\u0027s wonderful news, Barry. Have we heard anything on the Kinsman account?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen pairs of eyes swung to the man as he nervously rifled through some files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother executive chimed in all too eagerly before he could answer. \"Yes, Mr. Blake. They\u0027ve accepted the offer and should be ready to move forward by the end of July, sir.\" The man cleared his throat. \"I gave all of the necessary paperwork to your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin rose from his chair, gave a satisfactory nod, and called the meeting to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the last of the board members exited, Gavin sauntered over to a floor-to-ceiling window in his office. Peering down to the streets of Manhattan, he watched the chaotic lives of others rumble on below him. At the age of twenty-eight, he knew he had the world by the balls. Blake Industries was one of New York\u0027s largest advertising agencies. Nevertheless, he lacked the most vital necessity ever - love. He inwardly knew it; hell, he knew it better than he knew his own facial features. Though he played the dating game after a long-term relationship ended, few - if any contestants - evoked feelings within him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinding someone who truly wanted him for who he was had become...interesting since the breakup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching the tiny figures below scurry along the sidewalks, he found his thoughts racing back to Emily. It had been less than twenty-four hours since he was hit with the fact of whom she really belonged to. Gavin seethed at the fact that Dillon used him as a pawn with Monica. Yet, even though he had an attraction to Emily, Gavin knew he had to cover for his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, his emotions volleyed back and forth between the lie he had been forced to tell and the upsurge of want for her snaking its way through his mind. Sure, some of it was a sexual attraction. Emily was beyond beautiful, and he couldn\u0027t deny that fact. However, that wasn\u0027t what fueled his desire for her. He couldn\u0027t quite define exactly what it was, but he knew it was unlike any other attraction he\u0027d ever had. He felt a connection to her - a deep pull within his gut that she was supposed to be with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttracting, compelling, colliding, their chemistry - to say the least - was explosive. He felt it the first time he laid eyes on her, the drawing energy that radiated from her eyes as she stared into his. Standing among the empire he had built while the sun cast its rays against the steel giants lining the streets, he fought back the overwhelming urge to pay her another unexpected visit. Shaking his head at the insane thought, Gavin moved across his office. He sat down at his desk, went through some quarterly reports, and tried to rid the woman that could never be his from his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then that Gavin\u0027s older brother, Colton, walked into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing his arms in annoyance, Gavin glared at his brother with a displeased look on his face. \"Where were you? Did you not receive the message I left with Natalie regarding the meeting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColton gave Gavin a wry smile. \"I must say you play the roll very well, little man,\" he answered evenly, striding across the office as a muffled laugh left his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop being a wiseass. Really, what the fuck happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, Gavin, I got hung up on the home front with Melanie and the kids. Theresa and Timothy had a preschool musical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" He frowned, rocking back in his black leather chair. He had a soft spot for his niece and nephew. \"I would\u0027ve gone to see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColton waved a dismissive hand, his green eyes shimmering. \"Don\u0027t worry about it; they did just fine without Uncle Gavin.\" He laughed and patted Gavin on his shoulder. \"And I\u0027m sure you did just fine without me during the meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin snorted through his nose and muttered, \"They\u0027re fucking sharks if the numbers aren\u0027t appealing to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the business.\" Colton shrugged and took a seat on the black leather couch. \"We have people who invest in our company, and we need to produce the revenue they\u0027re looking for in return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding up from his chair, Gavin effectively ignored his brother\u0027s words and walked back over to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you ever going to secure an evening out with Alicia?\" Colton probed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout turning around, Gavin crossed his arms and let out a chuckle. \"I can\u0027t deny that I don\u0027t admire the way you\u0027re able to seemingly transition from one topic to the next, Colton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a true compliment somewhere in that statement. But seriously, man, Melanie\u0027s been bothering me about hooking you two up for a while. Just come out with us one night and decide if she\u0027d be someone who would interest you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you two are on the finding-Gavin-a-secure-relationship mission again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mission - not quite. But I think it\u0027s about time you get over her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnapping his head in Colton\u0027s direction, Gavin\u0027s eyes lit up with raw amusement. \"Do you think I\u0027m honestly not over her?\" He almost laughed. \"It\u0027s been two years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she definitely caused you to draw back from forming other attachments - long-term attachments, that is.\" Colton rose from the couch. \"They\u0027re not all the same, little man. She was just in it for all the wrong reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin\u0027s jaw tensed almost imperceptibly. \"I really have no desire at all to talk about this,\" he said, his voice holding a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough. Are you coming to dinner tonight at Mom and Dad\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging into his suit jacket, the barest suggestion of a smile played on his lips. \"Yes, I\u0027ll be there - with the exception that you and my wonderful sister-in-law are not hiding a secret date for me under the table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColton dug his keys from his pocket, gave an impish smirk, and walked out of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Gavin left, it was gridlock in Manhattan. Sighing, he rubbed a palm over his face as he gripped the steering wheel of his black BMW. While waiting for a herd of pedestrians to cross the street, he realized he was at the corner beside the restaurant where Emily worked. The blood drained from his face at the sight of her opening the door to leave. Pinching the bridge of his nose, he contemplated pulling over to say hello, but as soon as the idea entered his mind, a horn cut through his thoughts. Flipping the bird to the impatient driver, Gavin slid into first gear and navigated his way through traffic. He averted his eyes to the rearview mirror, trying to catch one last glimpse of her. It was then that his father\u0027s far-fetched story about love at first sight slammed into his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s out there, son, and when you find her, you\u0027ll know it the very second you see her. She\u0027ll pull at your every instinct. Without any regard to the natural order of things, she\u0027ll just...appear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is utterly fucking hilarious,\" he laughed, tapping his finger on the steering wheel. \"I\u0027ve got to be out of my mind thinking about this girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith so many conflicting emotions, over the next hour, Gavin thought about his beliefs carefully. As Manhattan\u0027s skyline disappeared from view and the sprawling trees that layered upstate replaced it, he swore to himself that he would try to rid Emily from his mind - though he wasn\u0027t quite sure if that was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApplying the last bit of mascara to her lashes, Emily tore her attention away from the mirror. The slamming door signaled Olivia\u0027s arrival home from work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried into the living room. \"I\u0027ve been calling and texting you all day,\" Emily let out breathlessly, slipping on a pair of red heels. \"Why didn\u0027t you call me back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia tossed her purse on the couch. \"I left the damn thing here.\" She walked into the kitchen and yanked it from the counter. Looking over to Emily, she beamed a smile. \"You\u0027re looking hot. What\u0027s the special occasion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine and Dillon\u0027s nine-month anniversary. He\u0027ll be here soon,\" Emily hastily replied, walking over to her. \"You were sleeping when I got home last night. You have no idea who I met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I was wondering why you were gone when I returned.\" Olivia stabbed her passcode into her phone. \"Okay, let me guess. Uh, Brad Pitt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m being serious, Liv. You\u0027ll never guess, so don\u0027t even try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! I want one more shot.\" Olivia paused. \"Hmm, President Obama?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is going nowhere real fast.\" Emily laughed and sank into a seat at the table. \"I met the one and only...wait for it...wait for it...Gavin Blake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Totally hot, right?\" Olivia asked, bringing her phone up to her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily smiled. \"Yes, completely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now admit my description of the walking god was on point, since, if I recall correctly,\" Olivia tapped her finger on her chin, \"when I gave you the prior mentioned walking-gods description, you begged to differ that any man could be that delicious looking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you pretty much hit the nail on the head,\" Emily laughed. \"But I\u0027m more than sure you want to hear the details of our prior meetings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia quickly slid her phone shut. \"Prior?\" She crossed the room in two strides and lounged into a seat. \"You have my attention. Spill it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning her elbows on the table, Emily tented her fingers under her chin. \"Let me see...oh, yes...he\u0027s the man I had the encounter with at the Chrysler Building while delivering the food that one day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia\u0027s brown eyes widened, but she remained silent, unwavering shock oozing from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily dropped her tone huskily. \"Yes, and he\u0027s the little stalker who came to my job, leaving me his name and number - oh, and a pretty decent tip, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut the front door, woman! Mr. Tall, Dark, and Fuckable Handsome is Gavin?\" Olivia squealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily nodded and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you messing with me, Em? Cause if so, that\u0027s seriously fucked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning back in her chair, Emily crossed her arms, a smirk tipping her lips. \"I swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should just go out with him,\" Olivia shrugged. \"Obviously, he\u0027s made an impression on you, and you\u0027ve made one on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words, so seemingly casual, threw Emily off. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have this dopey, dreamy look on your face. I know you\u0027re imagining jumping his bones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re joking, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia rose to her feet and made her way to her bedroom. \"Are you asking if I\u0027m joking about the dopey look on your face, going out with him, or jumping his bones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Olivia, you know what I\u0027m talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re acting surprised that I would say any of those things, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked, Emily swiftly followed behind her. She leaned against Olivia\u0027s door and placed her hands on her hips. \"Are you really serious about what you just said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia peeled off her clothes, strolled to the bathroom, and stepped into the shower. \"It\u0027s no secret how I feel about Douchebag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, that\u0027s right. Because how you feel about my boyfriend is what matters here,\" Emily interposed sardonically as she walked into the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not give Gavin a try?\" Olivia asked coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily ticked the reasons off on her fingers. \"One, I love Dillon. Two, I love Dillon. And three, guess what? I love Dillon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia mocked Tina Turner in her finest sultry singing voice. \"What\u0027s love got to do with it?\" She laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve completely lost it, Liv. And, even if I weren\u0027t with Dillon, you\u0027ve killed the ever-wanting-to-entertain-Gavin-Blake opinion from my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia poked her head out from behind the shower curtain. \"How did I kill your opinion of him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see...he\u0027s a ladies\u0027 man is the first thing that enters my memory.\" Drawing in a deep breath, Emily paused in thought. \"Oh, and you don\u0027t think he\u0027s capable of staying with any woman longer than a week is another. Shall I go on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia shut the water off and stepped out of the shower. Emily handed her a towel. \"Right, that was after his fiancee, Gina, broke up with him when he started acting like that. Before the infamous split, he was a total package.\" Olivia wrapped the towel around her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was engaged?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeppers,\" Olivia piped back, sliding into a pair of black shorts and a white tank top. \"They dated for almost five years, then one day he came home, and she was gone. Packed her shit and moved out of his apartment while he was at work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfusion creased Emily\u0027s brows. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To tell you the truth, he never told my brother exactly what happened. And when I\u0027ve asked him about it, he doesn\u0027t want to discuss it, so I have no idea,\" she replied, pulling her makeup bag out of the drawer. \"But you saw him. That man\u0027s been blessed by the proverbial fucking-hot-as-sin gene. He\u0027s worth millions and - really, I\u0027m not kidding - he\u0027s a decent guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why have you never dated him then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lord, I\u0027ve known him way too long. Let\u0027s just say it would be like me banging my brother.\" Olivia crinkled her nose in distaste. \"Even though I have the utmost respect for the glorious gene pool that fine piece of fuckable ass has been bathed in, I sort of look at him like an older brother. It\u0027d be way too weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long has he been friends with Trevor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure have a ton of questions for a girl who\u0027s not considering playing naughty,\" Olivia quipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily dismissively waved her hand as she turned to the mirror to study her reflection. \"I\u0027m trying to get in the loop here. Dillon tells me nothing about his friends or coworkers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if the answer you\u0027re really seeking is if Dillon and Gavin have been friends as long as my brother and Gavin have been, the answer is no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for some reason, I thought they all went to high school together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia reached under the sink for the dryer, plugged it in, and turned it on high. Her voice rose as she dried her golden hair. \"No, Trevor and Gavin went to high school together. They\u0027ve known each other longer. Trevor works under Dillon at the firm; this you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When my brother started working at Morgan and Buckingham, Dillon was already a stockbroker there. That\u0027s how my brother met your totally awesome dickhead boyfriend,\" Olivia laughed and Emily rolled her eyes. \"When Trevor was prepping to take his Series 7 Exam to become a broker, Dillon asked him if he knew anyone that had a decent bank account. Trying to impress a higher-up, my brother introduced Dillon to Gavin, and the rest is history. They\u0027ve been friends for the last three years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very cool.\" Or not, Emily thought to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, supposedly, Blake Industries is the largest account Dillon handles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shrugged. \"So? Big deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So...you could thank Gavin for the money your boyfriend has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily thought about the countless nights Dillon spent at the office, landing different clients in order to earn a living. Even though Gavin played some part in Dillon\u0027s newly acquired wealth, she knew her boyfriend worked above and beyond Blake Industries to make that money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe simply bowed her appreciations. \"Well, thank you for that very educational background of the three men\u0027s histories together. You\u0027re too kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily went to walk out of the bathroom, but Olivia spoke up one last time. \"Want to know something really funny, chick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stopped in the threshold and waited for her to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Gavin who was supposed to come out and visit that one weekend with my brother when we were in school - not Dillon. Crazy to think that right now you probably would\u0027ve been dating him instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint smile tugged at Emily\u0027s mouth as she stared into her friend\u0027s eyes. The ringing of Emily\u0027s phone broke through the few seconds of silence. She moved to the kitchen to retrieve the call. It was Dillon, announcing he was waiting for her downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing her purse, Emily strode to the door as Olivia blew her a kiss goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look amazing tonight,\" Dillon breathed into Emily\u0027s hair as they made their way into a quaint little restaurant nestled on the lapping shores of Liberty State Park. Placing his hand on the small of her back, he leaned closer and nipped at her ear. \"And I have to admit that pretty red dress will come off by the end of the evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiggling at his obvious gesture, Emily pushed up on her tiptoes to kiss him. \"And I have no disputes with it coming off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a quick moment to catalog Dillon\u0027s features, sighing with warmth at his boyish good looks. His dirty-blonde hair was naturally mussed as if she had just run her fingers through it, and his light brown eyes reminded her of a perfect blend of caramel and chocolate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had made reservations for the special evening, making sure they had a table overlooking the water. It offered some of the best views of the Statue of Liberty in the distance. The waiter led them onto a lavish patio lined with trees and subtle landscaping. The view of the harbor swept Emily\u0027s breath from her as she took in the sights New York had to offer under the stars. Although it was the first few days in July, the air held a crisp, cooling breeze on this particular night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter placing their order and enjoying two glasses of red wine, Emily looked to Dillon. His gaze was transfixed on hers as she tucked a piece of hair behind her ear. She felt a blush dance across her cheeks, and she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding his arm across the linen-draped table, he reached for her hand, smoothing the pad of his thumb along her knuckles. \"You really have no idea how beautiful you are,\" he remarked, inclining his body ever so subtly over the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you\u0027re really trying your hardest to get some tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckling, he held her hand tighter. \"Touche. I already know that I\u0027m getting some - willing or unwilling on your part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shook her head and laughed. \"You\u0027re in a very frisky mood right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and casually leaned back in his seat. \"Yes, I am. But how could I not be?\" he said, gesturing to her slightly exposed cleavage with his head. \"Although, I must say, I wish you would wear something that covered you up a little more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily adjusted the straps of her dress, pulling it up higher on her chest. \"Is it that bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I like to keep what\u0027s mine to myself.\" He cleared his throat and took a sip of wine. \"Okay, let\u0027s talk about something else before I take you right here on this table. So how was your day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot meeting his eyes, Emily traced the rim of her glass with two fingers. \"It was okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel self-conscious now, Dillon,\" she replied, glancing around the patio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emily, I didn\u0027t mean it like that.\" He reached across the table and lifted her chin with one finger. Her eyes came to rest on his. \"I just don\u0027t like when other men stare. You look stunning, but like I said, you\u0027re mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ll pay more attention to what I wear from now on.\" A faint smile tugged at her lips. \"But, to be honest, I actually like when other women stare at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do. I know you\u0027re with me, and that\u0027s all that matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re a woman, that\u0027s why. Men have other things in mind when they stare like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterrupting the conversation, the waiter arrived with another bottle of wine and two plates of Beef Wellington. The rest of the evening\u0027s talk focused on Dillon taking Emily to do some sightseeing around the city. It was something that she had looked forward to since she had yet to do it - at least not with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicking up the empty plates, the waiter looked to Emily and handed her a dessert menu. His thick, French accent slid from his tongue. \"The chef recommends the creme brulee medley, consisting of chocolate, vanilla, and banana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds good to me,\" Emily replied, handing the menu back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faint sound of an infant crying caught Dillon\u0027s attention. He glanced at Emily. \"That baby is driving me nuts. Do you really have to get dessert?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily sheepishly smiled, flicking her eyes in the direction of the couple who were trying to soothe the baby. \"It\u0027s just a baby, Dillon. And no, I don\u0027t have to get dessert, but I want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon\u0027s head snapped up as he glared at the waiter. \"Fine, bring her the medley. But is there a possibility of removing the people with the screaming child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily\u0027s smile fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologize, sir, but I\u0027m not able to do that,\" the waiter answered, noticeably uncomfortable by his request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon\u0027s eyes hardened on the man. \"Surely there\u0027s a manager that I could speak with then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupefied at his remark, Emily interjected immediately. She looked up to the waiter. \"Please, there\u0027s no need to do that. You can just place it in a to-go box for me. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may make for a mess in a to-go box, Miss. May I recommend our cheesecake if this will not be enjoyed here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s fine. And thank you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter nodded and whisked off to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily\u0027s jaw dropped open as she yanked the napkin from her lap, tossing it on the table. \"Jesus, Dillon, what the hell was that about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted in his chair, trying to drag his attention away from the couple and the now screaming baby. He rubbed his fingers against his temples. \"I\u0027m sorry. It was a long day at work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still, that was completely mortifying,\" she huffed, leaning back against the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I\u0027m sorry, Em. I\u0027m just exhausted from working all of these late nights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of guilt coursed through her as she reached across the table for his hand. \"I know you\u0027ve been working hard lately. But, honestly, what are you going to do when we have children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter returned with both the dessert and the bill. Dillon retrieved his credit card and handed it to the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small smile crept over Dillon\u0027s face. \"I wouldn\u0027t want you messing up that gorgeous body by having children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I do want children eventually, so I guess you will have to endure a messed-up body on my part one day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising from his seat, he buttoned his suit jacket and offered his hand to Emily. She stood up with him. \"We have time for children, babe,\" he whispered against her cheek. He signed his name on the receipt when the waiter returned. \"Come on, I have something special for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily followed him out to the docks that lined the restaurant, her eyes feasting on the skyscrapers towering over them. The sparkling of lights from the windows, indicating the presence of others so high in the sky, amazed her. A cool breeze swept across her skin as she slipped her heels off, so they wouldn\u0027t get caught between the boards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking hand in hand, Dillon held her heels as he led her to the end of the docks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe circled his arms around her waist. \"Happy anniversary,\" he said, handing her a black velvet box. \"I love you very much, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily\u0027s heart quickened with anxiety as her body trembled with anticipation. She licked her lips slowly. \"Dillon...I...we...\" she stammered, unable to finish the rest of her sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCocking his neck to the side, a low laugh escaped his lips. \"You were just talking about having children with me, Em.\" He tenderly brushed the hair from her face. \"But it\u0027s not what you think it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting out an audible breath, Emily stared at him. His familiar brown eyes gazed back as she opened the box, revealing a pair of stunning, one-carat diamond earrings. Emily gasped at their beauty. Dillon took them from the box, removed the earrings she was wearing, and secured them on her lobes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking down to the ground, Emily lightly fingered one of the diamonds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon brushed her cheek with the back of his hand. \"They look beautiful on you.\" He dipped his head, forcing her to stare into his eyes. \"Though, I have to say, you looked like you were about to pass out when I gave you the box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her hand and traced her fingers against his jaw. \"They\u0027re beautiful. Thank you so much. I just got a little...nervous, you know? I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027d be ready for marriage just yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slow smile curled his lips as his warm fingers splayed across her lower back. He pulled her to him. \"Be ready soon enough, babe,\" he crooned softly against her ear. \"Because I\u0027m marrying you one day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his breath in her ear, he ran his tongue along the curved edge, gently sucking her lobe into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hair on her nape stood on end from his rapt attention to the spot he knew would send her over the edge. Thrusting her fingers into his hair, she pressed her lips against his. Their lips moved together as he swept his tongue through her mouth. He smoothed his hands down her waist and pulled her closer, his kiss growing hungrier by the second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her inner senses becoming too hot for the public onslaught of affection, Emily pulled back and slowly grabbed him by the hand. \"Let\u0027s go,\" she breathed out, trying to contain the spiked level of need running through her. \"Okay, let\u0027s talk before I take you right here on the docks,\" she laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alright, but the talking ends once we get back to my place.\" He eyed her seductively as his grip on her hand tightened. \"Okay, something to talk about...something to talk about. Oh, you took off for this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily came to an abrupt stop; her brow drew up in confusion. \"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gavin\u0027s Fourth of July party. We told you about it last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, but that\u0027s Saturday. Why do I need off all three days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon snaked his arm around her waist and continued to lead her to his Mercedes. \"Because Gavin Blake doesn\u0027t throw what you would consider a normal Fourth of July party.\" Smiling, he opened the door for her. \"We party the whole weekend. We\u0027ll sleep there Friday and Saturday night and then head back here on Sunday morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily settled herself into the seat of his car, and he closed the door. Once again, she felt her pulse jump but for something completely different now. Her stomach felt nauseated at the thought of having to spend an entire weekend at Gavin\u0027s home in the Hamptons. She had prepared herself to see him again - she had to because he was Dillon\u0027s friend, and there was no doubt they would run into each other from time to time - but this...this was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon lounged into his seat, and the engine purred to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting her lip, Emily looked over at him. \"It\u0027s already Wednesday night, Dillon. I can\u0027t get off all three days. I told Antonio about Saturday, and he was fine with that, but I\u0027m pretty sure he won\u0027t be fine with me taking the entire weekend off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, I\u0027ll go in and say something to him,\" he stated, his voice holding a tone of superiority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dillon, you will do no such thing,\" she replied, her tone showing aggravation. \"I\u0027ll ask him when I get to work tomorrow. Don\u0027t you dare go there and say anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa-whoa,\" he laughed, taking his hands off the steering wheel momentarily and holding them up in surrender. \"Damn, Emily, it was just a gesture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling her eyes, she leaned her head against the window. She wondered two things. One, if she could actually get off work all three days on a holiday weekend, which seemed near impossible in her mind. And two, if she was able to get off, how on earth was she ever going to make it through an entire weekend around Gavin without absolutely losing her mind? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collide-collide-1/page-4.html","bookId":1865,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:42:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:42:35 PM"}
