Drawing in her breath, she continued reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t been prepared, either. I\u0027ve done a lot of thinking since your visit. I want to apologize for the way I behaved. It was a shock to see you. I wasn\u0027t prepared, emotionally or mentally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe I\u0027ve figured out why you came here. You were looking to me for reassurance about this new relationship of yours. Leanne, it\u0027s what I\u0027ve wanted for you all along. You deserve happiness, and I hope that\u0027s what he brings you. I\u0027m the one responsible for the mess I\u0027m in, not you. I\u0027m deeply in debt and will pay for this error in judgment for the rest of my life. I\u0027m the one who broke the law and was sentenced for my crimes. You did nothing wrong, so you shouldn\u0027t have to suffer. It didn\u0027t matter that she was innocent. She was involved whether she wanted to be or not. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas suffering. Yes, Mark had stolen the funds, but she\u0027d been affected by his actions. She wasn\u0027t behind bars and yet she felt like a prisoner all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet on with your life. What we once had was special, but it\u0027s over and there\u0027s no going back for either of us. Find a man, maybe this doctor, who\u0027ll love you and marry you and give you a family. Leanne swallowed her tears. She wanted children. The oncology center was beside the fertility clinic and every day Leanne saw couples desperate for a child, willing to do anything in order to conceive. If that meant drugs, shots, tests, embarrassment, they\u0027d submit themselves to it. Here she was, craving a child, and her husband--the man she\u0027d always hoped would be the father of her children--was out of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I close, I need to clear up one thing. I need to apologize. I led you to believe there\u0027d been other women during our marriage. That was a lie. I was trying to convince you to hate me. Instead, all I did was cause you more pain. While I might have failed in many respects and sunk to levels I never knew I was capable of reaching, not once did I look at another woman. I wasn\u0027t even tempted. You were always my one and only, my wife. Leanne smiled. She knew it; deep down she\u0027d known he was lying. Even more than that, Mark hadn\u0027t been able to live with himself for having misled her. A great weight lifted from her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, I hope and trust you\u0027ll be able to get past our divorce and begin a new life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne closed her eyes. She didn\u0027t know if she could do that, loving Mark the way she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will be the last letter you receive from me. The last communication I will ever send you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark He hadn\u0027t ended with an endearment, either. Still, every word of his letter throbbed with love. He hadn\u0027t said he loved her, but he\u0027d shown her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was all the proof she needed. Mark hadn\u0027t signed those divorce papers because he no longer loved her. He\u0027d done it to protect her. He\u0027d sacrificed his future for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher. He\u0027d guessed correctly. She\u0027d come to him looking for approval, for some indication from him that she was doing the right thing in accepting a date with Michael Everett. She\u0027d gotten that approval now, in the form of a letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she still had the courage, Leanne picked up the phone. She had Michael\u0027s cell phone number and she punched it out, held the receiver to her ear and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello.\" He sounded tentative. \"It\u0027s Leanne Lancaster,\" she said brightly. \"I wanted to thank you for dinner the other night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a good time,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did, too. Do you like crispy baked pork chops?\" she asked. \"Or we can have Italian food if you prefer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah...I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve ever tasted pork chops served that way,\" he said and seemed to find the question amusing. \"I love Italian food, so either is fine by me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll probably have Italian then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you cooking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. How about Sunday night, the twelfth, around six?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Works for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll see you then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sunday,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Leanne said suddenly. If Muriel phoned--or impulsively dropped in, which she\u0027d done once or twice-- while Michael was visiting, it could be awkward. \"Perhaps Monday would be better. Do you mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. Monday it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeanne appreciated how accommodating he was. She hung up and resisted the urge to write Mark and let him know she\u0027d followed his advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might bring someone home with me tonight,\" Macy told Harvey Monday morning. She stood on the other side of the white picket fence that separated their yards. Typical of her neighbor, he ignored her and continued watering the vegetable seedlings coming up in neat rows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy was determined not to move until he responded. Two or three minutes later she was rewarded for her patience when he deigned to acknowledge her comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Male or female?\" Harvey asked without looking in her direction. He kept his back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Male.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat got Harvey\u0027s attention. He turned to face her, the hose, still spurting water, in his hand. \"When did you meet him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A while back,\" she said, not elaborating. \"I want you to meet him, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Is he your boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you bringing him to meet me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a...sort of friend, nothing more. The thing is, I\u0027m not even sure I like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey made a scoffing sound and returned to his watering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m painting a mural in his office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he that persnickety doctor you talked about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\" She grinned. \"Persnickety. I love it. Not a word I\u0027ve actually heard anyone say before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then perhaps you should expand your vocabulary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Yes, he\u0027s that punctilious doctor I mentioned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one who annoyed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was putting it mildly. \"He\u0027s the one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey snorted, but it could have been a laugh. Sometimes it was difficult to tell. \"I\u0027d be interested in meeting that young man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy didn\u0027t question his sudden sociability. \"You will tonight.\" This was working out beautifully. Macy would bring Michael by and introduce him to Harvey, and the two men would chat. Michael would ask a few subtle questions and learn what he needed to know so he could order the proper tests. Her next challenge would be to get Harvey to take those tests, but she\u0027d deal with that when she got to it. \"See you later,\" she said, waving goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey grumbled something unintelligible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy made sure Sammy and her three cats were fed, then took the bus to Michael\u0027s office, her supplies in a large canvas pouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she arrived, Linda Barclay, Dr. Everett\u0027s nurse, let her in and accompanied her to the hallway. Macy removed the amended drawing from her bag, followed by paints, brushes, her purse, her lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was eager to begin the mural. She\u0027d worked on the sketch over the weekend, adding several flourishes she thought Michael would like. Well, she hoped he would. Since their conversation on Thursday, she\u0027d begun to think of him by his first name. And since she was passing him off as her \"sort of friend\" to Harvey, calling him Dr. Everett would be much too formal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The doctor isn\u0027t in yet,\" Linda told her as Macy unrolled the drawing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can get started, though, can\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older woman shrugged. \"I suppose that would be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy still hadn\u0027t made up her mind about Michael\u0027s nurse. The woman stood guard over him as if he were royalty in need of protection. And yet, at times, Macy had the distinct impression that Linda, obviously no fool, might have taken a liking to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it will be, too,\" Macy said decisively. She\u0027d struck her agreement with Michael and he\u0027d approved her idea, minus the zoo bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first order of business was to sketch in the background and the various animals. Since the wall had been freshly painted, or so she\u0027d learned from Linda, Macy didn\u0027t have to prepare it and set about drawing with a thick lead pencil. She did everything freehand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d just started when Michael showed up. He paused when he saw her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning,\" she said cheerfully without interrupting her work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched for a few minutes, although Macy didn\u0027t know what was so fascinating about a few lines. She was still sketching in the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you always hum while you draw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, do I?\" Macy frowned. \"No one\u0027s ever mentioned that before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and smiled warmly. \"You\u0027ll notice I got here before you did this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne side of his mouth lifted in a half smile, and Macy could see that getting him to relax would be a real test of her ability. She wasn\u0027t sure why she found it so important. She guessed it had to do with Hannah. If she\u0027d loved Michael, and clearly she had, there must be more to him than he\u0027d revealed so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to get this done as quickly as possible,\" she told him. Of course, being paid when she was finished was a great incentive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I added a few things to the scene if you want to check it out,\" she said and pointed to the sketch, which she\u0027d rolled out on the floor. \"See the baby giraffe? And the parrots?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared down at it, then nodded. \"I like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping you would.\" She wiped her forearm across her brow. Her hair was tied back with a red Western-style bandanna. An apron covered her denim skirt and Mariners T-shirt, both faded from multiple washings. She didn\u0027t care if she got paint on them, but she liked the way the skirt allowed her freedom of movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked away and returned a couple of minutes later, entering the examination room at the opposite end of the hallway. Macy heard a little boy let out a wail and wondered what had caused him pain. Soon afterward, however, he was giggling. Macy smiled just listening to him. She wouldn\u0027t have guessed it, but Michael seemed to have a way with children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy had hated visiting the doctor as a child and suspected other children felt the same terror she had. As the little boy left, he smiled shyly at Macy. Trailing behind his mother, he paused and studied the partial scene Macy had outlined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you see the zebra?\" she asked, squatting down so they were at eye level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded excitedly. \"The giraffe, too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cameron,\" his mother called, and he hurried after her. When he reached the door, he turned and waved. Macy waved back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe worked all morning without a break and was about to stop for lunch when Michael appeared. \"I\u0027m really going to have to ask you not to hum,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s distracting to me and the staff. I don\u0027t mean to be difficult, but--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it. I didn\u0027t realize it was a problem. All you need to do is ask.\" She pinched her lips shut, then realized she could still hum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d appreciate it,\" he said pointedly. He went into his office and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy stared at his door for a long time. She felt like sticking out her tongue, but didn\u0027t want to be a bad example to some suggestible young patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ate a yogurt and fresh strawberries for lunch at a nearby park. When she came back, she saw that Michael\u0027s office door remained closed. She knocked lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in,\" he called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy stepped inside and pulled the door behind her. Michael apparently ate lunch at his desk because there was an open container with a plastic fork poking out. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-25.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
