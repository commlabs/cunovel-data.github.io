He throws himselfinto the sea to go to the aid of his fatherAs soon as Pinocchio no longer felt the shameful weightof the dog collar around his neck, he started to run acrossthe fields and meadows, and never stopped till he came tothe main road that was to take him to the Fairy\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　When he reached it, he looked into the valley far belowhim and there he saw the wood where unluckily he hadmet the Fox and the Cat, and the tall oak tree where hehad been hanged; but though he searched far and near, hecould not see the house where the Fairy with the AzureHair lived.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He became terribly frightened and, running as fast as hecould, he finally came to the spot where it had once stood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The little house was no longer there. In its place lay asmall marble slab, which bore this sad inscription:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　HERE LIESTHE LOVELY FAIRY WITH AZURE HAIRWHO DIED OF GRIEFWHEN ABANDONED BYHER LITTLE BROTHER PINOCCHIOThe poor Marionette was heartbroken at reading thesewords. He fell to the ground and, covering the cold marblewith kisses, burst into bitter tears. He cried all night, anddawn found him still there, though his tears had driedand only hard, dry sobs shook his wooden frame. Butthese were so loud that they could be heard by thefaraway hills.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　As he sobbed he said to himself:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Oh, my Fairy, my dear, dear Fairy, why did you die?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Why did I not die, who am so bad, instead of you, whoare so good? And my father--where can he be? Please dear Fairy, tell me where he is and I shall never, neverleave him again! You are not really dead, are you? If youlove me, you will come back, alive as before. Don\u0027t youfeel sorry for me? I\u0027m so lonely. If the two Assassins come,they\u0027ll hang me again from the giant oak tree and I willreally die, this time. What shall I do alone in the world?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Now that you are dead and my father is lost, where shallI eat? Where shall I sleep? Who will make my newclothes? Oh, I want to die! Yes, I want to die! Oh, oh, oh!\"Poor Pinocchio! He even tried to tear his hair, but as itwas only painted on his wooden head, he could not even pull it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Just then a large Pigeon flew far above him. Seeing theMarionette, he cried to him:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Tell me, little boy, what are you doing there?\"\"Can\u0027t you see? I\u0027m crying,\" cried Pinocchio, lifting hishead toward the voice and rubbing his eyes with his sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Tell me,\" asked the Pigeon, \"do you by chance knowof a Marionette, Pinocchio by name?\"\"Pinocchio! Did you say Pinocchio?\" replied theMarionette, jumping to his feet. \"Why, I am Pinocchio!\"At this answer, the Pigeon flew swiftly down to the earth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He was much larger than a turkey.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Then you know Geppetto also?\"\"Do I know him? He\u0027s my father, my poor, dear father!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Has he, perhaps, spoken to you of me? Will you take me to him? Is he still alive? Answer me, please! Is he still alive?\"\"I left him three days ago on the shore of a large sea.\"\"What was he doing?\"\"He was building a little boat with which to cross the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　For the last four months, that poor man has been wanderingaround Europe, looking for you. Not having found you yet,he has made up his mind to look for you in the New World,far across the ocean.\"\"How far is it from here to the shore?\" asked Pinocchio anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"More than fifty miles.\"\"Fifty miles? Oh, dear Pigeon, how I wish I had your wings!\"\"If you want to come, I\u0027ll take you with me.\"\"How?\"\"Astride my back. Are you very heavy?\"\"Heavy? Not at all. I\u0027m only a feather.\"\"Very well.\"Saying nothing more, Pinocchio jumped on the Pigeon\u0027sback and, as he settled himself, he cried out gayly:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Gallop on, gallop on, my pretty steed! I\u0027m in a great hurry.\"The Pigeon flew away, and in a few minutes he had reached the clouds. The Marionette looked to see whatwas below them. His head swam and he was so frightenedthat he clutched wildly at the Pigeon\u0027s neck to keephimself from falling.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They flew all day. Toward evening the Pigeon said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I\u0027m very thirsty!\"\"And I\u0027m very hungry!\" said Pinocchio.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Let us stop a few minutes at that pigeon coop down there.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Then we can go on and be at the seashore in the morning.\"They went into the empty coop and there they found nothing buta bowl of water and a small basket filled with chick-peas.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The Marionette had always hated chick-peas. Accordingto him, they had always made him sick; but that nighthe ate them with a relish. As he finished them, he turnedto the Pigeon and said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I never should have thought that chick-peas could be so good!\"\"You must remember, my boy,\" answered the Pigeon,\"that hunger is the best sauce!\"After resting a few minutes longer, they set out again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The next morning they were at the seashore.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Pinocchio jumped off the Pigeon\u0027s back, and the Pigeon,not wanting any thanks for a kind deed, flew away swiftlyand disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The shore was full of people, shrieking and tearing theirhair as they looked toward the sea.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"What has happened?\" asked Pinocchio of a little old woman.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"A poor old father lost his only son some time ago andtoday he built a tiny boat for himself in order to go insearch of him across the ocean. The water is very roughand we\u0027re afraid he will be drowned.\"\"Where is the little boat?\"\"There. Straight down there,\" answered the little old woman,pointing to a tiny shadow, no bigger than a nutshell,floating on the sea.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Pinocchio looked closely for a few minutes and then gave a sharp cry:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"It\u0027s my father! It\u0027s my father!\"Meanwhile, the little boat, tossed about by the angrywaters, appeared and disappeared in the waves. And Pinocchio,standing on a high rock, tired out with searching,waved to him with hand and cap and even with his nose.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It looked as if Geppetto, though far away from theshore, recognized his son, for he took off his cap andwaved also. He seemed to be trying to make everyoneunderstand that he would come back if he were able, butthe sea was so heavy that he could do nothing with his oars.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Suddenly a huge wave came and the boat disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They waited and waited for it, but it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Poor man!\" said the fisher folk on the shore, whisperinga prayer as they turned to go home.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Just then a desperate cry was heard. Turning around,the fisher folk saw Pinocchio dive into the sea and heardhim cry out:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I\u0027ll save him! I\u0027ll save my father!\"The Marionette, being made of wood, floated easilyalong and swam like a fish in the rough water. Now andagain he disappeared only to reappear once more. In atwinkling, he was far away from land. At last he wascompletely lost to view.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Poor boy!\" cried the fisher folk on the shore, and againthey mumbled a few prayers, as they returned home.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/327/3162.html","bookId":135,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:00:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:00:35 AM"}
