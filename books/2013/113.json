I would send my K’Chain Che’Malle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnaster Toe had turned and he seemed to be studying the encampment, the rows upon rows of tents, the wreathed dung smoke of the fires. ‘You have fielded what, ten, twelve thousand warriors?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Closer to fifteen.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yet you have broken up the clans.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In the manner needed to field something resembling a professional army. You must shift their loyalty from the old blood-ties. I’ve seen you badgering your troop commanders, ensuring that they will follow your commands in battle. I’ve seen them in turn badgering their squad leaders, and the squad leaders their squads.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are a soldier, Anaster Toe’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And I hated every moment of it, Redmask.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat matters not. Tell me of your Grey Swords, the tactics they employed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That won’t be much help. I could, however, tell you of the army I originally belonged to, before the Grey Swords.’ He glanced over with his one glittering eye, and Redmask saw amusement there, a kind of mad hilarity that left him uneasy. ‘I could tell you of the Malazans.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have not heard of that tribe.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnaster Toe laughed again. ‘Not a tribe. An empire. An empire three, four times the size of Lether.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You will stay, then?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnaster Toe shrugged. ‘For now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing simple to this man, Redmask realized. Mad indeed, but it could prove a useful madness. ‘Then how,’ he asked, ‘do the Malazans win their wars?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe foreigner’s twisted smile gleamed in the dusk, like the flash of a knife. ‘This could take a while, Redmask.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will send for food.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And oil lamps-I can’t make out a damned thing o your map.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you approve of my intent, Anaster Toc?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To create a professional army? Yes, it’s essential, but it will change everything. Your people, your culture, everything.’ He paused, then added in a dry, mocking tone, ‘You’ll need a new song.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then you must create it,’ Redmask replied. ‘Choose one from among the Malazans. Something appropriate.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAye,’ the man muttered, ‘a dirge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white knife flashed again, and Redmask would rather it had remained sheathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverywhere I looked I saw the signs of war upon the landscape. There the trees had crested the rise, despatching skirmishers down the slope to challenge the upstart low growth in the riverbed, which had been dry as bone until the breaking of the ice dams high in the mountains, where the savage sun had struck in unexpected ambush, a siege that breached the ancient barricades and unleashed torrents of water upon the lowlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here, on this tuck and fold of bedrock, the old scars of glaciers were vanishing beneath advancing mosses, creeping and devouring colonies of lichen which were themselves locked in feuds with kin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnts flung bridges across cracks in the stone, the air above swirling with winged termites, dying in silence in the serrated jaws of rhinazan that swung and ducked as they evaded yet fiercer predators of the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these wars proclaim the truth of life, of existence itself. Now we must ask ourselves, are we to excuse all we do by citing such ancient and ubiquitous laws? Or can we proclaim our freedom of will by defying our natural urge to violence, domination and slaughter? Such were my thoughts-puerile and cynical-as I stood triumphant over the last man I had slain, his lifeblood a dwindling stream down the length of my sword-blade, whilst in my soul there surged such pleasure as to leave me trembling…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– King Kilanbas in the Valley of Slate, Third Letheras Tide-the Wars of Conquest\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ruins of a low wall encircled the glade, the | battered rough-cut basalt dividing swaths of green grasses. Just beyond rose a thin copse of young birch and aspen, spring leaves bright and fluttering. Behind this stand the forest thickened, darkened, grey-skinned boles of pine crowding out all else. Whatever the wall had enclosed had vanished beneath the soft loam of the glade, although depressions were visible here and there to mark out cellar pits and the like. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-113.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
