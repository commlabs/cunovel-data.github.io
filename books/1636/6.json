There was also a camera mounted in the corner of the ceiling. Kurt felt the familiar subsonic thrum around him, and he relaxed. He was on a spaceship. Although he preferred boot-on-dirt, anywhere was better than hard vacuum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered the bed\u0027s railing, and swung his legs over the edge. Pain lanced up his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCracked ribs—he\u0027d had them many times. Bruises covered his pale skin; they were especially livid on his shoulders, stomach, and waist. He checked in the mirror for injuries, and then ran his hand over the long black stubble on his head and face. He was intact… but how long had he been unconscious?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall slid apart and a balding man entered. Curiously he wore an Army uniform, pinned with the eagle insigne of a colonel. His dark eyes fixed upon Kurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir!\" Kurt started to stand and salute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At ease, soldier,\" the Colonel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt checked his motion. He opened his mouth to correct the Colonel\u0027s error, but fell silent. Naval NCOs were never called \"soldiers,\" but in Kurt\u0027s experience, officers. Army or otherwise, never appreciated correction unless lives were at stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Colonel\u0027s continued stare made Kurt uneasy. In fact, several things contributed to his unease. He was on a UNSC ship, receiving medical care, but how had he gotten here, and why was an Army colonel interested in him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am James Ackerson,\" the Colonel said. He then did a curious thing: he held out his hand to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a rare occurrence. Usually no one wanted to touch a Spartan, let alone shake their hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt took Ackerson\u0027s hand and gingerly squeezed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAckerson. Kurt knew that name. There had been conversations between Dr. Halsey and Chief Mendez. Ackerson had come up a dozen times, and from their inflection and body language Kurt had surmised he was not their friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt was aware that everyone in the UNSC had the same basic goal: protecting humanity from all threats. Not everyone, however, agreed on how that mandate should be executed… which led to internal conflict. Kurt understood this the way he understood basic precepts of a Shaw-Fujikawa translight engine. He grasped the underlying theoretical principles, but the nuances and the actual application of that knowledge remained a mystery to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost likely this colonel was on permanent loan to ONI as a liaison officer. They often recruited civilians, officers from other branches of the military, or anyone they needed to get their job done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Army colonel was approximately the same rank as a Navy captain, so while Kurt was wary, he had to be polite, and even take orders from Ackerson as long as they did not conflict with previous orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you are well enough, get dressed.\" Colonel Ackerson nodded to the night table on which was a neatly folded uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt stood, removed the osmotic IV patch, and dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"SPARTAN-051, what is your name?\" Ackerson asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kurt, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but Kurt what? What is your family name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt knew he had had another name, before his training. That, however, was part of a life that seemed more dream than real now. And that other name was just a shadow in his mind, as was the family that had gone along with it. Still, he struggled to remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Ackerson said. \"For the time being if asked, use the last name…\" He considered for a moment. \"Ambrose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt buttoned his shirt. The uniform was missing the Spartan patch of an eagle holding a lighting bolt and arrows. It instead had the clasping-hand patch of the UNSC Logistical core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt bore the single pip of a private first class and two combat ribbons for Harvest and Operation TREBUCHET.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow me.\" Ackerson moved out the open doors into a narrow corridor. He led Kurt through three intersections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany Naval officers passed them, but none saluted. They kept to themselves for the most part, eyes down. And while a few nodded to Kurt, no one so much as even glanced at Ackerson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt\u0027s unease at this odd situation grew palpable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey halted at a pressure door guarded by two marines who saluted. Kurt crisply returned their salute. Ackerson gave them a causal half-salute gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Colonel set his hand on a biometric reader and face, retina, and palm were simultaneously scanned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a hiss, the door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt and Ackerson stepped into a dimly lit twenty-meter-wide room filled wall to wall with monitors. Spectroscopic signatures, star charts, and Slipstream space pulses strobed across the screens. There were several officers and two holographic Als consulting with them in whispered tones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne AI was a gray-robbed figure without a body. A wraith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other was a collection of disembodied eyes, mouths, and gesturing hands—what Kurt vaguely recalled from one of Deja\u0027s art lessons as an example of cubist art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAckerson whisked him across the room and to another door. A second biometric scan and they entered an elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was downward motion, then a moment of zero-gee free fall, and the sensation of gravity then returned. The doors opened to a catwalk that extended over inky darkness to a blank wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Colonel approached the blank wall, a seam appeared, and then the two sections pulled apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This room is called \u0027Odin\u0027s Eye\u0027 by the junior staff,\" Ackerson said. \"You have been temporarily granted a code-word top-secret clearance to enter. Whatever is said inside is similarly classified and you will reveal none of our conversation unless the proper code words are provided. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" Kurt replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt\u0027s instinct, however, was to not enter this room. He, in fact, wanted to be anyplace but in that room. But he couldn\u0027t refuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors closed behind them; Kurt didn\u0027t see the seam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room had white concave walls, and Kurt\u0027s eyes had a hard time focusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your classification code word is Talcon Forty,\u0027\" Ackerson said. \"Now, speak freely in here. I certainly will.\" He gestured to a black circular table in the center of the room and they both sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, where am I? Why am I here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words seemed to evaporate as he spoke them, deadened by the too-still air in this strange room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Ackerson murmured. \"Your recovery is not complete. I had been warned of that.\" He sighed. \"We have gone to considerable trouble to extricate you from normal NavSpecWep operations… from your recon mission to Station Delphi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt remembered the explosion on his T-PACK; he blinked and saw for a split second the dizzying blur of stars in his faceplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My team,\" Kurt said, \"are they—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Ackerson replied. \"No injuries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt inhaled, feeling his cracked rib. Not quite no injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething changed in the Colonel\u0027s expression. The dark stare and hardness softened almost an imperceptible fraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a lowered voice, Ackerson said, \"Section Three has issued you new orders.\" He pushed a reader across the table to Kurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt thumbed the biometric and the screen warmed. There were code-word classified warnings and then he saw his transfer orders under Colonel Ackerson. The usual fields for assignment location, routing protocols, and record verification were redacted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are now a part of a subsection of Beta-5 Division,\" Ackerson said, \"a top-secret cell within Section Three. All the events at Station Delphi were staged to bring you here in the utmost secrecy for a new mission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaging the events at Delphi? Arranged by a subcell of Section Three? Something seemed wrong in a way Kurt couldn\u0027t quite put his finger on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut part of it made sense now. The partially decommissioned Shaw-Fujikawa drive at Delphi Station was the perfect lure and the ideal excuse for a malfunctioning T-PACK. The sensor echo the Circumference had picked up on the in-system jump was another prowler, the ship that had picked up Kurt\u0027s exhausted body—after he had been propelled on a not-so-random explosive trajectory. Though he resented the manner in which they obtained him, he had to admire the sheer elegance of the extraction plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have been classified as missing in action,\" Ackerson said. \"Presumed dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething cold contracted in Kurt\u0027s stomach. He checked his emotions, though, sensing that in this instance, they might not have been able to help him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this new mission, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAckerson stared at him a moment, then seemed to look through Kurt, past him. \"I want you to train the next generation of Spartans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt blinked, taking in what Ackerson had just said, not quite understanding. \"Sir, I was under the impression that Chief Petty Officer Mendez had been reassigned years ago to carry out that mission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The effort to train additional SPARTAN-IIs was postponed indefinitely by Dr. Catherine Halsey,\" Ackerson said. \"There were other candidates within the gene pool, but they were out of synch with her age restriction protocols. And with the continuing war, her program funds were… diverted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt had always presumed other Spartans were being trained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat he and his fellows were the first in what would be a long line of Spartans. He\u0027d never considered they might be the first, and the last, of their kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAckerson said, \"Mendez will, of course, join you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be an honor to serve under Chief Mendez,\" Kurt replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Ackerson\u0027s brows quirked up. \"Indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motioned at Kurt\u0027s secure tablet. \"Read. New training protocols have been outlined as well as an improved augmentation regime. We\u0027ve learned much from the unfortunate medical processes Dr Halsey had at her disposal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt balled his hands into fists, remembering the pain of the bone grafts—like glass breaking inside his marrow, and the fire that had burned along every nerve as they had been reengi-neered for enhanced speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he read he started to grasp the opportunities and challenges of this new program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new bioaugmentations were a quantum leap ahead of those he had received. There were lower projected wash-out rates. There was, however, only a fraction of the original SPARTAN program training time and budget. MJOLNIR armor was to be replaced with something called Semi-Powered Infiltration (SPI) armor systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With these new candidates,\" Kurt said, \"you\u0027re trying to do more with less.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAckerson nodded. \"They\u0027ll be sent on missions with higher strategic values but correspondingly lower survival probabilities. That\u0027s where you come in, Kurt. We need your training as a Spartan, and all your field experience passed along to these candidates. You need to make these Spartans better and train them faster. This program may be the key to our survival in this war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt scanned the reader again. The new genetic selection protocol expanded the pool of candidates, but there were disturbing references to behavior problems in these less-than- ideal potential Spartans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this mission was vital to the war, Kurt sensed that. And there would be CPO Mendez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be good to be working under his old teacher again. Could the two of them really train a new generation of Spartans?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In ten years,\" Ackerson said, \"with your guidance and a little luck, there will be a hundred new Spartans in the war. Employing several of these new Spartans to help train the next classes, there will be thousands within twenty years. With projected improvements in technology, perhaps a hundred thousand new Spartans will be created in thirty years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hundred thousand Spartans fighting for humanity? The image swam in Kurt\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that possible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Kurt didn\u0027t understand all the ramifications, he now understood the importance of the end result. His initial feeling of unease, however, remained. How many of these new Spartans were going to die? He steeled himself. He\u0027d do everything he could to see they had the best training, the best equipment, be the best soldiers humanity had ever produced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven then, though, would it be enough?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath. \"Where do we begin, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAckerson said, \"New training facilities are being constructed. You will oversee the operation, and simultaneously begin the screening of candidates. I have an ample supply of willing recruits for you.\" He reached into his pocket and withdrew a tiny box, pushed it across the table to Kurt. \"One last thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt opened the box. Inside were the single silver bar insignia of a lieutenant junior grade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are yours now.\" A faint crease of a smile appeared on Ackerson\u0027s face. \"I\u0027m not going to have my right-hand man taking orders from NCO drill instructors. You\u0027re going to be in charge of the entire show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSECTION II\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSPARTAN-III\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1950 HOURS, DECEMBER 27, 2531 (MILITARY CALENDAR) \\ ZETA DORADUS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSYSTEM, PLANET ONYX, CAMP CURRAHEE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt watched the incoming Pelicans. The blocky jet-powered craft were so distant they were only specks against the setting sun. He hit the magnification on his faceplate and saw lines of fire tracing their reentry vectors. They would touch down in three minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last six months he had developed a training regime tougher than the original SPARTAN program. He had created obstacle courses, firing ranges, classrooms, mess halls, and dormitories from what had been jungle and scrub plain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had received every piece of equipment he had requested from NavSpecWep Section Three. Guns, ammunition, dropships, tanks—even samples of Covenant technology and weaponry had appeared as if by sleight of hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll personnel were accounted for: six dozen handpicked drill instructors, physical therapists, doctors, nurses, psychologists, and the all-important cooks… all here except the most critical person, who was now on the incoming transports: Senior Chief Petty Officer Franklin Mendez, Mendez had, a dozen years ago, trained Kurt and every other Spartan. He would be invaluable in preparing the new breed of SPARTAN-III, but he wasn\u0027t going to be the solution to all Kurt\u0027s problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter poring over every detail of the new recruits\u0027 files, Kurt discovered they didn\u0027t match the perfect psychological and genetic markers set in Dr. Halsey\u0027s original selection protocols. Colonel Ackerson had warned him they had to draw from a \"less statistically robust\" group. These recruits wouldn\u0027t be anything like himself, John, Kelly, or any of the original SPARTAN-II candidates. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-6.html","bookId":1636,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM"}
