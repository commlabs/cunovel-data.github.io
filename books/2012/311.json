The father, the mother, and the baby. Would this be their final home, then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Khundryl child came up to Saddic, pressing into his hands yet another toy – a bone top or whistle, she couldn’t quite see it before Saddic slipped it into his sack and smiled his thanks. A new sack, too big to carry now. The Khundryl children had been bringing him toys all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe times she’d watched that procession, she’d wanted to cry. She’d wanted Saddic to cry. But she didn’t understand why she wanted that – they were being kind, after all. And she didn’t know why she saw those Khundryl children as if they were but servants to something greater, something almost too big for words. Not at the instigation of adults, not even mothers and fathers. Not at the behest of pity, either. Didn’t they want their toys? She had seen such precious things settle into Saddic’s hand, had seen bright shining eyes lift shyly to Saddic in the moment of giving, and then fall away again – children running off, too light-footed, flinging themselves into their friends’ arms, and this went on and on and Badalle didn’t understand, but how her heart ached. How she wanted Saddic to weep, how she wanted to feel her own tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke a poem under her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Snakes do not know how to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey know too much\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand yearn for darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey know too much\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand fear the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one gives gifts to snakes,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand no one makes of them a gift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are neither given\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enor received.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet in all the world,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esnakes do not know how to cry.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaddic studied her and she knew that he had heard. Of course it was for him, this poem, though she suspected that he did not know that. But the man who will find him will. Maybe he’ll cry, when we cannot. Maybe he will tell this tale in such a way as to make his listeners cry, because we cannot .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Khundryl elder came up then and helped Saddic load his bag of toys on to a wagon. When the boy glanced over at Badalle, she nodded. He climbed up to settle himself beside his treasure. And there, he believed, he would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it is not to be. How will he survive? I wish I knew the answer to that, because a secret hides inside it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe birth-tent’s flap was swept aside then, and the father emerged. His eyes were raw with weeping, yet there was a fire in them. He is proud. He is defiant in his pride, and would challenge us all. I like this look. It is how a father should look . Then behind him, out she came, unsteady on her feet, sagging with exhaustion, and in her arms a small bundled form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBadalle gasped upon seeing Rutt walking towards them – where had he come from? Where had he been hiding?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his crooked arms, with a terrible need in his ancient face, he walked to stand before the mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnguish gripped Badalle’s heart and she staggered in sudden weakness. Where is Held? Held is gone. Held was gone long ago. And what Rutt carried in his arms was us, all that way. He carried us .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mother looked across at this boy, and Badalle saw now that she was old – and so too was the father, old enough to be grandparents – she looked at Rutt, his empty arms, the ravaged face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe does not understand. How can she? He cannot hurt anyone, not Rutt. He carried our hope, but our hope died. But it wasn’t his fault, it wasn’t his fault. Mother, if you had been there – if you had seen —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she stepped forward then, that old woman, that mother with her last ever child, this stranger, and gently laid her baby into Rutt’s waiting arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gift beyond measure, and when she settled an arm about his shoulders, drawing him forward, so that he could walk with them – her and her husband – and they set out, slowly as it was all she could manage, in the wake of the nearest wagon, and all the Khundryl began to move … Badalle stood unmoving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaddic, I will tell you to remember this. These are the Khundryl, the givers of gifts. Remember them, won’t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Rutt walked like a king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom where he sat, Saddic watched as they made space on a Khundryl wagon for the mother, and for Rutt and her child that he held, and then set out to catch up with the rest of the army. The man who was the father took the lead yoke at the wagon’s head, and strained as if he alone could shoulder this burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it was no burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Saddic well knew, gifts never are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, the desert stretched on. Fiddler could see no end to it, and now believed he never would. He remembered that ancient shoreline of bones, the one they had left behind what seemed a century ago. No clearer warning could have been granted them, yet she had not hesitated. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-311.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
