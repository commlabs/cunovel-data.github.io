Even if it wasn’t something that increased his cultivation, it might be some other form of strength. He had felt that he had a slight chance to pass the seventh level, but now that hope had evaporated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe had to pass the seventh floor in a single go!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYan Mo had already vanished after speaking. Lin Ming didn’t waste any time. He immediately sat down with legs crossed, pulled out a true essence stone, and began to revolve the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis time, his recovery time was much longer. Before he attempted the sixth floor, he had to restore his strength to its peak condition and adjust his mental state to its maximum. In the last 19,000 years, there hadn’t been a single person that came to the Sorcerer Pagoda who was able to pass the sixth level.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e……………….\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOutside of the Sorcerer Pagoda, Na Yi had already been waiting a very long time.

But, according to the entries before and after he entered, and the descriptions of the surrounding environment and when he had lunch and dinner, Na Yi was able to roughly estimate that he had stayed within the Divine Kingdom for one or two hours.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut Lin Ming had been inside for at least four or five hours!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat caused Na Yi to feel the most anxious, was that Na Yanda had recorded that of those who entered the Divine Kingdom, if their strength was insufficient or they were incompetent, then they could die!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNa Yi instantly clutched her chest as she felt her heart tighten. There were several times that she had wanted to enter the Sorcerer Pagoda to investigate, but she had refrained from doing so. After all, everyone only had one chance to enter the Sorcerer Pagoda, and now was not the best time for her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd most importantly, it was simply useless even if she did enter the Sorcerer Pagoda.

After an evening of sleeping on the rough stone floor, her back was sore. Luckily for her, she was a martial artist. If she was just a normal little girl that had slept on such a floor for the evening, her back would already be bruised black and blue.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I’m not sure.

Surrounding the temple were 9 columns shaped like coiling dragons, each one over 1000 feet high, reaching the sky.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming stood in a vast square in front of this building. Around him, celestial mountains were suspending in the air, and towering waterfalls tens of thousands of feet high poured down the celestial mountainsides in raging torrents, turning into countless silver beads before they fell into the bottomless void.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn front of Lin Ming, there was a middle-aged man wearing blue clothes and carrying a longsword strapped to his back, facing away from Lin Ming. His hair was tied in a tight knot, half black, half white, and more than two feet long.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming looked at this man’s cultivation, and his heart chilled.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe was actually a Houtian master!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe was only an early Houtian master. However, there was an essential qualitative change between a Pulse Condensation Period martial artist and a Houtian master.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming felt bitterness swelling in his heart. His bone age was less than 16 years old, and yet he had to face a Houtian master on the sixth floor!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf one searched the entire Sky Spill Continent, would one be able to find a 15 year old boy that had the strength of a Houtian realm master?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe middle-aged man silently turned around. His face seemed hazy, as if there was light and shadow within. Without a doubt, this was the enemy that Lin Ming had to defeat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis was also the first time that Lin Ming would be facing a Houtian realm master.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe difference between the peak Bone Forging stage and the early Houtian realm was a stage and a half. That may not have sounded like much, but in the martial arts path, the disparity between each realm of cultivation only increased.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFrom Bone Forging to Pulse Condensation, the meridians of one’s body would be opened and connected, and true essence would be able to flow through freely and unimpeded, This was already a major leap. From Pulse Condensation to Houtian, true essence would gather within the Dantian and augment the entire body’s meridians endlessly. This was also a major leap.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming was not sure that he could bridge these two massive qualitative leaps in cultivation and deal with a Houtian realm master.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Take out your spear.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming was surprised. Not only did the middle-aged man speak, but he also used the language of the Realm of the Gods.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming gripped his spear in his right hand. His elbow was pressed against the shaft, and the base rested against body. He pointed this nearly 10 foot long spear at the middle-aged man and challenged him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe middle-aged man drew his longsword and slowly said, “You… are doomed to lose to me.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCha—\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs the sword point left the scabbard, there was only a clarion ring that sounded out as the air was split apart by the sword. The middle-aged man wielded his sword and pierced towards Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe middle-aged man’s speed was simply absurdly extreme as it neared the limit.

Since he could not see through the middle-aged man’s sword path, Lin Ming would use his strength to break his move, and use a massive amount of vibrating true essence to block the sword.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePeng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe sword wind dispersed. However, Lin Ming’s 5000 vibrating true essence filaments were mostly destroyed in return.

Lin Ming began to revolve the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’, and the heaven and earth origin energy around him continuously poured into his body, rapidly restoring the true essence that he had used. Lin Ming’s cultivation was now only at the peak of Bone Forging, but his stamina and endurance far surpassed that of a normal Pulse Condensation Period martial artist.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Mm?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat light shadow martial artist showed a hint of curiosity and sent an astonished look towards Lin Ming who was able to fend off his sword.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe light shadow martial artist flicked his wrist and the sword pierced forwards exactly like before. However, this time there was a layer of red light that covered the blade.

Flames like flickering red lotuses blossomed on the coldly shining tip of the Heavy Profound Soft Spear. The flames moved and twisted together with the 5,000 vibrating true essence filaments, charging towards the light shadow martial artist’s sword as if they were a legion of fiery dragons.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBang!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere was no flashy or fancy move as the spear and sword simply struck against each other. A blast of true essence exploded like a shock-wave as it scattered in all directions. Although Lin Ming was able to fend against the light shadow martial artist’s sword, he wasn’t able to stop the shockwaves. The raging true essence was similar to hidden weapons that broke into Lin Ming’s body. It was like several dozen knives had been stabbed into Lin Ming’s organs; the pain was terrible!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAlthough Lin Ming felt as if the blood within his organs was roiling, after examining himself, he found that there wasn’t a serious injury.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Mm?
