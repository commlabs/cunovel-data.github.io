A shocking energy rose up, causing everything to shake. A windstorm sprang into being, which promptly slammed into the Demonic cultivator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Demonic cultivator\u0027s face flickered, and blood sprayed out of his mouth in a continuous stream as he tumbled backward like a kite with its string cut. He fell back several hundred meters before finally coming to a stop, his face pale, his body trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBei Yu sat on her ship, which currently hovered in midair. All of a sudden, her face flickered, and she spoke four words, one at a time. “Demon Mantra: Mesmeric Rebuke!!” [1. The name of this magic is actually also a chengyu, a Chinese idiom. The definition of the idiom itself is: to mislead the public with rumors, to delude the people with lies. In this case I’m pretty sure Er Gen just copied it because it has the word “demon” in it. The literal character-by-character translation would be “demon word delude crowd”]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Demonic cultivators’ minds trembled, and expressions of disbelief appeared on their faces as they looked over at the waterfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Fan Dong’er appeared to be shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao\u0027s eyes narrowed. The voice which had spoken just now used only one phrase to unleash unthinkable power. That one phrase was like a magical technique, a divine ability that could... shake the mind. Not only did it leave the Demonic cultivator’s body trembling, it also was a powerful attack on his very thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was familiar with the four words that Bei Yu had uttered. He knew that it was one of the three most powerful Daoist magics of the Nine Seas God World’s Demonic Cultivator Horde!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demon Mantra: Mesmeric Rebuke can turn one’s own divine sense into an attack on the self....” he thought. “It is impossible to defend against, and the stronger one’s divine sense, the more terrifying the results!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery few Demonic cultivators were able to successfully learn it. In the current generation, only Bei Yu and Long Tianhai had ever studied it, as well as the other eight Sea Realm Demons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the way it had been used, Meng Hao, along with Fan Dong’er and Bei Yu, could all tell that whoever was inside the waterfall hadn’t attacked with killing intent, but rather, was issuing a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Demonic cultivator hovered in midair, his face pale white, looking at the waterfall with terror. Finally he clasped hands and bowed deeply, then hurried back to his ship. The white fox hadn\u0027t moved the entire time, nor had it even looked up. It simply continued to practice breathing techniques with the white jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered, but he continued to stand there silently. Bei Yu hesitated for a moment, then moved forward toward the waterfall. Feeling she had no other choice, she clasped hands and bowed, then said, “I am Sea Daughter Bei Yu of the Junior generation, from the Nine Seas God World. Senior, what relationship do you have with our Demonic Cultivator Horde?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemon Mantra: Mesmeric Rebuke was an esoteric magic of the Demonic Cultivator Horde, something that no outsider would ever have access to. And yet, they had all seen it unleashed right here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no response from the waterfall, and eventually, the white fox opened its mouth and swallowed the white jade. Then, it turned, disappearing into the waterfall in a flash of white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBei Yu hesitated for a moment, and finally decided not to risk going into the waterfall. Just now, the power of a single word had revealed that the cultivation base of whoever was inside... was terrifyingly powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter clasping hands respectfully one more time, Bei Yu headed back to her ship. It was in that moment that Meng Hao blinked his right eye nine times in quick succession. Rumbling filled his mind as his view of the world suddenly changed completely. His vision was suddenly empowered to pierce through the waterfall where, shockingly, he saw an Immortal’s cave, and a middle-aged man sitting there cross-legged. Located next to the man was a tomb!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if the man had always been there, and always would be, sitting there accompanying the tomb!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Meng Hao laid eyes on him, the man in the Immortal’s cave suddenly turned to look at him. As their gazes met, an expression of shock could be seen in his eyes, and he waved his sleeve, terminating Meng Hao’s vision. Pain filled his mind, and his face reddened, but he quickly recovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the vision having ended, he could still clearly picture the man’s appearance, and remembered that the man had a white scale on his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was a Demonic cultivator!” he thought. After a moment, he proceeded forward. Jian Daozi hesitated for a moment, then followed. Soon, everyone else on the ships followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter proceeding onward for a bit, Meng Hao’s hand suddenly shot out to grab Jian Daozi. Jian Daozi considered dodging, but hesitated, and Meng Hao’s hand latched onto his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grand Immortal....” he said, sounding alarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao\u0027s face was calm as his hand clenched down onto Jian Daozi’s arm. Cracking sounds could be heard as he then cleanly ripped off one of Jian Daozi’s fingers. The pain caused Jian Daozi to shake, but he didn\u0027t dare to show any anger, only fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That Demonic cultivator just now was one of the knives you had prepared to stick into our backs, right?” Meng Hao said coolly. Then he released Jian Daozi’s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bitter look appeared on Jian Daozi\u0027s face, as if he wanted to explain what had happened, but couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can continue to pretend as much as you want, but remember... don’t provoke me!” Meng Hao said one word at a time, staring Jian Daozi in the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ripping off your finger was just a warning. If you dare to provoke me again... I don’t care who you have hidden here in the Windswept Realm, nor how many knives you\u0027ve prepared... you will regret it.” At this point, Meng Hao gave a slight smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Jian Daozi, however, that smile was filled with something utterly terrifying, as if the person in front of him were a fiendish monster, someone he didn\u0027t dare to ever provoke. If he did, then... he had no idea what the consequences might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t encounter anything unusual during the rest of their journey. Nor did Jian Daozi speak any further with Meng Hao. As they traveled along, Meng Hao continued to take in the sights, his expression tranquil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the other cultivators from the Mountain and Sea Realm, they proceeded along quietly. After what had happened to the middle aged Demonic cultivator, their aggressive attitudes seemed to have been reined in, and they didn\u0027t impulsively try to grab any of the desirable things they saw along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Nation was not very large. After flying for about half a day, Bei Yu veered off toward the Immortal’s cave she had selected. One by one, the other Demonic cultivators also left, and eventually Fan Dong’er and her young cultivator companion departed. Soon, a city appeared up ahead of Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a city of mortals, and was also the capital city of the Ninth Nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the capital city, a mountain was just barely visible. The top half was capped in snow, and the bottom half was emerald green. Beneath the mountain was a lake, which was fed by a river that stretched off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lake was as smooth as a mirror, without the slightest wave or ripple, revealing a perfect reflection of the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJian Daozi continued to accompany Meng Hao as he flew past the city and across the lake. Soon, he was directly in front of Mount Whiteseal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they neared, a frigid wind blew down from the mountain. It was currently summer, and the heat was oppressive, so the cold wind was incredibly refreshing. It was the kind of feeling that would cause people to instantly take a liking to this mountain that was half-covered in snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeling was reinforced by the white snow on the top half of the mountain, which formed a striking contrast with the emerald green bottom half. The thing that moved Meng Hao the most, though, was that as they neared, he could clearly sense the natural law and World Essence... growing stronger and more defined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if this mountain were the nucleus of the entire Ninth Nation, as if it was the source of all the natural law and Essence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the mountain caused Meng Hao to feel a sensation similar to that which he had experienced from the Towers of Tang on Planet South Heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the type of feeling that came from an object that had been the subject of worship for countless tens of thousands of years. It was an intangible energy, similar to that which came from burning incense. After congealing to a certain extent, it became the National Aura of the Ninth Nation, and eventually transformed... into a type of qi flow!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe qi flow of the Windswept Realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was becoming increasingly moved. His eyes gradually grew wider as he gazed up at the highest peaks of the mountain, from which he sensed some type of summoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensation slowly grew more and more intense, causing Meng Hao’s heart to begin to pound. His blood began to surge through his veins, and soon he couldn’t control the urge to head to the peak of the mountain and see what it was that was calling him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when he was about to step forward, he stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Interesting. For some reason, I have the feeling that the purpose of the summons is to try to entice me to fly directly to the peak of the mountain....” After a moment of thought, he didn\u0027t do so, but rather, began to ascend the stone stairs which began at the very foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, Jian Daozi and the other old men noticed what he was doing, and exchanged shocked looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMount Whiteseal was the most sacred location in all of the Ninth Nation, a Holy Mountain that many Immortals had visited in the past. Virtually all of them had chosen chose to fly directly to the top, whereas Meng Hao chose to walk up slowly from the bottom. It was extremely rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, ascending the mountain from the very bottom would impart an even more profound sensation regarding the natural laws and Essences that were focused on this nucleus of the Ninth Nation, as well as the National Aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao began to walk up the steps, taking his time. Sometimes he even stopped to relish the sensation of the natural laws on the mountain, and the omnipresent Essences. Furthermore, he was also able to sense... the so-called National Aura which had built up on the mountain because of the years of worship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point, he stretched his right hand out into the air and made a grasping motion. “Is this... the Essence of wind?” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he didn\u0027t know it, somewhere out in the Ninth Nation, a gale-force wind sprang up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Essence of water.... And this is fire.... They’re all incomplete....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime passed as he strolled his way upward. Soon it was night, and eventually the rising sun could be seen once again. Then it was noontime. It was at this point that he passed out of the emerald green portion of the mountain and entered the snow white area. Step by step, he went onward. He immersed himself in contemplation of the mountain, in enlightenment. He forgot about walking, forgot about even moving forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t aware of it, but as he proceeded along up the mountain, all of the lands of the Ninth Nation were shaking. Wind blew and rain fell. Lights flashed in the sky, and Spirit Springs erupted. Mountains vanished and then reappeared, and rivers changed course. The entire world was altered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the changes occurred due to Meng Hao walking up the mountain and contemplating the world\u0027s natural laws. As he gained enlightenment of the Essences of Heaven and Earth, he made acquisitions which manifested as transformations in the Ninth Nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the foot of the mountain, Jian Daozi and the others had long since begun to stare with wide eyes and slack jaws. Even more so than the other old men, Jian Daozi’s eyes were now filled with profound anxiety. And what he was anxious about was clearly not Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, Meng Hao wasn’t even aware of the fact that he had already reached the peak of the mountain!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1091\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1093\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1092","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
