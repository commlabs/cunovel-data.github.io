The brothers filled the pews before him, chanting words that dated back to the Beginning. Claridon was in the archives, poring through documents. He\u0027d instructed the archivist to allow the impish fool access to whatever he requested--but also to keep a close watch over him. The report from Givors was that Cassiopeia Vitt\u0027s chateau seemed down for the night. One brother watched the front, another the rear. So while little else could be done, he decided to tend to his duties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new soul was about to be welcomed into the Order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven hundred years ago, any initiate would have been of legitimate birth, free of debt, and physically fit to wage war. Most were celibates, but married men had been allowed honorary status. Criminals were not a problem, nor were excommunicates. Both were allowed redemption. Every master\u0027s duty had been to ensure that the brotherhood grew. Rule made clear, If any secular knight, or other man, wishes to leave the mass of perdition and abandon this century, do not deny him entry. But it was St. Paul\u0027s words that had formed the modern standard for induction. Approve the spirit if it comes from God. And the candidate kneeling before him represented his first attempt to implement that dictate. It disgusted him that such a glorious ceremony was forced to take place in the dead of night behind locked gates. But such was the way of the Order. His legacy--what he wanted noted in the Chronicles long after his death--would be a return to the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chanting stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood from the oak chair that had served since the Beginning as the master\u0027s perch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good brother,\" he said to the candidate, who knelt before him, hands on a Bible. \"You ask a great thing. Of our Order, you see only the facade. We live in this resplendent abbey, we eat and drink well. We have clothes, medicine, education, and spiritual fulfillment. But we live under harsh commandments. It is hard to make yourself the serf to another. If you wish to sleep, you may be awakened. If you are wakeful, you may be ordered to lie down. You may not want to go where directed, but you must. You will hardly do anything that you wish. Can you suffer well these hardships?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man, probably in his late twenties, his hair already cropped short, his pale face clean-shaven, looked up and said, \"I will suffer all that is pleasing to God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that the candidate was typical. He\u0027d been found at university several years ago, and one of the Order\u0027s precepts had monitored the man\u0027s progress while learning the family tree and personal history. The fewer attachments, the better, and thankfully the world abounded with drifting souls. Eventually, direct contact was made and, being receptive, the initiate was slowly schooled in Rule and asked the questions candidates had been asked for centuries. Was he married? Engaged? Had he ever made a vow or pledge to another religious society? Any debts he could not pay? Any hidden illnesses? Was he beholden to a man or woman for any reason?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good brother,\" he said to the candidate, \"in our company, you must not seek riches, nor honor, nor bodily ease. Instead, you must seek three things. First, renounce and reject the sins of this world. Second, do the service of our Lord. And third, be poor and penitent. Will you promise to God and our Lady that all the days of your life you will obey the master of this Temple? That you will live in chastity, without personal property? That you will uphold the customs of this house? That you will never leave this Order, neither through strength nor weakness, in worse times nor better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose words had been used since the Beginning, and de Roquefort recalled when they\u0027d been uttered to him, thirty years ago. He still felt the flame that had been ignited within him--a fire that now burned with a raging intensity. To be a Templar was important. It meant something. And he was determined to ensure every candidate who donned the robe during his tenure understood that devotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe faced the kneeling man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you say, brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"De par dieu.\" For God\u0027s sake, I will do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you understand that your life may be required?\" And after what had happened the past few days, this inquiry seemed even more important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Without question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why would you offer your life for us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because my master ordered it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe correct answer. \"And you would do so without challenge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To challenge would be to violate Rule. My task is to obey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motioned to the draper, who produced from a wooden chest a long twill cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand,\" he said to the candidate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man came to his feet, dressed in a black wool robe that covered his thin frame from shoulder to bare feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remove your garment,\" he said, and the robe was lifted over his head. Beneath, the candidate was dressed in a white shirt and black trousers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe draper approached with the cloth and stood off to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have removed the shroud of the material world,\" de Roquefort made clear. \"Now we embrace you with the cloth of our membership and we celebrate your rebirth as a brother in our Order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motioned and the draper came forward and wrapped the cloth around the candidate. De Roquefort had seen many a grown man cry at this moment. He himself had fought to suppress his own emotions when the same cloth had been wrapped around him. No one knew how old this particular shroud was, but one had reverently remained in the initiation chest since the Beginning. He well knew the tale of one of the early cloths. Used to wrap Jacques de Molay after the master had been nailed to a door in the Paris Temple. De Molay had lain within the linen for two days, unable to move from his wounds, too weak to even rise. While he had, bacteria and chemicals from his body had stained the fibers and generated an image that fifty years later began to be venerated by gullible Christians as the body of Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d always thought that fitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe master of the Knights Templar--the head of a supposed heretical order--became the mold from which all subsequent artists fashioned Christ\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared out at the assembly. \"You see before you our newest brother. He wears the shroud that symbolizes rebirth. It\u0027s a moment we\u0027ve all experienced, one that joins us to each other. When chosen as your master I promised a new day, a new Order, a new direction. I told you that no longer would the few know more than the many. I told you that I would find our Great Devise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In our archives, at this moment, is a man who possesses knowledge we need. Unfortunately, while our former master did nothing, others, not of this Order, have been searching. I have personally followed their efforts, watched and studied their movements, waiting for a time when we would join that search.\" He paused. \"That time has come. I have brothers beyond the walls searching at this moment, and more of you will follow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke, he allowed his gaze to drift across the church to the chaplain. He was an Italian with a solemn countenance, the chief prelate, the Order\u0027s highest-ranking ordained cleric. The chaplain headed the priests, about a third of the brothers, men who chose a life devoted solely to Christ. The chaplain\u0027s words carried much weight, particularly given that the man spoke sparingly. Earlier, when the council had convened, the chaplain had voiced his concern about the recent deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re moving too fast,\" the chaplain declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing what the Order desires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re doing what you desire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like the previous master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On that point he was correct. And though I disagreed with him on a great many things, I obeyed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d resented the younger man\u0027s directness, especially in front of the council, but he knew that many respected the chaplain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you have me do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Preserve the brothers\u0027 lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The brothers know that they may be called upon to lay down their lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not the Middle Ages. We\u0027re not waging a crusade. These men are devoted to God and pledged their obedience to you, as proof of their devotion. You have no right to take their lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I intend to find our Great Devise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To what end? We\u0027ve endured without it for seven hundred years. It\u0027s unimportant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you say such a thing? It\u0027s our heritage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could it possibly mean today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our salvation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re already saved. The men here all possess good souls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This Order does not deserve banishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our banishment is self-imposed. We\u0027re content within it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then this is your fight, not ours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis anger had risen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t intend to be challenged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master, less than a week and you\u0027ve already forgotten from whence you came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring at the chaplain, he tried to read the features on the stiff face. He\u0027d meant what he said earlier. He was not going to be challenged. The Great Devise must be found. And the answers lay with Royce Claridon and the people inside Cassiopoia Vitt\u0027s chateau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he ignored the indifferent look from the chaplain and concentrated on the crowd seated before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brothers. Let us pray for success.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTY-TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1:00 AM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE WAS IN RENNES, STROLLING INTO THE CHURCH OF MARY Magdalene, and the same garish detail gave him the same uncomfortable feeling. The nave was empty, save for a sol itary man standing before the altar, dressed in a priestly black robe. When the man turned, the face was familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerenger Sauniere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you here?\" Sauniere asked in a shrill voice. \"This is my church. My creation. No one\u0027s but mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is it yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I took the chance. No one but me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chance of what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those who challenge the world always face risk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he noticed a gaping hole in the floor, just before the altar, and steps leading into blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s down there?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first step along the way to truth. God bless all those who guarded that truth. God bless their generosity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe church encasing him suddenly dissolved and he was surrounded by a treed plaza that spread out before the American embassy in Mexico City. People rushed by in all directions, and the sounds of horns blaring, tires squealing, and diesel engines grew loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen gunshots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing from a car that had ground to a stop. Men emerged. Firing at a middle-aged woman and a young Danish diplomat who were enjoying their lunch in the shade. Marines guarding the embassy reacted, but they were too far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for his gun and fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBodies dropped to the pavement. Cai Thorvaldsen\u0027s head exploded as bullets meant for the woman found him. He shot two of the men who\u0027d started the melange, then felt his shoulder tear as a bullet pierced through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain jarred his senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood poured from the wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stammered back, but shot his assailant. The bullet penetrated the dark face, which once again became that of Berenger Sauniere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you shoot me?\" Sauniere calmly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls of the church re-formed and the stations of the cross appeared. Malone spotted a violin lying on one of the pews. A metal plate rested on the strings. Sauniere floated over and scattered sand on the plate. Then he drew a bow across the strings and, as sharp notes rang out, the sand arranged itself into a distinct pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSauniere smiled. \"Where the plate does not vibrate, the sand stands still. Change the vibration and another pattern is created. A different one every time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe statue of the grimacing Asmodeus came to life, and the devil-like form left the holy water fount at the front door and drifted toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terrible is this place,\" the demon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are not welcome here,\" Sauniere screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why did you include me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSauniere didn\u0027t answer. Another figure emerged from the shadows. The little man in the brown monk\u0027s robe from Reading the Rules of the Caridad. His finger was still to his lips, signaling quiet, and he carried the stool upon which was written ACABOCE Ao1681.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe finger came away and the little man said, \"I am alpha and omega, the beginning and end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the little man vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman appeared, her face obscured, dressed in dark clothing with no detail. \"You know my grave,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie d\u0027Hautpoul de Blanchefort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you afraid of spiders?\" she asked. \"They\u0027ll not hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon her chest Roman numerals appeared, bright like the sun. LIXLIXL. A spider materialized beneath the symbols, the same design from Marie\u0027s tombstone. Between the tentacles were seven dots. Yet the two spaces near the head were bare. With her finger, Marie traced a line from her neck, down her chest, across the blazing letters to the image of the spider. An arrow appeared where her finger had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same two-tipped arrow from the tombstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was floating. Away from the church. Through the walls, out into the courtyard, and into the flower garden where the statue of the Virgin stood upon the Visigoth pillar. The stone was no longer a dingy gray, worn by weather and time. Instead, the words PENITENCE, PENITENCE and MISSION 1891 gleamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsmodeus reappeared. The demon said, \"By this sign you will conquer him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying before the Visigoth pillar was Cai Thorvaldsen. A patch of oily asphalt lay beneath him, crimson with blood, his limbs stretched at contorted angles, like Red Jacket from the Round Tower. His eyes were frozen open, alight with shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard a voice. Sharp, crisp, mechanical. And he saw a television with a mustached man reporting the news, talking about the death of a Mexican lawyer and a Danish diplomat, the reason for the murders unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the aftermath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven dead--nine injured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone came awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d dreamed of Cai Thorvaldsen\u0027s death before--many times, in fact--but never in relation to Rennes-le-Chateau. His mind was apparently filled with thoughts he\u0027d found difficult to avoid when he\u0027d tried, two hours ago, to fall asleep. He\u0027d finally managed to drift off, ensconced in one of the many chambers of Cassiopeia Vitt\u0027s chateau. She\u0027d assured him that their minders outside would be watched and they\u0027d be ready if de Roquefort chose to act during the night. But he agreed with her assessment. They were safe, at least until tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he\u0027d slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his mind had continued to play out the puzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the dream faded away, but he recalled the last portion--the television anchor reporting on the attack in Mexico City. He\u0027d learned later that Cai Thorvaldsen had been dating the Mexican lawyer. She was a tough, gutsy lady investigating a mysterious cartel. The local police learned there\u0027d been threats she\u0027d ignored. Police had been in the area, but curiously none of them were around when the gunmen emerged from a roadster. She and the younger Thorvaldsen had been sitting on a bench, eating their lunch. Malone had been nearby, on his way back to the embassy, in town on assignment. He\u0027d used his automatic to take down two attackers before two others realized he was there. He never saw the third and fourth men, one of whom planted a slug in his left shoulder. Before he lapsed into unconsciousness he\u0027d managed to shoot his attacker, and the final man was taken out by one of the marine guards from the embassy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not before a lot of bullets found a lot of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven dead--nine injured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up from the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d just solved the Rennes riddle. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1/page-45.html","bookId":2232,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM"}
