She had little in common these days with even her closest friends. Yes, they chatted and stayed in touch, but Mary Jo had a baby and could no longer take off at a moment’s notice to go to a movie or shop or do anything else. Her whole life, and therefore all her relationships, had changed since Noelle’s birth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a relatively short time she’d become a mother, left her family home, moved to a new town, taken a new job. Now she had one more item to add to that list. She’d become engaged and unengaged within a month. But like everything else, she’d deal with that and with Mack’s confused feelings for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right, of course; it was better to be honest, although she was still unsure exactly where their relationship stood. One thing she did feel sure about, though, was the fact that Mack would move heaven and earth to protect Noelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby stirred from her afternoon nap and Mary Jo went into her room. After changing Noelle’s diaper and feeding her, she set her in her baby seat and began doing what she always did when she felt troubled. She cleaned house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she was hanging up her clothes in the bedroom closet, the nail from a loose board caught on the toe of her sock. It wasn’t the first time she’d snagged a sock on that nail. Under other circumstances, she’d ask Mack to hammer it down for her, since he acted as the rental manager on behalf of his friend. But she couldn’t go to him just now. Besides, she was fairly competent. All she really needed was something to pound the nail. A shoe with a solid heel would work equally well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother is no dunce,” she told Noelle as she knelt on the floor and found an appropriate shoe. Once down on all fours, Mary Jo saw that more than one board was loose. Retrieving a flashlight from her drawer, she aimed it at the closet floor, ready to pound away, when an object of some kind caught her attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noelle,” she said, her voice rising. “There’s something underneath this board.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby cooed from the other side of the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Jo used her fingers to wiggle the nail out, then managed to free the second one. Once the board was loose, she lifted it up and discovered, still partially hidden, what seemed to be a wooden box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Jo worked at the remaining floorboards in the closet until she could retrieve the box. Breathless, she sat on the floor, holding it in her lap. The wooden box was old; that much was apparent. It was larger than a cigar box and light. The writing on it had faded long ago to the point that it was unreadable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shall I peek inside?” she asked Noelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby returned her look with wide-eyed wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m curious, too,” Mary Jo said. Holding her breath, she raised the lid. There were letters inside, old letters. She picked up the first envelope and turned to Noelle. Reading the postmark, she said, “These are letters written in 1943 by…” The ink on the blue airmail envelope had faded. “Major Jacob Dennison.” The letters were addressed to Miss Joan Manry, 1022 Evergreen Place, Cedar Cove, Washington.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to read it,” Mary Jo told her daughter. “I can’t imagine why Joan would hide them like this.” She carefully opened the flimsy paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spidery handwriting was difficult to read. “It’s written by Jacob—Jake—during the war,” Mary Jo said. “He’s in Europe…a pilot flying out of England, it looks like.” She bit her lip. “It’s a love letter. Oh, Noelle, he’s about to go on a bombing mission over Germany and he’s afraid he’s going to die and he wants Joan to know that if he doesn’t survive, he’ll find a way to come to her…that he’ll always love her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an hour or more, Mary Jo lost herself in the letters. Sitting on the bedroom floor beside Noelle, she read one after another, her eyes often filling with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was startled into awareness by the ringing of her doorbell, followed by a knock. That signal immediately identified her visitor as Mack. Immersed as she was in the letters, she wiped her eyes and hurriedly got to her feet, excited about sharing her discovery with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mary Jo, listen, I think I might’ve given you the wrong impression.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, it’s fine,” she said. Grabbing his arm, she pulled him inside. “I found something I need to show you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMack frowned. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was this loose board in the closet and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should’ve told me. I would have taken care of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That isn’t important, Mack. The letters are.” She couldn’t contain her excitement. “I came across a box hidden in the closet. It has the most beautiful love letters, all written during World War II.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You read them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, of course. Anyone would have…You have to read them, too! Once I started I couldn’t stop. They’re so eloquent, so moving…I want to know what happened to Jake and Joan. I want to find out if Jacob Dennison returned from the war and if they married and had children. You need to talk to your friend right away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My friend?” Mack sounded confused and, little wonder, the way she’d dragged him into the room, talking nonstop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The man who owns the duplex,” she elaborated. “They might be related to him. He’ll want these letters—they’re a treasure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMack shook his head. “That isn’t possible. My…friend, the owner, can’t be related. He only recently purchased the place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then maybe whoever he bought it from will know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can find out, if you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Jo nodded eagerly. “Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “I’ll see who might have owned the house during the war years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Mack,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the uneasiness returned. “I apologize,” Mary Jo said stiffly. “I didn’t really give you a chance to explain why you came over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMack shrugged. “No reason. I just wanted to be sure everything’s okay between us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is,” Mary Jo assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReading these letters had put everything in perspective—although she couldn’t have said exactly how that had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty-Six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay, Dad?” Megan asked, studying Troy closely. “You’re pale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy couldn’t remember being this nervous about anything in his life. “It isn’t every day a man asks a woman to be his wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s there to be nervous about?” Megan asked. As a child, she’d thought there wasn’t anything her daddy couldn’t do and she sometimes still seemed to believe it. “We both know Faith’s going to say yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy wished he shared his daughter’s confidence. He hoped and prayed Faith would accept his proposal, and yet he had doubts. On the one hand he felt optimistic, certain there’d been signs that she wanted him in her life. On the other…there’d been a few serious setbacks, and he wasn’t assuming anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, Daddy, go out there and get your woman,” Megan said, kissing his cheek. She steered him toward the front door. “You’re sure Faith is home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy hadn’t stopped to think that Faith would be anywhere else on a Friday night. They’d spoken a couple of times since the arrest, more than a week ago, but their conversations had been mostly related to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad!” Megan’s elbows jutted out as she put her hands on her hips. “You mean to say you didn’t phone ahead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, Megan stalked over to the telephone and punched in Faith’s number. She placed her hand over the receiver and looked up at him. “It’d serve you right if Faith’s gone out for the evening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat got his hackles up. “Who with?” If Faith was seeing another man, Will Jefferson, for example, he…he…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No answer, Dad,” Megan said, shaking her head. “I can’t believe you didn’t phone and say you wanted to talk to her. You aren’t even married and you’re already taking Faith for granted.” Megan sounded more amused than annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who could she be with?” Troy wondered out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How am I supposed to know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalk about taking the wind out of his sails. Troy left his daughter’s house, calling himself every name for stupid that he could remember. He should’ve phoned, instead of assuming Faith had nothing better to do on a Friday night than sit home waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was back at his place and feeling miserable when Megan phoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t ask me how I know, but Faith’s at the movies with Olivia and Grace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which movie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan told him and then with a smile in her voice, asked, “Do you have a burning desire to see Clive Owen all of a sudden?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I sure do! Bye, sweetheart, and thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good luck!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy was out the door so fast he nearly ran to his car. The theater parking lot was full and he had to circle twice before he found an empty slot. He purchased his ticket; then, wanting it to look as if their meeting was accidental, he bought popcorn and a soda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie had already started and the theater was so dark he couldn’t see anything beyond his own two feet. He slipped into the first available seat and scanned the backs of people’s heads, hoping to find Faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he squinted and leaned forward, nearly dumping his popcorn and his drink, he was unable to identify her. In fact, it wasn’t until the credits scrolled across the screen and the lights came up that he saw Faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was with Grace and Olivia, only about four rows ahead of him. If he waited for her to notice him, it might not happen, so he approached them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Faith, imagine seeing you here,” he said, hoping that sounded less contrived than he suspected it did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, imagine,” Grace said, exchanging a meaningful glance with Olivia. Or was that a smirk?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Megan phoned Jack,” Olivia said under her breath. In other words, they knew he’d been looking for Faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Troy,” Faith said, ignoring her friends. Her smile was warm. “I’m glad we ran into you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, me, too…” While Grace and Olivia might enjoy embarrassing him, Faith had gone out of her way to make him feel comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time the theater had emptied out. One of the teenagers from the concession stand started down the center aisle with a broom and dustpan, checking the rows for stray popcorn and assorted trash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we should talk outside,” Troy suggested. He could hardly take his eyes off Faith. Suddenly realizing that Olivia and Grace were waiting, obviously interested in what he had to say, he added, “I’ll drive you home, Faith.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were going to the Pancake Palace,” Grace said. “Would you care to join us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith looked at him then, and everything else receded. The question finally registered when Grace repeated his name. “Oh…sure,” he muttered absently. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/92-pacific-boulevard-cedar-cove-9/page-49.html","bookId":1951,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:11 AM"}
