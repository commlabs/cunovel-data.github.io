Mr. Coogan is my chief assistant and successor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak looked at Coogan. \"Out scavenging with the rest of the pack rats,\" he said. He turned back to Patterson. \"But perhaps there will be need of a successor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the guards moved up to stand beside the general. Pchak said, \"Since knowledge is unhappiness, even the word is distasteful when used in a laudatory manner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan suddenly sensed something electric and deadly in the room. It was evident that Patterson did, too, because he looked directly at Coogan and said, \"We are here to obey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You demonstrate an unhappy willingness to admire knowledge,\" said Pchak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard\u0027s blaster suddenly came up and chopped down against the director\u0027s head. Patterson slumped to the floor, blood welling from a gash on his scalp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan started to take a step forward, was stopped by the other guard\u0027s blaster prodding his middle. A red haze formed in front of Coogan\u0027s eyes, a feeling of vertigo swept over him. In spite of the dizziness, part of his mind went on clicking, producing information to be observed. This is standard procedure for oppressors, said his mind. Cow your victims by an immediate show of violence. Something cold, hard and calculating took over Coogan\u0027s consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Director Coogan,\" said Pchak, \"do you have any objections to what has just occurred?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan stared down at the squat brown figure. I have to stay in control of the situation, he thought. I\u0027m the only one left who\u0027ll fight this according to the Code. He said, \"Every man seeks advancement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak smiled. \"A realist. Now explain your Library.\" He strode around the desk, sat down. \"It hardly seems just for our government to maintain a pesthole such as this, but my orders are to investigate before passing judgment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour orders are to make a show of investigation before putting the Library to the torch, thought Coogan. He picked up an image control box from the desk, clipped it to his belt. Immediately, a blaster in a guard\u0027s hand prodded his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\" demanded Pchak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan swallowed. \"These are image controls,\" he said. He looked down at Patterson sprawled on the floor. \"May I summon a hospital robot for Mr. Patterson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Pchak. \"What are image controls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan took two deep breaths, looked at the side wall. \"The walls of this room are focus rhomboids for realized images,\" he said. \"They were turned off to avoid distractions during your arrival.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak settled back in the chair. \"You may proceed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard continued to hold his blaster on Coogan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving to a position opposite the wall, Coogan worked the belt controls. The wall became a window looking down an avenue of filing cases. Robots could be seen working in the middle distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terra is mostly a shell,\" said Coogan. \"The major portion of the matter was taken to construct spaceships during the great outpouring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That fable again,\" said Pchak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan stopped. Involuntarily, his eyes went to the still figure of Caldwell Patterson on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Continue,\" said Pchak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold, hard, calculating something in Coogan\u0027s mind said, You know what to do. Set him up for your Sunday punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan concentrating on the screen, said: \"The mass loss was compensated by a giant gravitronic unit in the planet center. Almost the entire subsurface of Terra is occupied by the Library. Levels are divided into overlapping squares one hundred kilometers to the side. The wealth of records stored here staggers the imagination. It\u0027s --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your imagination perhaps,\" said Pchak. \"Not mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan fought down a shiver which crawled along his spine, forced himself to continue. He said. \"It is the repository for all the reported doings of every government in the history of the galaxy. The format was set by the original institution from which this one grew. It was known as the Library of Congress. That institution had a reputation of --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congress,\" said Pchak in his deadly flat tones. \"Kindly explain that term.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what have I said? Coogan wondered. He faced Pchak, said, \"Congress was an ancient form of government. The closest modern example is the Tschi Council which --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought so!\" barked Pchak. \"That debating society! Would you explain to me, Mr. Coogan, why a recent Library broadcast extolled the virtues of this form of government?\" There\u0027s the viper, thought Coogan. He said, \"Well, nobody watches Library broadcasts anyway. What with some five thousand channels pouring out --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer my question, Mr. Coogan.\" Pchak leaned forward. An eager look came into the eyes of the guard with the blaster. Again Coogan\u0027s eyes sought out the still form of Patterson on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no control of program selection,\" said Coogan, \"except on ten special channels for answering research questions and ten other channels which scan through the new material as it is introduced into the Library.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No control,\" said Pchak. \"That\u0027s an interesting answer. Why is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan rubbed the back of his neck with his left hand, said, \"The charter for the broadcasts was granted by the first system wide government in the Twenty-first Century. A method of random program selection was devised to insure impartiality. It was considered that the information in the Library should always be freely available to all --\" His voice trailed off and he wondered if he had quoted too much of the charter. Well, they can read it in the original if they want, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fascinating,\" said Pchak. He looked at the nearest guard. \"Isn\u0027t that so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan took a slow, controlled breath, exhaled. He could feel a crisis approaching. It was like a weight on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has to be a thorough investigation,\" said Pchak. \"Let\u0027s see what you\u0027re broadcasting right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan worked the belt controls and an image realized before the righthand rhomboid. It was of a man with a hooked nose. He wore leather pants and shirt, shoes with some kind of animal face projecting from the toes, a feather crest hat on his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a regular random information broadcast,\" said Coogan. He looked at his belt. \"Channel Eighty-two.\" He turned up the volume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was talking a language of harsh consonants punctuated by sibilant hisses. Beside him on the floor was a mound of tiny round objects, each bearing a tag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is speaking the dead Procyon language,\" said Coogan. \"He\u0027s a zoologist of a system which was destroyed by corona gas thirty-four centuries ago. The things on the floor are the skulls of a native rodent, he\u0027s saying that he spent eleven years classifying more than eight thousand of those skulls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" asked Pchak. He seemed actually interested, leaned forward to look at the mound of skulls on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027ve missed that part,\" said Coogan. \"It probably was to prove some zoological theory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak settled back in his chair. \"He\u0027s dead,\" he said. \"His system no longer exists. His language is no longer spoken. Is there much of this sort of thing being broadcast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid ninety-nine per cent of the Library broadcasts -- excluding research channels -- is of this nature,\" said Coogan. \"It\u0027s the nature of the random selection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who cares what the zoologist\u0027s theory was?\" asked Pchak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps some zoologist,\" said Coogan. \"You never can tell when a piece of information will be valuable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak muttered something under his breath which sounded like, \"Pack rats!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/direct-descent/page-2.html","bookId":1571,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:50:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:50:33 PM"}
