TARBOX, where on earth have you been?\" inquired his wife, when her liege lord returned about 11.30 o\u0027clock. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ve been to the circus,\" said the farmer shortly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, why didn\u0027t you take me, Nathan? I\u0027ve always wanted to go to the circus,\" said Mrs. Tarbox in a tone of disappointment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It isn\u0027t a fit place for you,\" said her husband.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You went!\" said his wife, significantly. \"If it\u0027s a fit place for you, why isn\u0027t it for me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you think I went there for pleasure? You ought to know me better than to suppose I would visit such a demoralizing spectacle for amusement.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then why did you go?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I went to arrest that brute who kicked Bruiser to death and assaulted me. That\u0027s why I went.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 78\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did he feel bad when you arrested him?\" asked Mrs. Tarbox, with natural curiosity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; I had to defer it, for the warrant wasn\u0027t rightly made out.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dear me! Did it take all the evening?\" asked his wife.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Peace, woman! You ask too many questions,\" said Tarbox, who found it rather difficult to explain matters.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It must have been so nice to see the circus,\" murmured Mrs. Tarbox; \"but I am sure I should have been afraid of the giant.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There was a fat woman,\" growled Tarbox, \"who looked as silly as you do. I dare say she wasn\u0027t, though.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How funny you are. Nathan!\" said his wife, who wasn\u0027t at all sensitive. \"How was she dressed?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How on earth should I know? She didn\u0027t wear a coat and pantaloons.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It must take a sight of calico to make her a dress. How much does she weigh?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Two tons, more or less,\" answered Tarbox.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good gracious!\" ejaculated his simple-minded wife. \"I never heard the like. Do let me go to79 the circus, husband. I should so like to see her.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You might never come back alive. There\u0027s lions, and tigers and wild cats all around. They often break out of their cages and kill a dozen people before they can be stopped.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Tarbox turned pale and gave up her idea of going to the circus.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027d make a nice meal for a tiger. They\u0027re fond of bones,\" continued the farmer, grimly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"O, Nathan, don\u0027t say another word. I wouldn\u0027t go now if I could get in for nothing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next day, after a consultation with Squire Price and the constable, Mr. Tarbox concluded that it wouldn\u0027t be worth while to obtain a new warrant for the arrest of the giant, as he had reason to believe that Mr. Spriggins would go out of town to avoid serving it. It was hard to give up his cherished scheme of vengeance, particularly as he had already expended a dollar in vain; but there seemed no alternative.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"One thing I can do,\" he said to himself; \"if I can get hold of that boy that was with Enoch I\u0027ll give him a thrashing. He trespassed on my grounds, and I saw him laugh when the brute kicked Bruiser. I can manage him, anyway.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 80\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was no afternoon performance at the circus except on Wednesday and Saturday, and Robert and his friend Charlie Davis were at leisure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let\u0027s go on a tramp, Charlie,\" said Robert, after they had eaten dinner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m with you,\" said Charlie. \"Where shall we go?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, well, we\u0027ll go across the fields. Perhaps we\u0027ll go into the woods. Anything for fun.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two boys set out about two o\u0027clock, and after reaching the borders of the village took a path across the fields.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish nuts were ripe, Rob,\" said Charlie. \"We\u0027d have a nice time knocking them off the trees. Do you remember last fall up in Maine?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, but it\u0027s June now, and we can\u0027t have any fun of that kind. However, we can have a good time. Do you see those bars?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m going to vault over them.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All right. I\u0027ll follow.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert ran swiftly, and cleared the bars without touching them. Charlie followed, but, being a shorter boy, felt obliged to let his hand rest on the upper bar. They were accustomed to springing81 from the ring upon the backs of horses, and practice had made that easy to them which was difficult for ordinary boys.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I say, Charlie,\" said Robert, thoughtfully, as they subsided into a walk, \"what are you going to do when you are a man?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ride, I suppose.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In the circus?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think I shall.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why not?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t want to be a circus rider all my life.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should think you would. Ain\u0027t you the Boy Wonder?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shan\u0027t be the Boy Wonder when I\u0027m twenty-five years old.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can\u0027t make so much money any other way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps not; but money isn\u0027t everything I think of. I would like to get a better education and settle down to some regular business.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s more fun in circus riding,\" said Charlie, who was not as thoughtful a boy as his companion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t see much fun in it,\" said Robert. \"It82 is exciting, I know, but it\u0027s dangerous. Any day, if your nerves are not steady, you are likely to fall and break a limb, and then good-by to your riding.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s no use in thinking about that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think there is. What could we do if we had to give up riding?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, something would turn up,\" said Charlie, who was of an easy disposition. \"We might take tickets or keep the candy stand.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That wouldn\u0027t be very good employment for a man. No, Charlie, I think this will be my last season at circus riding.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What will you do?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am saving money so that, at the end of the season, I can have something to keep me while I am looking round.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t say so, Rob! How much have you saved up?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ve got about two hundred dollars saved up already.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Charlie whistled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I had no idea you were so rich,\" he said. \"Why, I haven\u0027t got five dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You might have. You are paid enough.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 83\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, it goes some way. I guess I\u0027ll begin to save, too.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish you would. Then if you want to leave the circus at the end of the season we\u0027ll go somewhere together, and look for a different kind of work. We can take a room together in Boston or New York, eat at the restaurants, and look for something.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know but I should like going to New York,\" said Charlie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By this time they had reached the edge of the woods, and were probably a mile or more from the town. There was no underbrush, but the trees rose clear and erect, and presented a cool and pleasant prospect to the boys, who had become warm with walking. So far as they knew, they were alone, but in this they were mistaken. Mr. Tarbox had some wood-land near by, and he had gone out to look at it, when, alike to his surprise and gratification, his eyes rested on the two boys, whom he at once recognized as belonging to the circus, having seen them ride the evening before. He didn\u0027t care particularly for Charlie Davis, but Robert Rudd had been with Anak when he inflicted upon him so mortifying personal chastisement,84 and he looked upon the boy as an accomplice of the man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s the very boy I wanted to see,\" said Tarbox to himself, with a cruel smile. \"I can\u0027t manage that overgrown brute, but I can manage him. I\u0027ll give the boy a lesson, and that\u0027ll be better than nothing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tarbox was naturally a tyrant and a bully, and, like most men of his character, was delighted when he could get hold of a person of inferior strength.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh ho!\" he said to himself, \"the boy can\u0027t escape me now.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Look here, boy,\" he said, in an impatient tone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert turned quickly, and saw the frowning face of Tarbox.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83297.html","bookId":277,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:32:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:32:09 AM"}
