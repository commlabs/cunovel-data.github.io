His Secretary seemed no one at all, really-merely a member of the Society of Ancients, appointed, theoretically, by the High Minister to take care of certain unspecified details, and dismissable, theoretically, at will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Minister was known to all the Earth and was looked up to as the supreme arbiter on matters of Custom. It was he who announced the exemptions to the Sixty and it was he who judged the breakers of ritual, the defiers of rationing and of production schedules, the invaders of restricted territory and so on. The Secretary, on the other hand, was known to nobody, not even by name, except to the Society of Ancients and, of course, to the High Minister himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Minister had a command of language and made frequent speeches to the people, speeches of high emotional content and copious flow of sentiment. He had fair hair, worn long, and a delicate and patrician countenance. The Secretary, snub-nosed and wry-faced, preferred a short word to a long one, a grunt to a word, and silence to a grunt-at least in public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the High Minister, of course, who had the semblance of power; the Secretary who had the reality. And in the privacy of the High Minister\u0027s office that circumstance was quite plain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the High Minister was pettishly puzzled and the Secretary coolly indifferent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I don\u0027t see,\" said the High Minister, \"is the connection of all these reports you bring me. Reports, reports!\" He lifted an arm above his head and struck viciously at an imaginary heap of paper. \"I don\u0027t have the time for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" said the Secretary coldly. \"It is why you hire me. I read them, digest them, transmit them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, good Balkis, about your business, then. And quickly, since these are minor matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minor? Your Excellency may lose a great deal someday if your judgment is not sharpened...Let us see what these reports mean, and I shall then ask you if you still consider them minor. First we have the original report, now seven days old, from Shekt\u0027s underling, and it is that which first put me on the trail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What trail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalkis\u0027s smile was faintly bitter. \"May I recall to Your Excellency certain important projects which have been nurtured here on Earth for several years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ssh!\" the High Minister, in sudden loss of dignity, could not forbear looking about hastily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Excellency, it is not nervousness but confidence that will win for us...You know further that the success of this project has depended upon the judicious use of Shekt\u0027s little toy, the Synapsifier. Until now, at least as far as we know, it has been utilized under our direction only, and for definite purposes. And now, without warning, Shekt has Synapsified an unknown man, in complete violation of our orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This,\" said the High Minister, \"is a simple matter. Discipline Shekt, take the treated man into custody, and end the matter. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. You are far too straightforward, Your Excellency. You miss the point. It is not what Shekt has done, but why he has done so. Note that there exists a coincidence about the matter, one of a considerable series of subsequent coincidences. The Procurator of Earth had visited Shekt that same day, and Shekt himself reported to us, in loyal and trustworthy fashion, all that had passed between them. Ennius had wanted the Synapsifier for Imperial use. He made promise, it seems, of great help and gracious assistance from the Emperor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" said the High Minister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are intrigued? A compromise such as that seems attractive as compared to the dangers attending our present course?...Do you remember the promises of food to us during the famine five years ago? Do you? Shipments were refused because we lacked Imperial credits, and Earth-manufactured products would not be accepted, as being radioactively contaminated. Was there a free gift of food as promised? Was there even a loan? A hundred thousand died of starvation. Don\u0027t put your trust in Outsider promises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that does not matter. What does is that Shekt made a great display of loyalty. Surely we could never doubt him again. With compounded certainty, we could not suspect him of treason that very day\" Yet so it came to pass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean in this unauthorized experiment, Balkis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, Your Excellency. Who was the man treated? We have photographs of him and, with the help of Shekt\u0027s technician, retinal patterns. A check with the Planetary Registry shows no record of him. The conclusion must therefore be reached that he is no Earthman, but an Outsider. Furthermore, Shekt must have been aware of it, since a registration card cannot be forged or transferred, if checked with retinal patterns. So, in simple fashion, the unalterable facts lead us to the conclusion that Shekt has Synapsified, knowingly, an Outsider. And why?...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The answer to that may be disturbingly simple. Shekt is not an ideal instrument for our purposes. In his youth he was an Assimilationist; he even once stood for election to the Washenn Council on a platform of conciliation with the Empire. He was defeated, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Minister interrupted. \"I didn\u0027t know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That he was defeated?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that he ran. Why wasn\u0027t I informed of this? Shekt is a very dangerous man in the position he now holds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalkis smiled softly and tolerantly. \"Shekt invented the Synapsifier and still represents the one man truly experienced in its operation. He has always been watched, and will now be watched more closely than ever. Do not forget that a traitor within our ranks, known to us, can do more harm to the enemy than a loyal man can do good to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, let us continue to deal with the facts. Shekt has Synapsified an Outsider. Why? There is only one reason why a Synapsifier can possibly be used-to improve a mind. And why that? Because only so can the minds of our scientists, already improved by Synapsification, be overtaken. Eh? This means that the Empire has at least a faint suspicion of what is going on upon Earth. Is that minor, Your Excellency?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a scattered dew on the High Minister\u0027s forehead. \"Do you really think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The facts are a jigsaw puzzle that can fit only one way. The Outsider so treated was a man of undistinguished, even contemptible, appearance. A good stroke, too, since a bald and fat old man can still be the Empire\u0027s most skilled espionage agent. Oh yes. Yes. Who else could be trusted on a mission such as this?...But we have followed this stranger, whose alias, by the way, is Schwartz, as far as we can. Let us take this second file of reports.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Minister cast an eye upon them. \"The ones concerning Bel Arvardan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Bel Arvardan,\" assented Balkis, \"eminent archaeologist of the gallant Sirian Sector, those worlds of brave and chivalrous bigots,\" He spat the last out. Then, \"Well, never mind. In any case, we have here a queer mirror image to Schwartz, an almost poetic contrast. He is not unknown, but, instead, a famous figure. He is not a secret intruder, but one who comes floating on a tidal wave of publicity. We are warned of him not by an obscure technician, but by the Procurator of Earth himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think there is a connection, Balkis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Excellency may suppose it possible that one may be designed to distract our attention from the other. Or else, since the ruling classes of the Empire are skilled enough in intrigue, we have an example of two methods of camouflage. In the case of Schwartz, the lights are put out. In the case of Arvardan, the lights are flashed in our eyes. In neither case are we intended to see anything?...Come, of what did Ennius warn us concerning Arvardan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Minister rubbed his nose thoughtfully...Arvardan, he said, was on an archaeological expedition under Imperial sponsorship and wished to enter the Forbidden Areas for scientific purposes. No sacrilege, he said, was intended, and if we could stop him in gentle fashion, he would back our action to the Imperial Council. Something like that. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So then we will watch Arvardan closely, but for what purpose? Why, to see that he makes no unauthorized entry into the Forbidden Areas. Here\u0027s the head of an archaeological expedition without men, ships, or equipment. Here\u0027s an Outsider who does not remain at Everest, where he belongs, but wanders about Earth; for some reason-and goes to Chica first. And how is our attention distracted from all these most curious and suspicious circumstances? Why, by urging us to watch carefully something that is of no importance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But notice, Your Excellency, that Schwartz was kept hidden in the Institute for Nuclear Research for six days. And then he escaped. Isn\u0027t that strange? The door, suddenly, wasn\u0027t locked. The corridor, suddenly, wasn\u0027t guarded. What queer negligence. And on what day was it that he escaped? Why, on the same day that Arvardan arrived at Chica. A second peculiar coincidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think, then...\" said the High Minister tensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think that Schwartz is the Outsider agent on Earth, that Shekt is the contact man with the Assimilationist traitors among us, and that Arvardan is the contact man with the Empire. Observe the skill with which the meeting between Schwartz and Arvardan was arranged. Schwartz is allowed to escape, and after an appropriate interval his nurse-Shekt\u0027s daughter, by a not-too-surprising additional coincidence-is out after him. If anything were to go wrong with their split-second timetable, it is obvious that she would have found him suddenly; that he would have become a poor, sick patient for the benefit of anyone\u0027s curiosity; that he would have been brought back to safety for another attempt later. In fact, two overcurious cabbies were told that he was a sick man, and that, ironically enough, backfired upon them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow it closely, now. Schwartz and Arvardan meet first in a Foodomat. They are, apparently, unaware of each other\u0027s existence. It is a preliminary meeting, designed, simply, to indicate that all has gone well so far and that the next step may be taken...At least they don\u0027t underestimate us, which is gratifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then Schwartz leaves; a few minutes later Arvardan leaves and the Shekt girl meets him. It is stop-watch timing. Together, after playing a little part for the benefit of the afore-mentioned cabbies, they head for the Dunham department store, and now all three are together. Where else but a department store? It is an ideal meeting place. It has a secrecy no cave in the mountains could duplicate. Too open to be suspected. Too crowded to be stalked. Wonderful-wonderful-I give credit to my opponent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Minister writhed in his chair. \"If our opponent deserves too much credit, he will win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible. He is already defeated. And in that respect we must give credit to the excellent Natter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who is Natter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An insignificant agent who must be used to the limit after this. His actions yesterday could not have been improved upon. His long-range assignment has been to watch Shekt. For the purpose, he keeps a fruit stand across the street from the Institute. For the last week he has been specifically instructed to watch the development of the Schwartz affair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was on hand when the man, known to him through photographs and through a glimpse at the time he was first brought to the Institute, escaped, He observed every action, himself unobserved, and it is his report that details yesterday\u0027s events. With incredible intuition, he decided that the entire purpose of the \u0027escape\u0027 was to arrange a meeting with Arvardan. He felt himself to be not in a position, single-handed, to exploit that meeting, so he decided to prevent it. The cabbies, to whom the Shekt girl had described Schwartz as being sick, speculated on Radiation Fever. Natter seized on that with the swiftness of genius. As soon as he observed the meeting in the department store, he reported the case of fever and the local authorities at Chica were, praised be Earth, intelligent enough to co-operate quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The store was emptied, and the camouflage which they counted upon to hide their conversation was stripped from them. They were alone and very conspicuous in the store. Natter went further. He approached them and talked them into allowing him to escort Schwartz back to the Institute. They agreed. What could they do?...So that the day ended without a single word passing between Arvardan and Schwartz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor did he commit the folly of arresting Schwartz. The two are still in ignorance of their detection and will yet lead us to bigger game\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Natter went further still. He notified the Imperial garrison, and that is beyond praise. It presented Arvardan with a situation he could not possibly have counted upon. He must either reveal himself to be an Outsider and destroy his usefulness, which apparently depends upon conducting himself upon Earth as though he were an Earthman, or he must keep the fact secret and subject himself to whatever unpleasantness might result. He took the more heroic alternative, and even broke the arm of an officer of the Empire, in his passion for realism. That, at least, must be remembered in his favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is significant that his actions were as they were. Why should he, an Outsider, expose himself to the neuronic whip for an Earthgirl if the matter at stake was not supremely important?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth fists of the High Minister were on the desk before him. He glowered savagely, the long, smooth lines of his face crumpled in distress. \"It is well for you, Balkis, from such meager details, to construct the spider web you do. It is skillfully done, and I feel that it is as you say. Logic leaves us no other alternative...But it means that they are too close, Balkis. They are too close...And they will have no mercy this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalkis shrugged. \"They cannot be too close, or, in a case of such potential destructiveness for all the Empire, they would have already struck...And their time is running short. Arvardan must still meet with Schwartz if anything is to be accomplished, and so I can predict for you the future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do so-do so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Schwartz must be sent away now and events allowed to quiet down from their current high pitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where will he be sent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know that too. Schwartz was brought to the Institute by a man, obviously a farmer. Descriptions reached us from both Shekt\u0027s technician and from Natter. We went through the registration data of every farmer within sixty miles of Chica, and Natter identified one Arbin Maren as the man. The technician supported that decision independently. We investigated the man quietly, and it seems that is is supporting a father-in-law, a helpless cripple. in evasion of the Sixty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Minister pounded the table. \"Such cases are entirely too frequent, Balkis. The laws must be tightened-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not now the point, Your Excellency. What is important is the fact that since the farmer is violating the customs, he can be blackmailed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shekt, and his Outsider allies, need a tool for just such a case-that is, where Schwartz must remain in seclusion for a longer period than he can safely stay hidden in the Institute. This farmer, probably helpless and innocent, is perfect\u0027 for the purpose. Well, he will be watched. Schwartz will never be out of sight...Now, eventually another meeting between him and Arvardan will have to be arranged, and that time we will be prepared. Do you understand everything now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, praise Earth. Then I will leave you now.\" And, with a sardonic smile, he added, \"With your permission, of course. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the High Minister, completely oblivious to the sarcasm, waved a hand in dismissal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary, on his way to his own small office, was alone, and, when alone, his thoughts sometimes escaped from beneath his firm control and disported themselves in the secrecy of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey concerned themselves very little with Dr. Shekt, Schwartz, Arvardan-least of all with the High Minister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead there was the picture of a planet, Trantor-from whose huge, planet-wide metropolis all the Galaxy was ruled. And there was the picture of a palace whose spires and sweeping arches he had never seen in reality; that no other Earthman had ever seen. He thought of the invisible lines of power and glory that swept from sun to sun in gathering strings, ropes, and cables to that central palace and to that abstraction, the Emperor, who was, after all, merely a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind held that thought fixedly-the thought of that power which could alone bestow a divinity during life-concentrated in one who was merely human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerely human! Like himself!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could be... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pebble-in-the-sky-galactic-empire-3/page-10.html","bookId":1726,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:11 AM"}
