It was my beach, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday Night - The Wedding\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like Italy. I took my glass of wine and walked onto the back deck, overlooking the other villa and the sea. I sat under a lit tent and watched the waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is it, Jacqueline. You did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at Luce as he sat in the chair next to me. He held his wine glass up to me. I clinked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To new beginnings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back at the girl he had brought, \"She is beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"Inside and out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat in silence. It wasn’t awkward with him like it could have been. We understood each other too well. He knew every minute of the journey I had been on and vice versa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think you will head back to Rome after the harvest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"I do. I think we are planning a little excursion. Stanley wants to stay on and help out. He\u0027s not loving retirement. I am in the process of building him a caretaker\u0027s house. So he will be able to hold down the fort. After the harvest and the processing, we will be done by October.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you considered ice wine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrinkled my nose, \"No. I think it\u0027s gross. I can\u0027t get into it. My sommelier, Sandy, wants me to—but blech.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi came out onto the deck. She sat next to me, sipping her wine slowly, \"Some view, sis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"It is. I got lucky with this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, \"No, you never. You got exactly what you deserved.\" She looked stunning in her wedding gown. Luce held his glass out for her, \"We all have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clinked my glass with theirs and sat back to enjoy the view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m pregnant again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI coughed on my wine a little as Luce snatched the wine from her hand. She laughed, \"It\u0027s cranberry juice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choked for a second, \"Wh-wh-what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled like I had never seen before, \"Yup. Just over a month we figure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"Wow, so soon? Abby is only a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, \"I want them close so they\u0027ll play like you and I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made me smile. We had played. She had been my friend more than she had ever been my sister. I had assumed that was what sisters were, friends who slept over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce handed her back the glass after checking; he knew her well enough. He held his glass up again, \"Congratulations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clinked my glass again, \"Yes, congratulations to you all. The wedding was stunning and the baby will be an amazing addition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gushed, \"I know. Thanks again for the wedding. It was perfect, with none of our old friends. Just what I wanted. Will is up for contract this year so wherever he ends up, I will get a fresh start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"I know. This place has been like a retreat. If he ends up somewhere sucky, you know you can always live here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a smile, \"I can\u0027t live without him, J.D.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at Mike talking with Sal and Arthur, \"I know that feeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a shitty grin when he saw me looking at him. My mom walked past him. I jumped up, \"Excuse me.\" I ran over to her. I grabbed her hand. She gave me a look of shock and annoyance. I wrapped my arms around her, \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged me back, \"We can fix all of the things we left broken for so long, Jacqueline. I do love you very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded into her shoulder, \"I know you do. I love you too, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoped my dad was watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole wedding was a hit and the photographer got hundreds of shots for our portfolio for the bridal magazines. Experiencing the Italian villa wedding in the US was economical and easier. No passports and foreign planners. Just me, Mom and Muriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod help them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the last of the dishes into the staff kitchen and thanked everyone. I turned and walked back to my house, excited to crawl into bed and sleep for a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got to the house, it was dark. Everyone had gone to bed, eager to sleep for a week too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the door to our room, stopping when I saw the lanterns lighting the way out to the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked out to the deck, then stopped, stunned by what I saw. The entire yard was filled with lanterns that were lit and glowing bright. Mike was on the deck holding a lantern. I looked at the lights everywhere, \"Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped to his knees, \"I never got to ask the right way. Jacqueline, will you do me the honor of being my home and my heart forever and ever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, feeling the emotion and exhaustion starting to blend. He let go of his lantern and in his hand was a ring box. He lifted the ring and placed it on my finger. The diamond sparkled in the lights. He stood and kissed me softly before turning to the lights in the yard. \"She said yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lanterns all sailed from the hands of the people I hadn’t seen. They sailed up around the yard and out to the ocean. It was an amazing thing to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed, \"Is that going to burn my vineyard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, \"They burn out fast. And Stan said the wind was going out to sea so we were good to go.\" He kissed my head, \"I have a bunch of guys with hoses on standby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd below erupted as the lights filled the sky for a second and then sailed away and went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike wrapped his arm around me and waved to the people below. I saw my mother waving like a madwoman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the diamond on my finger, \"Is it colored?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"You already had a white one, I figured mine could be a different color.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"I love it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached behind me to a box and passed it to me, \"I have one more surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned as I opened the box. Inside was the dress, CHANEL. She was alive and well. I pulled her from the box, \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, \"I stole it from your mom’s and took it to the store. I explained that I needed another one, but I wanted it a little different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let her fall open and noticed the weight difference right away. She was a gown. In the light I could see the flowers and the gathered fabric. She was stunning. The flower petals moved in the wind. I shook my head, \"I have no words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed my forehead, \"Good. I have something else in mind.\" I put her back in the box carefully as he waved goodnight to our family and friends below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed CHANEL on a chair and turned to see Mike closing the drapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"No, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did I get so lucky to find someone like you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and grabbed my hands, pulling me to the bed, \"You didn’t find me, Jack. You made me this way. You make me better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"Mike, that’s all you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me on the shoulder as he pulled my shirt off and tossed it on the floor, \"No, Jack. You make me want to try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and savored those words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe End. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-38.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
