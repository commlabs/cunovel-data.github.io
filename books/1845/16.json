It wasn\u0027t possible for me to take the time to send someone with Gilly to Quinlan\u0027s family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\" Her voice was completely devoid of emotion, and she gave her reply to the ground so she wouldn\u0027t have to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t understand,\" he muttered. \"MacNare and a fair number of his clan were following us, and though I would have loved a good fight, I couldn\u0027t give in to the pleasure because you would end up in the thick of it. I wasn\u0027t about to put you in such danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his hand when she tried to interrupt him, and continued on. \"However, as soon as we get home, I\u0027ll send one of my soldiers to find your mare and take her to Quinlan\u0027s father then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Connor. Is our enemy close now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close enough,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t hear them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They weren\u0027t close enough to hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was ready to dismiss the topic and turned to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t. \"Connor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried after him, then suddenly stopped. She\u0027d thought to kiss him on the cheek to let him know how much she appreciated his taking the time to explain the circumstances, but the memory of how he had reacted to her affection the last time was still fresh enough to hurt, and so she decided not to provoke him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for confiding in me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get used to it. It isn\u0027t customary for me to explain my actions to anyone. I doubt I\u0027ll do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed determined to ruin every kind moment with a nasty remark. He also had the discourteous and grating habit of walking away from her whenever he wanted to end a conversation, forcing her to chase after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we safe now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe refused to give her any other details, such as explaining why they were safe now but hadn\u0027t been safe earlier in the day, and she was simply too worn out from trying to get along with him to attempt to coax him into giving her additional information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to the creek and washed as quickly as she could. The water was much colder here than the water she\u0027d bathed in the night before. By the time she put on fresh undergarments and stockings, even her scalp felt numb. She hadn\u0027t been able to locate the trunk filled with her gowns, but thankfully she still had two clean but wrinkled ones left in her satchel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold night air was rapidly stealing what little strength she had left. She draped the shorter tunic over a bush in hopes that the damp air would ease the wrinkles out and sat down to brush her hair. She rushed through her night prayers to get them over and done with while she braided her hair, and when she was finished, she could barely find enough strength to put her shoes back on and stand up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was thinking how lovely it would be to sleep in a warm bed and immediately felt guilty because poor Gilly wouldn\u0027t have a warm stable tonight. An unfamiliar noise turned her attention then. The sound had been whisper faint and seemed to come from the opposite side of the cove, although she couldn\u0027t see anything out of the ordinary. The trees were too thick, and the moon wasn\u0027t casting sufficient light down on the branches, but she was still certain she\u0027d heard something that shouldn\u0027t have been there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stayed completely still, closed her eyes, and patiently waited several minutes before she heard the sound again. It was as clear as a shout to her now and very like the familiar sound of steel brushing over steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen with weapons were coming their way, God help them. They weren\u0027t allies, she knew, because friends wouldn\u0027t be sneaking up on them, would they? No, of course not, she reasoned. They would shout their greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t tell how many there were, but she had a feeling there were more than just a few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried not to let her fear control her actions. She wanted to run as fast as her legs would carry her to warn Connor of the danger coming their way. She walked instead and tried not to make any noise at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d heard them approaching, after all, and any sound she made was bound to give them her exact location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord, she was scared. She called to her husband in a soft voice as soon as she reached the narrow clearing, then saw him near a cluster of trees in deep discussion with Quinlan. They obviously had sought privacy for their talk, because they stood well away from the other warriors. She could tell from their rigid stances that the issue under discussion was serious. Connor didn\u0027t like what Quinlan was telling him, as he was shaking his head every other minute in obvious disagreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried forward and called his name again as she approached, but he put his hand up in silent command not to interrupt him and didn\u0027t even glance her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t wait until they finished, of course—they\u0027d all be dead if she did—and so she braced herself for his disapproval, then reached up and pulled his hand down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe defiant action gained his full attention. His initial irritation vanished the second he saw how frightened she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soldiers are coming toward us, Connor. I couldn\u0027t see their number, but I heard them. They\u0027re trying to be quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch to her confusion, her startling announcement didn\u0027t get the reaction she\u0027d anticipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor smiled. \"You actually heard them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was apparent he hadn\u0027t grasped the ramifications yet. \"Yes, I heard them. I don\u0027t believe they\u0027re allies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wouldn\u0027t care about making noise if they were, would they? We should leave with all possible haste. Why are you smiling? Don\u0027t you understand the danger we\u0027re in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe guessed he didn\u0027t understand when he didn\u0027t immediately move. She hadn\u0027t thought him at all slow-witted until now, and unfortunately, his friend seemed to suffer the same affliction. In fact, he was worse. He was having so much difficulty comprehending their dire situation, he laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt like throwing her hands up in despair. She settled on wringing them together instead. \"Connor, I\u0027m… concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no reason to be concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor usually didn\u0027t notice how a woman was groomed, but he couldn\u0027t seem to stop staring at his wife\u0027s hair now. He couldn\u0027t imagine what she\u0027d tried to accomplish. Honest to God, he\u0027d never seen anything quite like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered himself to be an astute man, however, and knew Brenna had extremely tender feelings, so he was careful to sound only mildly curious and not critical when he asked her to explain what she\u0027d done. \"What the hell have you done to your hair, wife? Did you mean to tie it in knots all over your head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t believe he wanted to talk about her appearance. \"My braid? You want to discuss my braid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, so it\u0027s a braid,\" he said. \"I hadn\u0027t realized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started backing away from him. She shook her head several times, and every time she moved, one of the knots came undone. \"Can\u0027t you see how worried I am?\" she cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t imagine why she was worried, unless she hadn\u0027t been paying attention to him when he\u0027d told her not to be concerned. Or had she heard and chosen not to believe him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t going to lecture her, no matter how much she provoked him. No, he would simply help her reason it all out in her mind. She was an intelligent woman; it wouldn\u0027t take her any time at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly why are you worried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was overwhelmed by his incomprehension and was, for the moment, rendered speechless. No one could be this obtuse, not even warlords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan couldn\u0027t keep silent a moment longer. He felt he was far more astute than his laird in matters concerning women, and so he naturally sought to lend his counsel before his laird put his foot in his mouth and injured his lady\u0027s delicate feelings. \"I believe your wife is still upset about the men she heard approaching. She might have thought we were in jeopardy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna was vigorously nodding her head in agreement when Connor denied the possibility. \"No, my wife wouldn\u0027t dare insult me that way,\" he replied, keeping his gaze directed on her all the while. \"She knows I\u0027ll protect her from harm. Isn\u0027t that so, Brenna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it wasn\u0027t so. How would she know if he was capable of protecting anyone or not? Just because he looked like a warlord from hell didn\u0027t mean he could fight like one. She didn\u0027t think it would be a good idea to tell him her thoughts, though. The way he stared at her made caution a much wiser choice, and she found herself nodding just to placate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remaining knots came apart then, and her hair was once again where Connor wanted it to be, in soft curls down about her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna was just about to leave when the truth dawned on her. \"You knew those men were there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor looked at her, but said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you known?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since they joined us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They aren\u0027t your enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" she demanded. \"You should have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re supposed to tell your wife important news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. Where in God\u0027s name did she come by these ideas? \"I think not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor couldn\u0027t believe she\u0027d contradicted him. He gave her a hard stare and folded his arms across his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan knew what that meant. His laird was getting angry. It was only a matter of time now before Connor said something he would later regret. Because he was Connor\u0027s friend, Quinlan couldn\u0027t let that happen. \"Mi\u0027lady, may I suggest you put your plaid on?\" he asked. \"Your husband wouldn\u0027t want you to catch a chill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked as though she hadn\u0027t heard him and her attention remained focused on her husband. The tension between the two continued to build, for their gazes were locked on each other. Connor\u0027s was challenging, Brenna\u0027s was defiant, and neither one of them appeared willing to back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The air\u0027s damp tonight,\" Quinlan interjected in yet another attempt to get his mistress\u0027s attention. \"We\u0027re in for a fierce thunderstorm.\" His last comment did the trick. Quinlan felt like sighing with relief when Lady Brenna finally looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it\u0027s going to rain, she said. It\u0027s a fitting end to a hellishly long day. Have you seen my trunk, Quinlan? I\u0027m in need of my heavy cloak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll wear my plaid,\" Connor told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t raised his voice to her, but she acted as though he had by backing farther away from him. \"My trunk, Quinlan?\" she reminded the soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We left it behind with your saddle, mi\u0027lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please go and get it for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan turned to Connor to judge his reaction to her request before answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laird shook his head but remained stubbornly silent, much to Quinlan\u0027s consternation, leaving him to fend for himself. \"It isn\u0027t possible for me to go and get it for you. We left it behind several hours ago, and we\u0027ve traveled a fair distance since then, over rough terrain, if you\u0027ll remember. We had to leave it, mi\u0027lady,\" he quickly added when he noticed the look in her eyes. \"The wagon wouldn\u0027t have made it up the narrow climb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you leave it behind without asking my permission first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By your laird\u0027s command,\" he explained, thinking that important fact would end the discussion once and for all. He was mistaken. Lady Brenna wasn\u0027t ready to let it go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t it occur to either one of you that there might be some important reason why I wanted to keep the trunk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she\u0027d given him time to think of a reply, Quinlan was sure he would have thought of something appropriate to say to her, but she didn\u0027t give him time. His mistress\u0027s outrage seemed to be gathering momentum as she continued. \"My sister Joan gave me the trunk and I had planned to put my children\u0027s clothes inside. I treasure it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan suddenly felt about as low and inadequate as an Englishman must feel every time he looked in a mirror. He turned to his laird again, willing him with his hard stare and a slight nudge to take over the battle. Damn it all, Quinlan wasn\u0027t married to the distraught woman. Connor was. Let him suffer her disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor continued to stay stonily silent, however. \"Mi\u0027lady, it was necessary,\" Quinlan said. \"Isn\u0027t that right, Laird?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna didn\u0027t particularly care what her husband had to say about it. She was too disheartened to listen to anyone any longer. The injustices done to her in the past several days were taking their toll now, and she thought that if she didn\u0027t get away from her husband for a few minutes, she\u0027d start screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t bother to excuse herself; she simply walked away. A sudden thought made her stop. \"My saddle, Quinlan? Did you say you also left the saddle my dear sister Rachel loaned to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have another one, Brenna?\" Connor asked dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord, how she hated his condescending, be-reasonable tone. \"No, I didn\u0027t.\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mi\u0027lady, it was also necessary to leave your sister\u0027s saddle behind,\" Quinlan blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I treasured it too,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan\u0027s shoulders slumped. He had known she would say that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot help but wonder why you didn\u0027t ask my permission first, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan vowed not to say another word. He stared at his laird, imitated his threatening stance by folding his arms across his chest, and simply waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor didn\u0027t take the hint fast enough to please his friend. \"Wouldn\u0027t you like to answer your wife ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan sounded downright desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor let his friend see his exasperation before turning to Brenna. \"I wouldn\u0027t be laird if I asked permission before I made decisions, especially insignificant ones. You were merely curious, weren\u0027t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou wouldn\u0027t show disapproval of your husband\u0027s actions in front of his followers. Isn\u0027t that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe surprised him by agreeing. \"Yes, I was simply curious, and no, I would never criticize you in front of your followers. Do you have the patience to endure one more question, husband?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do you suppose you\u0027ll leave me behind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor\u0027s mood darkened in the space of a heartbeat. He took a threatening step forward and briskly ordered her to come to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan moved back, looked to the heavens, and began to pray for divine intervention. His mistress had never seen Connor lose his temper, and though Quinlan knew his laird would never physically harm her, or any other woman for that matter, he could do considerable damage to her heart. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-16.html","bookId":1845,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:46 PM"}
