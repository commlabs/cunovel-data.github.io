Read it for fun, or just skip on to chapter 559!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 558: Heads!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How dare you!!” roared Patriarch Huyan. His body flickered as he shook off the power of the Time reversal and then shattered Meng Hao’s Eighth Demon Sealing Hex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Huyan’s eyes filled with scorn. He actually wasn’t worried about the snake bone whip being taken away. It had been refined from a bloodline ancestor of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe. Other than people of that bloodline, no one could use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven back before the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe had been eradicated, Patriarch Huyan would still have been the only one qualified to activate the bloodline power to use the precious treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need to even mention the current circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, the backlash power that would be levied against any outsider who touched the whip made him completely confident. With a cold chuckle, he backed up, allowing Meng Hao to near the whip and, at the same time, preparing a divine ability to unleash against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant Meng Hao’s hand fell onto the snake bone whip, a feeling like sparks of electricity began to race up his hand and into his arm. He instantly frowned, and his face grew pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tingling feeling quickly turned into pain, like that of hundreds of knives stabbing into his hand and forearm. He tried to release his grip, but was shocked to find that he was unable. It was as if his hand were stuck onto the snake bone whip, unable to release it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao gritted his teeth once again tried to shake away the snake bone whip. The pain was now becoming intolerable. His face was pale white and blood seeped out of the corners of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, an incredible power surged out, starting from the tip of the whip and then growing like a tidal of wave of force as it shot toward his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao felt a sense of deadly crisis sweep over him. The power of the snake bone whip was beyond anything he had ever faced up against before. After all, this was the power of an Immortal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he had fought Patriarch Huyan’s clone, as well as Patriarch Huyan’s true self, he had never even crossed paths with a Dao Seeking expert, let alone a true Immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that such power could instantly shatter him, body and soul, and even destroy his Nascent Souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, the power reached his hand, causing it to explode into a haze of blood and gore. As the power continued up his arm, bursting flesh, crushing bone, Meng Hao knew that he was moments away from being exterminated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quickly slapped his bag of holding to produce an ordinary flying sword. Without hesitation, he slashed at his right shoulder, severing his right arm completely. Shooting backward at top speed, he watched as the power of the snake bone whip turned what remained of his right arm into nothing more than a haze of blood which quickly faded away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that Patriarch Huyan pushed down hard onto his forehead, spitting up a mouthful of soul blood. He quickly performed a double-handed incantation which caused the blood to turn black. It then spread out to form an enormous beaded net. The net moved with incredible speed as it expanded, threatening to envelop Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, his path of escape was completely cut off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Huyan chuckled. “My Blood Time Net is faster than a Second Severing Cultivator. I don’t care what power-up magic you have, you could never evade it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s mind raced as he tried to think of what few options he had left. There simply wasn’t enough time to consider, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe net was now on the verge of completely covering him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in this moment that, shockingly… a huge fissure appeared in mid-air directly between Patriarch Huyan and Meng Hao. The fissure spread out with shocking speed and emanated a blinding, glittering light. A fearsome aura exploded out of it that caused even Patriarch Huyan’s face to go pale. It seemed something beyond comprehension, almost like the might of the Heavens themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light spread out to slash into the black-colored blood net, instantly shredding it into countless pieces which then became nothing more than ash on the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood sprayed from Patriarch Huyan’s mouth as his connection to the net was severed, and he instantly backed up, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao also stared in shock, having no clue whatsoever regarding the origin of this strange fissure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeathly silence filled the area. The only thing that could be heard was a faint pulsing sound coming from within the fissure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long moment passed, in which everyone observing felt their hearts pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that the cold voice of a woman echoed out from within the fissure, filled with incredible power. “You dare to harm my son!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice contained such power that Patriarch Huyan was instantly sent tumbling backward, his face filled with astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a hand could be seen emerging from the fissure. It was as smooth as jade, completely beautiful to the extreme. The hand was followed by an arm, and then a face. A woman emerged from the fissure, her eyes blazing with fury, and her right hand clenched tightly into a fist. Her hair whipped about her and her robes flapped violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she emerged, the fissure closed up behind her, letting out a sound like a thunderclap, as well as a violent, rushing wind that sent Patriarch Huyan tumbling backward yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman stared around coldly. This was none other than… Meng Li!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day Ji Nineteen attempted to sever Meng Hao’s Karma, she flew into a rage and directly attacked the Ji Clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, her killing intent soared to the Heavens. “You paltry Western Desert cretin!” she said. “You just poked a bear cub, but what you failed to realized is that the bear cub is actually the adopted child of a fire-breathing dragon! Right now, that dragon has the thirst for blood!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fellow Daoist, I….” Patriarch Huyan tried to gush an explanation, but before he could, Meng Li’s body flickered, and she was directly in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You dare to speak to me?” she said. She slowly reached out and flicked her finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flicking finger slammed into Patriarch Huyan’s face, causing his head to instantly explode. The force of the explosion rippled out, destroying his body and shattering his Nascent Divinity. The shockwave created by his death caused ripples to spread out in all directions. Many nearby beasts were instantly destroyed by the intense power. Meng Hao, however, seemed to be strangely shielded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, this Spirit Severing Patriarch, someone who could inspire fear into the hearts of everyone watching, was destroyed in body and soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe observing streams of Divine Sense were completely shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That aura… That’s not Spirit Severing. It’s not even Dao Seeking….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just who is this person…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Dekun’s face drained of blood. “Junior Brother…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuo Lan was trembling visibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the Cultivators in the other cities in the Black Lands all had similar reactions. Even through the screens upon which they were watching the battle, it was possible to tell that this woman was no ordinary Cultivator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Li slowly turned to look at Meng Hao. “Well… hello,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s heart was pounding. “Who are you?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckled. “I’ve finally come for you. The time has come for something… to happen, my son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Son?” replied Meng Hao. His mind reeled. This woman couldn’t possibly be… his mother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Li lifted up her hand, within which appeared a bag of holding. “I have something for you,” she said, tossing the bag over to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao frowned as he snatched the bag of holding out of the air. When he looked inside, his mind filled with a roaring sound, and waves of shock rippled out through his body. The bag was filled with… severed heads!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned it over numbly, watching in horror as the head of a woman tumbled out. He recognized this woman. It was none other than… the woman who was for all intents and purposes his beloved. Song Jia of the Song Clan!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the head fell downward, another head rolled out of the bag. It was… Hanxue Shan of the Frigid Snow Clan, who had professed her feelings toward him underneath the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that was… Han Bei, the only woman who could possibly match wits with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChu Yuyan!!! Chu Yuyan who had such complicated feelings for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s heart seized, and the blood completely drained from his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the worst was yet to come. The final head to tumble out of the bag was none other than…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXu Qing!!! Xu Qing, whose single tear had pulled him back from the midst of Demonic Transmigration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXu Qing, who had saved him from being slain at the hands of the Ji Clan Quasi-Array member.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXu Qing, who had taken him from Mount Daqing, which led to his new life as a Cultivator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXu Qing….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXu Qing…!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXU QING!!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was completely at a loss for words. Roaring filled his mind, and his remaining hand began to tremble violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis entire person filled with a sense of absolute coldness and emptiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Surprised?” said Meng Li. “Don’t worry, they died peacefully. I’m not a torturer. However, I couldn’t let inferior quality woman have contact with… my son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao slowly looked over at Meng Li, his face filled with astonishment and disbelief. Currently, he felt as if his entire world had become a nightmare. Was it even real?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could say anything, Meng Li held up her hand. “There’s no need for questions. Watch.” Meng Li started to chuckle, and then laugh uproariously. Suddenly, a rumbling sound filled Heaven and Earth. Everything began to shake, and Meng Li’s body trembled violently. Shockingly, vines exploded from her eyes, ears, nose and mouth. Her fleshly body appeared to be shredded in the blink of an eye as an enormous, seven-colored flower roared into existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManiacal laughter rang out in all directions as Meng Li then shouted, “The time has come. Awaken, my son!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in this very moment that the Resurrection Lily exploded in attack. Meng Hao’s mind was reeling and his heart virtually torn into pieces. He was completely caught off guard, thoroughly incapable of fighting back against the Resurrection Lily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt quickly seized control of his legs and arm, then his torso. By the time he realized what was happening and thought to fight back, the only thing left under his control was his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was too late. In the blink of an eye, his entire body and self was possessed by the Resurrection Lily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was powerless to do anything except watch what was happening as his body looked at the flower-form Meng Li and then spoke the words, “Hello, mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao wanted to scream, to rage, to fight back, but he was completely powerless. All he could do was let out a soundless howl that echoed out for him alone to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enormous, seven-colored flower approached Meng Hao’s body. Her voice was like a soft purr as she said, “At long last, you’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I failed so many times in the past,” Meng Hao heard his own voice saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter,” she replied. Why don’t you assume your true form?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA roaring sound echoed up into the sky. Vines exploded out of the eyes, ears, nose and mouth of Meng Hao’s body. They stretched out, seemingly destroying his fleshly body in the blink of an eye. Moments later, a five-colored Resurrection Lily hovered there, swaying back and forth bizarrely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s better,” said Meng Li. “We’ll soon figure out what to do about the two other colors. And now, to take care of this pesky Meng Hao.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a tentacle-like vine snaked out to stab directly into the middle of the five-colored Resurrection Lily. The vine wrapped around Meng Hao’s Nascent Soul and wrenched it out violently. Meng Hao felt incredible pain surrounding him. He realized that, at this moment, the only thing that remained of his true self, was nothing more than this Nascent Soul!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vine pulled the struggling Nascent Soul until it hovered directly in front of the face of the seven-colored Resurrection Lily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your days of causing problems for my true son are over. I know exactly how to deal with an insect like you.” Another tentacle flashed an incantation symbol, and suddenly, Meng Hao felt stabs of pain all over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like thousands of needles, not poking into, but piercing out from within!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down in shock to see what appeared to be a sea of needles emerging from the surface of his Nascent Soul!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis chapter was sponsored by Siwangzhijian\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 559: And Then There Were Three….\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpoiler Sneak Peek below\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enough of this ant!” cried Meng Li.
