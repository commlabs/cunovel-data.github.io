{"id":34796,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII TONY HIRES OUT","content":"Tony was not slow in going to sleep. Neither his hard bed nor his strange bedchamber troubled him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Generally he slept all night without awakening, but to-night, for some unknown reason, he awoke about two o’clock. It was unusually light for that hour, and so he was enabled to see what at first startled him. The old man had raised a plank forming a part of the flooring, and had lifted from beneath it a canvas bag full of gold pieces. He was taking them out and counting them, apparently quite unconscious of Tony’s presence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tony raised himself on his elbow, and looked at him. It occurred to him that for a man so suspicious it was strange that he should expose his hoard before a stranger. Something, however, in the old man’s look led him to think that he was in a sleep-walking fit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven,” Tony heard him count; “that makes nine hundred and seventy dollars, all gold, good, beautiful gold. Nobody knows the old man is so rich. There’s another bag, too. There are one hundred pieces in that. Three more and this will be full, too. Nobody must know, nobody must know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He put back the pieces, replaced the bag in its hiding place, and then, putting back the plank, lay down once more on his heap of rags.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How uneasy he would be,” thought Tony, “if he knew I had seen his treasures. But I wouldn’t rob him for the world, although the money would do me good, and he makes no use of it except to look at it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tony slept till six when he was awakened by a piteous groaning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What’s the matter?” he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Who’s there?” demanded Ben, terrified.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It’s only I. Don’t you remember you let me sleep here last night?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, yes. I remember now. I’m sick; very sick.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How do you feel?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m aching and trembling all over. Do you think I’m going to die?” he asked, with a startled look.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, no, I guess not,” said Tony reassuringly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I never felt so before,” groaned Ben. “I’m an old man. Don’t you really think I shall die?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tony knew nothing of medicines or of diseases, but he had the sense to understand that the old man would be more likely to recover if his terror could be allayed, and he said lightly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, it’s only a trifle. You’ve taken cold, very likely. A cup of hot tea would be good for you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I haven’t any tea,” groaned Ben. “It costs a great deal, and I’m very poor. I can’t afford to buy it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tony smiled, remembering the hoard of gold.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I guess you’ve got some money,” said Tony. “You’d better let me go to the store, and buy some tea and a fresh roll for you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How much will it cost?” asked Ben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I can get some bread, and tea, and sugar for thirty or forty cents,” answered Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Forty cents! It’s frightful!” exclaimed Ben. “I—I guess I’ll do without it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, well, if you prefer to lie there and die, it’s none of my business,” said Tony, rather provoked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But I don’t want to die,” whined Ben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then do as I tell you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tony jumped up, unrolled his coat and put it on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now,” he said, “I’m ready to go for you, if you’ll give me the money.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But you may take it and not come back.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If you think you can’t trust me, you needn’t.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I think I’ll go myself,” said Ben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He tried to raise himself, but a twinge of pain compelled him to lie down again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No, I can’t,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, do you want me to go for you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” answered Ben reluctantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then give me the money.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ben produced twenty-five cents from his pocket.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Isn’t that enough?” he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Better give me more,” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He produced ten cents more, and vowed it was all the money he had in the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tony decided not to contradict his assertion, but to make this go as far as it would. He put on his hat and started out. He meant also to stop at the doctor’s, and ask him to call round, for he thought it possible that the old man might be seriously sick.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After he left the grocery store, he called at the house of the village doctor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Old Ben sick?” said Dr. Compton. “How did you happen to be in his house?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tony explained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He has been repaid for taking you in,” said the doctor. “I’ll put on my hat and go right over with you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After Tony left the house, old Ben tormented himself with the thought that the boy would never come back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was relieved by seeing the door open and Tony enter. But he looked dismayed when he saw the doctor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What did you come for?” he asked peevishly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To see what I can do for you, Mr. Hayden.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But I can’t pay you,” whined old Ben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We’ll talk about that afterward.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You can’t charge when I didn’t send for you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Make your mind easy. I won’t charge for this visit. Let me feel your pulse.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Old Ben no longer opposed medical treatment, finding it would cost nothing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Am I going to die?” he asked, with an anxious look.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You need nourishing food and care, that is all,” was the reply. “You have had a chill, and you are reduced by insufficient food.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have some bread and tea here,” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then make a fire and boil the tea. And, by the way, Mr. Hayden needs somebody for a few days. Can you look after him?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If he will give me money enough to buy what he needs,” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Old Ben whined that he was poor, and had no money, but the doctor interrupted him impatiently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That’s all nonsense,” he said. “You may not have much money, but you’ve got some, and you’ll die if you don’t spend some on yourself. If you don’t agree to it I shall advise this boy here to leave you to your fate. Then your only resource will be to go to the poorhouse.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This proposal was not acceptable to Ben, who was unwilling to leave the house where his treasures were concealed. He, therefore, reluctantly acceded to the doctor’s conditions, and Tony got his breakfast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well,” thought Tony to himself, with a smile, “I’ve got a situation as plain cook and housekeeper. I wonder how long it will last, and what’ll come of it. I don’t believe Rudolph will look for me here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2019/57593.html","bookId":622,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 5:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 5:56:04 AM"}
