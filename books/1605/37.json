I open my eyes to Meg and Anna sleeping next to each other and Leo on the floor. Anna\u0027s hand is draped off the bed, touching his fur. He opens one yellow eye, watching me. I smile at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna wakes up and looks at me. She whispers, \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I will be. You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head too, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did they do to you for the week?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes twitch, \"Tests. Tons of tests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"Bernie wouldn’t let them hurt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow, \"Did they want to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods once slowly, \"The head guy did. He wanted to do experiments. He wanted to try things that Bernie kept saying no to. Bernie lied and said I was his girlfriend. The head guy thought I was too young for him, but Bernie lied and said I was twenty-three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"You and Will—all the way, huh?\" She changes the subject. I don’t blame her. I\u0027m pretty sure that head guy was my real dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"All the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs, \"I always was rooting for Jake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks into my eyes, like she is trying to tell me something important, \"You don’t know where you\u0027ll find love, but it\u0027s almost always going to be, the last place you think it\u0027ll be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cock an eyebrow, \"Did you read that somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe beams, \"I read it in one of your Granny\u0027s romance novels that were on the shelf you told me to start with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh quietly and whisper, \"I meant the survival books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrinkles her nose, \"Those were boring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh again, I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolls her eyes, \"Even though my family ruins your life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Even though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leans forward and whispers even quieter, \"Weird about Star and Jake, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very weird. They suit each other though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives me a funny look, \"She said you guys are sisters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"That is the weirdest part for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winks, \"I hope you guys fight for real. Two badass sisters with foul tempers and hardcore strength. No sissy slaps like back at Bernie\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"No way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna climbs out of the bed, making Meg stir and moan. I climb out of the bed too. My feet are a bit sore from breaking in the new boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow her into the living room. Allan looks at me from in the front window, \"Some cabin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch his eyes follow Anna as she stretches, \"Belonged to my Granny and Gramps and dad. They bought it when I was a kid. Dad was always planning on coming here when the meltdown happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks out the window, \"Seems like a smart idea. He must have known then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I think he might have. He had a friend who worked for my other dad.\" I don\u0027t even want to attempt explaining them all. I don’t honestly feel like I\u0027ve ever had a proper explanation. I tug on my boots and head to the front door. I look back at Anna, \"Make a huge pot of oats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllan stands, \"I can help her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No. You can come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks confused but follows me out. I whistle for Leo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe comes trotting out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk into the front yard. As the door closes, I pick up my bow and quiver and tuck my knife into my boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really are the vigilante, aren’t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back, \"Why do you keep saying that?\" he gives me the creeps. I have given him the benefit of a doubt for Will\u0027s sake, but I don’t like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark-brown eyes watch me, \"No reason. Just amazing there is a vigilante who is a little girl like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"I\u0027m not so little, trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe follows me into the woods. Leo senses my shitty mood and stays close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you come across such a magnificent animal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug and walk into the forest, \"I don’t know, luck I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo lifts a lip. I snort, \"He hates you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn around and face him, \"Animals are a good judge of character.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis bushy dark eyebrows lower, \"What is that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step towards him, \"I see the way you eye up Anna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs, \"She\u0027s a beautiful girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand twitches with the want to choke the life out of him, \"She\u0027s seventeen, so she\u0027s an actual girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowls, \"Oh. I thought she was twenty-something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgust creeps across my face \"How old are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirty-eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks forty-five. His dark hair is greasy and thinning. His thin face is sweaty and wrinkled, like he was fat before and his skin hangs a bit from the weight loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make sure we are eye to eye when I speak to him, \"This is your warning. I kill perverts. I kill them every day of the week. Ones bigger than you and stronger than you and meaner than you. If I even suspect you\u0027re a pervert, I won\u0027t give you another warning. This is the one you get.\" I point back towards the cabin and use Will\u0027s words from the camp, \"This isn’t a democracy. I know it looks like one, but that’s my cabin. I will kill you in a heartbeat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flinches and backs up, \"Hey…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You don’t talk. You just hear me.\" Leo steps towards him and growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallows and nods, \"Okay.\" I see it in his dark eyes, he wants me dead. He wants my cabin and the people who are there. The people I call family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon comes walking up, \"Hey, Em.\" He smiles and waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile back, \"Hey, Ron. Allan was just going to collect firewood. Why don’t you escort him and show him the ropes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile grows, \"Welcome, Allan. It\u0027s just this way.\" He points and starts walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to see Leo nuzzled against Will, who is leaned against a tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point, \"He…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I trust you. I trust your instincts. If you say he eyeballed Anna, I trust that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to him and let him wrap his arms around me \"I just don’t want to act like a crazy psycho. I feel like my feelings are all wrong. I thought that about Bernie, but he was kinda grossed out when I told him how old Anna was. He assumed she was closer to my age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill pulls me back, grinning like a fool, \"You admit you were wrong about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sneer, \"He\u0027s a whiny little bitch most of the time,\" I sigh, \"But yeah, I was wrong. He isn’t a pervert. Not all guys are perverts I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill nods towards Allan, \"Allan\u0027s a lot older than Bernie is. He\u0027s old enough to be Anna\u0027s dad. Not cool.\" His eyes narrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk, \"You made me bring him up this damned hill. He knows the way to the cabin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill speaks over my head, \"I don’t think we have to worry about him going down the mountain, Em. He looks at my sister again and I\u0027ll snap his neck myself.\" I see the dangerous glint in his eyes and nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at Allan and Ron rounding the corner to the woodpile. Ron and Bernie both have turned out to be nice guys. I look back at Will and smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill looks down on me, \"You let me handle it though, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agree, \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile turns mocking, \"Look at my girl getting all civilized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull back and walk away, \"Ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone reflects the smile on his face, \"Whatever you kill, make sure it\u0027s big. I am starved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull an arrow and head to the sweet spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg finds me alone, sitting on the hillside listening. I barely hear her sneaking up on me, \"You\u0027re so quiet, Meg. You need to teach Jake to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolls her eyes, chewing on a piece of grass and plops down where I\u0027m sitting. \"He ain\u0027t never gonna learn how to be quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort, \"Yeah, I guess not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nudges me, \"You all right then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I hardly know.\" I look at her dirty face and frown, \"How are you dirty already, it\u0027s morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sticks her tongue out, \"I was chopping firewood. I gotta do something with all my extra energy. Ron is gonna be the death of me. I think I\u0027m almost a virgin again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growl, \"Stop talking like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins, testing me, \"Why? It shouldn’t bother you that you\u0027re a virgin and I ain\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks flare instantly and I lower my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see her jaw drop, \"Oh, no way. You did it? Which one of them hunky brothers got the golden goose outta ya?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy nose wrinkles, \"Stop being disgusting about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs and lies back, \"I bet it was Will. That’s who I would want. He\u0027s a real man. He\u0027ll take care of ya. I think Jake might only ever take care of one thing. Not that it\u0027s a problem but a girl\u0027s gotta eat too, ya know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs and lies back, \"I bet it was Will. That’s who I would want. He\u0027s a real man. He\u0027ll take care of ya. I think Jake might only ever take care of one thing. Not that it\u0027s a problem, but a girl\u0027s gotta eat too, ya know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cover my face with my hands and moan. I want to choke her but I don’t. I breathe deeply, \"You know, I can go through a lot of shit and still it doesn’t feel as disturbing as a conversation with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snickers and chews the grass. I listen to the woods and glance at her after a minute, \"You okay to stay if we leave again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"I don’t trust Mary with Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Me either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg taps her foot, \"You hear that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI strain my ears and shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s Jake and that bitch, Star, fighting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudge her, \"She\u0027s my sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowls, \"No way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grimaces, \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I don’t know her. I know she\u0027s different. I wanna feel bad for her for what she\u0027s been through, but I feel like she brings it on. Being all flakey and shit.
