She did just see him in our doorway dropping me off, it can’t be that hard to believe. I mean, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, he kinda didn’t want me to leave.” I can’t help but take a little jab myself. I want her to know to keep her eyes off him because Sean is mine, and he’s made it clear I’m his. I won’t have him coming over and her pulling some shit or trying to put me down in front of him. I’ve put up with a lot from Harper but now I seem to give a shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you’re here now,” she smirks, and her words burn. Point Harper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some people do have to work, Harper.” I push past her, not wanting to have this verbal jab fest. I may be over her shit right now, but I also don’t want to hurt her with the things that are suddenly on the tip of my tongue. I want to let all the hateful comments fly and give her a nice dose of her own medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot right now, though. Right now, all I want is a hot shower and to go to bed. Tomorrow can’t come fast enough. I’ll be back with Sean and out of this apartment that I suddenly hate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you cooking dinner?” I hear her call out behind me, making me roll my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say, before shutting my bedroom door and dropping my bag on the floor. I pull my phone out and scan for any messages. It’s been maybe three minutes since he left and I’m already checking them. This is going to be a long night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is. I toss and turn all night until my alarm finally goes off. I drag myself from the bed and slowly get ready, taking a little extra time to do my hair and apply some light make-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull out my favorite work dress, hoping it’ll give me some confidence. It’s violet and hugs my body, but it looks professional and comes down to my knees. I pair it with some caramel kitten heels. I smile as I look at myself in the mirror. I wonder if Sean will like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check my phone again and see no messages. Maybe he’s just crazy busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Miss you \u0026lt;3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the phone back in my purse, making sure the sound is on so I can hear it when he does respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally leave my room, I see Harper sitting at the breakfast bar eating a bowl of cereal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to be late,” she warns, shoving a spoonful into her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re fine. I’m just going to grab a muffin.” I go to the pantry, grab two, and toss them into my purse. I’ll eat them when I get to my desk. I reach for the coffee pot but see none has been made. I bite my tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make it every morning. She couldn’t do it this once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I hear my phone beep, I hurriedly grab it, but the message is just from the bank manager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve: I need you to close today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guessing lover boy isn’t texting you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I look over at her as she gets up to put her bowl in the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The look on your face when you got that text. Guessing it wasn’t him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s right, but I play it off. “No, just Steve telling me I need to close today.” I hate opening and closing, plus it’s going to cut into when Sean is picking me up. I should probably let him know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I have to work late. Pick me up at 7?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare down at the phone, willing him to text me back. Just a simple ‘okay’ would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We gotta go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving up, I drop the phone back into my purse again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me grab something and I’ll be ready.” I dart to my room, snatch a bag and put a few items in it. I might need to stay at Sean’s tonight and tomorrow. I dig through my drawer but can’t find any sexy underwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I could run out at lunch and get something. I wonder what Sean’s face would look like if I walked out of his bathroom in nothing but lingerie. Yeah, definitely going at lunch to find something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt still blows my mind how last week I couldn’t even think about walking around naked in front of anyone, and now here I am, openly baiting Sean with my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s him. How he treated me all weekend. I feel sexy and needed. He kissed every inch of my body like he couldn’t get enough of every part of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close the drawer, grab my bag, and meet an inpatient Harper at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk to the train in silence, and it isn’t until we board does she start in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to be checking your phone all day? It looks a little sad.” Her tone is mocking. Like I’m a poor little puppy that she wants to pat on the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you care?” Looking over at her, I raise my eyebrow. I don’t get what her problem is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m just saying. You had a weekend fling. Don’t count on it being more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know nothing about what Sean and I did this weekend. Or what it means.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at me like she feels sad for me, and it pisses me off. “Tessa, this is how men work. They fuck you all weekend, tell you how wonderful you are, how much they want you. Then bam, they’re gone. Weekend of fun over, and they’re on to the next.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m guessing that’s what Nick did to her, because she seems bitter. I don’t get why. If I were her, I’d be happy if Nick never called me again. Especially after how he treated her at the bar. No way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not like that,” I say defensively, hating that anyone would think Sean would be like that. He may look tough and a little scary, but he’s sweet. He’d never do anything to hurt me. He did what he told me he would do. Made me fall for him before the weekend was over. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thief-breeding-3/page-30.html","bookId":1798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:25 PM"}
