Tavore wants Sinn with them because no one else can stand against that child, no one else could hope to survive her power, for when Sinn awakens that power, as Kalyth said, there will be fire .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Adjunct warned of betrayal—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Brys, Gesler and Stormy are on the edge of ascendancy, and they can feel it. They’re both holding on for dear life—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Holding on to what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To their humanity,’ she replied. ‘Their fingers are numb, the muscles of their arms are screaming. Their nails are cracked and bleeding. Did you see how the boy watched them? The one named Grub? He stands beside Sinn like her conscience made manifest – it is truly outside her now. She could push it away, she could crush the life from it – I don’t know why she hasn’t already. For all the fire in her hands, her heart is cold as ice.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are you saying the boy has no power of his own?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot him a look. ‘Did the Adjunct speak of him? The boy?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarily, he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What did she say?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She said he was the hope of us all, and that in the end his power would – could – prove our salvation.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe searched his face. ‘Then, Brys, we are in trouble.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetrayal. When the face before us proves a lie, when the eyes deceive and hide the truths behind them. Will there be no end to such things?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought back to the seabed, as he knew he would. I have these names, deep inside me. The names of the fallen. I can hear each one, there with its own, unique voice. Yet so many sound the same, a cry of pain. Of … betrayal. So many, and so many times . ‘She trusts those two marines,’ he said. ‘She trusts them not to betray her. It’s all she has. It’s all she can hope for.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes,’ said Aranict. ‘And, worse than that, that Awl woman – Kalyth – who said she didn’t understand anything, well, she understands all too well. Like it or not, she holds the fate of the K’Chain Che’Malle in her hands. She is the Destriant to the Matron – do you imagine she trusts Sinn? With all their lives? With the Matron’s and all the other K’Chain Che’Malle? Hardly. She is in the same position as we are – it’s all down to Gesler and Stormy, and she is watching those two men fight for everything.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It must be breaking her heart.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She’s terrified, Brys. And so alone, so alone. With all that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed at his face. Their horses had slowed to a slow amble, directionless. Unaware, the standard-bearer had ridden on and was now closing on the column. At this distance, the standard looked like a white flag. ‘Aranict, what can we do?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No matter what happens,’ she said, ‘we must stand with them. With Gesler and Stormy, and Kalyth and the K’Chain Che’Malle. But if it comes down to who can we save, if we’re left with that awful choice, then … it must be the boy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Those two men are at each other’s throat – there must be—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, that . Brys, they are like brothers, those two. They’ll snap at each other, even come to blows. They’ll shout each other down, but things would be a lot worse if none of that was happening. What we saw was their humanity – the very thing they’re desperate to keep. That was all like … like a ritual. Of caring. Love, even.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As if married …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Brothers, I’d say. Bound by blood, bound by history. When we witness them argue, we only hear what’s said out loud – we don’t hear all the rest, the important stuff. Kalyth is only beginning to understand that – when she does, some of her terror and anxiety will go away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I hope you are right.’ Brys reined in, and then dismounted. He turned to observe the Bluerose lancers, waved them back to their flanking patrol. To Aranict he said, ‘Let us walk. The vanguard will survive without me a while longer, I’m sure.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see her curiosity, but she shrugged and slipped down from her horse. Leading their mounts, they began walking, parallel to the column.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My love,’ said Brys, ‘I have known a silence deeper – and more crushing – than anyone could imagine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You need not speak of it—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, you are wrong. But what I must tell you is more than finding a new intimacy between us, though that will be part of it. What I will describe is important – it bears on what you have just said, and – with your help – I hope it will guide us to a course of action. Tell me, what do you know of my death?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-138.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
