He knew that what the young man said was the truth. He could defy the other party’s orders, but the value of five Herkula corpses was indeed great.

Wander about this place. Either way, it is still quite some time before I must return.” After speaking, the young man leapt out of the window. He spread his arms in the sky, his clothes that were opened wide fluttering in the wind like two black wings. While relying on this negligible air resistance, he unexpectedly flew further and further into the night like a bat under the moon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe red-robed warrior was left without a choice.

After reading the message delivered by the Tungus Warhawk through this bit of light, the Red Duke’s brows immediately creased. He remained silent, handing over the message to a red-robed warrior moving beside the giant wolf. After giving the secret message a single look, he released a low cry of alarm. “Four warriors dying in battle?! Isn’t Kakremi also there?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Correct. It seems like a large amount of never before seen strange creatures appeared in the pyramid, all of the red-robed warriors that died falling under their claws. Kakremi has also said that those wolf-like fellas give him a similar feeling to the temple’s Herkula.” The Red Duke said with a dull tone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This really is hard to believe.” The red robed warrior leader said with a sullen tone. He read the secret message several times, and only then did he pat the giant wolf the Red Duke was sitting on, saying, “Herkula might not be the most powerful, but it is the most successful weapon the temple has produced for many years. Moreover, after three-fold strengthening, I don’t believe that there are any biological weapons of similar size that can compare to our Herkula. However, a single red-robed warrior can defeat ten Herkula! That is why I still think this is absurd.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Kakremi won’t lie on these types of matters.
