Yesterday morning, on my way back from the hunt, I ran into the little girl from next door in the entrance. I didn\u0027t even dare say hello, my fangs had already sprouted. And last night, when I felt the Call summoning the boy ... I almost joined the vampires.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe owl was looking into my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why do you think the boss gave me the job?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stuffed dummy. Clumps of dusty feathers stuffed with cotton wool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So I could see things through their eyes?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang in the hallway. I sighed and shrugged: it was her own fault, after all, anyone would be better to talk to than this boring bird. I switched the light on as I walked to the door and opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding there in the doorway was a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come in, Kostya,\u0027 I said, \u0027come in.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated at the door, but then came in. He ran his hand through his hair – I noticed that his palms were sweaty and his eyes restless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKostya\u0027s only seventeen. He was born a vampire, a perfectly ordinary city vampire. It\u0027s really tough: with vampire parents a child has almost no chance of growing up human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve brought back the CDs,\u0027 Kostya muttered. \u0027Here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the pile from the boy, not even surprised there were so many. I usually had to nag him for ages to bring them back: he was terribly absentminded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Did you listen to them all?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Did you copy any?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No ... I\u0027ll be going . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wait.\u0027 I grabbed him by the shoulder and pushed him into the room. \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You already know?\u0027 I asked, beginning to catch on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There aren\u0027t many of us, Anton,\u0027 said Kostya, looking me in the eye. \u0027When one of us passes away, we sense it immediately.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay. Take your shoes off, let\u0027s go into the kitchen and have a serious talk.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKostya didn\u0027t argue. But I was desperately trying to figure out what to do. Five years earlier, when I became an Other and the Twilight side of the world was revealed to me, I\u0027d made plenty of surprising discoveries. And one of the most shocking was the fact that a family of vampires was living right above my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember it like it was yesterday. I was on my way home from classes that seemed so ordinary, they reminded me of my old college. Three double lectures, a lecturer, heat that had the white coats glued to our bodies – we rented the lecture hall from a medical college. I was fooling around as I walked home, dropping into the Twilight in short bursts – I couldn\u0027t manage any longer back then. Then I began feeling out the people walking down the street, and at the entrance I ran into my neighbours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re really nice people. I wanted to borrow a drill from them once, and Kostya\u0027s father, Gennady, he\u0027s a builder, just came round and had some fun helping out with the concrete walls, demonstrating conclusively that the intelligentsia can\u0027t survive without the proletariat . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now suddenly I could see they weren\u0027t humans at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was terrifying. The brownish-grey auras, the hideous pressure. I stopped dead, staring at them in horror. Polina, Kostya\u0027s mother, looked surprised, the boy froze and turned his face away. But the head of the family walked towards me, moving deeper into the Twilight as he came, walking with the elegant stride that only vampires, alive and dead at the same time, have. The Twilight is their natural habitat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hello, Anton,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world around me was grey and dead. I\u0027d dived into the Twilight after him without even noticing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I knew you\u0027d cross the barrier some day,\u0027 he said. \u0027Everything\u0027s okay.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a step back – and Gennady\u0027s face quivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Everything\u0027s okay,\u0027 he said. He opened his shirt and I saw the registration tag, a blue imprint on the grey skin. \u0027We\u0027re all registered. Polina! Kostya!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wife also crossed into the Twilight and unfastened her blouse. The boy didn\u0027t move and it took a stern glance from his father to get him to show his blue seal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I have to check,\u0027 I whispered. My passes were clumsy, I lost track twice and had to start again. Finally the seal responded. \u0027Permanent registration, no known violations . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is everything okay?\u0027 asked Gennady. \u0027Can we go now?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t worry about it. We knew you\u0027d become an Other some day.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Go on,\u0027 I said. It was against the rules, but that was the last thing I was bothered about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes . . .\u0027 Gennady paused for a moment before he left the Twilight. \u0027I\u0027ve been in your home . . . Anton, I return to you your invitation to enter . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was just as it should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked away and I sat down on a bench, beside an old granny warming herself in the sunshine. I lit a cigarette, trying to sort out my thoughts. The granny looked at me and said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nice people, aren\u0027t they, Arkasha?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was always getting my name wrong. She only had two or three months left to live, I could see that quite clearly now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not exactly . . .\u0027 I said. I smoked three cigarettes, then trudged off into the building. I stood in the doorway for a moment, watching the grey \u0027vampire\u0027s trail\u0027 fade away. I\u0027d just learned how to see it that very day . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moped into the evening. I leafed through my notes, which meant I had to withdraw into the Twilight. In the ordinary world, the pages of those standard exercise books were a pure, unsullied white. I wanted to call our group\u0027s supervisor or the boss himself – I was his personal responsibility. But I felt I had to make the decision myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was dark I couldn\u0027t stand it any longer. I went up to the next floor and rang the bell. When Kostya opened the door, he shuddered. But he actually looked perfectly ordinary, like all of his family . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Call your parents, will you?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What for?\u0027 he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I want to invite you all for tea.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGennady appeared behind his son\u0027s back, out of nowhere, he was far more skilful than me, the newly fledged adept of the Light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you sure, Anton?\u0027 he asked doubtfully. \u0027There\u0027s no need. Everything\u0027s okay.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused and then shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ll come round tomorrow. If you invite us. Don\u0027t rush things.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy midnight I was feeling absolutely delighted they\u0027d refused. At three I tried to get to sleep, reassured in the knowledge that they couldn\u0027t enter my home and never would be able to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, still not having slept a wink, I stood at the window, looking out at the city. There weren\u0027t many vampires. Very few, in fact. There wasn\u0027t another within a radius of two or three kilometres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did it feel to be an outcast? To be punished, not for committing a crime, but for the potential ability to commit it? And how did it feel for them to live . . . well, not live, some other word was required here . . . alongside their own guard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way back from classes I bought a cake for tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now here was Kostya, a fine, intelligent young man, a physics student at Moscow University, who had the misfortune to have been born a living corpse, sitting beside me and raking the spoon around in the sugar bowl like he was too shy to take any. What could have made him so bashful?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first he used to call round almost every day. I was his direct opposite, I was on the side of the Light. But I let him into my home, and he didn\u0027t have to pretend with me. He could simply sit and talk, or he could plunge into the Twilight and boast about the new abilities he\u0027d developed. \u0027Anton, I actually transformed!\u0027 – \u0027And now my fangs have started to grow, r-r-r-r!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the strange thing was, it all felt entirely normal. I laughed as I watched the young vampire\u0027s attempts to transform himself into a bat – that\u0027s a trick for a top-flight vampire, but he\u0027s not one of them and, may the Light grant, he never will be. Just sometimes I would scold him: \u0027Kostya . . . you mustn\u0027t ever do that. Do you understand?\u0027 And that felt entirely normal too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Kostya, I was only doing my job.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You shouldn\u0027t have.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They were breaking the law. Do you understand? Not just our law, mind you. It\u0027s not just the Light Ones who have accepted it, all the Others have. That vampire—\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I knew him,\u0027 Kostya suddenly said. \u0027He was a laugh. Did he suffer?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No.\u0027 I shook my head. \u0027The seal kills instantaneously.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKostya shuddered and squinted down at his own chest for a second. If you enter the Twilight, you can see the seal even through a vampire\u0027s clothes, and if you don\u0027t, you\u0027ll never find it. I don\u0027t think he actually moved across. But how should I know what the seal feels like to a vampire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What was I supposed to do?\u0027 I asked. \u0027He\u0027d already killed. Killed innocent people, who had absolutely no defence against him. He initiated a girl ... by crude force – she should never have become a vampire. Yesterday he almost killed a boy. Just for the sake of it. Not because he was hungry.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you know what our hunger\u0027s like?\u0027 Kostya asked after a pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was growing up. Right in front of my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. Yesterday I . . . almost became a vampire.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a moment\u0027s silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know. I could feel it ... I was hoping.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. While I was conducting my hunt, they\u0027d been hunting me too. Or rather, lying in ambush for me, hoping the hunter would turn into the hunted beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027Sorry, no way.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay, so he was guilty,\u0027 Kostya went on stubbornly. \u0027But why did you have to kill him? He should have been tried. A tribunal, a lawyer, a proper charge, the way the law says things should be done . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The law says that humans mustn\u0027t be involved in our business!\u0027 I roared. And for the first time that tone of voice failed to make any impression on Kostya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You were human for too long,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And I don\u0027t regret it for a moment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why did you kill him?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If I hadn\u0027t, he would have killed me!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Initiated you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s even worse.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKostya didn\u0027t answer. He put down his tea and stood up. A perfectly ordinary, slightly insolent and morally pained young man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that he was a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wait.\u0027 I stepped across to the fridge. \u0027Take this, they issued it to me, but I didn\u0027t need it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out the two-hundred-gram bottles of donor\u0027s blood from between the bottles of Borzhomi mineral water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No thanks.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Kostya, I know this is always a problem for you. It\u0027s no use to me. Take it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you trying to bribe me?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-6.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
