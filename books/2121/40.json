My God, what has happened here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You set this up. Don\u0027t play the innocent. We all know what you really are, Croatan.\" Mimi spat, shooting him a look of pure disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize it is hard for you to believe, but I have only just managed to escape from a rather nasty stasis spell myself,\" he said sourly. \"I went to pick up Alfonso for our usual golf game, and the next thing I know I\u0027m trapped in the back of my own car. As soon as I extricated myself I came down here to warn the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi sniffed. A fine story Kingsley was telling her. Playing the victim once again. Yeah, right, he\u0027d been detained. When it would have been so easy for him to leave the house from the back and come in the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what would he gain by keeping her alive? Why didn\u0027t he just finish it off? Gut her throat and be done with it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Lawrence?\" Kingsley coughed as several explosions shook the ground beneath them. \"I tried sending him a message, but I couldn\u0027t find him in the glom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not here,\" Mimi said, noticing that Kingsley had lowered his dagger. She could kill him now, while he was unguarded. But what if he was telling the truth? Or was his act just another part of the trap?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could make a decision, there was a crash, and Forsyth Llewellyn appeared. He was carrying the limp body of his wife. His clothes were singed, and he sported a deep gash on his forehead. So he had survived as well. Mimi felt a little better. Maybe there were more survivors. But where had the Silver Bloods gone? After she had felled Nan Cutler, the rest of them seemed to have disappeared in the smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone else is dead,\" Mimi told Forsyth. \"You and I are the only ones left. I saw Edmund fall, Dashiell, Cushing...everyone. The Regent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nan\u0027s dead?\" Forsyth Llewellyn asked, aghast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was one of them,\" Mimi told him, her eyes watering from the smoke. \"I killed her myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon, we\u0027ve got to get out of here,\" Kingsley said, suddenly pulling the two of them out of the doorway, which crashed to the ground in flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Kingsley wanted her dead, he sure wasn\u0027t acting like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" she said, tucking her sword - again the size of a needle - back into her bag, which she miraculously found she was still holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley didn\u0027t reply, his face hardening as he looked above her shoulder. Meanwhile, Forsyth Llewellyn looked utterly lost, sitting in the middle of the street with his head in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi turned to where Kingsley was looking. The grand eighteenth-century villa was now a giant black fireball. It was a crematorium. The Silver Bloods were back. And they had struck deep into the heart of the Coven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Second Great War had begun. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-40.html","bookId":2121,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM"}
