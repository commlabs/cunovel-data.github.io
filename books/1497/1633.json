Its aura appeared as though it intended to destroy the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan had a solemn expression as he stared at the chaotic battleground. A flicker was present in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone present had underestimated the strength of the Di tier embryonic pill. Originally Zhu Kun thought that with both Gu Yuan and him cooperating, they should be able to subdue it within a short period of time. After exchanging blows, however, he finally discovered that he was too optimistic. Additionally, with Hun Taindi and the Nihility Devouring Flame entering the body, both parties ended up interrupting each other during the critical junctures. In this way, it had allowed the situation to become even more chaotic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, this kind of chaos worked both ways. Zhu Kun and Gu Yuan might be unable to successfully subdue the Di tier embryonic pill but Hun Tiandi and the Nihility Devouring Flame did not have the opportunity to do so either. The Nihility Devouring Flame, whose strength was the weakest amongst the four of them, had even been attacked by both Zhu Kun and Gu Yuan for a couple of times. If it was not because of Hun Tiandi aiding him, it was likely that he would have already been injured…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fighting in this manner is not the solution…” Yan Jin frowned and commented softly as he looked at the chaotic battleground in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan laughed bitterly upon hearing this. They were no longer able to intervene in the battle at that place. If they were to forcefully enter, they would only end up being injured by the extermination force. Hence, they could only simply stand here and stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Jin shook his head helplessly after seeing the bitter smile on Xiao Yan’s face. He also understood that they were unable to do anything now…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Di tier embryonic pill had an icy expression in front of everyone’s eyes. He flipped his hand. There was a vague rich pill fragrance surging in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do not inhale the pill fragrance!” Xiao Yan hurriedly cried out. He was suddenly startled after sniffing this mysterious pill fragrance. Under the scent of the pill fragrance, it seemed that even his Dou Qi was about to ignite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone hurriedly halted their breath after hearing Xiao Yan’s cry. Fortunately, this pill fragrance did not target them. Hence, the Dou Qi within their bodies became violent for a moment before it gradually calmed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Di Pill Palm!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Di tier medicinal pill in the sky suddenly opened both of his eyes. His body suddenly rose into the air. Finally, his palm was pressed onto the four people below. The moment it did so, a human head sized brilliant light cluster suddenly appeared!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang bang bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe energy of this place seemed to have met with a hot boiling oil as it was suddenly ignited. At a glance, the seemingly endless sky was covered with a fierce flame. The entire place had become like a furnace at this moment!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Gu Yuan’s group had a drastic change in expression after seeing the might of this palm from the Di tier embryonic pill. The Dou Qi within his body was hurriedly maneuvered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Di tier medicinal pill had an even denser icy expression. Both of his hands were suddenly pressed downwards. Immediately, the flame in the sky swiftly whistled downwards at a shocking speed. Within a short instant, the endless flame spreading across the sky had actually entered into brilliant light cluster in the Di tier embryonic pill’s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Extinguish!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of his hands were pressed downwards and the entire place became dark. Only the light cluster in the palm of the Di tier medicinal pill was emitting an extermination like light. The light cluster shook. Finally, it came whistling downwards. Within a short moment, it had already arrived just above the heads of Gu Yuan’s four men group!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roar!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Gu Yuan’s group could sense an extremely rich danger in the face of such a terrifying attack. Vast and mighty endless Dou Qi surged out in usion and swiftly formed an extremely powerful defence!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light cluster heavily smashed onto the Dou Qi defence above the four individuals. A earthshaking loud sound appeared as an extermination ripple overflowed. Four miserable figures fell from the sky and violently landed on the plains. They smashed onto the ground and formed deep crack lines that was a hundred thousand feet in size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone’s expression changed drastically after seeing this scene. No one expected that this Di tier embryonic pill would actually be able to fight against four experts who had reached the nine star Dou Sheng class!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough these four people were divided into two parties which were scheming against each other, they were after all the peak level experts in this world. It was unexpected that they were still beaten into such a state by the Di tier medicinal pill despite them joining hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Di tier embryonic pill floated in the sky. His eyes were icy cold as he stared at the few hundred thousand feet gullies on the plain below. The four figures rose into the air in a somewhat miserable manner. They divided into two group and looked at each other from a distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All of you are still lacking if you wish to refine me.” The Di tier embryonic pill glanced at those four and spoke in a faint voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hee hee, isn’t it too early for you to be happy?’ The Di tier embryonic pill’s words had only just sounded when the Nihility Devouring Flame suddenly laughed coldly. After which, he turned his head to look at Hun Tiandi before speaking in a deep voice, “Hand me the Tou She Ancient God Jade!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHun Tiandi was startled upon hearing this. He hesitated for a moment before decisively taking out the Tou She Ancient God Jade and handing it to the Nihility Devouring Flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nihility Devouring Flame gave the Di tier medicinal pill a dense smile as he grabbed the Tou She Ancient God Jade. He spat out a mouthful of black blood containing some black flame and shot it onto the ancient jade. Both of his hands also began to suddenly form many strange seals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was startled after seeing the sudden action of the Nihility Devouring Flame. He stared at the latter’s hand seals and felt that they were somewhat familiar. After musing for an instant, he suddenly lifted his head and looked at the hundred thousand feet large Ancient God stone statue. The seal that the stone statue hands had formed was exactly the same as that of the Nihility Devouring Flame!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hum hum!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tou She Ancient God Jade in front of the Nihility Devouring Flame began to hum and tremble as the latter’s hand seals were rapidly formed. Soon after, a cluster of gentle light spread. The ancient jade shook and turned into a brilliant light cluster!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light cluster had many colours. There seemed to be a flame dancing within it, giving it an extremely mysterious appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Transforming Pill Ring! How is it possible that you know how to use the Tou She Ancient God’s Transforming Pill Divine Skill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe originally icy cold face of the Di tier medicinal pill suddenly changed after seeing the light ring being formed. Even his voice had become a little sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nihility Devouring Flame laughed coldly. However, he did not explain. His hand was swung and a brilliant light shot out. Within a short instant, it had appeared above theDi tier embryonic pill. Circular brilliant light surfaced and enveloped the body of the Du tier embryonic pill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith these flame light clusters continuously wrapping around the body of the Di tier medicinal pill, traces of white smoke suddenly rose from within the latter. Miserable screech suddenly sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nihility Devouring Flame’s eyes were a little startled. Clearly, he did not expect this Transforming Pill Ring to be able to restrain the Di tier medicinal pill. The flames on the latter’s body became a lot fiercer and the body of the Di tier embryonic pill slowly began to shrink. It actually showed traces of turning into a medicinal pill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing this Di tier medicinal pill, who was originally acting mightily, suddenly became so miserable, everyone’s expression quickly paled. Their bodies flashed and they directly rushed towards the Nihility Devouring Flame. From the looks of it, the reason that the Nihility Devouring Flame was able to use the Transforming Pill Ring was most likely due to the Tou She Ancient God Jade!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Humph!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHun Tiandi, who was prepared, immediately let out a cold snort as he saw the two acted. His body moved and appeared in front of the two. With a flick of his finger? A couple of medicinal pills containing rich medicinal fragrance shot towards Gu Yuan duo before suddenly exploding apart!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air churned. Even Gu Yuan’s and Zhu Kun’s body were forcefully dragged down. They coldly laughed, “Exploding tier 9 Treasure Pill. How grand!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them appeared on both sides of Hun Tiandi after their voices sounded. Sharp attacks were unleashed, encompassing Hun Tiandi in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boom boom!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHun Tiandi immediately fell into a disadvantage in the face of Gu Yuan’s and Zhu Kun’s combined attack. He appeared quite miserable as he advanced and retreat. However, he also understood the current situation. Hence, he clenched his teeth and unleashed his full strength in order to do his best to hold back Gu Yuan duo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get lost!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis pestering like fight caused a ferocity to surge into Zhu Kun’s eyes. One could see him suddenly letting out a low roar. A couple of huge dragons, which seemed to have occupied hundreds of thousands of feet in the sky, suddenly appeared. The huge dragon turned into a purple-gold light that smashed onto Hun Tiandi, who had just forcefully received a blow from Hun Tiandi with lightning like speed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grug!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBright purple-gold light directly penetrated through the powerful defence on the surface of Hun Tiandi’s body. It ruthlessly smashed onto his physical body. Immediately, a mouthful of fresh blood was spat out from Hun Tiandi’s mouth. His body staggered as he flew backwards by tens of thousands of feet. Only then did he miserably stabilized his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shrink!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nihility Devouring Flame let out a stern cry as Hun Tiandi withdrew. The Di tier embryonic pill was collected inside the Transforming Pill Ring without resistance. It turned into a brilliant light cluster the size of a human head and was suspended within the Transforming Pill Ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nihility Devouring Flame rejoiced upon seeing this scene. He beckoned with his hand and the Transforming Pill Ring flew towards him with lightning like speed. However, the Transforming Pill Ring was about to land in his hand when a figure suddenly appeared in front of him and grabbed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sudden unexpected change caused the Nihility Devouring Flame to be startled. His eyes looked at the messy haired Hun Tiandi in front of him and his eyes flickered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hand over the Di tier medicinal pill. Given your current condition, even with the Help of the Nihility Devouring Flame, you are no match for us.” Gu Yuan’s expression was gloomy as he looked at Hun Tiandi and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Kun by the side also slowly clenched his fist. His face was ferocious as he stared at Hun Tiandi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want the Di tier embryonic pill?” Hun Tiandi wiped off the trace of blood from the corner of his mouth. He tilted his head to look at the brilliant light cluster in the Pill Transforming Ring. The cluster of light was like a silver river. The energy of the world seemed to be gathered inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange smile suddenly surfaced on Hun Tiandi’s face as he stared at the brilliant cluster of light. After which, he suddenly widened his mouth in front of everyone’s shocked eyes and swallowed that brilliant light cluster!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had actually directly swallowed the Di tier embryonic pill into his body. This method of swallowing was suicidal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This fellow is crazy…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan muttered to himself. Although this was only a Di tier embryonic pill, the energy that it contained was extremely frightening. If one was careless, one’s body and even one’s soul would end up exploding from being too full!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis action of Hun Tiandi really seemed to be putting all his eggs in one basket!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1632\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1634\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1633","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:55 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:55 AM"}
