She used to be a guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate’s eyes bug out of her head. “Wow. You’d never know it, looking at her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen her gaze falls on me. Thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I ask, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes shine. At me. For me. “Nothing. I just…I love you, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. “I’m a loveable guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs. And brings her palm to my cheek, smacking it softly. “And slappable—definitely a slappable guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kinky. We should explore that further, later on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckles again and kisses me softly. Then she pulls back and hooks her thumb towards the dance floor. “You want to dance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m almost offended. “The Electric Slide? I don’t think so.” Not that I have anything against dancing. Some guys will tell you it’s effeminate but I’m not one of them. Today’s dancing is practically sex with your clothes on, dry humping in a room full of people. And I’m definitely into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Too cool for the Electric Slide?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I am. Besides, Steven has the monopoly on group dances.” I point over to where my brother-in-law is burning up the dance floor, at the head of the pack with Mackenzie at his side. “He also does a mean funky chicken.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate cracks up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few hours later, we’re all walking out to the private parking garage together. My tie’s gone, the top three buttons of my shirt open. I’m holding Kate’s hand, which is lost in the arm of my tuxedo jacket that she’s wearing like a teenaged girl after the prom. Steven carries a sleeping Mackenzie on his shoulder, while Alexandra adjusts her dress with one hand and holds her shoes in the other. Matthew and Delores are already outside, saying their final goodbyes to the departing guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he spots us, Matthew comes jogging up. His face is nervous—and remorseful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drew…I didn’t know, man. I’m really sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubs the back of his neck and his eyes slide to my car, parked a few feet away at ground level, clearly visible under the garage light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s when I see it. Or more to the point—that’s when I see the words that have been carved into her hood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, no, no, no…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumble forward and fall to my knees beside my baby. I rub over the words, trying to erase the gouges with my hand. Then I yell over my shoulder at Delores, “You heartless monster! How could you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn back to my car and whisper soothingly, “It’ll be okay. I’ll get the best body guy in the city. It’ll be like it never happened. No one will ever know you were scarred.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the upper level I hear Billy Warren’s wail of anguish, and I know Delores got to his new truck, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel your pain, Douche Bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeisurely, Delores strolls over. She looks down at me, eyes mocking, one fingerless-lace-gloved hand on her hip. “Pull any shit like that again and I’ll carve it into your f**king forehead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she smiles cheerily. “Night, everyone. Thank you for being a part of our special day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she disappears into the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel bad for Matthew’s Guardian Angel. He’s going to be working overtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Cause I’m pretty sure my best friend just married a demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE END \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/holy-frigging-matrimony-a-tangled-series-short-story-tangled-1-5/page-5.html","bookId":1812,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:13 PM"}
