You were rank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brodick\u0027s gonna think you\u0027re pretty, but you know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t tell you so. Do you want him to think you\u0027re pretty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not particularly,\" she answered, her mind clearly on more important matters. \"We can\u0027t wait any longer, Alec. We\u0027re going to have to go on alone. Finish your food, and then we\u0027ll leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you don\u0027t want Brodick to think you\u0027re pretty, how come you put on your pretty green clothes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. Alec asked the most outrageous questions. Inconsequential matters seemed to be extremely important to him, and he wouldn\u0027t let up until she gave him what he considered an adequate answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I put on these clothes because my other gown was dirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took another bite of bread while he thought about her answer, and then said, \"You know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held on to her patience. \"No, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re gonna be afraid of Brodick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Cause ladies are always afraid of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I won\u0027t be afraid,\" she insisted. \"Stop talking now and finish your food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded on the door, and Gillian stood up just as Waldo, the older Hathaway, rushed inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got trouble, milady,\" he blurted out. \"The MacDonald soldier… the one I gave the message to…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frantically nodded. \"He must have told the other MacDonalds you Were here, because there\u0027s over thirty of them coming across the meadow below. They\u0027re all wearing the same colors as Henley, but I didn\u0027t see him among the soldiers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" she replied. \"I didn\u0027t tell Henley about Alec. Why would his clan come here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking they\u0027re here to claim you, milady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was startled by the suggestion and shook her head. \"But they can\u0027t claim me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaldo looked bleak and weary. \"They do things different in these parts,\" he told her. \"If they want something, they take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed Alec\u0027s hand and pulled him to his feet. \"We\u0027re leaving now. Waldo, get your brother and meet us at the horses. Hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, milady,\" Waldo protested. \"There\u0027s more to the telling. There\u0027s another clan on the opposite side of the meadow riding hard toward the MacDonalds. I don\u0027t know for certain who they are, but I\u0027m thinking they must be the Buchanans you sent for. There\u0027s nine of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s Brodick and his soldiers, then they\u0027re pitifully outnumbered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, milady, it\u0027s the MacDonalds I pity. I ain\u0027t never seen the like of these warriors. They\u0027re ferocious looking, and I could see by the way the MacDonalds were backing away, they fear them. If there\u0027s blood shed this day, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to be a Buchanan doing the bleeding. Are you certain you want to put yourself and the boy in the hands of such savages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what to think, and she was in such a panic inside, her heart felt as if it might stop. \"I hope it is Brodick and his men,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec was struggling to get away from her so he could go outside and watch the fight, but she tightened her hold on him and wouldn\u0027t let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waldo, you and Henry should leave now before they get here. I thank you for all you\u0027ve done for Alec and me. Hurry now, before you\u0027re seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaldo shook his head. \"My brother and I will not leave until we are assured you will fare well, milady. We\u0027ll stand guard at the door. The soldiers will have to kill us before they can get to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t dissuade him from what he considered a noble undertaking. As soon as he went back outside, she turned to Alec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what Brodick looks like,\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He looks like Brodick,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what exactly does he look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"He\u0027s big,\" he whispered. Then he smiled because he\u0027d thought of something else he could add. \"And old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Terrible old,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t believe him. \"What color is his hair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"White.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"And you know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart had sunk to her stomach. \"No, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t hear too good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to sit down. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me Brodick was an old man before I sent the message that I was his bride? The shock could have sent him to his grave.\" She jumped back up and pulled Alec along. \"We\u0027re leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about the Buchanans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s apparent the other clan in the meadow isn\u0027t Brodick\u0027s. Waldo would have told me if any of the warriors had been old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go look. I can tell you if it\u0027s the Buchanans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaldo opened the door and shouted, \"The MacDonalds have taken off, milady, and the other clan is coming this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian grabbed Alec by the shoulders and forced him to look at her. \"I want you to hide behind that stone font until I find out who these men are. I don\u0027t want you to say a word, Alec. Promise me… please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise me,\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I come out if it\u0027s Brodick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until I\u0027ve talked to him and gained his promise that he\u0027ll help both of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said. \"I promise I\u0027ll be quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so pleased to get his cooperation she kissed him on his cheek. He immediately wiped it away with the back of his hand and squirmed when she hugged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re always kissing me,\" he complained with a wide grin that told her he really didn\u0027t mind. \"Just like my mama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go hide,\" she said as she led him to the back of the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took hold of her left arm, and she grimaced in reaction. The injury from the knife wounds still hadn\u0027t healed, and from the way it was throbbing, she knew it was infected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had seen her flinch. \"You need my mama\u0027s medicine,\" he whispered. \"Then you\u0027d feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure I would,\" she replied. \"Now, Alec, not one word,\" she cautioned. \"No matter what happens, you stay put and don\u0027t make a sound. May I have the dagger Brodick gave you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it\u0027s yours. I would just like to borrow it,\" she assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed the dagger to her, but as she turned to walk away, he whispered, \"It\u0027s awful dark here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here with you, so there isn\u0027t any need to be afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear them coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do too,\" she whispered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gillian, are you scared?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Now, be quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rushed down the center aisle and stood in front of the altar to wait. A moment later she heard Waldo shouting the order to halt. The command was obviously ignored because a second later the door flew open, and there in the center of the arch stood the most intimidating warrior she had ever seen. He was a towering figure with long, flaxen hair and deeply tanned skin. Barely covered, he wore only a muted plaid that didn\u0027t quite reach the tops of his knees. A wide strip of the cloth angled over his massive and scarred chest and draped down over his left shoulder. A dirk protruded from one of his deerskin boots, but he didn\u0027t carry a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man hadn\u0027t even stepped inside the church yet, but she was already quaking in her shoes. The sheer size of him blocked out most of the sun, though streaks of golden light shone all around him, making him appear almost ethereal. She gripped the dagger behind her back, and after slipping it into the sleeve of her gown, she slowly brought her hands forward and folded them in an attempt to fool him into believing she was thoroughly composed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior stood immobile for several seconds, his gaze searching for any threat that might be lurking in the corners, and when he was convinced she was all alone, he ducked under the doorframe, stepped inside, and slammed the door shut behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick strode down the aisle, shaking the rafters of the little church with each hard step as specks of dust rained down from the ceiling. Gillian valiantly held her ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlessedly, when he was just a couple of feet away, he stopped, then clasped his hands behind his back and insolently studied her, his gaze moving from the top of her head to her feet and then back again. He took his sweet time, and after he had finished his rude inspection, he kept his eyes locked on hers and waited for her to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had planned for this moment and had rehearsed exactly what she would say to him. She would begin by introducing herself because that was the polite thing to do, and then she would ask him his name. He would tell her he was Brodick, but she wouldn\u0027t believe him until he had proven his identity by answering several questions she had cleverly come up with, a test, actually, to determine that she could trust him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAye, she was going to be clever with her questioning, and just as soon as she could calm down, she would begin. The way he was looking at her was unnerving, and she was having difficulty coming up with a single thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quickly grew impatient. \"Are you the woman claiming to be my bride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anger in his voice heated her face. She felt herself blush with mortification. \"Yes, I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was surprised by her honesty. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t usually…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Usually what?\" he asked, wondering why she was so nervous. His stance was relaxed, his hands were clasped behind his back, and he had given Dylan his sword before coming into the church. Surely she realized he wasn\u0027t going to do her any harm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t usually lie,\" she explained, thrilled that she could remember what she was talking about. Staring at his chin helped, for his eyes were too intense. \"You aren\u0027t old.\" She blurted out the thought and then smiled. \"I was told you were very old,\" she whispered, \"… with white hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she laughed, convincing Brodick she was out of her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe I should start all over. My name is Lady Gillian, and I really am sorry I lied, but claiming to be your bride was the only way I could think of to get you to travel such a long distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"The distance wasn\u0027t great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t?\" she asked in surprise. \"Then, pray tell, why did it take you so long to get here? We\u0027ve been waiting in this church for a very long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We?\" he asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we,\" she replied. \"The Hathaway brothers… the two guards outside the door… and I have been waiting all that time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why were you so certain I\u0027d show up at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Curiosity,\" she answered. \"And I was right, wasn\u0027t I? That\u0027s why you came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hint of a smile softened his expression. \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"I wanted to meet the woman who dared such audacity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are Brodick… I mean to say, you are Laird Buchanan, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face lit up with relief. Damn, but she was pretty. The messenger hadn\u0027t lied about her appeal, Brodick thought. If anything, Henley had understated her beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to test you to make certain you really were Brodick, but one look at you convinces me. I was told, you see, that your glare could part a tree trunk, and from the way you\u0027re scowling at me, I do believe you could do it. You\u0027re quite intimidating, but you know that, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t show any reaction to her remarks. \"What is it you want from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want… no, I need,\" she qualified, \"your help. I have a very valuable treasure with me and I need assistance getting it home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t there any Englishmen who could come to your aid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s complicated, Laird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Start at the beginning,\" he suggested, surprised by his own willingness to extend this meeting. Her voice appealed to him; it was soft, lyrical, yet husky and sensual, as sensual as the woman herself. Brodick was conditioned to keeping his thoughts hidden, and for that reason he was certain she didn\u0027t have any idea of the effect she was having on him. Her wonderful scent was a clear distraction. It was very feminine and smelled faintly of flowers, which he found both alluring and arousing. He had to fight the urge to move closer to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This should explain everything you need to know,\" she said as she slowly removed the dagger and sheath from her sleeve and held it up for him to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reacted with lightning speed. Before she could even guess his intent, he\u0027d snatched the dagger out of her hand, grabbed hold of her injured arm, and jerked her forcefully toward him. Towering over her, he demanded, \"Where did you get this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will explain,\" she cried out. \"But please let go of me. You\u0027re hurting me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears in her eyes confirmed her words. Brodick immediately let go of her and stepped back. \"Now explain,\" he demanded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I borrowed the dagger,\" she said, and then she turned and called out, \"Alec, you may come out now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick had never been so close to losing his composure. When the Maitland boy came running toward him, he felt his knees buckle and his heart lodge in his throat. He was too stunned to say a word, and then Alec threw himself into his arms. Brodick\u0027s hands shook as he lifted him up and clasped him to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little boy wrapped his arms around his protector\u0027s neck and hugged him. \"I knew you would come. I told Gillian you would help us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are well, Alec?\" he asked, his voice trembling with emotion. He turned to Gillian questioning her with his eyes, but she was watching Alec with a soft, motherly smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer him, Alec,\" she instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child leaned back in Brodick\u0027s arms and nodded. \"I\u0027m very well, Uncle. The lady, she took good care of me. She gave me her food to eat and went hungry when there wasn\u0027t enough for both of us, and you know what? She wouldn\u0027t let nobody hurt me, not even when the man wanted to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick stared at Gillian while Alec chattered away, but nodded when the little boy had finished his explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will tell me exactly what happened,\" he told Gillian. It wasn\u0027t a question but a statement of fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she agreed. \"I\u0027ll tell you everything.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-14.html","bookId":1843,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM"}
