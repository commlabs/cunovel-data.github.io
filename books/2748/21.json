Mr. Solomon and Aunt Abby followed my roommate outside and closed the door as my mother stepped closer. \"Don\u0027t worry about Macey, Cam.\" But it wasn\u0027t a soothing phrase. It was an order. \"The Secret Service is very good at what they do. For all our differences, my sister is very, very good at what she does. I do not want you worrying about Macey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I,\" I said. And in that moment, I really did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you were in the compartment.\" Macey\u0027s voice sliced through the Hall of History. Down in the Grand Hall, girls were eating, people were gossiping, but Macey just sat on the top step looking into the foyer as if she didn\u0027t have the strength to stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t hear you or anything,\" she went on as I walked closer. \"It was just a…feeling.\" Then she looked at me. \"You know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said, and I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The top sleeping compartment was hanging too low, and the magazine on the bench had shifted, and I just…knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she looked at me. \"I\u0027m good at this, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When your mom called me in, I thought… I thought she was gonna kick me out.\" She shrugged a little. \"Usually that\u0027s when I get kicked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve seen Macey without makeup and in her fat jeans. I\u0027ve heard what she says in her sleep and seen the way her lips move when she\u0027s reading and the words just won\u0027t sink in. I know Macey McHenry, but that night, sitting on that staircase, I realized I\u0027d never know what it\u0027s like to be her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe McHenrys have five houses, but this is Macey\u0027s only home. She\u0027s the most famous daughter in America, but Liz and Bex and I are her only family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one\u0027s gonna kick you out, Macey.\" I tried to laugh. \"You know too much. By now we\u0027d have to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took forty-seven seconds, but eventually Macey smiled. Eventually she laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Preston?\" I said, because, honestly, I was sort of about to explode. And…okay … so it had taken me practically twenty-four hours to mention it, but I\u0027d had other things on my mind. Like my sanity, my future, and whether or not Zach\u0027s sudden disinterest in kissing had anything to do with the fact that my hair tends to get frizzy when it\u0027s raining. But that didn\u0027t stop me from leaning closer and whispering, \"Did I or did I not hear you kissing Preston?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are people I could hire to kill you and make it look like an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gripped the banister and propelled myself up a couple of steps. \"He\u0027s not so bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously. There wouldn\u0027t even be an inquest.\" Macey took a step then added, \"Besides, do I have to tell you that secret boyfriends are the hottest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of everything, I smiled. \"Point taken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-one\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still remember the day—the moment—when I found my very first secret passage. I had been at school three days. My mom had just started her job. My dad had just died. And I\u0027d just arrived at the school I\u0027d heard about my entire life (or, well, the parts of my life that came after the part where I figured out that my mom and dad had more covert reasons for missing my kindergarten graduation).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wandering the hallways, wondering about this building that was bigger and older and more beautiful than anything I\u0027d ever seen. Wondering how long it would take for me to realize that my mom would never go away again and my dad would never come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWondering if I really belonged at the Gallagher Academy and if I was truly worthy to carry both the Morgan and Cameron family names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I stopped in the hallway by the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA window was open. The school still had the stale feeling of a building that had been underoccupied for a long time, and I watched as a breeze blew through the windows and pushed some dust along the stone-tiled floor, rolling dirt through the cracks like water in a river. But at one point, instead of rolling along, it dropped out of sight as if there were a waterfall in the grout that could barely be seen by the naked eye, disappearing beneath a wall of solid stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed and pulled for five minutes before the wall slid open, and I found my first way of disappearing in plain sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days before I\u0027d found it. Three days I\u0027d been at this place I loved. Three days…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd already I was looking for ways out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was before I was forbidden to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePROS AND CONS OF BEING GROUNDED INSIDE THE MOST AWESOME GROUNDS IN THE WORLD:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: It\u0027s a lot easier to protect your roommate from the people who want to kidnap her if she spends most of her time in your room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: When Mr. Mosckowitz asks you to help him proof his paper for the Excellence in European Encryption seminar on Friday night, you can\u0027t say \"Sorry, I\u0027m going to be out of town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: Staying out of secret, ancient tunnels means you don\u0027t get nearly as many questionable stains on your white blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: When your roommate tests a landmark discovery in clean-fuel technology (that happens to reside inside a Dodge minivan), you don\u0027t get to ride shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: You don\u0027t have to worry about running into the boy who may or may not have been stalking you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: You don\u0027t get to run into the boy who may or may not have been protecting you. (Even though you don\u0027t really need protecting, it totally is the thought that counts.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: You have plenty of time to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: You don\u0027t always like what you\u0027re thinking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach hadn\u0027t tried to kiss me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there are bigger mysteries in the world, and I\u0027m sure the CIA would have classified that information as a low-level concern (I know … I asked Liz). Maybe it was the way the walls felt close and the grounds felt small, but for some reason that fact kept pressing down on me, day after day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t get me wrong, it\u0027s not that I think I\u0027m so completely kissable (because, believe me, I don\u0027t), but every morning I walked past the place where he had dipped me in front of the entire school. In the Grand Hall every night I ate in the exact same place where we had danced. And every day, with every step, new questions filled my mind:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• Why had Zach been in Boston (among other places)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• What had he meant when he\u0027d said that he was someone who didn\u0027t have anything left to lose?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• Who had set all this in motion? And why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor three weeks I wandered the halls, wondering about people who had hurt me and a boy who hadn\u0027t tried to kiss me: two great mysteries. But there was only one of them that I had any hope of solving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you check again?\" I asked Liz as we left Culture and Assimilation. \"Professor Buckingham told me that MI6 registers a dozen new terrorist groups in their database every week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Liz said. \"But Cam, there\u0027s nothing there. I\u0027ve run the image of that woman\u0027s ring through MI6, MI5, CIA, NSA, FBI. Believe me, if they\u0027ve got initials, I\u0027ve hacked them, and that image isn\u0027t anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t make that symbol up! It\u0027s got to exist …\" I snapped, but the look that my three best friends in the world were giving made me stop short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam, darling,\" Bex said. \"Is something…bothering you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I …\" I started, but Macey was the one who answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s still freaked out about Zach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may be a pavement artist, but Macey McHenry will always know more about boys and all things boy-related than I can ever comprehend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Macey asked with a shrug when I stared at her. \"I\u0027m intuitive.\" She took a step. \"Plus, you talk in your sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right. Zach and I had fallen out of that train berth together, and the world had been upside down ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boys!\" I cried, but luckily the halls were loud, and girls were hurrying, and the word got lost in the crowd. Would we ever understand them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t be…bad?\" Liz asked softly. \"I mean, didn\u0027t we establish last year that Zach is not bad?\" She wasn\u0027t asking as a girl, she was asking as a scientist who really didn\u0027t want to reevaluate her models, duplicate her research, and change any of the things that she thought she\u0027d once proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she hadn\u0027t been on the train. She hadn\u0027t seen with her own eyes that Aunt Abby knew something about Zach. And Zach knew something about Boston. And someone knew something about that emblem. As Liz started for the labs and Macey started for Encryption, Bex and I boarded the elevator to Sublevel Two, and I couldn\u0027t help but ask, \"What good is it having elite spying abilities if the people who have the highly classified information are even more elite?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex smiled at me. \"Because where would be the fun in that?\" The spiraling ramp seemed steeper as it carried us deeper and deeper into Sublevel Two. When we reached the bottom, she stopped and looked at me. \"And maybe there are some things\"—she spoke slowly, and I knew the words were almost painful as she said—\"we aren\u0027t supposed to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Motivation,\" Mr. Solomon said as we settled into our chairs around the old-fashioned tables of the Covert Operations classroom. For weeks I\u0027d been coming to that room, studying our teacher, trying to find some clue in his eyes about Zach and the train and a million other questions that swarmed my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s why people do the things they do,\" our teacher said, the sentence as simple and basic as any lesson we had ever learned; and yet something in Joe Solomon\u0027s tone told me it was also the most important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, ladies\"—he took a step, scanning the dim room—\"is almost always tied to why. There are six reasons anyone does anything: Love. Faith. Greed. Boredom. Fear …\" he said, ticking them off on his fingers; but he lingered on the last, drawing a deep breath before he said, \"Revenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the people on the rooftop, wondered which of those six things had brought them there. And why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have gadgets,\" Mr. Solomon said. \"We have comms units and trackers and satellites that can photograph the wings of a fly, but make no mistake, we practice a very old art. Six things, ladies. And they haven\u0027t changed in five thousand years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Solomon turned back to the board. My classmates sat at attention, but my mind was spinning, going over and over what my teacher had just said. I gripped the edge of the table. I saw the classroom fade away. The world came into focus as I said the words, I must have known for weeks but only just realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going on about?\" Bex asked. For once in her life she could barely keep up with me as I stepped from the elevator and started up the Grand Staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were wrong. I was wrong,\" I said, the words coming faster now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam, what—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course Liz didn\u0027t find it in the computer files. Going back fifty years wouldn\u0027t help. Going back a hundred wouldn\u0027t help. Bex, they\u0027re not a new threat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the foyer below us, girls were going in for lunch. The halls were alive with the smells of lasagna and talk of midterms, but my best friend and I were alone in the Hall of History as I pointed to our school\u0027s most sacred treasure. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-21.html","bookId":2748,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM"}
