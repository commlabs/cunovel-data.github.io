However, a follower’s cultivation requirements and daily needs are paid for by the Consolidating Equipment Master. As such, it is very rare that a Consolidating Equipment Master would bind more than five Followers, as it would put too much pressure on them as well. However, their Followers are likely powerful beings in their own right. For example, those Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Masters, most likely their Follower are also Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters or the like, and they may not even want ordinary Jewel Masters as their Followers. It’s possible Master Yun Li has something urgent to do, otherwise with his potential, he wouldn’t be accepting ordinary Jewel Masters to be his Followers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er exchanged looks, and he muttered to himself: “That’s possible?! Damn! I have lost out indeed!” If he had known this earlier, he wouldn’t have given his classmates such a great deal, instead coming out to gather more Followers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he was currently only a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, he was not far from reaching the rank of High Level, and would not take much time in doing so. Furthermore, his speed in creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls far outstripped any others, and was more than sufficient to support a large number of Followers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lost out in?” The middle aged man looked at Zhou Weiqing curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said: “Big bro, is it that every shop can display a sign like that to gather Followers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle aged man nodded and said: “Yes, it is a great way for the shop to gather fame and more business, of course every shop would want to be chosen by a Consolidating Equipment Master to host them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s eyes twirled as he said: “Then I shall look for a shop too.” As he said that, he grabbed hold of Shangguan Bing’er and turned to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait, wait. Little bro, what do you mean?” The middle aged man held hold of Zhou Weiqing in surprise. “Do you mean to say that you are also a Consolidating Equipment Master? You’re looking to get some Followers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Yup! Why? Do I not look the part?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle aged man furrowed his brow and said: “You really do not. Little bro, you look to be barely twenty. Let me tell you, normally Disciple level Consolidating Equipment Masters aren’t able to attract many Followers. After all, no one can be certain of your future potential. It is only at least a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master that has qualification to start attracting Followers. Naturally, the younger and the higher rank, the higher quality the Followers attracted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing stuck his chest out and said proudly: “I AM a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master. Who made the rule that someone young cannot be a Consolidating Equipment Master? Big Bro, thanks for your tips, but please do not hold me back. I’m going to look for a shop to do the same, otherwise all the outstanding Heavenly Jewel Masters might be taken up!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle aged man stared in shock before saying: “You… you’re really a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master?” In his memory, he had never seen or heard of such a young Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said: “Of course!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle aged man said: “Then come with me.” As he said that, he turned around, leading Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er to the shop right beside, with the number 77 on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little bro… let me ask you one more time… you really are a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master? Do not joke around with me okay, or my face will be all thrown out!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing looked at the shop numbered 77, and said: “Big Bro, this shop is yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle aged man nodded and said: “Yes it is. Sigh, today’s business is terrible, that lucky fellow from 76 has gotten it all. If you really are a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, then there’s nothing else to say. If you open your stand in front of my shop, I will give you a 20 percent discount from now on when you buy from me… that’s the treatment of a High Level Membership Card!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Alright, that sounds good. I’ll set up a stand in front of your shop then. I’ll need a table like that, and the sign can just be the same as his. Besides that, could you please get me a small wooden sign like his, but I’ll write that one on my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle aged man nodded and said: “That’s simple, I’ll go prepare it now. Let’s introduce ourselves first, My name is Qin Feng, you can just call me Bro Qin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said: “My name is Zhou Weiqing, you can just call me by my name. Bro Qin, I’ll trouble you to help me prepare the items then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQin Feng looked deeply at Zhou Weiqing, his heart rather perturbed. If this young man was lying to him, then his reputation would be ruined. However, he was also under much stress, as lately the shop 76 had been taking all the business around due to the influence of Master Yun Li. In the past month, he had barely gotten ten customers. The rent in this Trading Center was after all extremely expensive, and his number 77 shop was one of the larger ones, and had a rather frightening monthly rent. If this lack of business continued for too long, he would have to close down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, Zhou Weiqing saw the hesitation in his eyes, and smiled. Lifting up his hands, he circulated his Heavenly Energy and released his Heavenly Jewels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree Icy Jade Physical Jewels appeared on his right wrist, and three Gold-Green Cat’s Eye Jewel (disguised) appeared on his left wrist, displayed out for Qin Feng to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Upper Level Heavenly Shi Master, Spatial Attribute, that is at least the basis of a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, right?” Zhou Weiqing smiled and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the three pairs of Heavenly Jewels on Zhou Weiqing, Qin Feng’s eyes brightened. In the Jewel Master world, power was of utmost importance, and for Zhou Weiqing who looked so young to already have three Jewels already spoke volumes. A Heavenly Jewel Master wouldn’t usually go around lying to others, let alone when there wouldn’t be any self benefit in doing so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s my fault for being too suspicious. Little brother, wait here, I’ll prepare everything quickly.” After saying that, Qin Feng rushed into his shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he left, Shangguan Bing’er turned to Zhou Weiqing and asked uncertainly: “Little Fatty, why are you looking for Followers now? We currently do not need any Followers right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing grinned and said: “There aren’t that many Heavenly Jewel Masters, and if they Follow someone else, they will be lost to us. Since we are already here, we might as well get a few Heavenly Jewel Master Followers, that will also be the roots of our Heavenly Bow Empire’s future. Bing’er, do not worry, your husband is extremely talented, and my speed at creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls is also much faster than normal. Even with a conservative estimate, I can easily maintain a hundred Jewel Masters’ Consolidating Equipment and Skill Storing needs without any problems.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er looked at Zhou Weiqing and said gently: “I just do not want you to experience so much hardship. Little Fatty, I can feel that you are under a lot of stress, and if possible, let me share some of it okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing fell silent a while, before saying solemnly: “Bing\u0027er, do you know the feeling I had when I see how weak our country is? That feeling of urgency? Everybody looks down on us, even when we come to our ally, Fei Li Empire, our nobles are treated as commoners. I do not know what I can do in the future, or how well I can do, but I will do my utmost to strengthen our Heavenly Bow Empire. My father said to me once, only when there is stress and pressure will you have the motivation to work hard, and this is so true. In truth, you do not have to do anything else, just staying by my side and letting me see you everyday eases my fatigue and makes me feel much better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing\u0027er held hold of Zhou Weiqing’s hands, smiling gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQing Feng was indeed extremely efficient in doing things, and very soon the table Zhou Weiqing had requested for was placed out, along with the small wooden board, brush and ink for him to write. As for the large sign to be hung outside, it was being created in the shop, and should be done pretty soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were more and more people gathering around Yun Li to watch, and the interviews and tests had begun. Zhou Weiqing thought for a while, before picking up the brush and writing furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the large horizontal sign was complete, Qin Feng got his two employees to hang it up. On it was written: ‘The Continent’s youngest Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, Zhou Weiqing, is recruiting Followers!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sign was not exaggerated at all, at least it was what Qin Feng had determined with his own eyes. However, when he saw what Zhou Weiqing had written on his wooden board, he sucked in a deep breath, thinking to himself in exclamation: \u003ci\u003eThat’s too exaggerated!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Accepting Followers, no limit on numbers, but only looking for 2-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters and higher. Want to have Consolidating Equipment Sets? Want to have Socketing Scrolls? A future God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master is now before your eyes. Your opportunity is here, do not miss it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the rest of the words, it was still fine, but Zhou Weiqing had written the words ‘God Tier’ in an extra huge font. If it were up to Qin Feng to describe, this little rascal was literally treating God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters like cabbages [1. basically a term to signify being common or easily found]!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, before Qin Feng could persuade him to change the words, Zhou Weiqing had already started shouting into the crowd: “Come, have a look! A Future God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master is looking for Followers! It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity, if you pass this up, you will regret it for life!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Zhou Weiqing shouted, he swaggered over to his seat behind the table to sit down, with an arrogant air that was more than a match to the High Level Consolidating Equipment Master Yun Li at the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his shouting, he actually managed to draw much attention. However, most of the people swept a glance at his sign and turned back disdainfully. The words ‘God Tier’ had in fact gotten the reverse reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I say… Old Qin… where did you get this clown? Let’s not say whether or not he is even truly a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, even if he is, what does he take God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters as? Even if he wants to blow his own trumpet, he should boast about something more believable!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at that moment, a middle aged man of over forty who was not far from them sniggered and mocked at Qin Feng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQin Feng glanced and him and gave a cold humph: “Zhou Changxi, can you tell the future? How do you know that my little bro here cannot become a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master in the future? Have you ever seen such a young Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master? I’m afraid that even Master Yun Li wasn’t the same level as him at this age.” By now, Qin Feng was already forced into the same boat as Zhou Weiqing, and had no choice but to defend him. After all, he had already brought him out to fight, naturally he would do so to the end. This Zhou Changxi was the boss of the shop number 76.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Changxi laughed and said: “Very good, very good. Bro Yun Li, did you hear that? They claim that there’s a genius Consolidating Equipment Master here that’s even more talented than you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” A cold, proud voice sounded out, and as the crowd parted, Yun Li walked over, an arrogant look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-7-chapter-55-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-7-chapter-56-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-7-chapter-55-03","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
