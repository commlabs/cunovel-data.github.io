But you can\u0027t take responsibility for any of it, can you? Couldn\u0027t be your fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta curled his fingers into his palm, tightened them until they turned white. \"What do you want, Sandra? You come to apologize or yell at me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to tell you I\u0027m leaving you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Thought you did that six years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I was too afraid to say it then. I\u0027m saying it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I get out of here? If I come after you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes didn\u0027t flinch. She said, \"I won\u0027t run anymore. I won\u0027t do that to my son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure which of us was caught off-guard most by the certainty in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta focused on Michael for the first time. \"Hey, chico, come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta cupped his hand inward, gesturing for the boy to approach the glass. Michael stepped forward. He kept his head down. He hooked a finger under his collar and scratched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta crouched a little. \"Show me your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta looked at Michael, then Ines. His expression said, Kid sure as bell ain\u0027t mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody talks to you,\" said Zeta, \"you need to look them in the eyes, little man. It\u0027s respectful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta\u0027s face was deadly serious. No smile for the little kid. He looked like he was trying to burn a message into Michael\u0027s mind and I had a feeling he\u0027d be able to do it pretty successfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your name, little man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"M-mml?\" Zeta mimicked. \"What\u0027s your name? Speak up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You scared, Michael?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My daddy had that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta frowned. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael pressed one finger to the Plexiglas, pointing at Zeta\u0027s face, then poked his own cheek. \"Cut himself shaving. My daddy let me put the Band-Aid on for him. Yes. I\u0027m scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes\u0027 hands made a tent over her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta cleared his throat. \"I got to tell you something, Michael. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael shuffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to take care of your mom, little man. You hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael milked his red-and-blue tie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hear me, Michael? Will you promise me that? That\u0027s a real important job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She gets scared, you\u0027re the man to protect her. You hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about a \u0027yes, sir.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta gestured toward the visitors\u0027 exit. \"Good-bye, Michael. Adios, Sandra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes started to say something, then stopped herself. Closure was a bull\u0027s-eye she could\u0027ve easily overshot. She nodded to Zeta Sanchez, then looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there,\" I promised. \"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked like she wanted to protest that, but her desire to get Michael out of the room was stronger. She held out her arms to reclaim her son. She took Michael\u0027s hand and led him toward the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta watched her go. \"Shorter than she remembers,\" he murmured. \"Chingate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanchez wore the same expression I\u0027d seen once on a lion on Wild Kingdom — right after the tranquilizer dart hit, the beast stumbling around in irritated bewilderment on the savannah, just before Marlin Perkins said it was safe to approach and the sleepy lion mauled the hell out of Jim or Bob or whatever the hell the assistant\u0027s name was. Marlin had had to cut to a Mutual of Omaha commercial pretty quick after that segment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"If word gets around you let her go—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta raised a cautionary finger. \"My call. You remember that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think Ines knows why you really came back to San Antonio? She wasn\u0027t the only piece of your past you needed closure on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were getting sleepier and angrier by the second. \"Go home, Professor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother worked for Jeremiah Brandon until just after you were born. Jeremiah kept track of you as you grew up. Have you ever known for sure who your father was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI strove to see some resemblance between Zeta Sanchez and the old photos of Jeremiah Brandon. I didn\u0027t see any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what it\u0027s worth,\" I said, \"you\u0027re more like him than Aaron or Del. You\u0027re the one who inherited his character.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell that my words were no consolation. They simply sank in, probably joining the army of similar thoughts that Zeta had been amassing most of his life and still hesitated to put into the battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did something good today,\" I said. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeta stood. \"I didn\u0027t do nothing, Professor. I\u0027ll be out of here sooner than you think. You wait until then before you decide to thank me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he walked to the exit and disappeared back into the county jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to convince myself that he\u0027d needed to say those parting words to save face, that we\u0027d come to a resolution despite that. I sat there listening to the crying babies and the fat woman grouse about her electric bill. But I kept watching the door Zeta had gone through, just to make sure it stayed closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTY-TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoodlawn Lake cuts a green, quarter-mile U through the near West Side. The area had been affluent once. When my father was a kid back in the 1940s, the water had been pristine, the circular Casting Pond stocked with fish for children to catch. Dad once told me he\u0027d beaten his friends in a rowing race around the lake\u0027s miniature red and white lighthouse, an idea I found incredulous, given Dad\u0027s massive beer gut in his later years. Neighborhood families had held their debutante parties and upscale Christmas posadas at the now boarded-up community center. My father and mother had gone to their first dance there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the palm trees dotting the shore were dying. The Casting Pond was choked with watercress and cattails and old shoes. Most of the Spanish villas and Southern plantation homes fronting the water had long ago been divided into apartment blocks, their lawns gone to crabgrass and wild pyracantha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, in the fresh light on a late spring morning, the place glowed with a kind of faded dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong the shore, joggers did their routes. Preschool-aged children toddled after the flocks of grebes and geese. The smell of roasted buttered corn filled the air from vendors\u0027 wagons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe parked across from the old docks, in front of Ines and Michael\u0027s new apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t look like much — a two-story brownstone cube with white-framed windows and a briar patch of TV aerials on the roof. The first time I\u0027d seen it, I\u0027d been reminded of those buildings in atomic bomb test films, a few seconds before annihilation. I hadn\u0027t shared that observation with Ines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the doorstep, we found a wicker basket full of food, heavily cocooned in Saran Wrap. Ines\u0027 name was on the tag. Erainya\u0027s handwriting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greek leftovers,\" I pronounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes hefted the new addition to her larder. \"But she brought us a basket this big yesterday. We haven\u0027t even started—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erainya is relentless,\" I warned her. \"Now that you\u0027re on her list, she won\u0027t stop until your breath permanently smells like gyros.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed Ines and Michael upstairs to number five. Across the hallway, their neighbor\u0027s door was cracked open just enough to let out the sound of Spanish soap opera and the smell of cooking beans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes unlocked the door to number five and Michael pushed through immediately, tugging at his tie as he disappeared around the corner. Ines leaned against the doorway. She hugged the basket of food to her stomach and closed her eyes. Pain tightened in her face. I got the uncomfortable impression that she was passing through a labor contraction. Congratulations, sir. It\u0027s a dolma platter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she murmured, \"I don\u0027t know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buy some fresh yogurt. A couple of bottles of ouzo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled wanly. \"You know what I mean. I don\u0027t trust myself to stop moving. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll fall apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The worst is over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes and looked straight through me, as if calculating the distance to the horizon. \"Is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t sound like she expected an answer. That was just as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to stay for a while?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"You don\u0027t have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could keep Michael company, if you want to take a nap or something. You look like you could use one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moistened her lips, tasting the idea, then asked almost timidly, \"A hot shower?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hot shower,\" I agreed. \"Followed by several million calories of spanakopita. Just what Hippocrates ordered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed despite her weariness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Ines had disappeared into the bathroom, I unpacked Erainya\u0027s Greek food plates, put them with their brethren in the refrigerator, then walked over to the living-room windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apartment was saved by its view — three wide picture windows looking out over Woodlawn Lake, just above the fronds of the palm trees. You could see the Y-shaped piers below, the lighthouse, the jogging trails, clusters of waterfowl, sunlight turning the water to hammered silver. On the eastern horizon, rising above the live oaks, the yellow-capped spires of Our Lady of the Mount gleamed. I could just make out the tiny iron Jesus who stared down at the Poco Mas Cantina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to the apartment\u0027s interior. Not as promising. The living-room wallpaper was blistered pink, the ceiling water-stained and fixed with a tiny glass chandelier. There were heaps of moving boxes everywhere. Despite Ines\u0027 cleaning efforts, the carpet still smelled faintly of cat urine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the right, master bedroom and bathroom. On the left was the kitchen, and the short hall that led to Michael\u0027s room. His father\u0027s silk tie was lying in a melted P on the floor just outside Michael\u0027s doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it for a good three minutes. Then I walked over and peeked in. No sheet cave. Michael\u0027s bed consisted of a stripped mattress and a sleeping bag. The walls were bare except for a little window that looked out on the trunk of a palm tree. Moving boxes were crammed into the tiny closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael sat cross-legged on the turquoise carpet, cutting out ads from a magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still in his button-down and slacks but he\u0027d pulled off his dress shoes and socks. His pale, bare feet were splotchy with chigger bites. He seemed completely focused on the toy advertisement he was cutting out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027d visited the night before, Jem had come with me, bringing his PlayStation unit and a spare TV for Michael to borrow. Erainya had insisted. Poor paidi needs to learn these things. Donkey Kong as a life skill. Jem had done most of the playing last night himself, and the television was still on. As near as I could tell it was the same game. The basketball-dribbling dinosaur was doing continuous, pointless flips, waiting for someone to give it directions. Michael ignored it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rapped on the door. \"Can I come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem\u0027s PlayStation game kept cranking out the carnival music. I walked inside, sat down on the carpet, pressed escape on the gameset. It told me to enter my name. I was one of the high scorers. I punched in T-R-E-S, then shut off the TV. Michael finished cutting out the picture. It was an advertisement for a G.I. Joe. He looked at it for a second, then added it to a stack of cutouts next to him. \"Hey, kiddo,\" I said. \"You doing okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-hmm.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-48.html","bookId":2418,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM"}
