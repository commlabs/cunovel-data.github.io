Unless they look under the lawnmower, thought Paul. But why would they do that? Before she left, Paul asked her to bring him some paper so that he could continue writing the book while she was away. He needed the drug of writing. She shook her head regretfully. \u0027I can\u0027t do that, Paul. I\u0027d have to leave the light on down here and someone might see the light through the windows. And if I give you a torch or a candle you might try to shine it through the windows.\u0027 He thought of being left alone down here in the cellar in the dark, and his skin felt cold. He thought of the rats hiding in their holes in the walls, waiting for darkness so that they could come out. He wondered whether they could smell his fear. \u0027Don\u0027t leave me in the dark, Annie. The rats.\u0027 \u0027I have to. Don\u0027t be such a baby. I\u0027ve got to go now. If you need an injection, push the syringe into your leg. Don\u0027t worry about the rats, Paul. They\u0027ll probably recognize that you\u0027re a rat too.\u0027 She laughed at her joke and continued laughing all the way up the stairs. When she closed the door to the kitchen it became totally black. He could hear her drive away. He imagined that she was still laughing. In the darkness his imagination soon began to play games with his mind. He imagined that the young policeman came to life in the barn and crawled up to the house; he imagined that he came through the wall into the cellar. He felt one of the policeman\u0027s cold, dead fingers touch his cheek - but it was only a large spider and Paul realized that he had been dreaming. His legs were painful now and he gave himself an injection. Then he fell properly asleep, and, when he woke up, the dull light of early morning was filling the cellar. He saw a huge rat sitting in the plate of food which Annie had left, eating cheese. He screamed and the rat ran away. He took some Novril and looked round the cellar. He saw the 73 Suddenly on idea burst into his mind like a bright light. He looked at the idea from all directions and it still seemed sweet. barbecue stove with all its tools and equipment, and remembered burning Fast Cars . . . and suddenly an idea burst into his mind like a bright light. He looked at the idea from all directions and it still seemed sweet. At last he had a plan which might be successful. He fell asleep again with a smile on his face, dreaming about the next pages he would write. Annie came back in the middle of the afternoon. She was silent, but seemed tired rather than depressed. Paul asked her if everything had gone all right and she nodded. \u0027Do you want another injection, Paul?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Your legs must be hurting a lot by now.\u0027 It was true. The damp had made his legs hurt terribly, but he wanted her out of the cellar as quickly as possible, so he told net he was OK. When he got on to her back for the ride up the stairs he had to bite his lips to stop himself shouting in pain. At the bottom of the stairs she paused, and he hoped . . . prayed . . . that she would not notice the missing can of barbecue fuel; he had pushed it down the back of his trousers. She didn\u0027t seem to notice anything. When he was back in his room he said, \u0027I think I would like that injection now, Annie.\u0027 She looked at his face, which was covered in sweat from the pain, and then nodded. As soon as she left the room to fetch the medicine he pushed the small, flat fuel can under the mattress. He hadn\u0027t hidden anything there since the knife, so he didn\u0027t expect her suddenly to look there. Anyway, he wasn\u0027t planning to leave it there for long. After she had given him the injection she said she was going to sleep. \u0027If a car comes I\u0027ll hear it,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ll leave your wheelchair next to your bed so that you can get up and work if you want to.\u0027 \u0027I probably will, later,\u0027 he said. \u0027There isn\u0027t much time now, is there, Annie?\u0027 \u0027No, there isn\u0027t, Paul. I\u0027m glad you understand that.\u0027 \u0027Annie,\u0027 he said innocently. \u0027Since I\u0027m getting to the end of the book, I wonder if you\u0027d do something for me.\u0027 75 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027Please don\u0027t read any more. When I\u0027ve finished it all, then you can read all the last chapters. Will you do that? It\u0027ll make it more exciting for you.\u0027 \u0027Yes, thank you, Paul. Yes, I\u0027ll do that.\u0027 Four hours later she was still asleep. He had heard her go to bed upstairs at four o\u0027clock and had heard nothing since then. He felt safe. He got into his wheelchair as quietly as possible and rolled himself over to his table by the window. Not long ago he had discovered a loose board in the floor. Under the board was a narrow space. The space was just big enough for the can of fuel. Paul sighed in relief when the board was back in postion. He gently blew the dust back over the board so that it looked the same as ail the surrounding boards. He wrote some pages of the book and then went back to bed and slept peacefully.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1577/46852.html","bookId":656,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:56:15 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:56:15 PM"}
