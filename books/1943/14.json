His marriage was dead, and rehashing unresolved issues between him and Rosie would do no good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later, Zach drove into the garage at 311 Pelican Court, the custom-built house he’d helped design. Together he and Rosie had pored over house plans for months on end. Despite this inconvenient arrangement, he felt grateful to the judge for her unconventional edict, since it meant he didn’t have to completely give up a place he loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Zach’s surprise, the house was quiet when he came in through the kitchen door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is everyone?” he called as he set his briefcase on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here, Dad,” Eddie shouted from the family room. He was lying in front of the television on his stomach, manipulating the joystick to his video game. “Allison’s got a visitor in her bedroom,” he said, looking up at Zach. “It’s a boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” The word exploded out of Zach before he could stop it. He’d see about this. Allison knew the rules, and Rule Number One was no kids at the house without an adult present. No boys in her room, either. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie nodded in the direction of the hallway. “Check it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach didn’t need a second invitation. He practically ran to Allison’s bedroom; it was the fastest he’d moved in weeks. He pounded on the closed door, then flung it open. His daughter sat on the edge of her bed with her arms entwined around the neck of a skinny boy with long stringy hair badly in need of washing. He wore a black leather jacket and motorcycle boots that laced up to his knees. A studded leather dog collar circled his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad.” Allison’s eyes grew huge. “What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I live here three days a week. Who’s this?” He narrowed his gaze on the pimply-faced youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is Ryan Wilson. Ryan, this is my dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ryan,” Zach said. He reached for the boy’s arm and jerked him to an upright position. “Nice to meet you.” Without taking a breath, he continued. “However, we have rules in this house and that includes no boys in my daughter’s bedroom.” He loomed over the teenager, who blinked up at him, face paling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daddy,” Allison cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach ignored her. “If you want to see my daughter again, I suggest you abide by my rules. Do we understand each other, Ryan?” he asked pointedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” He held out his hand. “Well, goodbye, Ryan. I assume you know your way to the front door?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan made a beeline out of the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was on her feet now, too, her expression one of outrage. “How dare you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I dare, Allison, and I’ll dare a whole lot more. What the hell do you think you’re doing bringing a boy into this house without an adult present?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m an adult.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach nearly laughed out loud. “When you’re living on your own, paying your own expenses, we’ll revisit that issue. As it stands now, you live in my house.” He paused, because technically this wasn’t his house. It belonged to Rosie and him jointly and to the kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can invite anyone I want into my room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach glared at her. “Don’t go there, little girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little girl?” Indignation shone from her eyes, and her cheeks reddened as she clenched her fists at her sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach could see this argument was getting out of hand. He was angry and so was Allison. Difficult as it was, they both needed to step back and take a deep breath. “We’ll talk about this after dinner.” He turned and left the room, and heard the door slam a couple of seconds later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Zach entered the kitchen, he was shaking. He dragged several calming breaths into his lungs and forced his heart to settle down to a normal beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s for dinner?” Eddie asked, following him inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hot dogs,” Zach said. It was convenient, quick and he was in no mood to mess with a casserole. He’d discovered he was quite good at tossing a few ingredients together. He had his failures—notably the ground turkey baked with peas and rice—and his successes. Eddie didn’t seem to care one way or the other. Of the two, Allison was the picky eater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We had hot dogs last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeave it to Rosie to beat him to the punch. “What would you like?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation, Eddie said, “Spaghetti.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” He searched the refrigerator’s freezer section for hamburger and realized there was none. It was his week to buy groceries, which he should’ve done before he got home. More than likely, that was why Allison had Ryan in her room. She’d expected him to arrive later than normal, but he’d forgotten it was his turn to do the shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has Ryan been here before?” he asked. He hated to use his son as a snitch, but he was beginning to think Ryan might be a routine visitor. If so, that was about to stop right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie glanced over his shoulder and then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does your mother know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie shook his head. “No one did until now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach patted his son on the back. “What about macaroni and cheese?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie shrugged. “Are you going to cook the real kind or the kind that comes out of a box?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do we have?” Zach asked, examining the contents of various cupboards. He needed something easy while he decided what to do about Allison. It was clear he’d have to talk to her, and much as he dreaded the idea of calling Rosie, he should probably get her advice before he initiated the big discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve got grated mozzarella cheese,” Eddie said, peering inside the refrigerator. “That makes the best kind ’cause it melts in the macaroni.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Done,” Zach said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie removed the container of cheese and set it on the counter. “You aren’t going to make me eat green beans with this, are you? Mom does. She’s on this kick about eating vegetables and fresh fruit. It’s disgusting. She won’t let us order pizza, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach smiled wanly. “I might let you off just this once.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie looked appreciative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I should call your mother,” Zach said, putting a pot of water on the stove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s not home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis son was a fount of information. “She isn’t?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie beamed him a big smile. “She’s got a date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosie was out on a date? If so, he wanted to know who with. No one had said anything to him about this. “On a school night?” he asked, hoping for more facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie nodded. “That was all she talked about last night. Dad, I’ve got problems with my math homework. Can you help?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” he said absently. This was great. Just great! Zach was struggling to find something edible to feed his kids. He was the one dealing with his teenage daughter’s rebellion. Eddie needed help with his homework. And his ex-wife was enjoying a night on the town with her new love interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was definitely something wrong with this picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a lovely Saturday morning, and the blustery winds of October blew orange and yellow leaves around the waterfront and the Cedar Cove Farmers’ Market. Grace and Olivia meandered down the row between a series of festive booths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, what time do you want to go to the movie?” Olivia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was thinking I’d pass this afternoon,” Grace said nonchalantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh—” Olivia couldn’t help being disappointed. “How come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace suddenly became flustered. “Oh, for heaven’s sake, just go to the movie without me,” she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia knew that look. Her friend was up to something and Olivia probably wasn’t going to like it. She stopped at a booth and purchased a loaf of homemade raisin bread, which she tucked into her large straw bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, all right, I’ll tell you,” Grace said as though the truth had been tortured out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia didn’t bother to point out that she hadn’t asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack’s going to be there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat got Olivia’s attention. “Jack?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack. Remember Jack? He called and asked me to set it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, this was downright ridiculous. Jack had phoned her best friend and not her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember last month when you turned down Stan’s dinner invitation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia wasn’t likely to forget. It had caused a rift between her and Stan, but she wasn’t nearly as concerned about her relationship with her ex-husband as she was about her continuing disagreement with Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack was supposed to meet us at the theater the Friday night we went to the movies last month, but at the last minute he couldn’t make it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on here?” Olivia demanded, although she wasn’t really upset. It was increasingly obvious that she needed all the assistance she could get in the romance department. Not that her friend was any great expert. Grace had her own difficulties, but unfortunately they weren’t the kind that intervention would help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack covers the Friday-night football games,” Grace reminded her. “Gordie was supposed to go instead, but something came up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued to stroll through the market, mouths watering at the enticing scent of popping kettle corn carried on the wind. “Jack wasn’t happy about it.” Grace sighed. “Ever since then, he’s been driving me nuts, trying to get me to set up another movie outing, but between your schedule, his and mine—well, it’s getting too crazy to work it all out. I figured I’d just tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s about time he and I settled this, isn’t it?” Olivia said, eager to patch up her differences with Jack. They’d let their quarrel drag on weeks longer than it should have. She didn’t understand why he hadn’t simply called her, but…well, trust a man to do things the hard way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely,” Grace said emphatically. “You’re both stubborn and headstrong. Now fix it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia couldn’t believe her ears. This was Grace speaking? Grace never ordered people about. Obviously she felt strongly about this, and that made Olivia feel good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaves billowed past and leaden gray clouds had begun to darken the sky. It would rain within the hour, she predicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How will he know which movie?” Olivia hadn’t even decided what she wanted to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack’s a smart man, he’ll figure it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he was so smart, he’d—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Olivia, are you going to argue with me, or are you going to accept some heartfelt advice and do what I suggest?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she answered, Olivia had a question or two of her own. “What’s happening with you and Cliff?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace sighed again. “Not a whole lot. After Dan was found, I told him I needed time to grieve for my husband. He understood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia nodded; that much she knew. “You haven’t seen him in a while.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/311-pelican-court-cedar-cove-3/page-14.html","bookId":1943,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:11 AM"}
