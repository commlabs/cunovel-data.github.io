Why do you wear it back like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Tom likes it,\" Jenny said reflexively, her standard response. \"Look, what did you mean-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, clicking his tongue. \"May I?\" he said politely, straightening up. His tone was so normal, so solicitous, that Jenny nodded automatically. She was still intent on her question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you-no, don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had pulled the elastic band out of her ponytail. Jenny felt her hair fall about her neck, and then his fingers were in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn almost imperceptible shudder went through Jenny. \"Don\u0027t,\" she said again. She didn\u0027t know how to deal with this situation. He wasn\u0027t being rough. He still looked solicitous and friendly. It didn\u0027t seem appropriate to hit him in the gut as Dee had taught her to do with guys that annoyed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beautiful,\" he murmured. His touch was as light as the soft pat of a cat\u0027s paw, and his voice was like black velvet. \"Don\u0027t you like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jenny said, but she could feel the heat in her face. She was backed against the wall now. She didn\u0027t know how to get away from him-and the worst thing was that her body didn\u0027t seem sure it wanted to. His cool fingers moved against her warm hair roots, and she felt a trembling thrill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I told you about your mouth?\" he said. \"No? It\u0027s soft. Short upper lip, full lower. Just about perfect, except that it\u0027s usually a little wistful. There\u0027s something you want, Jenny, that you\u0027re not getting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go now,\" Jenny said in a rush. Her standard stuck-with-a-jerk-at-a-party response. She was so confused she didn\u0027t care if it didn\u0027t make sense here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to go anywhere.\" He seemed unable to take his eyes away from her face for a second. Jenny had never held anyone\u0027s gaze for this long-and she had never even dreamed of eyes like his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could show you what it is you\u0027ve been wanting,\" he said. \"Will you let me? Let me show you, Jenny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice seemed to steal the bones from her body. She was aware of shaking her head slightly, as much in response to the new feelings as to his question. She didn\u0027t know what was happening to her. Tom\u0027s touch made her feel safe, but this-this made her feel weak inside, as if her stomach were falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me show you,\" he said again, so softly she could barely hear him. His fingers were so gentle as they laced in her hair, urging her to tilt her face up toward him. His lips were bare inches from hers. Jenny felt herself flowing toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, stop,\" she said. \"Stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really want me to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" To her astonishment, he stepped back, fingers trailing out of her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny could still feel them. I almost kissed him, she thought. Not the other way around. In another minute I would have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom. Oh, Tom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you doing this?\" she said, her eyes filling again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"I told you. I fell in love with you. I didn\u0027t do it on purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027re so different,\" Jenny whispered. She was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estill feeling weak at the knees. \"Why should you-want me? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, head tilted slightly, quizzically. \"Don\u0027t you know?\" His eyes moved to her lips. \"Light to darkness, Jenny. Darkness to light. It\u0027s always been that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" And she didn\u0027t. She wouldn\u0027t let herself understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose the devil was just quietly minding his own business-when he saw a girl. A girl who made him forget everything. There\u0027ve been other girls more beautiful, of course-but this girl had something. A goodness, a sweetness about her. An innocence. Something simple he wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To destroy it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. To cherish it. To warm his cold heart. Even a poor devil can dream, can\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re trying to trick me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I?\" There was something oddly serious in his blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t listen to you. You can\u0027t make me listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True.\" For just an instant Julian looked tired. Then he gave his strange half smile. \"Then there\u0027s no choice but to keep playing, is there? No choice for either of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julian-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny caught herself up short, shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was crazy. But one thing she believed, he really was in love with her. She knew, somehow, that it was true. She also knew something else about him-she\u0027d known it since that instant when she\u0027d looked into his eyes and seen the ancient shadows there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d known it when he\u0027d humiliated Tom and terrorized Dee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was evil. Cruel, capricious, and dangerous as a cobra. A prince of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompletely evil-and completely in love with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow was she supposed to reconcile that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want me so much,\" she said, \"why don\u0027t you just take me, then? Why go through all this with the Game? You could grab me anytime-why don\u0027t you just do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heavy lashes drooped again. In that instant he looked exactly like the boy in the More Games store. Almost vulnerable-almost human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealization came to Jenny. \"Because you can\u0027t,\" she breathed. \"You can\u0027t, can you? You can\u0027t do just anything you want to, not even here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flashed up, glittering like a snake\u0027s. Jenny saw pure violence there. \"This is my world. I make the rules here-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Giddy triumph was swelling through Jenny, an effervescent rush. \"Not this one. That\u0027s why you asked if you could touch my hair. That\u0027s why you tried to make me kiss you. You can\u0027t do it without my permission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful, Jenny,\" he said. His face was cold and cruel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny just laughed excitedly. \"If you can kiss me against my will, then prove it,\" she said. \"Show me-do it now.\" And then she added an Italian phrase she\u0027d picked up from Audrey. \"Come osi!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt meant I dare you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you understand,\" he said. \"I\u0027m going to have you, at any cost. Any cost, Jenny, even if you have to suffer on the way. If I can\u0027t force you, I\u0027ll persuade you-and I can be very persuasive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny felt some of the triumph fold up inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember where you are, Jenny. Whose territory you\u0027re on. Remember what I can do in the Game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was completely sober now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You challenged me-now I suppose I\u0027ll have to show you what I am capable of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what you do to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it won\u0027t be to you. See your friend there? She\u0027s playing the Game, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was looking down the hallway, in the same direction Jenny had been going. Barely visible under a far candle was the copper glint of someone\u0027s hair. Jenny drew in her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare-\" Turning back to speak to him, Jenny broke off. Julian was gone. She was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny bit her lip. It was infuriating to talk to somebody who could do that, and she was beginning to think it hadn\u0027t been a very good idea to laugh at him. Nothing to be done about it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Audrey!\" she called and started down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey\u0027s skin, usually pale as magnolia blossoms, was touched with a golden glow from the candles, and her auburn hair flashed copper. She and Jenny hugged, and Jenny thought only Audrey could stay so calm, so chic, in such awful circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look as if any minute you\u0027re going to be demanding to see your ambassador,\" Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Daddy were here he\u0027d take care of things,\" Audrey agreed. \"He\u0027d come out of retirement to take on this place on. Are you all right? You look a little flushed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny put a hand to her cheek self-consciously. \"It\u0027s the light,\" she said. \"Uh, how long have you been here? I mean, did you see me-before I called?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027d been looking and looking-for anybody, but all I\u0027ve seen is this interminable hallway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I mean-it\u0027s good that I found you. The only other person I\u0027ve seen is Dee. She\u0027s back there, and she\u0027s just been through hell. And you\u0027re next, if I\u0027m right about the way this works. I\u0027ll explain as we go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe explanation, about how they were all scattered, about finding doors in the nightmares, about the dawn time limit and about how things in the nightmares could hurt you, took until they found Dee. They did find Dee, to Jenny\u0027s relief, standing beside a door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I\u0027d better guard it to make sure it didn\u0027t go anywhere,\" she said after a perfunctory nod at Audrey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey had only one question. \"Is he Nordic, that guy? They\u0027re supposed to be sexy as all get-out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny ignored this. \"Since the doors move, how do we know this isn\u0027t one of the two we opened before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t,\" Dee said and flashed The Smile. Dee\u0027s wild, leaping beauty always annoyed Audrey. \"Of course, it doesn\u0027t have a key like the first one, but I guess we\u0027d better get in monster position again. Anything could be inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Jenny did, ready to kick the door shut fast. Audrey\u0027s eyebrows lifted into her spiky bangs. \"No,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethank you, she said politely. Not in a fitted linen skirt. Listen, you two, why are we doing this at all? Why don\u0027t we just sit down and refuse to play?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you listen to me before?\" Jenny said. \"If we\u0027re still here by dawn, we stay for good. We lose automatically.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never lost anything by default,\" Dee said. Then she said, \"Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the door there was a forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCool wind blew out, ruffling Jenny\u0027s loose hair against her cheek. It smelled like summer camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God,\" said Jenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, come on,\" Audrey said, flicking her perfectly polished nails in a gesture of readiness. \"We might as well get it over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too weird,\" Jenny said as they stepped inside -outside. \"Dee\u0027s bedroom was a room, at least. But this...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were on the outskirts of a dark forest on a sloping hill. Above them the night sky was strewn with stars much bigger and brighter than the ones Jenny usually saw from her Vista Grande backyard. A moon of pure silver was rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door had slammed and disappeared, of course, as soon as they stepped through. Behind Jenny were meadows and pastures; before her a tangled mass of pitch-black trunks and bushes. The girls were alone on the hill in the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what?\" Audrey said, shivering fastidiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you know? It\u0027s your nightmare-you drew it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I drew a picture of me opening the Bloomies catalog and finding it blank,\" Audrey said. \"That\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emy worst nightmare. Don\u0027t look at me that way-shopping is cheaper than therapy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was all she would say about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a few scattered lights in the valley below them. \"But it\u0027s too far to hike,\" Jenny said, \"and even if we did get down there, I don\u0027t think that there would really be any people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey looked at her strangely, but Dee nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It feels like one of those model-train landscapes -or like a stage set,\" she said. \"False fronts. You\u0027re right, I don\u0027t think we\u0027d find little houses with people in them down there. Which means-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey faced the forest bleakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do I have a bad feeling about this?\" Jenny asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Dee said. \"Let\u0027s make it happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forest looked solid, but with Dee in the lead they found a way into it. It was mostly pine and fir trees, with the occasional beech shining silvery gray against the darkness of the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God,\" Audrey said after they\u0027d been walking some time. \"High ground, evergreen trees, rocks-I know where we are now. It\u0027s the Black Forest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like something from a story,\" Jenny muttered, picking her way through the undergrowth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a real place. I saw it when I was eight, when Daddy was at the German embassy. It-scared me a little, because it was the forest, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee threw a derisive glance over her shoulder. \"The forest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The forest where everything happened-where the Grimm brothers got all their fairy tales. You know, snow white. Hansel and Gretel. Little Red Riding-Hood and the-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey stopped in midsentence. In front of her, Dee had stopped, too. Jenny\u0027s knees locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust ahead of them in the tangled blackness, yellow eyes glowed. Jenny even imagined she could see moonlight gleaming off sharp teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three girls stood very still. Seconds passed and the yellow eyes remained motionless. Then they seemed to shift to a different angle so that one went out. Both flashed toward the girls again, then both went out. Jenny heard underbrush crunching. The sound got fainter. It faded into a profound silence in which Jenny could hear her heart beating strong and very fast in her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny let out her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee\u0027s shoulders heaved slightly. She reached down and picked up a long stick almost as thick as her own slim wrist. She settled it in her hand, waggling it, testing her grip. It made a good weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-and the Wolf,\" said Audrey, her voice suspiciously calm. She tucked stray wisps of hair into her French twist, her lips tight. The three of them looked at one another, then started walking again. What else was there to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was strange, that wolf coming just when you were talking about one,\" Dee said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless-\" Jenny stopped dead. \"Wait,\" she said. Something had fallen into place with an almost audible click. \"Let me think a minute... yes. It wasn\u0027t strange at all that the wolf came when Audrey was talking about it. Don\u0027t you see? He\u0027s taking it all from our own minds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" Audrey said, her well-bred nostrils flared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do you think? Julian. The Shadow Man. He\u0027s creating the Game around us-or we\u0027re doing it-but either way it\u0027s made up of our own thoughts. That hallway back in the house is the hallway from the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. It always scared me as a kid-so it came from my mind. And the door in the UFO was like a plane door I\u0027d seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee\u0027s eyes flashed like a jaguar\u0027s. \"And the parlor-I saw a lamp like that once in Jamestown. I wondered what it was doing here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything-every detail-is coming from us,\" Jenny said. \"Not just big things but little things. He\u0027s using our minds against us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s going to happen next?\" Dee asked Audrey. \"You\u0027re the one who should know what scares you most. I mean, should we be on the lookout for walking trees or little hooded men or what? Or was that wolf it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was only eight when I lived here,\" Audrey said coldly. \"And, no, I don\u0027t remember specifically which story ... disturbed me ... most. I had a German nurse, and she told me all of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Dee glared at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could run into something from any of our minds,\" Jenny said, to make peace. \"Anything could happen here. You can feel it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew in her heart that it was going to be something worse than the wolf. Something more un-mundane. Audrey didn\u0027t like anything supernatural, so it followed that whatever happened was going to be very.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember, it\u0027s all a dream, she told herself. But she could hear Julian\u0027s voice in her mind: \"I can tell you right off that one of you probably won\u0027t make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked. Underbrush clutched at Jenny\u0027s skirt like little fingers. The fragrance of evergreens surrounded them like a thousand Christmas trees. All Jenny could see was darkness and the endless tangle of forest ahead. Her nerves stretched and stretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey literally stumbled on the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne large tree grew there-a yew, Jenny thought. It stood in front of a great jumble of rocks and boulders that looked as if they might have been left by a glacier. The tree had rough bark, dark green needles, and red berries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGathered around it was a group of young men in weird clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were wearing pants and long over-tunics of leather trimmed with fur, very old-fashioned looking. Their arms were bare and muscular. The ground beside the tree had been cleared and a circle drawn on it. Inside the circle a fire burned, and red light glinted off daggers and what looked like drinking horns. The whole area was decorated with flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s some kind of secret ceremony,\" Dee whispered. \"And we\u0027re spying on it,\" she added with considerable relish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re certainly good-looking,\" Audrey murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were. Jenny counted seven of them, four with blond hair and three with blondish-brown. They looked as if they were in their late teens or early twenties, and if what they were doing was secret, they weren\u0027t bothering to be quiet about it. Jenny could hear laughter and boisterous singing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood grief, it\u0027s like a fraternity party, she thought. Even this far away she could smell the beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" said Audrey, \"I\u0027m Beginning to like this Game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped out before Jenny could stop her. The singing fell silent. Seven faces turned toward the girls. Then one of the German boys lifted a drinking horn over his head, and all the rest cheered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all seemed surprised but delighted to see the girls. White, even teeth flashed in friendly smiles, and they bundled the visitors over to the warmth of the fire. Audrey\u0027s bare legs caused a lot of appreciative comment, as did Dee\u0027s spandex leggings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No-no, thanks,\" Jenny said as one of them tried to get her to drink the stuff in his horn. The horn had angular symbols carved on it that made her nervous somehow-they reminded her of something. \"Audrey, what are they saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t catch it all. It\u0027s not like the German I learned,\" Audrey said. Seated between two admirers, her cool porcelain beauty contrasted with her flirtatious lashes. \"I think it must be archaic. But that one is saying that you\u0027re like Sif. It\u0027s a compliment-Sif was a goddess with shining golden hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, give me a break!\" Dee backed up to sit on a rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an instant stirring among the German boys. Several pulled Dee away from the rock pile, shaking their heads. Dee barely allowed them to move her, not at all placated by the way they marveled over her dark skin. And she only snorted when one offered her a garland of flowers to wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, put it on,\" Jenny said, flicking a small bug out of her own wreath. She was starting to enjoy this. The young men were nice, even if they did smell a bit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike sweat, they were about the most strapping youths she\u0027d ever seen, but several of them had braids in their hair, and they didn\u0027t seem to think weaving garlands was sissy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a ceremony to greet the spring,\" Audrey said as one of the blonds cried, \"Ostara!\" and poured beer on the ground. \"Ostara\u0027s the goddess of spring-that\u0027s where we get \u0027Easter.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young men began to chant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s something about life being renewed,\" Audrey said. \"There\u0027s something else-something I can\u0027t quite make out. They\u0027re ... asking? Petitioning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the German boys were on their feet by now, urging the girls to rise. They were facing the huge pile of boulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dokkalfar,\" they chanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s dark-something. I don\u0027t-oh, my God.\" Audrey\u0027s voice changed completely. She tried to pull away from the circle, but two of the German boys grabbed her. \"Dark elves,\" she said wildly. \"That\u0027s what they\u0027re saying. They came here to ask favors from the elves-and we\u0027re the yielding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny had never heard Audrey\u0027s voice like that before-bordering on hysteria. \"The what?\" she demanded. Suddenly the white, even smiles around her didn\u0027t look so friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The gift to the Otherworld. The sacrifice!\" Audrey cried. She was trying to get away again, but it was no good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re outnumbered more than two to one, Jenny thought. And they\u0027ve all got muscles. She looked at Dee-and felt shock ripple over her. Dee was laughing. Snickering, actually. Chortling. \"Elves?\" she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egasped. \"Little pixies in bluebells? Little guys who sit on acorns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you idiot,\" Audrey said through her teeth. \"Dark elves-Outdwellers. Oh, you don\u0027t understand-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny heard rock scraping. One of the huge stones in front of her was moving. It swung out slowly, pushing a ridge of dirt along in front of it. A black, gaping hole was revealed in the pile. A tunnel leading down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee\u0027s laughter was dying-but it was too late. The girls were pushed forward into the hole. Jenny tried to turn, but her Capezio flats slithered on dust and grit, and she felt herself falling. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-hunter-the-forbidden-game-1/page-7.html","bookId":2100,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:47 PM"}
