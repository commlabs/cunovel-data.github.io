He wanted to lie to her, to tell her, yes, he must have been wrong, but he knew that eventually she\u0027d have to accept the truth, and so he braced himself for her reaction, prayed she wouldn\u0027t faint on him, and then blurted out, \"As God is my witness, I heard them correctly. Everyone knows… but you,\" he stammered. \"They are going to England, and you are being taken to the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuchanan holding.

She turned and started to walk away, then stopped. \"Thank you, Proster, for explaining.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milady, if you still don\u0027t believe me, talk to Graeme and Lochlan.

Her voice was flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t say another word until they\u0027d returned to the cottage. Proster had just bowed to her and turned to leave when she called him back. \"Do you know where Kevin and Annie Drummond live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the soldiers know the Drummonds. When someone gets hurt, he goes to her for help. If he doesn\u0027t die on the way, she heals him. Most times, anyway,\" he added. \"Why do you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just curious,\" she lied. \"In a little while, I would like to return to my sister\u0027s home. Would you please accompany me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonored that the Buchanan\u0027s woman would choose him to escort her, he squared his shoulders. \"I would be happy to ride with you, but didn\u0027t you just come from your sister\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I forgot to give her the presents I brought from England, and she\u0027s most anxious to have them. When I\u0027m ready to leave, I\u0027ll send for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed the door softly, walked to the bed, and sat down, and then buried her face in her hands and wept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved with an urgency born out of desperation. Tearing the Buchanan plaid from her body, she threw it on the bed and reached for her English gown. She had already packed a small bag, filled it with the necessities she would need on her journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid interrupted her. Gillian heard her call out, opened the door a crack, and told her friend she wasn\u0027t feeling well. She tried to shut the door then, but Bridgid wouldn\u0027t let her. She pushed it open and rushed inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re ill, I\u0027ll help you. Why are you dressed in those clothes? Your husband won\u0027t like it. You should be wearing the Buchanan colors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her back to her friend Gillian tossed her brush into the bag and then tied it closed. When she turned around, Bridgid saw her face and knew something was terribly wrong. \"What is it?\" she demanded. \"Tell me and I\u0027ll help you any way that I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I just heard, but not until tomorrow. Your husband\u0027s soldiers won\u0027t be here until then. Is that what\u0027s upsetting you? Don\u0027t you want to go to your new home?\" she asked, trying desperately to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going home to England.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You cannot be serious…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m never wearing the Buchanan plaid again. Never,\" she cried out. \"Brodick betrayed me, and I will never, ever forgive him.\" The truth of it overwhelmed her, and she sat down on the bed before her legs gave out. \"He gave me his word that he and Iain and Ramsey would wait…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid sat beside her. \"They\u0027ve all gone to England.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered. \"Proster told me this morning that they had left. Brodick promised me that he would take me with him. I made him give me his word before I would tell him the names of the barons who helped Gideon take Alec Maitland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was their reason for taking the laird\u0027s son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn\u0027t mean to take him. They thought they\u0027d kidnapped Ramsey\u0027s brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid\u0027s mind was racing with questions. \"Start at the beginning and tell me what happened. Then maybe I can figure out a way to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t help me,\" she whispered. \"Oh, God, I don\u0027t know how I\u0027ll be able to protect my uncle now. I\u0027m so scared and I…\" Her voice broke on a sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid patted her arm and pleaded with her to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so Gillian told her everything, beginning with the night her father was murdered. By the time she was finished, she realized how hopeless her situation was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t return to England with the box or your sister, how will you save your uncle?\" Bridgid asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter now. As soon as the lairds attack, Alford will order Morgan\u0027s death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you think your uncle is still alive? You told me that Baron Alford has never kept his word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alford knows I won\u0027t give him the treasure until I see my uncle is safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid in her agitation began to pace about the cottage. \"But you don\u0027t have the box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I don\u0027t have it,\" she lamented. \"I had hoped that my sister would know where it was…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she didn\u0027t know,\" Bridgid said. \"Tell me again who was in the chamber with your father the night he gave Christen the treasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already told you that there were four soldiers with my father,\" she explained once again. \"And the reeve, Ector, but he was only in the chamber for a moment. Christen told me he gave Father a message and then left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid mulled the puzzle over in her mind, shook her head, and then asked, \"The soldiers assigned to protect you were both killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, they were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re absolutely certain? Did you see them die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I did, I don\u0027t remember. I was very young,\" she reminded her friend. \"But Liese told me they died protecting me. She was certain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But your sister isn\u0027t certain what happened to the soldiers who took her north. She\u0027s only guessing that they returned to your father\u0027s estate. Isn\u0027t that true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid interrupted her before she could finish. \"Then couldn\u0027t one of them have taken the treasure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"They were loyal and honorable men, and my father trusted them implicitly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps his trust was misplaced,\" she offered. \"It has to be one of them, or the reeve, but you just said that Ector was only in the chamber for a very short while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it couldn\u0027t have been Ector. He was daft.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was crazed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered impatiently. She stood up then and went to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked Proster to accompany me to my sister\u0027s home, and I\u0027m going to go get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you told me that Christen doesn\u0027t wish to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s true, but—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you going back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh she said, \"I\u0027m not really going to my sister\u0027s. Proster knows where the Drummonds live, and once we\u0027re on our way to Christen\u0027s, I\u0027m going to insist that he take me on to Annie\u0027s instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" she persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Kevin and Annie know the way to the Len holding, and I know the way home from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid was stunned. \"My God, you really are going back to England. You told me you were, but I didn\u0027t believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am.\" When Bridgid ran to her, she hugged her farewell. \"I want you to know how much your friendship has meant to me. I\u0027m going to miss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027ll see you again, won\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m not coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Brodick? You love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t love me. He used me, Bridgid, to get what he wanted. I meant so little to him that he couldn\u0027t…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too painful to talk about. Straightening away from her friend, she said, \"I must get going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Bridgid demanded when Gillian reached for the latch. \"I\u0027ll go hunt Proster down while you change your clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m never wearing the Buchanan colors again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be reasonable. Everyone will know you\u0027re up to something if you go outside wearing those clothes. You\u0027ve got to change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian realized her friend was right, they would notice. \"I wasn\u0027t thinking… I was so angry, and I… Yes, I\u0027ll change my clothes while you go get Proster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may take me a while to find him, but you stay here. Promise me you\u0027ll wait inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait. Remember,\" she warned, \"Proster thinks I\u0027m going to see Christen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Bridgid said as she opened the door. She stepped out onto the stoop, then turned to pull the door closed. Still puzzling over the disappearance of the treasure, her mind raced with possibilities. \"Could I ask you one more question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said that Ector was crazed. Were you exaggerating because he was a little peculiar, or did you really mean it? Was he truly crazed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, he was,\" she answered in a rush. \"Now, please hurry, Bridgid. I must get going as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I was just wondering…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would your father put a crazed man in charge of collecting the rents? That doesn\u0027t make any sense at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ector wasn\u0027t crazy then. Liese told me it was cowardice that broke his mind. After the siege he was never the same. I know Ector was mean-tempered, cruel, and terribly greedy. Now, please go and get Proster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid finally closed the door. Gillian removed her gown and was reaching for the plaid when she suddenly froze and let out a loud gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid was gone a long time, and when she returned to the cottage, Gillian was frantic with worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What took you so long?\" she demanded as soon as her friend came inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to do a few things first,\" she said. \"Proster\u0027s here, and he isn\u0027t alone. He\u0027s letting Ker and Alan ride along. They\u0027re acting like they\u0027re escorting a princess. You should have heard them carrying on. They\u0027re honored that you asked a MacPherson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re young is what they are,\" she countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been thinking about your plans,\" she said then. \"I don\u0027t think you should ride to the Drummonds because their home could be out of your way. Take a direct route to the Len holding. I\u0027m sure Proster knows the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the soldiers know the territory boundaries and where they can ride and where they can\u0027t. Their lives depend upon such knowledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t know how I can convince the soldier to take me there. I was going to tell him I needed Annie\u0027s treatment for my leg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then do that,\" she advised. \"But when we\u0027re on our way, then we\u0027ll tell Proster we must go to the Len holding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We? Bridgid, you cannot mean—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to England with you. I\u0027ve already packed my things and rolled them in a plaid so the soldiers won\u0027t be suspicious. It\u0027s tied behind the saddle of my mare. That\u0027s what took me so long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid\u0027s voice was calm, but her hands were fisted at her sides and she had a determined glint in her eyes. When Gillian began to shake her head, Bridgid hurried to convince her that her mind was made up and that nothing her friend would say could change her decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t anything for me here, and I won\u0027t stay and watch Ramsey marry Meggan. It would hurt too much. No, I can\u0027t stay. I won\u0027t. For God\u0027s sake, my own mother doesn\u0027t even want me around, and that\u0027s the truth of it. I don\u0027t know where else I could go. Please, Gillian. Let me come with you. I\u0027ve always been curious about England, and you told me that your Uncle Morgan had Highland blood. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll let me stay with him for a little while… until I decide what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t take you with me. You could get hurt and I wouldn\u0027t be able to protect you from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The baron?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered. \"You don\u0027t understand what he\u0027s like. He\u0027s a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you plan to protect yourself? You were ordered to return with your sister and the treasure, but you\u0027re going back without either. If anyone should be afraid, it\u0027s you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have a choice,\" she argued. \"I have to go back home, and you have to stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m begging you, Gillian. I accept the danger, and I take full responsibility for anything that might happen to me. Please reconsider. I have a plan in mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t live with myself if you were hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me ride with you as far as the Len holding. I can help you persuade Proster. I know I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ll come back here with them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Bridgid promised and immediately felt a wave of guilt for lying to her dear friend. She did have a sound plan and her mind was made up, and with or without Gillian\u0027s permission or approval, she was going to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We… that is, you… could run into Brodick and the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t think I will. They\u0027ll surely go to my Uncle Morgan\u0027s home first, and it\u0027s in the northwest of England, a remote area to be sure, and I\u0027m heading east to Dunhanshire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is this Baron Alford\u0027s estate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Due south from my uncle\u0027s home. God willing, by the time they reach Dunhanshire, the ransom will be paid and it will be over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will be over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian shook her head. She wasn\u0027t going to explain. Bridgid suddenly felt chilled to the bone. \"Shall we go then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStraightening her shoulders, Gillian nodded. As she walked through the doorway, she whispered, \"God be with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-Six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a desperate race against time. She knew she would reach Dunhanshire well before the fall festival, but her fear was that Brodick and Iain and Ramsey would get there before her. And God help them then. As angry as she was at her husband for deceiving her and as determined as she was never to return to the Highlands, she was still terrified for his safety. He had broken her heart, but she couldn\u0027t stop loving him. If he and the others tried to breach Alford\u0027s fortress, there would be a war and they would all die. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-52.html","bookId":1843,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM"}
