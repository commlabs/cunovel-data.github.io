Erekala saw them checking their soldiers—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole scene vanished in multiple eruptions, as if the entire slope had exploded beneath the Kolansii forces. The concussion rolled upwards to shake the summit, fracturing the wall and shaking the stone gates, taking hold of the wooden platform Erekala and the others stood on and rattling it so fiercely that they all lost their footing. Rails snapped and men and women tumbled over the sides, screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErekala grasped one side post, managed to hang on as successive shock waves slammed up the slope. Wolves protect us!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisting now on the strangely tilted platform, he saw the clouds lifting to blot out the view to the north – dust and dirt, armour and weapons and sodden strips of clothing – all of it now swept down towards them, a grisly rain of devastation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnmindful of the deadly deluge, Erekala pulled himself upright. One of the legs of the platform had snapped and he was alone – even Staylock had plummeted to the broken ground below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sword tip stabbed deep into the pine boards just off to his left, the blade quivering with the impact. More rubble rained down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared downslope, struggling to make sense of what he was seeing. All but the highest, nearest trench – along with the levelled ground behind it – was torn chaos, the ground wounded with overlapping craters steaming amidst chewed-up corpses. Most of the Kolansii army was simply … gone .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he saw movement once again, from the downward end – the same marines, swarming back up the slope, into the huge bites in the earth, up and over. Squads advancing, others drawing into tight clumps and beginning work on something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreams of Kolansii survivors, stunned, painted crimson, were retreating up towards the stone wall, clumping on the cobbled road. Most of the soldiers had flung away their weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like that, the Kolansii are finished .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange crackling bursts of fire from the marines, and Erekala’s eyes widened to see streaks of flame race out from squad positions, sizzling as they lunged up and into the air, arcing upslope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the dozen terrifying projectiles launched, only two directly struck the crowded road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe platform under Erekala pitched back, flinging him round. He lost his grip, slid past the embedded sword, and then he was falling. There was no sound. He realized that he had been deafened, and so in sweet, perfect silence, he watched the ground race up to meet him. And overhead, shadow stole the morning light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaylock had only just picked herself up – bruised and aching – when a closer detonation threw her back to the ground. The wall before her rippled, punching away the soldiers huddled against its protective barrier. And then, with a roar of fire, something descended on the gate to her right. The stones disintegrated in a flash of light. The sound of the impact threatened to crush her. Stunned, she staggered away from the blazing gate – saw Commander Erekala lying not ten paces away, in the wreckage of the toppled platform. Vague motions from his body drew her to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Brother Erekala!’ she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were open, but the whites were crazed with blood. His mouth opened and closed like that of a beached fish, but she could hear no breaths going in or out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she reached his side she heard a desperate gasp from the man, and all at once he was on his side, coughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Commander!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did not hear her – she could see that. She looked up – entire companies of Perish had been thrown to the ground by multiple impacts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not war .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is slaughter .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in her skull, she thought she could hear the howling of her gods. A sound of impotent rage and blind defiance. A sound that understood nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gloved hand grasped Stern by the shoulder and spun him round. Snarling, he reached for his sword, and then stared. ‘Fist!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Cease the bombardment immediately!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corporal looked up and down the rough line of redbolt stations. The crates positioned behind them had each been cracked, and bundles of fleece-packed padding lay torn and scattered between the crates and the launch sites. He did a quick count of the nearest ones. ‘Still got four or five salvos left, sir – right down the line!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I said stop! The High Fist does not want the Perish engaged!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStern blinked. ‘But we ain’t engaging the Perish!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Have you any idea how far those bolts are going?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corporal turned to spit grit from his mouth – there was another taste there, bitter, new to his tongue. ‘We’re softening up that wall, that’s all. Not one’s gone beyond it, Fist. On my word!’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-356.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
