He\u0027d conjured it from his staff, draining some of the item\u0027s magical essence in the process. The cost was worth it to keep out even the rudimentary spells the globe protected him from. Gromph knew the lich was capable of much more powerful castings-spells that would pass through the globe without the slightest degradation in power-but at least it would limit Dyrr\u0027s options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of the globe, no matter what he tried, Gromph couldn\u0027t get within sixty yards of the lich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe repulsion effect is coming from Dyrr\u0027s staff, Nauzhror whispered into Gromph\u0027s mind. We are studying possible solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe repulsion was another petty defense, another meager drain on a powerful item, and in that way Gromph and Dyrr were even-again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you afraid of, lich?\" the archmage called to his opponent. \"I won\u0027t try to kiss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDyrr, who was also floating above the black depths of the Clawrift, actually laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could simply float here,\" Dyrr replied, \"waiting for one of the defenses to go down-your globe, my repulsion . . . but where\u0027s the sport in that?\" \"Good question,\" Gromph whispered, not caring if the lich could hear him or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archmage began to cast a spell, and the lich pressed his fingertips together, waiting to defend against it. Gromph set himself moving through the air toward the lich the second he finished his incantation and knew it was successful when the distance between them abruptly closed. The repulsion effect successfully dispelled, Gromph swooped in quickly to get into range for a more damaging spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDyrr, who didn\u0027t seem the least bit surprised, dropped out of the air. Gromph knew he\u0027d dispelled the repulsion effect, not Dyrr\u0027s ability to fly. The lich was trying to escape into the black abyss of the Clawrift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph dropped after him. The air, moving fast over the surface of the magical globe that still surrounded him, made a curious humming sound that Gromph found distracting. Still, he managed to cast another spell as he flew and succeeded in closing the distance between them even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bead of pulsing orange light appeared in Gromph\u0027s right hand. He looked up at Dyrr, brought his arm back to throw the bead, and hesitated. Dyrr, a cold light in his dead eyes, was coming at him. The distance between the two mages was closing faster and faster-and the lichdrow was casting a spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words of Dyrr\u0027s spell-a series of almost nonsensical quatrains in an obscure dialect of Draconic-echoed around them both. Gromph drew his right arm back farther still, aiming the bead at his opponent\u0027s face while holding his staff in his left hand. Dyrr had something cupped in his own left hand and his own staff in his right. It was as if they were both looking in a mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDyrr threw his first. A cloud of sparkling red dust-Crushed rubies, Grendan reported-burst into the air around the lich. The dust swirled on some twist of wind for half a heartbeat then was gone. As the last grain of the powdered gemstone disappeared, Gromph threw the bead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archmage came to a sudden stop in the air. The breath was forced from his lungs, and he grunted loudly. His own staff hit him in the face, numbing his bottom lip and making his eyes water. His joints went limp for a few seconds, and his arms and legs flapped out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bead of compressed fire should have hit the lich in the face and exploded in a ball of flame six paces wide. It should have burned the lich\u0027s face off-but it didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph, as he finally gained control of his body and came to rest once again hovering in midair, could see the tiny speck of orange light fly true toward the lich\u0027s face then curve in the air and dive into the garish crown the Agrach Dyrr wizard had the audacity to wear. The bead blazed briefly to life in a splash of orange and yellow luminescence that lit the lichdrow\u0027s face but didn\u0027t come close to burning it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crown, Gromph thought. I should have remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fireball has been absorbed by the crown, Nauzhror hissed into Gromph\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph was certain he\u0027d see it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe item will allow him to redirect the fireball at you, Grendan warned. Yes, gentlemen, Gromph replied. Thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDyrr drew to an abrupt stop and hung in the air, bouncing ever so slightly. He looked like a mushroom cap bobbing on the surface of Donigarten Lake. Gromph, on the other hand, was frozen in air, standing on what felt like a solid surface but looked like a dim, phosphorescent glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph\u0027s globe was still up, but it wasn\u0027t the only thing that surrounded him. An impressive spell, Nauzhror said. Difficult to cast and expensive what with the ruby dust and all. It\u0027s nothing you can\u0027t handle, Archmage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A forcecage?\" Gromph asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lichdrow didn\u0027t bother answering. Instead, he began to cast another spell. Clearly he thought he had Gromph trapped, so of course he would take advantage of the situation. The archmage brought a spell to mind and rushed through the casting of it, racing the lich, though he would likely still have to suffer through whatever Dyrr was throwing at him. He needed to get the forcecage off him. Being trapped in a magical box was hardly convenient at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDyrr\u0027s spell took effect half a heartbeat before Gromph\u0027s. As the lich finished the last gestures and the final complex verbalization and crunched a lodestone and a pinch of dust in his right hand, something opened under the archmage\u0027s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph\u0027s spell went off, and his own globefell victim to it-but so did the forcecage-and Gromph was falling into whatever it was Dyrr had conjured underneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archmage touched his brooch and made himself stop quickly, well before he contacted Dyrr\u0027s dramatic magical effect. As he drew himself up, moving farther and farther away from it, Gromph looked down-and into a whole other universe. The lichdrow had opened a gate beneath him, and a blinding, eye-searing light poured out of it. Gromph had seen light like it only a few times in his long life. It was sunlight, and the Archmage of Menzoberranzan didn\u0027t like it at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you trying to send me?\" Gromph asked his opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe World Above? Prath mused, though only Gromph could hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDyrr didn\u0027t answer but busied himself gathering some spell component or perhaps another magic item.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve imprisoned me more than once already,\" Gromph went on, \"though they seem to hold me less time each attempt. Now you want to send me away? For pity\u0027s sake, Dyrr, why not simply kill me and get it over with? Or isit that you can\u0027t kill me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph certainly wished that were the case-and maybe by some bizarre twist of fate it was-but Dyrr seemed to have something else in mind. The lich finished casting his spell. The immediate effect was that Gromph\u0027s stomach lifted in his gut. He caught his breath in a hissing gasp and started to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t levitate-Dyrr had dispelled the magic that was keeping him aloft-and Gromph fell toward the rotating pool of daylight beneath him. Knowing Dyrr, it would be a worse fate than simply splattering at the bottom of the Clawrift. It was a fate Gromph would do anything to avoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archmage extended himself, wiping more stored energy, more access to the Weave from his mind than he normally would have had to, but he needed the spell to take effect faster and couldn\u0027t spare the time for complicated incantations. The effect felt the same as Dyrr\u0027s dispelling of his levitation, but instead of falling down, Gromph drifted to a stop then started falling upward. The source of gravity, with enough magic, could be moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph twisted in the air as he accelerated toward the roof of the cavern that housed Menzoberranzan. As the lich crossed his field of vision, Gromph could see him grimace in frustration. The archmage didn\u0027t waste time gloating. His brooch was useless to him-at least for the time being-Gromph would continue to fall upward toward the new source of gravity until he was dashed against the ceiling. He would have to stop himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe command word, Gromph sent to the masters of Sorcere. Quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe staff that he\u0027d used to surround himself in the globe of protective magic had been charged with more than one effect. He\u0027d never used it, but the staff would grant him the same power of levitation as his brooch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSshivex, Nauzhror provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sshivex,\" Gromph repeated and immediately began to levitate \"up\" and away from the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a fraction of a second-before he \"landed\" on the ceiling-Gromph once again drew to a halt in midair. The pool of blinding sunlight was far below him. The light made it difficult, but Gromph finally managed to spot the lichdrow, who was flying slowly, well away from the gate, and casting another spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was close, Dyrr,\" Gromph called out. \"You almost-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words caught in Gromph\u0027s throat. His vision blurred. For a few seconds he couldn\u0027t breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You al-\" Gromph started again, but the words were pinched off when his throat clamped shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears welled up in the archmage\u0027s eyes, and a wave of overwhelming despair passed through him, leaving his skin clammy, and his head spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s an enchantment, Grendan told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to die. Gromph knew that with absolute certainty, but what was worse, Menzoberranzan would die soon after him. Everything he\u0027d built over a life spent in the corridors of power had come to nothing. Menzoberranzan was eating itself alive. Everything Gromph had considered a strength-in himself, and in his race-had proven a weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA compulsion, added Prath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hate and mistrust, the vendettas and animosities, had finally come home to roost. The once great City of Spiders had been reduced to a besieged, ragged, self-destructing ruin of its former glory-glory that was proving with every dead drow to have been a lie all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFight it, Archmage, Nauzhror urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLolth was dead, and Gromph would be dead soon too. Lolth was dead, and so was House Baenre. So was Sorcere. So was Menzoberranzan. It had all come to nothing, as he himself had come to nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArchmage . . . Nauzhror prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph\u0027s body shuddered through an alien sensation: a sob. He wiped at his eyes with the back of his hand and tried to blink away the tears, but more came. Through the tears he saw that Dyrr had moved and was floating above him. \"That\u0027s it, young Baenre,\" the lichdrow said. \"Lament. Cry for fallen Menzoberranzan. Cry for House Baenre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCry? Gromph thought. Am I crying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slow,\" Dyrr said,his voice like a gentle caress against Gromph\u0027s pain-ravaged brow. \"Stop, young mage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, a voice in Gromph\u0027s mind all but shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph hadn\u0027t realized he was moving-levitating slowly \"down\" toward the ceiling, moving away from the blinding light pouring from Dyrr\u0027s gate. The archmage slowed his descent and came to a stop, hanging only a few yards from the jagged stalactites that hung from the ceiling like fangs ready to puncture the neck of Menzoberranzan the Mighty, ready to punish them all for their weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There . . .\" the lichdrow murmured, his voice sending a quivering chill down Gromph\u0027s spine. \"There . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lich was holding something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did he get so close?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArchmage, the voice in his head asked, shall I come help you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he thought back at the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph tried to flinch away, but the lichdrow touched him with a long, thin wand of gem-inlaid silver. The touch of it sent a wave of blinding agony ripping through the archmage\u0027s body. Every muscle tensed, joints popped, and the wizard clenched his teeth against the pain. His eyes watered more, and Gromph could feel tears streaming down his tingling black cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away from the lich, rolling in the air, and faced down toward the gate. His eyes closed against the light, but he blinked them open and saw the briefest flash of a silhouette: Dyrr in shadow against the sunlight. The lichdrow was below him but had been above him. Gromph wasn\u0027t sure at that instant what he was seeing. Dyrr had fooled him, or he was disoriented ... or he was dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I dying? Gromph thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I?\" he said aloud then clamped a hand over his face, closing his eyes and mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Archmage, said the voice in his head. You are under the effect of a powerful enchantment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, Gromph lost all memory of any plan, of any determination, of any purpose for the ruin of a life he\u0027d been cursed with. He wanted to get away. He needed to run, but he was still the Archmage of Menzoberranzan, so he cast a spell that would get him away a little faster, a little farther. With a few words and gestures he\u0027d repeated so many times that even in his confused, despairing state of mind he managed to get right, Gromph brought forth the magic to open a doorway through the dimensions-a break in space and time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph levitated toward it, but something hit him and hit him hard. It was Dyrr. The lichdrow had put away his wand. The slim magical weapon caused physical damage and pain, but it didn\u0027t cause an impact-not like that. The air was forced from Gromph\u0027s lungs again, and he found himself pinwheeling through the air. The light from the gate grew brighter and brighter, and Gromph was only dimly aware that he was moving toward it. The pain was everywhere, still burning from the wand and joined by whatever it was that had hit him to send him falling toward the light. The pain turned to numbness in spots then was gone, and Gromph took a deep, shuddering breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ring, he thought. I have a ring that will. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Archmage, the voice said, the ring. The ring will keep you alive but not forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph closed his eyes tight again and let his body relax. The ring he\u0027d slipped on at Sorcere before meeting Dyrr at the Clawrift would regenerate injuries: knit broken bones back together, seal cuts, even re-grow severed limbs. He remembered putting the ring on but couldn\u0027t for the life of him remember why. What could possibly have been the point? To live? To live in the shattered ruins of a Menzoberranzan ruled by the traitorous Dyrr and an army of stinking gray dwarves?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph touched the ring, grabbed it with the opposite hand, and was about to rip it from his finger so it would let him die, when he saw the lichdrow swooping down at him, cackling. Laughing at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it off,\" Dyrr chuckled. \"It won\u0027t help with burns anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArchmage! another voice shouted into his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lich blinked and jerked forward with his head and shoulders. From the grotesque crown on his head came a tiny ball of undulating orange light. It spiraled through the air, riding a sort of wave, and drew a long, curved trajectory directly at Gromph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour fireball, the voice in his head warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My fireball . . .\" the archmage whispered, as he instinctively tucked himself into a fetal position, wrapping his body around his staff and closing hiseyes tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with his eyes closed the flare of hot orange light burned his retinas. The fireball warmed his skin but didn\u0027t burn him. He and the other Masters of Sorcere had thought, of course, to protect him against fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little longer . . .\" the archmage murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gromph,\" the lichdrow spat back. \"You live!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now,\" was the archmage\u0027s shaking, muttered reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDyrr didn\u0027t wait for Gromph to elaborate. He began to work another spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fireball had broken Gromph\u0027s concentration on the levitation effect, and once again his stomach lurched up as he began to fall. Gravity was still upside down, and his fall took him away from the gate and toward the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Dyrr finished his spell, Gromph began to list in his own mind the many reasons he should simply let himself fall into the ceiling and die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the troubled archmage could reach a conclusion, shards of jagged, half-molten rock burst into existence, flying with extraordinary speed toward the falling archmage. There were too many of them to count, and Gromph, mumbling to himself of his lost position and the bleak fate of his House, didn\u0027t bother trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the meteors entered the area in which Gromph had affected gravity, their courses radically changed. They went everywhere, scattering, dipping, curving, colliding with each other, some even curving back at Dyrr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the burning projectiles struck Gromph a glancing blow, sending him spinning as he fell. Pain blazed in his side, and without thinking he cast a spell. With only a few words and a quick gesture, Gromph\u0027s skin tightened, stretched-painfully-and took on the gleam, and the hardness, of cold black iron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery good, Master, the voice ... it was Nauzhror . . . said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph watched one of the meteors come right at him. He might have twisted out of the way, but he didn\u0027t care. The rock hit him square in the chest, exploding in a shower of yellow-orange sparks and sending a deafening clang rippling away from him in the air. He started to spin in a different direction and began to wonder why he hadn\u0027t hit the ceiling. As he whirled around he saw Dyrr slip through a dark hole in the sky that was rimmed with purple light like faerie fire. The lichdrow was passing through a dimension door of his own to avoid the meteors that had come careening back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinning, falling, Gromph saw the jagged, stalagmite-cluttered ceiling racing toward him, closer and closer-only inches from oblivion, from the sweet release of death- -and the spell effect ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph hadn\u0027t made it permanent after all. Gravity went back to its normal place, and once again Gromph hung in midair for a second-less than a second maybe-his stomach feeling as if it were rotating in his belly. He started to fall again but toward the floor-toward the Clawrift, toward the light, toward the gate, toward wherever it was that Dyrr was trying to send him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph didn\u0027tcare. He\u0027d go, then. He\u0027d go anywhere as long as he could get out of Menzoberranzan, where every stone, every stalactite and stalagmite, every glow of faerie fire, reminded him of his failure and despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArchmage, Nauzhror said. Gromph . . . no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing his eyes against the blinding sunlight, Gromph fell through the gate. Squinting, able only to see a vague play of shadow and light, he watched the gate close behind him. He was enveloped, enclosed in blinding light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hit the ground hard enough to break a leg, more than a few ribs, his left arm, and very nearly his neck. Quivering from pain and shock, blinded by the relentless sunlight, Gromph lay in a heap on a bed of what felt like some kind of moss. Blood roared in his ears, which were still ringing from the whine of the meteors and the rush of wind. Something in his chest popped, and his leg twitched out from under him, rolling him over onto his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph put a hand over his face and realized that his broken arm was obeying his commands with only a little pain. His leg was numb and tingling, and he could actually feel his ribs popping back into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ring, he thought again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost wanted to laugh. It was his own fault after all, for insisting on wearing that cursed ring. He\u0027d wanted to save his own life when he\u0027d put it on, and it hadn\u0027t occurred to him then that all it would end up doing was keeping him alive in whatever blazing hell Dyrr had banished him to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph blinked his eyes open and found that he could actually see. The light was still uncomfortably bright, but something had moved between the brightest part of it and himself. The archmage blinked again, rubbed his eyes, and struggled to sit up. His face was still wet with tears, andhe was breathing hard-panting like a slave at hard labor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you keerjaan?\" a voice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph held out a hand, fending off the voice, and blinked some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all at once that he realized the thing that had come between him and the source of the light was a creature of some kind, and it was speaking to him. \"Am I . . . ?\" the archmage started to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused, rubbed his eyes, and found himself concentrating on a spell he\u0027d long ago made permanent. It was a spell that allowed him to understand and be understood by anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" the strange creature asked, and Gromph understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up and saw that he was surrounded by tiny, drowlike creatures-drowlike in that they were roughly the same shape, with two arms, two legs, and a head. There the similarity ended. The creatures that surrounded him had pale skin that was almost pink. Their hair was curly and an unsightly shade of brown-orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir skin was spattered with tiny brown spots. Plastered on their faces were the most childlike expressions of delighted curiosity. They hovered around him in a circle, several feet off the plant-covered ground, each of them borne aloft on a set of short feathered wings of the most garish colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of them were naked, though some wore robes of flowing white silk, and a couple wore breeches and fine silk blouses. They were no more than three feet tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By all the howling expanse of the Abyss, Dyrr,\" Gromph murmured, curling his legs under him and resting his face in his hands, \"where have you dropped me?\" Words began to pop into his mind like soap bubbles bursting: Halflings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrushing ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrushing despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you,\" Gromph breathed, his body relaxing, his eyes drying, his mood lifting as if by magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t magic that was lifting it, he realized. It was magic that sank it in the first pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well played, traitor,\" Gromph said, looking up into the bright blue sky of the . . . where was he? The World Above?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you talking to?\" one of the winged halflings asked, tipping its head to one side like a confused pack lizard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where am I?\" Gromph asked the strange creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archmage, not waiting for an answer, stood, brushing soot, dust, and pieces of the odd, needle-like plant life from his piwafwi. He leaned on his staff, but thanks to the ring he was feeling stronger with each breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know where you are?\" one of the winged halflings-a female-asked. \"Tell me where I am, or I\u0027ll kill you and ask someone else,\" Gromph growled. The halflings reacted, maybe with fear-Gromph couldn\u0027t be sure. They bobbed up and down and quivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a cambion?\" one of them asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a drow,\" Gromph replied, \"and I asked you a question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe winged halflings all looked at each other. Some smiled, some nodded-some smiled and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get here?\" the female asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked you a question,\" Gromph repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female smiled at him, and Gromph had to squint from the brightness of her perfect white teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you come here from . . . where did you come from?\" one of the males said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am from Menzoberranzan,\" replied Gromph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s that?\" asked another of the males.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Underdark,\" Gromph said, his crushing despair gone, being replaced by burningimpatience. \"Faerun . . . Toril?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faerun,\" one of the males gasped. The others looked at him and he said, \"I was from there. From Luiren. Faerun is a continent, and Toril is a world. On the Prime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other winged halflings nodded and shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" the one who\u0027d asked the question before repeated, \"how could you come here from Menzoberranzan, the Underdark, Faerun, Toril, and not know where you are?\" \"You\u0027re not even on the Prime anymore, drow,\" said the halfling who\u0027d claimed to be from Faerun. Gromph could see contempt starting to manifest in that halfling\u0027s beady brown eyes. \"You\u0027ve come to the Green Fields, and you don\u0027t belong here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right,\" Gromph said. \"I\u0027m not staying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking over the vast landscape of gently rolling hills covered in a blanket of the tiny green, needle-like plants and punctuated with a scattering of rainbow-colored blossoms like delicate, paper-thin mushrooms, Gromph almost sank into despair again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDyrr had sent him far-sent him to another plane of existence altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Green Fields,\" Gromph repeated. \"Halfling Heaven. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNauzhror, he thought, sending the name out into the Weave. Grendan? Can you hear me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGromph sighed. It was going to take him a while to get home. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-15.html","bookId":2163,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:06 PM"}
