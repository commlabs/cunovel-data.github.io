I could almost feel my dick shriveling up and retreating back inside my body. I didn\u0027t mind taking this stuff off of a woman, but standing in the middle of a room surrounded by this crap made me feel entirely too in touch with my feminine side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus f**k, what is THAT?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a ball gag mask, Carter. I take it you aren\u0027t into bondage?\" Liz asked seriously, noticing the direction of my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, I….umm…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it hot in here all of a sudden?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever tied up a partner? Used whips? Experimented in anal play? Had a threesome? Would you say you\u0027re more of a dominant or a submissive? When was the last time you were checked for STD\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I mean, I….\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many sexual partners have you had in the last five years? Have you ever been convicted of a sex crime against another human, animal or plant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ELIZABETH!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh thank God. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been happier to hear the sound of Claire’s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got my eye on you,\" Liz whispered, looking me up and down and doing the whole two-finger point from her eyes to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duly noted,\" I muttered as I walked past her and over to the doorway behind the counter where Claire was currently standing with her hands on her hips. Since she was busy staring over my shoulder shooting dirty looks at Liz, I had the opportunity to take her in unnoticed. It was unbelievable how she seemed to have gotten even more beautiful than the last time I saw her. Maybe it was because I knew her so much better than before. Her hair was up in a messy ponytail with stray pieces falling down around her face. I noticed a smudge of flour or maybe powdered sugar on her cheek and I wanted to lick it off. My dick got hard just thinking about tasting her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll deal with you later, Liz,\" Claire threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut your mouth and get your scraggly ass back in the kitchen where you belong, whore!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire rolled her eyes and jerked her head behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, I\u0027ll show you my part of the store.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for my hand like it was the most natural thing in the world. When our skin touched I had a hard time forcing my feet to move. I just wanted to stand there and stare at her. Claire smiled at me and turned, pulling me gently along behind her. We walked through the storage room of Liz’s store and it took everything in me not to reach out and grab her ass. Fuck, she was wearing jeans again. This woman in a pair of jeans should be illegal. My brain didn\u0027t work when she wore jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And here is my half of Seduction and Snacks,\" Claire stated proudly as we left Liz’s storage room and entered her kitchen. With her hand still in mine, she led me through the kitchen to the front of the store, pointing things out to me. Where Liz’s store was all dark colors and rich fabrics, Claire\u0027s side was light and airy and full of bright colors. In the front of the store, she had three light yellow walls and one light pink wall. Behind the counter there was just enough wall hanging down from the ceiling to hold three large chalkboards, filled with all the store had to offer along with prices. Below the chalkboards, the wall ended and you could see straight into the kitchen. All around the room were framed pictures of cupcakes, candies and different sayings that had to do with her business. A pink and brown wooden sign on one wall stated “Money can’t buy happiness but it can buy chocolate, which is kind of the same thing.” and a yellow and brown one by the door read “A balanced diet is a cookie in each hand.” Aside from the warm, inviting atmosphere, the smell alone would put you in a good mood. For once, the smell of chocolate didn\u0027t bother me like it usually did. Maybe, because Claire was standing right next to me, and all I could think about was tasting her instead of the memories that scent usually brought me. I moved a step towards her and took the fact that she didn\u0027t move away or let go of my hand as a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seduction and Snacks is a great name. It’s probably more appropriate than Blow Jobs and Baked Goods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed nervously, but still didn’t move away from my close proximity. This near to her, I could see that her eyes weren’t just liquid brown. They also had tiny specs of gold in them that made it look like someone had sprinkled a handful of glitter in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The place looks great,\" I told her, taking another step in her direction, wanting to be as close to her as possible. I reached down by her side and slid my free hand into hers, the fingers of both of our hands intertwining. She swallowed and licked her lips nervously but didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" she mumbled, her eyes staring straight at my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck, did she want me to kiss her? Should I do it? Just lean in and press my lips to hers? Why do I feel like a twelve year old that has no experience? Why can’t I stop asking myself these annoying questions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took one last step, closing the distance between us. I let go of her hands so I could slide mine behind her and rest them on her lower back, pulling her flush against me in the process. Her hands flew up to my chest but she didn\u0027t push me away. She rested them there and finally looked up into my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It smells good in here. What did you make?\" I asked quietly, leaning my head down closer to her lips, thankful that she was finally in my arms and amazed at how right she felt there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"N-nothing,\" she stammered. \"I was just making a list of all the supplies I need to order and stocking the flour on the shelves.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-35.html","bookId":1853,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM"}
