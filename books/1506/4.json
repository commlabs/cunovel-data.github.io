The battle hadn’t ended, yet she had been out of it!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMaetel was looking at Artpe blankly. He spoke icily towards her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Wake up, Maetel. We are no longer children who live within the fences of a village.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Artpe······.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOther 12 year old girls could act like this right now, but a hero didn’t have that luxury. Even if Maetel’s goodwill towards him decreased, he wanted her to have a mean streak.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe hero in his previous life was too soft.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShe had been softer than a cheese matured for half a year! Instead of giving her a curriculum for the gifted, he needed to make a hero who was cold and spiteful!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“...is too cool.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Huh?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, his intentions was off by a little bit. Maetel’s cheeks were flushed as she ran towards Artpe. She grabbed both of his hands and started yelling excitedly as she jumped around. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Artpe is too cool! You really are like a hero!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“You are the hero! Ah, I guess I’m also a hero now...”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEven as he said it, his words gave him goosebumps. Artpe couldn’t think of anyone else in this world who was as unsuitable for the role of a hero as him! On the other hand, it seemed like Maetel viewed Artpe as a cool hero.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I want to be like Artpe!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“No, you won’t.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eArtpe spoke with a serious face. Maetel’s spirit was finally dampened a little bit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Anyways, you should never put down your guard until all of your enemies are dead. Even fallen enemies should be checked. I want you to double check even if the enemy’s throat was cut, do you understand?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Yes, I understand. I’ll bear it in mind!... So the enemy doesn’t die even if its throat is cut?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eArtpe clicked his tongue at Maetel’s naive question. It wouldn’t be called a monster if it died so easily!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I’m not sure about these small fishes, but later on, there are bastards who survive even after being cut into 17 pieces. The criteria for finding out if a monster is dead is to use Mana.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Mana?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“You’ve handled Mana not too long ago, and you’ve also acquired skills… I’ll teach it to you slowly.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Yes!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“However, there is something else I have to teach you first.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eArtpe approached a dead goblin and tapped the corpse. Suddenly, a yellow coin fell from its body. When she saw this, Maetel’s eyes turned round.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Why do monsters have money!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“That is a very good question.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eArtpe kicked the remaining two goblins and picked up the coins. He let out a fresh smile as he spoke.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I don\u0027t know the answer either!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis was the moment when the hero learned of Looting.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-reincarnated-for-nothing/irfn-chapter-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-reincarnated-for-nothing/irfn-chapter-4\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-reincarnated-for-nothing/irfn-chapter-3","bookId":1506,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:36:15 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:36:15 AM"}
