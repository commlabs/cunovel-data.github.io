Some people are born with a musical ear. They can pick up an instrument and play a tune with no training while others can attend class after class, but never really learn how to play. Some people are born artists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you were born seeing ghosts?\" she demanded. \"I guess that gave new meaning to the term imaginary friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"What I\u0027m trying to say is that there are gray regions in life. You\u0027re afraid right now. I don\u0027t blame you. Questioning your own mental health can be even more frightening than admitting you commune with ghosts. It\u0027s not perfectly natural, no. But it doesn\u0027t make you a lunatic. All scientists know that there are still things in the world that defy logic and explanation. We understand gravity, life, evolution, ages long gone. We\u0027re constantly questioning faith. Men live and die for their beliefs. But none of us has the definitive answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe offered a skeptical smile. \"Not even you? Don\u0027t your ghosts fill you in on everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Ghosts are usually wandering around a little lost themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. It\u0027s that thing about a violent end, or a need to finish something, find someone, even take revenge, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was half sincere question, half skepticism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are different reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down, smoothed her napkin again. He had gone for his own. Their fingers brushed. She looked at him, startled, and he returned the intense stare, equally aware of the electricity between them. A tremor shook the length of him. She was appealing on so many levels, sensual in the most natural of ways, the opposite of internationally provocative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t trust him, though. She wanted him at arm\u0027s length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew his fingers away, afraid that he would lose her if he wasn\u0027t careful, that she would stand up and leave and demand that he stay away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nikki, I believe with my whole heart that I can help you. And I also desperately need your help in return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t bolt, though her eyes remained downcast. Then she looked up at him again. \"Who was the man in the picture you showed me today? And when did he die? Was he supposedly dead when I saw him at Madame\u0027s? Or was he killed after?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"The ME could only give an approximate time of death. I think he might still have been alive the first time you saw him, but in serious trouble. I don\u0027t know. And who was he? An undercover FBI agent, a man above reproach. The kind of guy who couldn\u0027t be bought, not for any price. He\u0027d been undercover in some of our worst slums, among the most heinous drug lords, in war zones. He was on to something here. He managed to keep his cover by keeping private until he really had something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew him?\" Nikki asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent shook his head. \"No. That\u0027s part of the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know he was so lily white, then?\" she asked softly. \"And why is it a problem that you didn\u0027t know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I work for a man who travels in the highest government circles possible. But he never trusts anything without proof. Adam Harrison always goes to the people who knew someone best, those who were closest. When you don\u0027t hear anything but lily white all the way around, you can pretty much bet it\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I thought he was a bum, and he was really a great guy. There you go. I\u0027m a great judge of character, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw what you were intended to see,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is it bad that you didn\u0027t actually know him yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he didn\u0027t know me, either, so he has no reason to trust me now. But you saw him again. On the street the other night, and that\u0027s part of the problem, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe licked her stir stick absently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tremors rocked through his body again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusiness. He was a professional. A professional ghost buster, some mocked, but still a professional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever mix business and pleasure. Never. Not in this. Not in matters of life and death. Not when there was the least chance it could weaken the perception or the wits…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw him, yes,\" she murmured. Then she stared at him with her huge eyes pleading. \"They must have made a mistake. He isn\u0027t dead. It\u0027s someone else—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe exhaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you know,\" he added, \"that Andy is dead, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him, smiling sadly. \"Yes, Andy is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you keep seeing her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she murmured, looking down, then quickly back up. \"She even changed clothes. From the T-shirt she was wearing when… to the suit I chose for her funeral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s here to help you, you know,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me? So far, my friends think I\u0027m nuts, and I nearly alienated a woman on the tour tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled ruefully. \"It can be difficult, to say the least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twirled her swizzle stick in her now-empty mug. \"Maybe I do need a drink,\" she said. \"No, no, I\u0027ll start seeing polka-dotted elephants or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another latte?\" he suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him suddenly, aqua eyes assessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re telling me mat I have a special gift—something like an artist or a musician has. And it\u0027s been drawn out because Andy wants to help me. And you—whoever you are—have the same gift. And I\u0027m not insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And other people have this gift, as well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why haven\u0027t I ever heard of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, hands lifting. He was careful not to touch her. The scent of her perfume was so subtle. Like the whisper of her movement, the touch of her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely you\u0027ve read stories about… well, hauntings. Usually written by people on the periphery. Those who have a touch of something on a different level than most people even experience. Those who have to become deeply involved… well, they\u0027re usually fairly circumspect about the whole thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, sure,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need your help,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, staring at him intently again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you need mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just… just exactly what do you want from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to get to know your ghosts,\" he said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you… just walk up and introduce yourself?\" she asked, half laughing. Her laughter faded uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t know me. They don\u0027t trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy would have loved you,\" she murmured. She shook her head. \"Exactly how do I introduce you to my ghosts? I never actually had a conversation with your dead agent. I saw him at Madame\u0027s—either dead or alive—and again in the street when he was definitely… dead. And as to Andy… I never actually know when I\u0027m going to see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can look for her. Together,\" he said. \"If she knows that you trust me, maybe she\u0027ll trust me, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know that I do trust you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you do,\" he chanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought an uneasy flush to her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood. He thought she intended to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need more coffee, and I don\u0027t need a drink. Walk me home,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian was definitely nervous about Nikki going off with the stranger. Not that he controlled Nikki\u0027s social life, but something about the man bothered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Nikki wasn\u0027t in her right mind. Not since Andy\u0027s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had walked away, he\u0027d watched uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaced in front of Madame\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Madame herself had come out. \"What\u0027s going on?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um… Nikki… uh, kind of has a date,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" she murmured, staring down the street. She was silent for a minute. \"I don\u0027t think Nikki should have a date right now, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell Nikki what to do,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might have discouraged her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So… she\u0027s seeing ghosts, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s really upset about Andy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Madame studied him. \"Do you know the guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of. We met him the other night, then saw him at the police station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cops have been known to be… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be what?\" Julian demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dirty,\" Madame said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think I should follow them?\" Julian asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian stared at Madame, then sped off after Nikki and Blackhawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t like it. He didn\u0027t like any of it. The strange guy… the talk of ghosts. It was far too unnerving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t healthy. Not for anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially Nikki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a great apartment,\" Brent Blackhawk said, eyeing the place from the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I love it,\" Nikki said. They stood awkwardly before the door for several seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait until you\u0027re in and the place is locked up,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the breeze brush by her hair. The light scent of whatever cologne he wore drifted along with it. The solidity of his presence was ridiculously reassuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd frightening. She didn\u0027t really know him. He was definitely beyond the ordinary. She wondered idly what this moment would have been like if they\u0027d been on a date. She\u0027d always had her personal set of rules. A first date was a get to know you, and that was that. She was a big fan of Sex and the City, had all the episodes on tape, but that wasn\u0027t her lifestyle. In everything, personal and business, she had a tendency to be slow and careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if it had been a date…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart was racing as if this was the moment for a first kiss. The whisper of the breeze was perfect, seeming to urge her to step closer. Revel in the feel of his skin. The heat of his body. She was almost tempted to tilt her chin, close her eyes, smile, part her lips… wait. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-21.html","bookId":2268,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
