Stunned and... repulsed? No. Not really. Not for her. Just stunned a bit. And dazed. Too much story. Too much data. Too much monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey really know how to rip up Life, don\u0027t they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how did he feel about her? How did he really... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay it, you stalling buffoon! Do you still... love her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, he thought at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what, he wondered, am I smiling about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only other door to the room - the one to the bedroom used by the ladies - opened. It was Annabelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she okay?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabelle first closed the door carefully behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she\u0027ll sleep,\" she said. \"You should try to do the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix looked around at the empty room filled with smoke and overflowing ashtrays and half-empty glasses. The others had gone to their rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll just give her a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabelle smiling knowingly. Sometime during Davette\u0027s tale she had busied herself knitting some large multicolored whatever. She resumed her seat and picked it up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were wonderful for her tonight,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix shrugged. \"Not hard to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what took you so long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" he asked innocently. \"I\u0027ve only known her for - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felix!\" she intoned, sounding like everyone\u0027s mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped short, grinned. \"Yeah. Well, I\u0027m not used to this falling-in-love-at-first-sight stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabelle grinned at him. \"That\u0027s better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around and busied himself making a drink he didn\u0027t need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was angry that she was with Crow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Annabelle gasped. \"You thought that she and Jack were...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? Oh, no. Not at all. But...\" He lit a cigarette and looked at her. \"See, I\u0027ve been waiting for my wife to come along all my life and, well, avoiding this kind of shit at the same time. Then I see her and there\u0027s Jack and...\" He shook his head. \"I shoulda figured I couldn\u0027t have one without the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought he looked almost embarrassed. \"She loves you, too, you know,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up. \"You think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know so.\" She eyed him carefully. \"Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her quickly, looked down, smiled. \"Yeah.\" This time he was definitely embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figures,\" he added, \"the way her luck\u0027s been running.\" And then they both smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow weird you are, Felix, she thought. What a weird, dark, scary young man you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were quiet for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felix, what have you been doing all this time? Since Mexico?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I run the saloon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged again. \"The past couple of years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And before that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this time he just looked into his glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabelle eyed him carefully, a smile curling up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felix, just how rich are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, surprised. \"What makes you think I\u0027m...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How rich?\" she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, relaxed, grinned. \"Very.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Millions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Many.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, almost to herself. \"Rich, single, young, obviously well educated... Young man, what have you been doing all this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he looked at her and had no answer. But Jack Crow, at the doorway, did. \"He\u0027s been waiting for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes, Jack,\" drawled Felix lazily, \"you sound just like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the three of them laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow fetched himself a glass of ice water and sat down across from them and got right to the point. \"What\u0027s it gonna be, Felix? You coming with us tomorrow, or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix put his cigarette out and closed his eyes and rubbed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Jack. I guess so. You\u0027re going to Davette\u0027s house, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got to. Got to try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix nodded. \"I know. And... well, it\u0027s not like anyone\u0027s going to be there waiting for us. It\u0027s not another trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so far as I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix nodded again. \"Then I guess I\u0027m in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix lit a cigarette and blew the smoke out slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Jack. No. Jack, it\u0027s not... it\u0027s just that I don\u0027t think you\u0027re a good deal. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow shook his head. \"That\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it hurt. Saying this was hurting Felix. And he wanted the other man to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack, it\u0027s just that... Dammit, they know who you are and they\u0027re gunning for you. And they\u0027re going to keep gunning for you. And you keep on doing this alone - \" Felix stopped abruptly, looked down. \"You shouldn\u0027t be doing this alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Crow\u0027s voice was so tired and his eyes were so bright as he replied, \"I know. But I can\u0027t get anyone else to help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Felix muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no one spoke after that for awhile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Felix stood up, said good night, and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack watched him go and after he was gone he sighed and dragged out a cigarette and a light and leaned back wearily without lighting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks so tired, Annabelle thought. I\u0027ve never seen him so tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she thought: I\u0027ve never seen him like this at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she felt the resentment for Felix welling up. Because Jack needed him so - they all needed him. Davette needed him. And Jack had been counting on him so much and he was so good at it and Jack was alone...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor bastard,\" Jack muttered to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felix?\" she asked, amazed. \"Why do you feel so sorry for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack\u0027s smile was thin and grim. \"Because here\u0027s this poor jerk who\u0027s... Hell, he\u0027s young and bright and, in his own way, plenty, plenty strong. And he can\u0027t do a goddamned thing but shoot. But he doesn\u0027t want to shoot. Doesn\u0027t want to be a shooter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he doesn\u0027t do anything at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabelle frowned. \"Jack, you\u0027re not making me feel any better about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"But don\u0027t you see? Don\u0027t you see how he\u0027s trapped? Hell, he\u0027s always been - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I see is you in a spot and a young... young I-don\u0027t-know is too scared to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa, there, lady. It\u0027s not just scared. Besides, scared is smart. He - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack! Would you stop defending him?\" she cried. He stopped, looked at her. \"The more you take up for him, the less I like him,\" she said with exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he grinned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is he smiling about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a bad thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack, is that what you\u0027re hoping for, that the vampires will stop scaring him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Oh, no! They\u0027ll never stop scaring him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sooner or later,\" he whispered fiercely, \"they\u0027re going to piss him off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-21.html","bookId":2118,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM"}
