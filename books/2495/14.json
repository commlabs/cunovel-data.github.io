It wouldn’t have been on you,” I say. “Like your parents.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They offered to go first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up, Sloane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We both saw it happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, so you think because you went out there you can say this shit to me,” she says, collecting herself. “It doesn’t work that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug and close my eyes again. I want to sleep. I want her to leave so I can do it. I let myself doze, feel my breathing even out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, she moves from the cot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what I hate?” she asks, and I surface enough to ask her. “The way everyone talks about it. How my parents chose to go into that alley, like they were aware of the fact they might die. But they wouldn’t have done it if they thought there was the remotest chance. No one thinks about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But they did do it,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because they thought it was clear,” she says, and then she pushes my hair away from my face and it’s such a tender gesture, it confuses me. It’s so at odds with the harshness of the words coming out of her mouth. “There was no way they would have gone into that alley first if they thought it was too dangerous because they had us. Why do you think they let Cary lead the way that whole time when they were the adults? They did it so if anything happened, he died. Not them. They went in that alley because he told them it was clear and he was wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he was sorry, he would’ve gone out there tonight. Oh, and Trace wants to thank you.” Her voice breaks. She exhales. “I think you made him finally understand that they’re dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI curl up onto my side and stay as still as possible until she finally leaves and then I breathe so quietly, I can’t hear myself. I pretend I’m dead. Eventually everything disappears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when it comes back, it comes back as strange, uneven footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone entering the room. A rough, calloused hand against my cheek. It doesn’t belong to anyone in this building I can think of. Fingertips trace my face and I think I must still be asleep and dreaming, but I don’t want this dream, whatever it is, so I turn my face away from the touch and then the footsteps retreat and I realize I am awake. I sit up fast, bleary-eyed, and stare at the open door to the nurse’s office. From here, the hall seems empty, seems cold. Was I awake? I get up slowly, my body groaning, and pad out of the office. I stand in the hall, unsure of my next steps. It’s dark and I feel exposed and I want to know who touched me because the more awake I get the more awake I’m sure I was when it happened and I can’t deny the familiarity of the touch but I need to deny its reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk past the administration office, guiding myself by shadows. I stand at the barricades against the front entrance and try to remember what it felt like to come through the doors every day when this was just a school. I can’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then my whole body goes rigid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe charged feeling of another presence in the air. I step forward, my eyes traveling over nothing. I bring my hand to my face and move back down the hall, the way I came, when I get another weird feeling, like I’m being watched. And then a musky scent coats the inside of my throat. My chest tightens. It feels like I’m being wrapped in plastic. I wonder if I’ll remember him forever, if nothing will disappear the feel of his hands, his scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall crackles with my voice, breaking the spell. I fumble back to the nurse’s office and sit on the edge of my cot, waiting for the invisible hand that’s squeezing my heart to let it go. I grab the flashlight and turn it on its lowest setting and it catches my note to Lily on the table. I unfold it and smooth it out over and over until I calm down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if she hears him where she is now, if she hears his voice and his footsteps in her dreams. I wonder if she hears him when she’s awake or if she stopped hearing him as soon as she left, if everything got more okay the more distance she put between us. Or maybe the voice and the footsteps she hears are mine. I hope they are. I hope I’m the ghost that belongs to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ready to join the land of the living?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince. Even Cary cringes as soon as it’s out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought me clothes from the drama department. A plaid men’s shirt and a pair of jeans that don’t fit. I look rural. The buttons of the jeans dig uncomfortably into my abdomen. I changed into them in the little bathroom across the room and when I came out, he was still there, waiting to ask me that. Am I ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s it like out there?” I ask. “I mean … outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are a few stragglers, but they’re mostly in the streets. They haven’t gone back to the doors, which is good,” he tells me. “We covered the windows again, just in case. Do you feel okay? You were pretty out of it when we brought you in here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bandage on my head itches. It also looks stupid, but it would be ungrateful to say so. The side of my face is scratched, red. My cheek is bruised. Lots of bruises have exploded all over my body in the last twenty-four hours. I feel like I was in a minor car accident but I tell him I’m fine and he says, “I’ll bet,” and then we both stand there uncertainly. He stares at me for so long, it makes me prickly and hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs. “I was just surprised you were the one who went out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but it probably should’ve been me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would you even say that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because that’s what Grace and Trace keep telling me. I don’t know. Now Trace is saying I almost had your blood on my hands too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wouldn’t have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhales slowly. “You mean that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t about you, Cary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was it about?” I look away from him. And then he says, “Rhys told me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rhys told you what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About the man out there. What you did. Rhys said he was half crazy and that he would’ve jeopardized us if you brought him in. Now he’s—he’s one of the stragglers…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the man turned. My eyes burn. I don’t want to talk about it with Cary, though, so I twist the topic back around to Grace and Trace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re in mourning. They just need to get through it…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone’s in mourning,” he says. “There’s a whole world out there to mourn. The only difference between them and us is they got their parents a little longer and the only reason they survived as long as they did was because of me and—” He struggles to force the next words out. “I apologized to them and they never once thanked me for getting them this far.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re probably not going to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry, I’m not holding my breath.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s quiet for a minute and then I kind of lie. It’s not a bad lie, though. Maybe it will make him feel better. I look him in the eyes and I say, “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t have the desired result. It doesn’t make him feel better. Instead, Cary seems to get sadder. He forces a half smile at me, but I see through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go back,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get to the auditorium, everyone looks at me and that makes it feel more like high school than anything. Before anyone can speak, Trace crosses the room and hugs me. It hurts. He doesn’t speak, just holds me until Rhys finally says, “I went out there too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you got your pat on the back.” Trace releases me and when he looks at me, his eyes are all warmth. “Thank you for what you did for us, Sloane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forget it.” I want everyone to forget it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to know it means something to me that you tried.” He looks past me and the warmth disappears from his eyes. “Unlike some people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you,” Cary says tiredly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s got breakfast?” Rhys asks. “I did it yesterday. Not doing it today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do,” Trace says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprising. I don’t think Trace has gotten breakfast once since we got here, and it’s not like there’s anything to prepare. Grab packaged food, an assortment of drinks, toss on tray. He jogs over to the stage and hoists himself up, disappearing behind the curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kitchen’s the other way,” Rhys calls. No sooner is it out of his mouth than Trace reappears with—the whiskey. “That’s not exactly what I had in mind when I said breakfast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t we get drunk on this the day we found it?” Trace hops offstage. “What exactly are we waiting for again? I don’t think we have time to wait on this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All we have is time,” Grace says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but who knows how long that is? Fuck tomorrow and the day after and the day after that.” He opens the bottle, moves to take a swig, and stops. He holds it out to Rhys and me. “It should be you two first. For what you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a douchebag,” Cary says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrace ignores him and pushes the bottle at us. Rhys takes the whiskey first, brings it to his mouth, and drinks it easily. He hands the bottle to me. I mimic Rhys but unlike him, I nearly choke. It burns all the way down. I hand the bottle back to Trace. He drinks and hands it to Grace, who grudgingly passes it to Cary after she takes her swig. We go in a circle. Harrison has such a hard time with it, he grabs a bottle of juice from the kitchen to cleanse his palate. In that moment, he looks too young to be alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pussy,” Trace says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace elbows him. “Better than wasting it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then we realize this is it as far as booze goes, at least. A bottle of whiskey. This is all we have. It’s unlikely there will be any more hidden around the school, waiting to be found. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/this-is-not-a-test/page-14.html","bookId":2495,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:50:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:50:53 PM"}
