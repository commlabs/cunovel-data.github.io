We can be f**k buddies if it makes you feel better. New friends with fabulous benefits. I’ll be the scratch for your itch . . . the booty to your two a.m. call. Just . . . don’t screw any other guys—you won’t need to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe begins to shake her head. Until I remind her. “And the world could end tomorrow, remember? The aliens could invade . . . global warming . . . we’ve got to live for the now, ’cause you never know when the now will be gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold out my hand. “Take a chance, Dee. I won’t let you down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer honey-colored eyes look wistfully at my hand. “God, you’re good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk. And it just comes out. “That’s what she said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee cracks up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she takes my hand in hers. They’re a perfect fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike two middle schoolers experiencing their first crushes, we stand like that for a few moments, smiling at each other. Wordlessly, we turn and walk toward her apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch too seriously, Dee says, “Hey, Matthew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise my eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you’ve had enough? Just remember I tried to warn you, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what kind of f**ked-up, douche bags Dee has been going out with, but that kind of talk ticks me off. I’m determined to prove her wrong and lighten the mood. So I lean toward her and whisper, “You’re too beautiful to ever get enough of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores rolls her eyes. And I get the distinct impression she thinks I’m bullshitting her. Guess I’ll just have to keep calling her beautiful until she believes it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaking up in a place that’s not yours is always slightly disorienting. My eyes open to sunlight streaming through sheer purple curtains and to a clothes-cluttered bedroom. Last night, Dee and I talked some more after going inside her apartment. Turns out, she didn’t have sex with the homeboy. She said he spent the majority of their time at her apartment on the phone with a friend. Idiot. She asked me if it would’ve bothered me if she had—my answer was yes. But . . . I would’ve gotten over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slip on a pair of boxers, then I follow the smell of bacon and the sound of music to the kitchen. Dee stands at the stove with her back to me, singing along to “Beneath Your Beautiful” that pours out from the stereo, which is mounted below her cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice is adorably bad—off-key and screechy—like a mating cat’s. Her reddish-blond hair is pinned up with chopsticks—still color-streaked from last night—and the only piece of clothing she’s wearing is my button-down, blue shirt. As the song ends, I applaud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spins around, spatula in hand. “Morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice shirt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. “Since I was making you breakfast, I decided to go full fledged cliché and wear it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step up close and plant a sweet kiss on her lips. She smiles, shyly. “Are you hungry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Starved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee hands me two glasses of orange juice and grabs a platter of bacon and scrambled eggs from the counter. We sit at her small, two-chaired dining table and dig in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is good,” I comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Organic turkey bacon. It’s like crack. One taste, you’ll never do pork again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we eat, I take the opportunity to check out her place. Before, I was much too preoccupied with making her moan. It’s neater than I expected, and eclectic. A red recliner whose fabric has seen better days is stationed next to a round, mosaic-topped table, adjacent to a comfy looking beige couch with a soft, brown blanket thrown across the back. Floral pillows of all shapes are scattered around, and a tall lamp with a beaded fringe shade stands in the corner. Just a few picture frames decorate the walls—one is of Delores, standing next to a thin woman with similar hair color, who I assume is her mother. Another is of Dee, at about thirteen, with one arm around the shoulders of a braces-adorned Kate Brooks, and the other arm around a brown-haired boy, who must be Dee’s cousin. All three are wearing roller skates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow a forkful of mouthwatering eggs and ask, “What are you doing today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to hit up the farmers’ market in Brooklyn . . . but otherwise, nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to hang out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll swing by my place so I can shower, and I have to make one quick stop, but after, I thought we could go to Central Park?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beauty of living in the city is there’s always something to do. Even if your ass is sitting on a park bench and you’re feeding the pigeons, it feels like you’re doing something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds good. I’ll get dressed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes later, Dee’s freshly showered and walking out of her building with her hair in a bun, wearing a silver, strapless shirt, black leather pants, and tiger patterned high heels. Luckily, my illegally parked motorcycle didn’t get ticketed or towed. Dee gazes at the bike appreciatively. She runs her hand over the seat and it reminds me of how she ran her hand over my stomach, inching lower and lower. I pick up her hand and kiss her palm. “Don’t stroke it like that unless you mean it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reaches up on her toes and whispers in my ear, “I always mean it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull a cap helmet out of the pack on the back of my bike and place it on Dee’s head, buckling it under her chin. She’s the perfect mixture of sensual and adorable, sexy and cute—I could eat her out right here on the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe climbs on my motorcycle and winks. “Take me for a ride, Matthew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rev the engine. “Hold on tight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot every girl is cut out for riding on a motorcycle. One or two have clutched me so tight they left nail marks and cut off feeling to my extremities. Another time, a chick didn’t grip strong enough—was too busy “wooting” and waving her hands in the air—and she almost gave me a heart attack when she went sailing off the back. Thankfully, she wasn’t harmed. Dee squeezes me just right—one arm around my waist, her other hand on my thigh, the splendid feel of her tits pressed against my back and her chin on my shoulder blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll gladly give her one long ride after another. Both kinds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we arrive at my building, we park in the private deck and head to the lobby. Delores admires the impressive architecture while I retrieve my mail from the box. When we walk into my apartment, I tell Dee to make herself at home and hop in the shower. After I’m dry, I slip on a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt. Leaving it unbuttoned for the moment, I walk back to the living room in search of Delores. She’s staring out the picture window. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tamed-tangled-3/page-17.html","bookId":1811,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:04 PM"}
