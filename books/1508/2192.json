However, these descriptions were all rumors and legends.

There were even some people that said the corpse of the Demon God was buried within. In addition to the multitude of force fields that protected the Demon God’s Tomb, this caused special Laws to appear in the Emperor Bone Sea. These rules could even rid themselves of the Heavenly Dao and have all the bones buried within remain eternally pristine, and even remnant souls could be permanently sealed within.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was a story that many abyssals believed in.

As for those weaker Empyrean level abyssals, they wouldn’t dare step into the Emperor Bone Sea to send themselves to death. Rather, they would compete for the power of demon gods in the surrounding edges of the Demon God’s Tomb.
