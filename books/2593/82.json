It really could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh honey,\" she says, throwing her arms around me, hugging my head. \"Lunch at Le Cirque? You\u0027re the best. You\u0027re not the Grinch. I take it back. Thursday? Is Thursday good for you? Oh no. I can\u0027t do it Thursday. Herbal wrap. But how\u0027s Friday? And do we really want to go to La Cirque? How about - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push her off me and knock on the divider, rapping my knuckles against it loudly until the driver lowers it. \"Sid, I mean Earle, whoever, this isn\u0027t the way to Chernoble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes it is, Mr. Bateman - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean Mr. Halberstam.

C as in... Cartier, I take it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hip,\" I assure her. \"It\u0027s totally hip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been there?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Millions of times,\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chernoble? No, not Chernoble, \" she whines. \"Honey, it\u0027s Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in the hell does that mean?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Limo driver, oh limo driver...\" Evelyn leans forward, balancing herself on my knees. \"Limo driver, we\u0027re going to the Rainbow Room. Driver, to the Rainbow Room, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push her back and lean forward. \"Ignore her. Chernoble.

It\u0027s Christmas,\" she whines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keep saying that as if it means something,\" I say, staring right at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s Christmas,\" she whines again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stand the Rainbow Room,\" I say, adamant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh why not, Patrick?\" she whines. \"They have the best Waldorf salad in town at the Rainbow Room. Did you like mine? Did you like my Waldorf salad, honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my god,\" I whisper, covering my face with both heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly. Did you?\" she asks. \"The only thing I really worried about was that and the chestnut stuffing...\" She pauses. \"Well, because the chestnut stuffing was... well, gross, you know - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to go to the Rainbow Room,\" I interrupt, my hands still covering my face, \"because I can\u0027t score drugs there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh...\" She looks me over, disapprovingly. \"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Drugs, Patrick? What kind of, ahem, drugs are we talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drugs, Evelyn. Cocaine. Drugs. I want to do some cocaine tonight. Do you understand?\" I sit up and glare at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick,\" she says, shaking her head, as if she\u0027s lost faith in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see you\u0027re confused,\" I point out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t want any part of it,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to do any of it,\" I tell her. \"Maybe you\u0027re not even invited to do any of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t understand why you have to ruin this time of year for me,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think of it as... frost.
