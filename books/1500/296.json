Either they are being soaked until they smell and rot, or their containers will be directly smashed apart by the enemy and cut up like mushy meat. Is this the conclusion those chosen are heading for?

She was just like a doll as she hovered there, a pair of small hands slowly tapping on the optical screens that continuously came in and went out of existence around her, sometimes changing screens and sometimes giving orders. The color of her pupils fluctuated irregularly. If they were magnified many times, one would see that there were countless optical screens that were currently emerging and disappearing within.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was an extremely quiet place without any sound.

It remained fixed there, unlike the other light screens packed with information that came in and out of existence. On the screen was a photograph that was already turning a bit yellow, displaying a heroic and powerful male whose smiling face seemed to release dazzling brilliance. His marshal uniform that was full of ribbons also proved his status as well. Beside him was a quiet and beautiful woman. Even though it was just a static photograph, one could still see at what could only be described as happiness at the corners of her eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBetween the two individuals was an infant that had just been born.

She half kneeled on a completely nonexistent floor, and with an ice-cold yet pleasant sounding voice, she said, “Great apostle, have your distinguished self fully regained consciousness?

A translucent cylindrical container appeared in the light, one that contained green culture fluid. A young lady’s body was floating inside.

Meanwhile, in the expansive southern forest, O’Brien had already fought together with Poseidon’s Trident here for an entire month. A month of time allowed their troop to penetrate close to a hundred kilometers into this dark primitive forest without daylight. During their journey, countless vicious strange beasts, crafty snipe birds, and fierce carnivorous plants became sacrificial victims. Of course, their greatest sacrificial victim were still the indigenous natives here, or Hebilu, as the Arthur family’s laboratory personnel referred to them as.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Hebilu had the primitive shaping of a society, as well as highly developed wisdom. Their level of intelligence was even 30% higher than that of an ordinary human. They possessed outstanding physical strength and stamina, as well as shockingly great equilibrium senses. This could explain why they were able to jump about several tens of meters above in the sky as if they were flying. In addition, their internal organs were vastly different from that of humans’. There was a honeycomb shaped organ within their chest that was especially sensitive towards magnetic fields, and this organ was capable of resonating with most magnetic forces currently known to man. The research personnel speculated that this organ’s existence was why the relatively primitive Hebilu were able to produce electromagnetic weapons purely through manual means. Apart from this, there were more than sixty small organs within the Hebilu’s bodies that had unknown uses.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs mammals, these bluish-gray skinned Hebilu had similar reproductive organs as humans, and from a human’s esthetic point of view, they weren’t all that ugly, at best looking a bit offbeat. Due to the human race’s love for novelty, once the Hebilu were publicly announced and it was proved that it wouldn’t bring about any dangers to them, some great figures with heavier appetites would definitely find a way to get their hands on a few Hebilu to raise them themselves, treating them like an unconventional type of slave.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFrom a genetic perspective, the similarity between the Hebilu and standard human genome did not even reach 50%. No matter what type of angle one looked at it from, it couldn’t be considered a similar species as a human. In addition, with the currently used classification system, it was hard to say exactly what kind of species they were. In this current era, species currently known would experience substantial changes after just a few years. All olden era classification systems were already completely outdated, but in this new era where most humans were still struggling for survival, biologists were concentrating all of their attention on discovering new abilities, perfecting known ability systems, or manufacturing genetic weapons. There was no one with the time or resources to revise and complete the classification of organisms. Moreover, in the era of turmoil, even if they completed a new classification system, in just a few years, it would be outdated again.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-3-chapter-14-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-3-chapter-14-4\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-3-chapter-14-3","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM"}
