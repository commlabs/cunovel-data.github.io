His mouth opened and shut, but his voice wisely decided not to come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppicymon pushed his bandaged face close to the priest\u0027s pointed nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I remember you,\u0027 he growled. \u0027I\u0027ve seen you oiling around the place. A bad hat, if ever I saw one. I remember thinking that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared around at the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re all priests, aren\u0027t you? Come to say sorry, have you? Where\u0027s Dios?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancestors pressed forward, muttering. When you\u0027ve been dead for hundreds of years, you\u0027re not inclined to feel generous to those people who assured you that you were going to have a lovely time. There was a scuffle in the middle of the crowd as King Psam-nut-kha, who had spent five thousand years with nothing to look at but the inside of a lid, was restrained by younger colleagues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppicymon switched his attention back to Koomi, who hadn\u0027t gone anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Foul shades, was it?\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Er,\u0027 said Koomi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Put him down.\u0027 Dios gently took the staff from Koomi\u0027s unresisting fingers and said, \u0027I am Dios, the high priest. Why are you here?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a perfectly calm and reasonable voice, with overtones of concerned but indubitable authority. It was a tone of voice the pharaohs of Djelibeybi had heard for thousands of years, a voice which had regulated the days, prescribed the rituals, cut the time into carefully-turned segments, interpreted the ways of gods to men. It was the sound of authority, which stirred antique memories among the ancestors and caused them to look embarrassed and shuffle their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the younger pharaohs lurched forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You bastard,\u0027 he croaked. \u0027You laid us out and shut us away, one by one, and you went on. People thought the name was passed on but it was always you. How old are you, Dios?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sound. No-one moved. A breeze stirred the dust a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDios sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I did not mean to,\u0027 he said. \u0027There was so much to do. There were never enough hours in the day. Truly, I did not realise what was happening. I thought it was refreshing, nothing more, I suspected nothing. I noted the passing of the rituals, not the years.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come from a long-lived family, do you?\u0027 said Teppicymon sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDios stared at him, his lips moving. \u0027Family,\u0027 he said at last, his voice softened from its normal bark. \u0027Family. Yes. I must have had a family, mustn\u0027t I. But, you know, I can\u0027t remember. Memory is the first thing that goes. The pyramids don\u0027t seem to preserve it, strangely.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This is Dios, the footnote-keeper of history?\u0027 said Teppicymon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ah.\u0027 The high priest smiled. \u0027Memory goes from the head. But it is all around me. Every scroll and book.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s the history of the kingdom, man!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. My memory.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king relaxed a little. Sheer horrified fascination was unravelling the knot of fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How old are you?\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I think... seven thousand years. But sometimes it seems much longer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Really seven thousand years?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes,\u0027 said Dios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How could any man stand it?\u0027 said the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDios shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Seven thousand years is just one day at a time,\u0027 he said. Slowly, with the occasional wince, he got down on one knee and held up his staff in shaking hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027O kings,\u0027 he said, \u0027I have always existed only to serve.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long, extremely embarrassed pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We will destroy the pyramids,\u0027 said Far-re-ptah, pushing forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You will destroy the kingdom,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027I cannot allow it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You cannot allow it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. What will we be without the pyramids?\u0027 said Dios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Speaking for the dead,\u0027 said Far-re-ptah, \u0027we will be free.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But the kingdom will be just another small country,\u0027 said Dios, and to their horror the ancestors saw tears in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All that we hold dear, you will cast adrift in time. Uncertain. Without guidance. Changeable.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then it can take its chances,\u0027 said Teppicymon. \u0027Stand aside, Dios.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDios held up his staff. The snake around it uncoiled and hissed at the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Be still,\u0027 said Dios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark lightning crackled between the ancestors. Dios stared at the staff in astonishment; it had never done this before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut seven thousand years of his priests had believed, in their hearts, that the staff of Dios could rule this world and the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the sudden silence there was the faint chink, high up, of a knife being wedged between two black marble slabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pyramid pulsed under Teppic, and the marble was as slippery as ice. The inward slope wasn\u0027t the help he had expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing, he told himself, is not to look up or down, but straight ahead, into the marble, parcelling the impossible height into manageable sections. Just like time. That\u0027s how we survive infinity - we kill it by breaking it up into small bits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was aware of shouts below him, and glanced briefly over his shoulder. He was barely a third of the way up, but he could see the crowds across the river, a grey mass speckled with the pale blobs of upturned faces. Closer to, the pale army of the dead, facing the small grey group of priests, with Dios in front of them. There was some sort of argument going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was on the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached up, located the next crack, found a handhold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDios spotted Ptaclusp\u0027s head peering over the debris, and sent a couple of priests to bring him back. IIb followed, his carefully folded brother under his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What is the boy doing?\u0027 Dios demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027O Dios, he said he was going to flare off the pyramid,\u0027 said Ptaclusp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How can he do that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027O lord, he says he is going to cap it off before the sun sets.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is it possible?\u0027 Dios demanded, turning to the architect. IIb hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It may be,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And what will happen? Will we return to the world outside?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, it depends on whether the dimensional effect ratchets, as it were, and is stable in each state, or if, on the contrary, the pyramid is acting as a piece of rubber under tension-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice stuttered to a halt under the intensity of Dios\u0027s stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Back to the world outside,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027Not our world. Our world is the Valley. Ours is a world of order. Men need order.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s my son!\u0027 shouted Teppicymon. \u0027Don\u0027t you dare try anything! That\u0027s the king!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranks of ancestors swayed, but couldn\u0027t break the spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Er, Dios,\u0027 said Koomi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDios turned, his eyebrows raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You spoke?\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Er, if it is the king, er I - that is, we - think perhaps you should let him get on with it. Er, don\u0027t you think that would be a really good idea?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDios\u0027s staff kicked, and the priests felt the cold bands of restraint freeze their limbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I gave my life for the kingdom,\u0027 said the high priest. \u0027I gave it over and over again. Everything it is, I created. I cannot fail it now.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he saw the gods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic eased himself up another couple of feet and then gently reached down to pull a knife out of the marble. It wasn\u0027t going to work, though. Knife climbing was for those short and awkward passages, and frowned on anyway because it suggested you\u0027d chosen a wrong route. It wasn\u0027t for this sort of thing, unless you had unlimited knives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over his shoulder again as strange barred shadows flickered across the face of the pyramid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom out of the sunset, where they had been engaged in their eternal squabbling, the gods were returning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey staggered and lurched across the fields and reed beds, heading for the pyramid. Near-brainless though they were, they understood what it was. Perhaps they even understood what Teppic was trying to do. Their assorted animal faces made it hard to be certain, but it looked as though they were very angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you going to control them, Dios?\u0027 said the king. \u0027Are you going to tell them that the world should be changeless?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDios stared up at the creatures jostling one another as they waded the river. There were too many teeth, too many lolling tongues. The bits of them that were human were sloughing away. A lion-headed god of justice - Put, Dios recalled the name - was using its scales as a flail to beat one of the river gods. Chefet, the Dog-Headed God of metalwork, was growling and attacking his fellows at random with his hammer; this was Chefet, Dios thought, the god that he had created to be an example to men in the art of wire and filigree and small beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it had worked. He\u0027d taken a desert rabble and shown them all he could remember of the arts of civilisation and the secrets of the pyramids. He\u0027d needed gods then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trouble with gods is that after enough people start believing in them, they begin to exist. And what begins to exist isn\u0027t what was originally intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChefet, Chefet, thought Dios. Maker of rings, weaver of metal. Now he\u0027s out of our heads, and see how his nails grow into claws . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not how I imagined him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Stop,\u0027 he instructed. \u0027I order you to stop! You will obey me. I made you!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey also lack gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKing Teppicymon felt the power around him weaken as Dios turned all his attention to ecclesiastical matters. He saw the tiny shape halfway up the wall of the pyramid, saw it falter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the ancestors saw it, too, and as one corpse they knew what to do. Dios could wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic heard the snap of the handle under his foot, slid a little, and hung by one hand. He\u0027d got another knife in above him but . . . no, no good. He hadn\u0027t got the reach. For practical purposes his arms felt like short lengths of wet rope. Now, if he spreadeagled himself as he slid, he might be able to slow enough .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down and saw the climbers coming towards him, in a tide that was tumbling upwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancestors rose up the face of the pyramid silently, like creepers, each new row settling into position on the shoulders of the generation beneath, while the younger ones climbed on over them. Bony hands grabbed Teppic as the wave of edificeers broke around him, and he was half-pushed, half-pulled up the sloping wall. Voices like the creak of sarcophagi filled his ears, moaning encouragement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well done, boy,\u0027 groaned a crumbling mummy, hauling him bodily on to its shoulder. \u0027You remind me of me when I was alive. To you, son.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Got him,\u0027 said the corpse above, lifting Teppic easily on one outstretched arm. \u0027That\u0027s a fine family spirit, lad. Best wishes from your great-great-great-great uncle, although I don\u0027t suppose you remember me. Coming up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther ancestors were climbing on past Teppic as he rose from hand to hand. Ancient fingers with a grip like steel clutched at him, hoisting him onwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pyramid grew narrower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown below, Ptaclusp watched thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What a workforce,\u0027 he said. \u0027I mean, the ones at the bottom are supporting the whole weight!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Dad,\u0027 said IIb. \u0027I think we\u0027d better run. Those gods are getting closer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you think we could employ them?\u0027 said Ptaclusp, ignoring him. \u0027They\u0027re dead, they probably won\u0027t want high wages, and-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Dad!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sort of self-build-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You said no more pyramids, dad. Never again, you said. Now come on!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic scrambled to the top of the pyramid, supported by the last two ancestors. One of them was his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve met your great-grandma,\u0027 he said, indicating the shorter bandaged figure, who nodded gently at Teppic. He opened his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s no time,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re doing fine.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the sun which, old professional that it was, chose that moment to drop below the horizon. The gods had crossed the river, their progress slowed only by their tendency to push and shove among themselves, and were lurching through the buildings of the necropolis. Several were clustered around the spot where Dios had been. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-38.html","bookId":1626,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:47 PM"}
