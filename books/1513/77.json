A large variety of different colored gems were also embedded along its edges, making it look extremely extravagant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, a youth wearing a swallow-tail coat was standing in front of this mirror. Behind him were a few maids, who were busy straightening out their master\u0027s attire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter tidying up, the youth waved his hands, sending the maids away, leaving him alone in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis youth judged his reflected figure-- a medium-height build with a slim stature. He was brown haired and somewhat pale-skinned. His countenance could be described as delicate, but the shining luster in both his eyes indicated he had a very active mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unknowingly, I have already turned 17!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked at himself in the mirror and spoke with a hint of melancholy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime was the most incisive weapon. It turned babies into old people and created barren deserts by drying up seas. Even if a person was a Magus, they could only slightly prolong their lives. But even if they could live for several thousand years, they could still not evade the slow corrosion of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver a year had passed ever since Leylin returned from his previous exploration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! I must fight the eternal curse of time and seek immortality. Only then would I be deserving of the fate of having being transported to this world!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin\u0027s eyes turned a fiery black as if a deep magnificent flame was burning within them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master! The city lord\u0027s horse carriage is here!\" Outside the door, Anna\u0027s voice could be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him wait for a while, I\u0027ll be coming over shortly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin faced the mirror and finished sorting out his bearings, before picking up a short black cane and leaving the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Deng Deng! *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black horse carriage flew rapidly across the street and, after seeing the insignia of the city lord Castle; the citizens avoided it and made way. They all sent respectful and envious gazes to the horse carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the cabin, there was only Leylin. Currently, this youth was lying comfortably against a velvety goose feather cushion. His hand laid on its side, revealing a strange pendant on his palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pendant was strikingly similar to the silver cross. On its surface were a few red and blue diamonds, which glittered in the light, giving off a faint glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Leylin stared at this pendant, a satisfied expression crossed his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to the A.I. Chip\u0027s calculations, with the Stellar Alloy as the centerpiece and the support of various precious alloys that I have obtained during my travels, this prototype of the magic artifact has already been perfectly synthesized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis pendant artifact was something that Leylin had synthesized according to the magic artifact section of the Lowian Academy Teachings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3 years ago Leylin had managed to buy the decrepit page of the Lowian Academy Teachings, having the A.I. Chip slowly decipher the contents within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe earlier portions of the teachings were only suitable for acolytes, with many travels and adventures recorded down. If not, Leylin could never have purchased the page at an extremely low price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin\u0027s luck was not bad. After the A.I. Chip finished deciphering, he obtained a method to synthesize a low-grade magic artifact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFallen Star Pendant -- This was the name of the magic artifact recipe he had obtained. According to the Lowian Academy Teachings, this Fallen Star Pendant, while a low-grade magic artifact, was of the rare defensive nature. Compared to a few attack type magic artifacts, its value was naturally much higher. Even an official Magus might be interested in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter having to see the materials needed and the process, Leylin had immediately decided that he had to synthesize the Fallen Star Pendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the spells of acolytes are rather destructive, their low defense capabilities have always been an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly by turning into an official Magus, and being able to form an innate defensive spell, can there be a spell projecting a force field that constantly protected the body. Only then, could someone be considered to be an awe-inspiring Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for acolytes, they could lose their lives at any time from sneak attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe few acolytes who had entered the withering woods with Leylin previously were the best examples of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough they were able to cast destructive spells, due to the Great Mankestre Snake, they had all perished due to the lack of defensive spells. Only Murphy was fortunate enough to stay alive, but that was due to Leylin saving him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he had synthesized the Fallen Star Pendant, coupled with a couple of defensive potions, Leylin\u0027s defence would be comparable to a fraction of the defence that a Magus had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the Fallen Star Pendant\u0027s defence force field would be activated immediately. For instance, as long as the opponent\u0027s attack power does not exceed the threshold of the Fallen Star Pendant and before it\u0027s energy was completely depleted, Leylin\u0027s defence would be like that of a sturdy turtle shell. As long as the Fallen Star Pendant was active, nothing would happen to Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fortunately, there was a magician market near Extreme Night City, if not I wouldn\u0027t have been able to find so many precious ingredients so quickly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin somehow felt glad for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter smashing and grinding most of the magic crystals he had, as well as adding all of the ingredients from the Great Mankestre Snake, he managed to create this prototype of a pendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have basically consumed all of my expendable resources. According to the Lowian Academy Teachings, this is only an incomplete product. The core of the Fallen Star Pendant has already been completed. What\u0027s left is the final step....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing at the Fallen Star Pendant in his hands he saw that the silver cross glittered and glowed with a wide range of different hues. On its surface were inscribed mysterious patterns, and altogether it seemed like a mystical art piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for the final ingredient, I have it with me already. I need to only wait for the opportune moment before I can initiate the spirit awakening for the Fallen Star Pendant!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin gripped the Fallen Star Pendant tightly and kept it on his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for the Tears of Mary, this ancient formula is really difficult to comprehend. Even after a lot of experiments and obtaining large amounts of data on spirit bodies, I still don\u0027t understand anything from looking at this formula!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin appeared downcast, and his thoughts spun rapidly, \"Could it be that my conjecture is wrong? What if this formula has nothing to do with spirit bodies....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Halt!\" The coachman\u0027s voice travelled from the front. The horse carriage jerked, as it came to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir Leylin! The city lord\u0027s Castle is just ahead,\" reported the coachmen, respectfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin shook his head and organized his inner thoughts as he walked out of the carriage\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city lord\u0027s Castle was still the same - just as imposing and dignified as before. Rows of guards on both sides of the entrance were standing facing each other, and their gaze never wavered, appearing formidable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Viscount Jackson is rather intelligent!\" Ever since the withering woods incident, he had pretended to be heavily injured and allowed the news to travel out. After his enemies confirmed the news and began to gather in cahoots for an attack, he caught them all at once lightning quick. He cut off all of their heads and their blood overflowed into the moat. From then on, all of Extreme Night City has been extremely quiet....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leylin! My brother!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViscount Jackson had long since waited at the main door. Upon seeing Leylin, he immediately went forward to receive him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViscount Jackson had witnessed Leylin\u0027s strength first hand. Not to mention that Leylin was Viscount Jackson\u0027s lifesaver. If not for Leylin, Viscount Jackson would have long since become prey for the Great Mankestre Snake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"City lord,\" said Leylin, as he nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViscount Jackson grabbed Leylin\u0027s hands in a cordial manner. After bringing Leylin for a stroll around his castle\u0027s garden, he then brought Leylin to a private study room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the privacy of the castle, Viscount Jackson finally revealed a worrisome expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother Leylin! Last time you had requested for 50 men, but I am simply unable to provide you with that many.... I have already sent all the criminals from all of my jails to your place. Also, I have even sent you cheats and thieves whose crimes do not warrant a death sentence. However, it is still too far from the number you requested....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was like this?\" Leylin nodded his head, and sat on the sofa, entering into deep thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtreme Night City could barely be considered as a medium-sized city. Their residents would not exceed 100,000 people. For Viscount Jackson, providing Leylin with a few prisoners meant for the death row was still within his means. However, as time passed, the number of death row criminals became less and less, yet Leylin\u0027s request only kept increasing. So now, he could no longer fulfill the requests of Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you know,\" continued Viscount Jackson while Leylin was in deep thought, \"I am only a city lord. My noble status is only that of a Viscount. For individual death sentences, I may still be able to decide on them. However, once it exceeds a certain threshold, I have no choice in the matter. After all, there are still laws presiding over the dukedom....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViscount Jackson waved his hands, and his eyes flashed, \"Unless there is a war happening at the moment, if 50 or 100 people disappeared at once, it would definitely incite the wrath of the masses!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"War!!!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin was startled, but very soon his startled appearance turned into a frosty smirk. This was indeed a good chance to collect samples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Viscount Jackson chose to mention it at this time, so it was very likely that he had already thought of a plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Regarding this, I...\" As Leylin wanted to speak further on the matter, his chest pocket suddenly vibrated as a crow-like \u0027caw\u0027 sounded. Immediately Leylin\u0027s expression changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there something wrong?\" Viscount Jackson asked with a \u0027concerned\u0027 look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s.... It\u0027s nothing; I\u0027ve received news from a friend!\" Leylin reached his hands into his chest, and the cawing stopped immediately. His countenance also resumed its previous tranquility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Leylin lost interest in speaking any further. He hurriedly exchanged a few more words with Viscount Jackson before bidding farewell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough something was troubling Viscount Jackson, seeing Leylin, who became absent-minded towards the end, he still did not say what was on his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Leylin came out of the castle, he hopped onto the horse carriage and rushed back to the manor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I actually received news from the academy at a time like this ....\" According to the news, the war of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy had already reached the peak of its intensity, where the victor and loser could be determined at any given moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Leylin was an acolyte who was sent out on a mission, the academy had given him items with which they could contact him. There were also various items for contact purposes, with a \u0027single-use\u0027 effect, sent with him. This way, they were able to get the most updated news of the school during critical times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now, the news given would most likely determine the winner and loser. The Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u0027s strength is limited, and there are two other factions of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy\u0027s strength opposing it, so the chances of winning are slim,\" mused Leylin, as he had a good grasp of the current predicament of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless some external faction has stepped forward to mediate, the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy will definitely take a huge loss this time, and may even result in being disbanded....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin carried a solemn expression as he stepped into his secret lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-76\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-78\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-77","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
