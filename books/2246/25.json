It had only taken me about two hours to find Marcie after my plane touched down in Acapulco. She was stretched out in a beach chair next to the pool of a luxury hotel, sipping an umbrella drink and reading an art magazine. She burst into tears when she saw me, hugged me hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen punched me square in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve reached an understanding since then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I\u0027d determined that Amber was going to be okay, I let her have the Impala to drive back to Orlando. I gave her every cent I had on me to make sure her trip went okay and told her it might be six months or so before I could contact her and Danny again. I needed to lay low for a while. She let me know I could contact Danny through Clemson University. She\u0027d see to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really did seem like she was going to be okay as she dropped me off at the Chattanooga Airport. She kissed me on the cheek again, said I\u0027d be in her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a plane ticket to Mexico on Minelli\u0027s credit card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the ninety minutes I had before my plane left, I dropped the key to the airport locker in the mail. I used the card Agent Dunn had given me to get the address. I also sent him a note saying one of the conditions for my help was to put Stan in a witness relocation program if they ended up nabbing him. Maybe Dunn would even be grateful enough to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be strange for a while without Stan\u0027s guiding hand, but I was starting a new life. I was my own boss now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight breeze picked up. I rocked in the hammock. Marcie and I had stayed in the luxury hotel one night before I\u0027d explained we\u0027d have to make her cash stretch for as long as possible. We were waiting to hear if the real estate agent had sold her house. Until then we\u0027d moved into a reasonably safe and clean neighborhood with the locals. Rent on the villa was modest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard someone approach the villa, but I kept my eyes closed. I knew what Marcie\u0027s quick steps sounded like on the cobblestones. She climbed the stairs to the porch and put something on my chest. I pretended I was still asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cleared her throat pointedly, and I opened my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was looking straight into the eyes of a big stuffed iguana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell me this isn\u0027t dinner,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know what they\u0027re charging for these nasty things in the tourist shops?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty bucks,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not dollars, dumbass. Pesos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two thousand fucking pesos.\" She put her hands on her hips. \"Can you believe that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s unbelievable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grunted her derision at me. \"Laugh it up, boy-toy. We need to make a living. I could stuff these things in my sleep.\" She picked up the lizard and shook it at me. \"I have a very marketable skill here, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can always go in on that deal with Hernandez,\" I told her. Hernandez was a shady fellow I\u0027d met a few nights ago in one of the local saloons. We got to talking over a few pints of tequila, and he told me about a scheme he had going where he and his pals stole cars in Texas and smuggled them over the border to sell in Mexico.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Marcie smacked me on the forehead with an open palm. \"We don\u0027t do things like that anymore. You want me to kick your ass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tucked the iguana under her arm and went inside the villa. \"I\u0027m serious,\" she called over her shoulder. \"We have to earn a living somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unfolded the telegram that had arrived an hour earlier, read it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStash all counted. Account in your name at Bank of Zurich. Account number: DH123-45567. Balance: $1,428,076.00.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eÂ¨C Jimmy the Fix\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get by somehow,\" I shouted at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes. The breeze picked up just a little as I slipped into mariachi dreams. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gun-monkeys/page-25.html","bookId":2246,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:09 PM"}
