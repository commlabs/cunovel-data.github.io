The one who…?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Murdered Gerun Eberict? Indeed, the very man. With his own two hands, Ormly. His own two hands.’ Then she smiled. ‘And those hands, well, murdering isn’t the only thing they’re good at.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I knew it! It is all you ever think about!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe settled back in her chair. Make them feel clever. The only sure way to keep the peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the city of Letheras was a massive core of ice. A fist of Omtose Phellack, clutching in its implacable grip an ancient spirit. Lured, then trapped by a startling alliance of Ceda Kuru Qan, a Jaghut sorceress and an Elder God. For the Errant, it was a struggle to appreciate that conjoining, no matter how advantageous the consequence. A spirit imprisoned, until such time as that hoary ritual weakened-or, more likely, was shattered in wilful malice. So, though temporary-and what truly wasn’t?-it had prevented death and destruction on a colossal scale. All very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKuru Qan treating with a Jaghut sorceress-surprising but not disturbing. No, it was Mael’s involvement that gnawed ceaselessly in the Errant’s thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Elder God. But not K’rul, not Draconus, not Kilmandaros. No, this was the one Elder God who never got involved. Mael’s curse was everyone else’s blessing. So what changed? What forced the old bastard’s hand, enough so that he forged alliances, that he unleashed his power in the streets of the city, that he emerged onto a remote island and battered a broken god senseless?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriendship towards a pathetic, mortal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what, dear Mael, do you now plan to do about all those worshippers? The ones so abusing your indifference? They are legion and their hands drip blood in your name. Does this please you? From them, after all, you acquire power. Enough to drown this entire realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWar among the gods, but was the battle line so simply drawn as it seemed? The Errant was no longer sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood in solid rock, within reach of the enormous knot of ice. He could smell it, that gelid ancient sorcery that belonged to another era. The spirit imprisoned within it, frozen in the act of rising through a fetid lake, was a seething storm of helpless rage, blurred and indistinct at its centre. One of Mael’s own kin, the Errant suspected, like a piece torn free only to suffer a geas of the Crippled God. Entirely unaware-so far-of the terrible fissures spread like crazed webs through that ice, fissures even now working their way inwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShattered indeed. With intent? No, not this time, but in imagining a place of permanence they chose in error. And no, they could not have known. This… nudge… not mine. Just… dread circumstance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes Mael know? Abyss take me, 1 need to speak to him-ah, how 1 recoil at the notion! How much longer can I delay? What rotted commodity would my silence purchase? What meagre reward my warning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps another word with that war god, Fener. But no, that poor creature probably knew even less than he did. Cowering, virtually usurped… usurped, now there’s an interesting notion. Gods at war… yes, possibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Errant withdrew, passing ghostly through rock. Sudden desire, impatience, pushed him onward. He would need a mortal’s hand for what he planned. A mortal’s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe emerged onto a floor of mouldy, uneven pavestones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow far had he travelled? How much time had passed? Darkness and the muted sound of dripping water. He sniffed the air, caught the scent of life. Tainted acrid by delving into old magic. And knew where he was. Not far, then. Not long. Never hide in the same place, child. Mouth dry-something like anticipation-he hurried down the crooked corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can do nothing, weak as I am. Edging askew the course of fates-1 was once far more. Master of the Tiles. All that power in those scribed images, the near-words from a time when no written words existed. They would have starved without my blessing. Withered. Does this mean nothing? Am I past bargaining?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel now, within him, flaring to life, a once-dull ember of… of… of what? Ah, yes, I see it clear. I see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmbition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Errant reached the secret chamber, could discern trickling heat at the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrouched over a brazier, she spun round when he stepped into the room. The heady, damp air, thick with spices, made him feel half drunk. He saw her eyes widen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Turudal Brizad-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Errant staggered forward. ‘It’s this, you see. A bargain-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw her hand edge out, hovering over the coals of the brazier. ‘They all want to bargain. With me-’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-154.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
