On this principle they may as well accuse Caius Catullus for calling Clodia Lesbia, Ticidas for substituting the name Perilla for that of Metella, Propertius for concealing the name Hostia beneath the pseudonym of Cynthia, and Tibullus for singing of Delia in his verse, when it was Plania who ruled his heart. For my part I should rather blame Caius Lucilius, even allowing him all the license of a satiric poet, for prostituting to the public gaze the boys Gentius and Macedo, whose real names he mentions in his verse without any attempt at concealment. How much more reserved is Mantua’s poet, who, when like myself he praised the slave-boy of his friend Pollio in one of his light pastoral poems, shrinks from mentioning real nnames and calls himself Corydon and the boy Alexis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Aemilianus, whose rusticity far surpasses that of the Virgilean shepherds and cowherds, who is, in fact, and always has been a boor and a barbarian, though he thinks himself far more austere than Serranus, Curius, or Fabricius, those heroes of the days of old, denies that such verses are worthy of a philosopher who is a follower of Plato. Will you persist in this attitude, Aemilianus, if I can show that my verses were modelled upon Plato? For the only verses of Plato now extant are love-elegies, the reason, I imagine, being that he burned all his other poems because they were inferior in charm and finish. Learn then the verses written by Plato in honour of the boy Aster, though I doubt if at your age it is possible for you to become a man of learning.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThou wert the morning star among the living\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eere thy fair light had fled; —\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003enow having died, thou art as Hesperus giving\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003enew light unto the dead.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is another poem by Plato dealing conjointly with the boys Alexis and Phaedrus:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI lid but breathe the words ‘Alexis fair’,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eand all men gazed on him with wondering eyes,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003emy soul, why point to questing beasts their prize?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e’Twas thus we lost our Phaedrus; ah!
