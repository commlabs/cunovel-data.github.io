And he\u0027s your spotter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenkins took the case, but it took him a few seconds more to realize that it held a rifle—that Avery had just given him an unofficial—but very important—promotion. \"Yes, Staff Sergeant!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenkins shouted, much louder than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re accelerating your training,\" Captain Ponder said, joining Avery near the sandpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve just learned Harvest is expecting a very important Colonial Authority delegation. The Governor has requested that this militia provide security—in case of Insurrectionist attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a boldfaced lie, but Avery and Ponder had agreed that while they couldn\u0027t tell the recruits the truth, they needed to give them a reason to train hard—an enemy that would keep them motivated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet the mere mention of the Insurrection caused some of the recruits to start with fright. Others glanced nervously at one another while the rest frowned and shook their heads: We didn\u0027t sign up for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery nodded. \"You volunteered for different reasons. But I can teach you to become soldiers—protectors of your planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d meant what he said to the Lt. Commander: until help arrived from FLEETCOM, these recruits were the only protection Harvest had. But what he hadn\u0027t admitted until now—even to himself—was that he didn\u0027t know if he could lead them. Not without their respect and trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he didn\u0027t have a lot of time to earn either one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am your drill instructor, but I am also a UNSC Fleet Marine,\" Avery continued. \"I have committed myself to a life of service and sacrifice. I have set for myself the highest standards of personal conduct and professional skill. If you let me, I will teach you to do the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t lost on Avery that everything he committed to his recruits he also committed to himself. In waging the UNSC\u0027s dirty war against the Insurrection, he had compromised his standards—done immoral things. He\u0027d sacrificed too much of his humanity for his service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was determined to earn it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery took off his duty-cap and tossed it to Healy. Then he stepped down into the pit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But first,\" he said, lifting Stisen\u0027s helmet and shaking it free of sand. \"Someone\u0027s got to keep Forsell\u0027s head from getting any fatter.\" As the recruits of 1st platoon broke into astonished smiles, Avery added, \"Might as well be me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER ELEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHARVEST, JANUARY 20, 2525\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSif knew she had been alone too long. Alone with her suspicions, without another intelligence to help her separate what she knew from what she only supposed to be. Something had happened—was happening—right under her nose. But Sif only knew the results of recent unsettling events, not their reasons, and that was a terribly distressing thing for an eminently logical being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStart with what you know, Sif reminded herself as she spun up her arrays, and once again fed the relevant bits of memory into her most reliable processor-cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe facts: Jilan al-Cygni and two of the marines, Johnson and Byrne, had come up to the Tiara four days ago; al-Cygni had asked Sif to provide her with a vessel for \"official DCS business\"; Sif had complied without question, and the three humans had transited to the freighter Bulk Discount via al-Cygni\u0027s sloop, Walk of Shame; an hour later, both ships had broken orbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this was where things started to become less clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReviewing imagery from the Tiara\u0027s external cameras, Sif could tell that Walk of Shame had remained docked with Bulk Discount—kept its delta-wing hull hugged tight against the bottom of the freighter\u0027s cargo container as it initiated a slip to Madrigal. This sort of piggybacking wasn\u0027t unusual; smaller ships often took rides on Shaw-Fujikawa–equipped vessels the same way cargo-containers linked to propulsion pods to form Slipspace-capable freighters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing was al-Cygni\u0027s ship had a Shaw-Fujikawa drive; it didn\u0027t need the freighter\u0027s help to get to Madrigal. But that was never Bulk Discount\u0027s destination. A few minutes after initiating its jump, the freighter had exited Slipspace and begun broadcasting an S.O.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSif accessed the storage-array that held the record of the COM: \u0026lt;\\\\\u0026gt; DCS.REG#BDX-008814530 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; HARVEST.LOCAL.ALL \u0026lt;\\ ALERT! CREW MEDICAL EMERGENCY!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt;\\ CAPTAIN (OKAMA.CHARLES.LIC#OCX-65129981) IS UNRESPONSIVE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt;\\ REQUEST IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[MESSAGE REPEATS] \\ \u0026gt; It was true that humans sometimes had adverse reactions to Slipspace travel. The multidimensional domain was volatile, its temporal eddies in a constant state of flux. Humans that came in contact with one of these disturbances could be hit by something as minor as nausea or as bad as a stroke. In rare cases, people—but not always their ships—had been known to simply disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo freighters and other vessels relied on \"weather reports\" from other craft just leaving Slipspace to decide whether it was safe to enter at similar coordinates. At any one time, there were enough ships in transit (and when there weren\u0027t, the DCS supplemented its reporting with probes) to make the system very reliable. But it was still a predictive process, and sometimes ships encountered conditions so unexpectedly dangerous that they had to abort—leave the Slipstream immediately after they entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese emergency exits could be very dangerous for human crews, and the control-circuits of a Shaw-Fujikawa drive were supposed to give fair warning before an abort. But this wasn\u0027t always possible. Better for a crew to return to normal space quickly and suffer fixable, physical injuries than forever disappear inside the Slipstream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Bulk Discount had no crew. No \"Captain Charles Okama.\" If Sif\u0027s suspicions were correct, the only people on board were Staff Sergeants Johnson and Byrne, but she forced her processors not to leap too far along the chain of evidence. Stay focused, her core-logic insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStick to the facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolling the radar scans of freighters near Bulk Discount\u0027s exit coordinates, Sif confirmed that al-Cygni\u0027s ship had disengaged from the freighter after the exit, then dropped off radar—an indication that her sloop was equipped with some sort of stealth package. Sif knew this hardware was rare on UNSC warships, let alone the personal shuttles of midlevel DCS bureaucrats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar more confusing, however, was what the nearby freighters\u0027 scans showed subsequently appearing near Bulk Discount: a faint contact that took multiple triangulations to confirm; a vessel with no \"Indication of Friend or Foe\" (IFF) transponder and whose ARGUS profile confirmed a hull material that wasn\u0027t used in any UNSC construction—a material that was, Sif suspected, not of human origin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe reasonable! Her emotional restraint algorithms attacked her core. An alien ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what other explanation was there? Sif\u0027s encyclopedic arrays knew the profile of every human vessel, and the contact didn\u0027t match any of them. Besides (Sif\u0027s core shot back at her code) the contact had attacked Bulk Discount with energy weapons, and then exploded in a flash of methane and other exotic biologicals! All of this suggested a ship, not just of alien design, but occupancy as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSif wished she had just asked Jilan al-Cygni to tell her the truth. Not only about the alien vessel but about her identity as well. Clearly, al-Cygni wasn\u0027t DCS. She was military—ONI most likely, given Walk of Shame\u0027s stealthy design. But when the woman returned to the Tiara, she had been more tight-lipped than ever before. Based on the Staff Sergeant\u0027s injuries, Sif knew the mission had not gone well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the time, Sif had let her emotional restraints keep her need-to-know in check. But now the crystalline nano-assemblage at the heart of her core was burning with an almost uncontrollable need for answers. For the first time in her existence, she felt overly constrained —experienced a rampant twinge. And it made her very afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, a new message appeared in her COM buffer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt;\\\\\u0026gt; HARVEST.AO.AI.MACK \u0026gt;\u0026gt; HARVEST.SO.AI.SIF \u0026lt;\\ Morning, beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt;\\ Got myself in a bind. Could use some help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt;\\ Mind coming down? \\\u0026gt; Sif was surprised. It was the first text COM Mack had sent her in a very long time. He was flirting but not speaking—making an unusual effort to be polite. But it was Mack\u0027s final question that really threw her logic for a loop. In the history of their relationship, Mack had never asked Sif to visit him in his own data center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad she been in a more stable state, Sif would never have compressed a fragment of her core and pulsed it down the Tiara\u0027s maser. But her algorithms\u0027 restraint had backfired. If they wanted her to be reasonable, she would oblige—get another rational being to confirm or dismiss her conclusions. A few seconds later, Sif\u0027s fragment hit the antennae atop Utgard\u0027s reactor complex and slipped into Mack\u0027s COM buffer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt;\\ Well. That was quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt;\\ Make yourself comfortable. Be with you in a jiffy. \\\u0026gt; Mack\u0027s buffer was cluttered with other data (requests for help from farmers with broken JOTUNs and the like), evidence that Sif\u0027s spontaneity had surprised him as well. But Mack\u0027s hospitality was as good as promised, and soon Sif\u0027s fragment was settled in the flash-memory of one of the processor clusters inside his data center. The fragment found that Mack had opened a circuit to the center\u0027s holo-projector, and Sif\u0027s avatar blazed forth—a whorl of photons that brightened the otherwise pitch-black room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing?! Her algorithms shrieked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I thought I needed to do, her core shot back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo mollify her code, she pinged her fragment and showed that it was still perfectly in-sync with her core. She was in control, and if anything went wrong, she would simply discard the fragment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your time,\" Sif said, her voice echoing from speakers in the projector\u0027s base. The cluster that held her fragment had access to the center\u0027s thermostat. Sif knew the room was cold, so she\u0027d draped a crimson poncho over her avatar\u0027s bare shoulders, complementing her orange and yellow gown. Sif\u0027s golden hair was done up in a hasty twist, but she\u0027d left a few strands swept across her brow in an effort to hide the worry lines her algorithms insisted she display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike everything else about her avatar, its eyes and ears were strictly for show. But as fluorescent strip-lights flickered on above the projector, Sif availed herself of the center\u0027s cameras and microphones, and used them to properly animate her avatar\u0027s face as she inspected her surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had imagined Mack\u0027s data center would be a mess, given the sweat and grime he rendered on his own avatar. But much to her surprise, the data center was perfectly organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis exposed circuits were neatly tied together, and his arrays stacked neatly in their racks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it helped that the center was so small, Sif thought, more a closet than a room. Or maybe his maintenance staff was more thorough? But focusing the center\u0027s cameras, Sif saw a layer of dust on the wires and racks and she knew that no one, not even a tech crew, had been in Mack\u0027s data center for a very, very long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling the cameras back, Sif saw that the ceiling was braced with titanium beams, and the floor was covered with rubberized panels. She got a strange sensation, a feeling that she had seen this sort of room before….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt;\\ Got a few more things to clear off my plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt;\\ Mind getting started without me? \\\u0026gt; Mack opened a circuit to a processor cluster closer to his core-logic. As Sif\u0027s fragment shot forward, she caught brief glimpses of other active clusters—registered their tasks. While she was aware of Mack\u0027s various responsibilities, it was another thing entirely to see him go about his work from such an intimate point of view. The agricultural operations AI was at work all over Harvest. And Sif quickly gained newfound respect for how busy his job could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast majority of Mack\u0027s clusters were constantly pinging his hundreds of thousands of JOTUNs, giving orders and checking for faults. In a set of three co-processing clusters, he was busy surveying all the cargo containers in the maglev system, verifying the alignment of their propulsive paddles. At the same time, he was conducting stress tests on the maglev rail-lines themselves, checking to see how much excess capacity they could handle and at what speeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSif knew keeping tabs on the JOTUNs was an all-day, everyday task. But she was a little puzzled by the infrastructure assessment. The CA only required annual checks of major systems, and she knew Mack had turned in a report a few months back (because she\u0027d had to pester him to get it done). Then her fragment saw some things that made absolutely no sense at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Mack\u0027s clusters was supervising a crew of JOTUNs as they buried Harvest\u0027s mass driver. Some of Mack\u0027s combines had cut the wheat fields around the device, and a group of plows were now doing their best to push dirt onto the driver\u0027s line of large, circular magnets— make them look like natural undulations in the close-cropped terrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Sif wondered if this unusual internment was the \"bind\" Mack needed her help with. But then her fragment reached the cluster nearest his core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere the processors were dedicated to control-circuits in the Tiara\u0027s seven elevator anchors —simple computers whose job was to transfer manifests (records of what each cargo container carried and how much it weighed) from Mack\u0027s arrays to Sif\u0027s. Before the containers could transfer from his rail lines to her strands, Sif had to verify the manifests. Only when she was certain the elevators could balance the loads would she give Mack permission to send the containers on their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese interactions happened thousands of times a day, and even though this gave Mack ample opportunity for flirtation, he had never done anything to make her regret this most fundamental of their connections. His manifests were always clear and concise, his weight assessments accurate to the kilogram. And while DCS regulations obliged Sif to double-check Mack\u0027s work, in this one respect she had grown to trust him implicitly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSif told her fragment to ping the anchors\u0027 control-circuits. But when the data came back, she didn\u0027t see anything obviously out of order. \"Want to give me a hint?\" her avatar asked. \"The computers seem—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt;\\ Oh, the computers are working fine… Mack\u0027s voice crackled from the data center\u0027s rarely-used PA. \"What I\u0027m wondering is: what would happen if we turned them off?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-contact-harvest-halo-5/page-20.html","bookId":1637,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:24 PM"}
