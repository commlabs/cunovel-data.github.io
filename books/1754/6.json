He moved one hand slowly over his head, smoothing the sparse strands of light hair that did not manage to hide the pink streaks of hairless skull that lay between. He said, \"None that I could convince the Council of Science with. None that I could even present to Mr. Makian. But I believe I\u0027m right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it anything you would care to talk about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t know. Frankly, it\u0027s been a long time since I\u0027ve spoken to anyone but farmboys. You\u0027re a college man obviously. What did you major in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"History,\" said David promptly. \"My thesis concerned the international politics of the early atomic age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Benson looked disappointed. \"Any courses in science at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a couple in chemistry; one in zoology.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. It occurred to me that I might be able to convince Mr. Makian to let you help me in my laboratory. It wouldn\u0027t be much of a job, especially since you have no scientific training, but it would be better than what Hennes will have you doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mr. Benson. But about the Martians?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes. It\u0027s simple enough. You may not know it but there are extensive caves under the Martian surface, perhaps several miles under. So much is known from earthquake data, or, rather, Marsquake data. Some investigators claim they are merely the result of natural water action in the days when Mars still had oceans, but then radiation has been picked up that has its source beneath the soil and which can\u0027t have a human source but must have some intelligent source. The signals are too orderly to be anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes sense, really, if you stop to think about it. In the youth of the planet there was sufficient water and oxygen to support life, but with a gravity only two fifths that of Earth, both substances leaked slowly away into space. If there were intelligent Martians, they must have been able to foresee that. They might have built huge caverns well underneath their soil, into which they could retire with enough water and air to continue indefinitely, if they kept their population stable. Now suppose these Martians found that their planet\u0027s surface was harboring intelligent life once more-life from another planet. Suppose they resented it or feared our eventual interference with them. What we call food poisoning might be bacteriological warfare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid said thoughtfully, \"Yes, I see your point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But would the Syndicate? Or the Council of Science? Well, never mind. I\u0027ll have you working for me soon, and perhaps we\u0027ll be able to convince them yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and held out a soft hand which was swallowed up in David Starr\u0027s large one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they\u0027ll be letting you out now,\" Benson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did let him out, and for the first time David had the chance to observe the heart of a Martian farm. It was domed, of course, as the city had been. David had been sure of that from the instant he had regained consciousness. You couldn\u0027t expect to be breathing free air and living under Earth-strength gravity unless you were within a powered dome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally the dome was much smaller than that of a city. At its highest it was only about one hundred feet, its translucent structure visible in all its details, strings of white fluorescent lights outdoing the translucent glimmer of the sunlight. The whole structure covered about half a square mile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the first evening, however, David had little time to extend his observations. The farm dome seemed full of men and they all had to be fed three times a day. In the evenings particularly, with the day\u0027s work done, there seemed no end to them. Stolidly he would stand behind the chow table while farmboys with plastic platters moved past him. The platters, David found out eventually, were manufactured especially for Martian farm use. Under the heat of human hands they could be molded and closed about the food at such times as it was necessary to carry meals out to the desert. Molded so, they kept the sand out and the heat in. Within the farm dome they could be flattened out again and used in the usual way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe farmboys paid David little attention. Only Bigman, whose lithe frame slipped among the tables replacing sauce bottles and spice containers, waved to him. It was a terrible drop in social position for the little fellow, but he was philosophical about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only for a month,\" he had explained one time in the kitchen, when they were preparing the day\u0027s stew and the head cook had left on his own business for a few minutes, \"and most of the fellows know the score and are making it easy for me. Of course there\u0027s Griswold, Zukis, and that bunch: the rats that try to get somewhere by licking Hennes\u0027s boots. But what in Space do I care? It\u0027s only a few weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother time he said, \"Don\u0027t let it bother you about the boys not cottoning to you. They know you\u0027re an Earthman, see, and they don\u0027t know you\u0027re pretty good for an Earthman, like I do. Hennes is always poking about after me, or else Griswold is, to make sure I don\u0027t talk to them, or else they would have heard the facts from me. But they\u0027ll get wise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the process was taking time. For David, it remained the same: a farmboy and his platter; a dollop of mashed potatoes, a ladle of peas, and a small steak (animal food was much scarcer on Mars than plant food, since meat had to be imported from Earth). The farmboy then helped himself to a sliver of cake and a cup of coffee. Then another farmboy with another platter; another dollop of mashed potatoes, another ladle of peas, and so on. To them, it seemed, David Starr was just an Earthman with a ladle in one hand and a large-tined fork in the other. He wasn\u0027t even a face; just a ladle and a fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cook stuck his head through the door, his little eyes peering piggily over the sagging pouches\" beneath. \u0027\"Hey, Williams. Rattle your legs and get some food into the special mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMakian, Benson, Hennes, and any others who were considered especially worthy in point of view of position or of length of service dined in a room by themselves. They sat at tables and had the food brought to them. David had been through this before. He prepared special platters and brought them into the room on a wheeled service table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threaded his way quietly through the tables, beginning with the one at which Makian, Hennes, and two others sat. At Benson\u0027s table he lingered. Benson accepted his platter with a smile and a \"How are you?\" and proceeded to eat with relish. David, with an air of conscientiousness, brushed at invisible crumbs. His mouth managed to get itself close to Benson\u0027s ears and his lips scarcely moved as he said, \"Anyone ever get poisoned here at the farm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenson started at the sudden sound of words and looked quickly at David. As quickly he looked away, tried to appear indifferent. He shook his head in a sharp negative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The vegetables are Martian, aren\u0027t they?\" murmured David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new voice sounded in the room. It was a rough yell from the other end of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By Space, you long Earth jackass, get a move on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Griswold, Ms face still stubbled. He must shave sometimes, David thought, since the stubble never grew longer, but no one ever seemed to see it shorter, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGriswold was at the last table to be visited. He was still mumbling, his anger boiling over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips drew back. \"Bring over that platter, dish-jockey. Faster. Faster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid did so, but without hurry, and Griswold\u0027s hand, with the fork in it, jabbed quickly. David moved more quickly, and the fork clanged sharply against the hard plastic of the tray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalancing the tray in one hand, David caught Griswold\u0027s fist with the other. His grip grew tight. The other three at the table pushed back their chairs and rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid\u0027s voice, low, icy, and dead level, sounded just high enough to be heard by Griswold. \"Drop it and ask for your ration decently, or you\u0027ll have it all at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGriswold writhed, but David maintained his hold. David\u0027s knee in the back of Griswold\u0027s chair prevented the farmboy from pushing away from the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask nicely,\" said David. He smiled, deceptively gentle. \"Like a man with breeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGriswold was panting harshly. The fork dropped from between his numbed fingers. He growled, \"Let me have the tray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please.\" He spat it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid lowered the tray and released the other\u0027s fist from which the blood had been crushed, leaving it white. Griswold massaged it with his other hand and reached for his fork. He looked about him, mad with fury, but there was only amusement or indifference in the eyes that met his. The farms on Mars were hard; each man had to care for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMakian was standing. \"Williams,\" he called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid approached. \"Sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMakian made no direct reference to what had just occurred, but he stood there for a moment, looking carefully at David, as though he were seeing him for the first time and liked what he saw. He said, \"Would you like to join the checkup tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The checkup, sir? What is that?\" Unobtrusively he surveyed the table. Makian\u0027s steak was gone, but his peas remained behind and the mashed potatoes were scarcely touched. He had not the grit, apparently, of Hennes, who had left a clean platter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The checkup is the monthly drive through all the farm to check on the plant rows. It\u0027s an old farm custom. We check on possible accidental breaks in the glass, on the condition and workings of the irrigation pipes and farm machinery, also on possible poaching. We need as many good men as possible out on the checkup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to go, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good! I think you\u0027ll do.\" Makian turned to Hennes, who had been listening throughout with cold and unemotional eyes. \"I like the boy\u0027s style, Hennes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe may be able to make a farmboy out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, Hennes____________________ \" His voice sank and David, moving away, could no longer catch it, but from the quick hooded glance Makian cast in the direction of Griswold\u0027s table, it could not have been very complimentary to the veteran farmboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Starr caught the footstep inside his own partitioning and acted even before he was fully awake. He slipped off the far side of the bed and underneath. He caught the glimpse of bare feet glimmering whitely in the pale light of the residual fluorescents shining through the window. The residuals were allowed to burn in the farm dome during the sleeping period to avoid darkness too inconveniently black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid waited, heard the rustle of the sheets as hands probed uselessly through the bed, then a whisper. \"Earthman! Earthman! Where in Space____________________ \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid touched one of the feet and was rewarded by a sudden withdrawal and a sharp intake of breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause and then a head, shapeless in the dusk, was near his. \"Earthman? You there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where else would I be sleeping, Bigman? I like it here under the bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little fellow fumed and whispered peevishly, \u0027\u0027You might have squeezed a yell out of me and then I would have been in the stew to my ears. I\u0027ve got to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now\u0027s your chance.\" David chuckled softly and crawled back into bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"You\u0027re a suspicious space bug for an Earthman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet,\" said David. \"I intend living a long life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re not careful, you won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m foolish to be here. If I\u0027m caught, I\u0027ll never get my reference papers. It\u0027s just that you helped me when I could use it, and it\u0027s my turn to pay back. What was it you did to this louse, Griswold?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a little mixup in the special mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little mixup? He was raving mad. It was all Hennes could do to hold him back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this what you came to tell me, Bigman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Part of it. They were behind the garage just after Eghts-out. They didn\u0027t know I was around, and I didn\u0027t tell them. Anyway, Hennes was yanking the stuffings out of Griswold; first for starting something with you when the Old Man was watching; and second, for not having the sand to finish once he had started it. Griswold was too mad to talk sense. Near as I could judge, he was just gargling something about how he would have your gizzard. Hennes said____________________ \" He broke off. \"Listen, didn\u0027t you tell me that Hennes was all clear as far as you were concerned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He seems so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those midnight trips-\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You only saw him once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once is enough. If it was legitimate, why can\u0027t you give me the straight stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not mine to give, Bigman, but it all seems legitimate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s the case, what\u0027s he got against you? Why doesn\u0027t he call off his dogs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, when Griswold finished talking, Hennes said he was to hold off. He said you would be out on checkup tomorrow and that would be the time. So I thought I\u0027d come and warn you, Earthman. Better stay off checkup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid\u0027s voice remained unflurried. \"Checkup would be time for what? Did Hennes say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t hear past that. They moved away and I couldn\u0027t follow, or I would have been out in the open. But I assume it\u0027s pretty plain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. But suppose we try to find out for sure exactly what they\u0027re after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman leaned close, as though he were trying to extract a reading from David\u0027s face despite the gloom. \"How do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid said, \"How do you suppose. I\u0027ll be at the checkup and give the boys a chance to show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t do that,\" gasped Bigman. \"You couldn\u0027t handle yourself on a checkup against them. You don\u0027t know anything about Mars, you poor Earthman you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then,\" said David phlegmatically, \"it could mean suicide, I suppose. Let\u0027s wait and see.\" He patted Bigman on the shoulder, turned over, and went to sleep again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/david-starr-space-ranger-lucky-starr-1/page-6.html","bookId":1754,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:18 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:18 AM"}
