Our relationship was changing, but even her gesture of support wasn’t enough to get me through this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my heart I knew what was coming and I couldn’t bear it. Not again. Everything within me wanted to scream how unfair this was. Like a little girl, I wanted to jump up and down and throw a temper tantrum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad’s not here to help me anymore, and the sense of abandonment I experienced was overwhelming. Irrational as it might seem, I was furious with my father for dying. I’m so angry. Angry with Dad. Angry with God. Angry at the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving spent most of two days drugged for the surgery, I now found the escape of sleep unavailable. Every time I closed my eyes, all I saw was Brad’s face. All I heard was his voice. What kept coming to mind was the last confrontation we had, that day on the phone, when I told him I didn’t want to see him again. I made it as plain as I could that I was not interested in continuing our relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t understand, of course, that I was doing him a favor and seemed bent on arguing, trying to change my mind. I regret the things I said, but I couldn’t tell him the truth, so I’d led him to believe my interests lay elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Margaret strongly disapproved of my breaking up with Brad. However, I told her this is my life and I make my own decisions. That shut her up, but I could tell she was furious. I can deal with her displeasure, though. I have dealt with it nearly all of our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t think she’s blamed me for the return of the cancer. I’ve tried to be grateful for that one small bit of compassion on my sister’s part. When I told her the news, she grew very solemn and told me how sorry she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if my thoughts had conjured her up, Margaret stood in the doorway to my room. “I see the flowers arrived,” she said, looking ill-at-ease. She glanced around warily, as if she half expected an orderly to grab her, throw her on a gurney and wheel her off for experimental surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The flowers are very nice,” I told her. “It was a thoughtful thing to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” she said, tentatively stepping closer to the bed. “How did the tests go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged because there wasn’t anything to say. “About the same as last time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret’s eyebrows rose in sympathy. “That bad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a genuine effort to smile, but the best I could manage was a grimace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom wanted to come….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. My mother didn’t know the reason I’d been admitted, and I wanted to keep it that way. On reflection, if there’s anything positive about my father’s death, it’s that he went quickly. Mom wouldn’t have been able to cope with a long illness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suspect Margaret’s a lot like our mother, and her willingness to visit me now revealed how much our relationship had evolved over the past few months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce she figured it was safe to relax, Margaret pulled the visitor’s chair to the side of my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad you came,” I told her, “because there are a few things I want to discuss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if she hadn’t heard me. “I don’t think now is a good time….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please.” The tone of my voice seemed to reach her, even if my words didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResigned, Margaret sighed heavily. “All right, what is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been thinking about what will happen to A Good Yarn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret’s expression was painful. “I’ve given that some thought myself. You know I don’t knit, but I’d be willing to step in and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t ask you to do that.” Asking my sister to take over my business hadn’t occurred to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a possibility. Mom and I could trade days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer generosity touched me deeply, and for the first time since I’d entered the hospital, I felt tears clogging my throat and filling my eyes. “I can’t believe you’d be willing to do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret stared at me in surprise. “You’re my sister. I’d do anything I could to help you, including…” She hesitated, drew in a deep breath and looked over her shoulder. “We can talk about this later, all right? Nothing’s for sure, so why don’t we cross that bridge once we get to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have another visitor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined one of my nieces had come with her and looked expectantly toward the door. I’d wanted to settle the future of my yarn shop immediately, but it made sense to wait until Dr. Wilson delivered his verdict. I hadn’t believed I’d survive the second bout of cancer, and I had no illusions about the third. The fight had gone out of me and I was willing to accept my fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe awful truth, what I could never say aloud to Margaret or my mother, is that I preferred death over treatment. I felt I couldn’t do this again, couldn’t endure the agony of chemotherapy. I was an adult and capable of making my own decision. Well, I’d made it. I’d decided to refuse treatment and let the cancer take its course. The only person I could discuss this with was Dr. Wilson, and I wouldn’t see him until he’d had a chance to analyze the test results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me a moment,” Margaret said. She rose from the chair and disappeared into the hallway outside my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in for a shock when she returned. The visitor she brought in with her wasn’t Julie or Hailey, but Brad. Everything inside me wanted to scream at him to leave and for Margaret to go with him. I couldn’t stand it. One look at the tender concern on Brad’s face, and I reacted like a juvenile, covering my face with both hands. Then, to my horror, I unceremoniously burst into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Brad’s arms come around my shoulders. “You could have told me, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped my hands and refused to look at him or speak. My fury was focused on my meddling sister. “How could you?” I shouted at her. “How could you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could you?” she shouted right back. It was as though the room had developed an echo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrad interrupted our shouting match. He spoke in a strong, determined voice. “If you’d told me what was wrong we could have talked it out, Lydia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go away.” I turned to look him straight in the face, although my heart was breaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “Sorry, that isn’t going to happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have any choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not letting you drive me away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you get it?” I cried, and nearly choked on the words. “There’s no future with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes soft, he reached for my hand. “But there’s today and tomorrow and the next day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my chin toward the ceiling. I didn’t understand why everyone had to make this so difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lydia,” Margaret said. “Would you stop feeling so damned sorry for yourself and get a grip?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t expect anything different from my sister. She wasn’t the one who’d gone through this nightmare. She wasn’t the one who’d suffered weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. My sister acted as though my cancer was a minor inconvenience. As though I should just get over it and deal with life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t tell you what the future holds,” Brad said, his gaze earnest, “but I can tell you that whatever happens, I intend to be here, for you and with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d heard that before, too. Same words, different year. But after two days of being poked and prodded, I was in no state of mind for an argument. “Please, just leave…I can’t deal with this now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret and Brad exchanged glances. They didn’t seem to believe me. Nor did they care what I wanted or needed, because they utterly ignored my request. They gave me no option, so I slammed my hand on the bell to call the nurse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you need?” A tinny voice rang through the intercom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peace,” I cried. “I need peace and quiet and these people refuse to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret pinched her lips together and slowly shook her head. And from the grim frown on Brad’s face, it would take the Seventh Cavalry—or one annoyed nurse—to make him vacate my room. I slid down in the bed and rolled over, offering him my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We haven’t finished our discussion,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t answer him. As far as I was concerned, I’d already told him everything I intended to. Nothing he said was going to change my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard footsteps enter the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were just leaving,” Margaret told the nurse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself not to roll over and watch my sister and Brad walk out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps I had a bigger problem than cancer. I’d just thrown out the only two people in the world who’d come to offer me their love and support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 38\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCAROL GIRARD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC arol and Doug arrived at the fondue restaurant in the Seattle University district before Rick. They were already seated and had each ordered a glass of chardonnay while they waited for her brother and possibly Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had taken Carol several days to reach him. Their conversation had been short. She’d invited Rick to dinner and asked him to bring Lisa, too, if she was available. After setting the date and time, he’d promised to see if Lisa could come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think she’ll be with him?” Carol asked, clutching her husband’s arm. This night could be one of the most important in their married life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Doug had an opportunity to answer, Carol saw the hostess leading her brother to the table. He was alone, but perhaps that was for the best. After talking the matter over, she and Doug had decided her brother could present their idea to Lisa. She might have found it awkward to discuss such a private matter with complete strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol had intended to spend the evening socializing with Rick—or the couple if Lisa showed up—and then afterward invite them to the apartment, where they’d make their suggestion. Doug would do the talking, they’d agreed, and that would give Carol a chance to gauge Rick’s feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here you are,” Rick said. He kissed Carol’s cheek before taking a seat across from them. His eyes avoided hers. “Mom told me about the miscarriage. I’m so sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir drinks came then, providing a distraction. Rick ordered a double whiskey. “I’m not flying until tomorrow night,” he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s everything in your life?” Doug asked as soon as the waitress had taken their dinner order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hunky dory,” Rick said flippantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol reached for her husband’s hand beneath the table. “How’s Lisa?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, I guess. I haven’t talked to her in a week or so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he hadn’t bothered to extend the dinner invitation, after all. Well, she supposed it didn’t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You certainly seem to be in good spirits.” Rick directed the comment at Carol. “I expected you to be all depressed. Mom said you’d taken the miscarriage really hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grimaced. “I did, but life goes on.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shop-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-1/page-38.html","bookId":1933,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM"}
