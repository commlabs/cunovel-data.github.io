I couldn’t wait for him to come back and steal more from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I knew, even then, my life would never be the same again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe electronic belch of the prison gate rang to notify guards on the other side whenever the doors were about to open. It was meant to be a warning. Caution. But to me, it was the sound of freedom, because today, they blasted for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stood before them, the obnoxious wail echoed between my ears with a piercing intensity. It made my hands twitch at my sides and nerves rattle like loose change in my stomach. Then metal grated on metal as the gray steel began to peel apart, slowing baring the world beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColor assaulted me. A pristine azure sky, bright yellow taxi with a white puff of smoke coughing from the tailpipe, glistening silver gates, a piercing red stop sign down the block, and grass as green as the moss that grew on the trees in the woods behind my childhood home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d been eighteen when I’d stepped behind bars. For six years, my world had been nothing but grays and browns, blacks, and inmate orange. So I had to wince against the blinding onslaught of fresh, new color until I lifted my hand to shield my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight warmed my chilled palm and it sent a ripple of anxiety down my spine. I tried to control my erratic breaths and slow the whiplash of my heartbeat, hide the overwhelming insecurities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t expected quite this level of emotion. What perplexed me most, though, was that the overriding sensation wasn’t even relief. It was fear. I no longer knew this world. I wasn’t prepared to step into it. I didn’t even know if I wanted to be a part of it. But I sure as hell didn’t want to stay here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiping my hand over my face to clear my expression, I took a step forward, my first toward freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard next to me nudged my arm. “Hey, Parker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heels of my shoes collided with the floor, jerking me to a halt. Expecting him to hitch his chin toward the belly of the prison and drag me back to my cell—telling me this was simply a test run, I wasn’t really being released today—I did nothing but stare blankly when he pulled a folded bill from his pocket and extended it my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I only blinked at the cash, he jabbed it at me again, like some kind of jousting stick. “Buy yourself some new clothes, will you? You look like shit in those.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze darted from the money to his face, back and forth, a ticking pendulum of indecision. I didn’t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to shake my head, so he sighed. “Just take it already.” He glanced away, uncomfortable with his gift. “It’s only twenty bucks. You’ll barely be able to buy a meal with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes flared. If you couldn’t even buy a meal with twenty dollars these days, I wasn’t prepared for life on the outside at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there went the acid in my stomach again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on. I know you need it. I’m the one who pulled your possessions. You have exactly eleven cents in your pocket.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed and slowly reached for the cash. “Okay, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced away. “Don’t get too excited, it’s not much. I wish I could’ve helped more. You’re a good kid. You never belonged here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat closed as I studied him. I was going to miss him. He’d been the only source of nice I’d had in the last six years, and I was probably never going to see him again. I opened my mouth to thank him, to say good-bye, to...I don’t know. But nothing I thought to say sounded even remotely effective enough to convey what I really meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I...” I glanced down at the money. “It’s more than I expected.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, that sounded awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard laughed softly and nudged my shoulder. “Go on. Your ride’s waiting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the taxi, then back to him. “Good-bye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “Stay out of trouble. I don’t want to see you back here again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” He didn’t have to worry about that. I sent him a small wave before half walking, half jogging toward my one and only state-funded cab ride to a destination of my choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy clothes stretched and pinched as I moved. I’d grown enough that the hem of my pants fell well above my ankles and my shirt was so tight the seams groaned, protesting each step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I’d worn this very outfit, I was being arrested for raping Abbott Bainbridge’s only daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where to?” the cabbie asked as I opened the back door and slid in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there, staring at him. Where to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy had I not thought of an answer for that question until this very moment? All morning, ever since I’d been informed I was being let go, I’d only been concerned about getting free; I hadn’t even thought about what I’d do when I actually was free. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-5.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
