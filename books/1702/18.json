At the weaving shed, Kira paused, greeted the women, and asked about Matt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t seen him! And good riddance, too!\" one of the workers replied. \"The useless scamp!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When\u0027re you coming back, Kira?\" another asked. \"We could use your help. And you\u0027re old enough to be on the looms now! With your mother gone, you must need the work!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut another woman laughed loudly and pointed to Kira\u0027s clean new clothes. \"She don\u0027t need us no more!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe looms began to click and move again. Kira turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, she heard an oddly familiar, oddly frightening sound. A low growl. Quickly she glanced around, half expecting to see a menacing dog or something worse. But the sound had come from a cluster of women near the butcher\u0027s. They burst into laughter when they saw her looking. She saw Vandara in their midst. The scarred woman turned her back on Kira and she heard the growl again: a human imitation of a beast. Kira lowered her head and limped past them, ignoring the cruel laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas had gone ahead; she could see him far beyond the butcher\u0027s. He had stopped near a group of young boys playing in the mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dunno!\" one was saying as she approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gimme coins and maybe I could find him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked them about Matt,\" Thomas explained, \"but they say they haven\u0027t seen him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you suppose he might be sick?\" Kira asked, worried. \"His nose is always running. Maybe we should never have cleaned him up. He was accustomed to that layer of dirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys, slapping their bare feet in the mud, were listening. \"Matt\u0027s the strongest of the strong!\" one said. \"He never be sick!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smaller one wiped his own runny nose on the back of his hand. \"His mum be yelling at him. I heared her. And she throwed a rock at him too, and he laughed at it and run off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\" Kira asked the runny-nosed boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dunno,\" he said. \"Maybe two days ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It were!\" chimed in another. \"Two days ago! I seed it too. His mum chucked a rock at him \u0027cause he tooken some food! He said he were goin\u0027 on a journey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s all right, Kira,\" Thomas reassured her, and they walked on. \"He takes care of himself better than most adults. Here — I think this is where we turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed him down an unfamiliar narrow lane. The huts were closer together here, and close to the edge of the woods, so that they were shaded by trees and smelled of dankness and rot. They came to a foul-smelling stream and crossed it by a slippery, primitive bridge of logs. Thomas took her hand and helped her; it was treacherous, with her bad leg, and she feared slipping into the water, which was quite shallow but clogged with filth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side of the stream, beyond the thick poisonous oleander bushes that were such a danger to tykes, lay the area known as the Fen. In some ways it was similar to the place that Kira had called home: the small cotts, close together; the incessant wailing of infants; the stench of smoky fires, rotting food, and unwashed humans. But it was darker here, with the trees thick overhead, and festering with dampness and an odor of ill health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why must there be such a horrible place?\" Kira whispered to Thomas. \"Why do people have to live like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s how it is,\" he replied, frowning. \"It\u0027s always been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden vision slid into Kira\u0027s mind. The robe. The robe told how it had always been; and what Thomas had said was not true. There had been times — oh, such long ago times — when people\u0027s lives had been golden and green. Why could there not be such times again? She began to say it to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thomas,\" she suggested, \"you and I? We\u0027re the ones who will fill in the blank places. Maybe we can make it different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she saw how he was looking at her. His look was skeptical, amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" He didn\u0027t understand. Perhaps he never would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Kira told him, shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they walked, an ominous quiet fell. Kira became aware of eyes. Women stood in shadowed doorways, watching them suspiciously. Kira limped along, trying to find ways around the garbage-strewn puddles in the path, and felt the hostile stares. It made no sense, she knew, to walk without a destination through this unfamiliar, malevolent place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thomas,\" she murmured, \"we must ask someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped, and she stopped beside him. They stood uncertainly in the path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What be your purpose?\" a hoarse voice called from an open window. Kira looked, and saw a green lizard slither into the vines at the sill; behind the fluttering wet leaves a gaunt-faced woman was holding a tyke in her arms and looking out. There seemed no men around. She realized the men, mostly draggers and diggers, would all be working, and she felt relieved, remembering how they had grabbed at her the day of the weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira made her way through the thorny underbrush and went closer to the window. Through it, she could see the dark interior of the cott, where several other tykes, half-naked, stood staring dull-eyed and frightened toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for the boy called Matt,\" she said politely to the woman. \"Do you know where he lives?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you be giving me fer it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Giving you? I\u0027m sorry,\" Kira told her, startled by the question. \"I don\u0027t have anything to give.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nary food?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m sorry.\" Kira held her hands out, showing that they were empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have an apple.\" Thomas approached and to Kira\u0027s surprise, took a dark red apple from his pocket. \"I saved it from lunch,\" he explained to Kira in a low voice, and he held it toward the woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thin arm reached out from the open window and grabbed the fruit. She bit at it and began to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" Kira said. \"The cott where Matt lives! Can you tell us, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman turned back, her mouth full. \"Further down,\" she said, chewing noisily. The infant in her arms grabbed at the bitten apple, and she shoved its hands away. She gestured with her head. \"There be a busted tree in front.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira nodded. \"And please, one more thing,\" she pleaded. \"What can you tell us about a tyke named Jo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman\u0027s face changed and Kira found it hard to interpret the look. For a moment, a brief flicker of joy had washed across the thin, embittered face. Then hopelessness replaced it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The little singing girl,\" the woman said, her voice a hoarse whisper. \"She be tooken. They tooken her away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away abruptly and disappeared into the shadowed interior of the cott. Her children began to cry and to claw at her for food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gnarled tree was dying, split almost to the ground and rotting. Perhaps it had once borne fruit. But now its limbs were broken, dangling at odd angles, punctuated by occasional wisps of brown leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small cott behind the tree looked damaged and neglected too. But there were voices inside: a woman speaking roughly and a sharp-tongued child answering her in an angry, spiteful tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas knocked. The voices became quiet and finally the door opened slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who you be?\" the woman asked abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re friends of Mart\u0027s,\" Thomas told her. \"Is he inside? Is he all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who be it, Mum?\" the child\u0027s voice called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman peered at Thomas and Kira silently, not answering. Finally Thomas called to the child, \"Is Matt at home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he done now? What you be wanting him for?\" the woman asked, her eyes glinting with mistrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He runned off! And tooken food too!\" A tyke called to them; his head, thick with tousled, unkempt hair, appeared beside the woman. He pushed the door open wider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira looked in dismay at the cott\u0027s dark interior. A pitcher, overturned on a table, lay in a puddle of some thick liquid through which insects crawled. The tyke at the door picked his nose with one finger, scratched himself with the other hand, and stared at them. His mother coughed wetly and then spat something to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where he went?\" Kira asked, trying not to show how shocked she felt at the condition of these people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman shook her head and coughed again. \"Good rid to him,\" she said. She shoved the tyke to the side and pulled the heavy wooden door closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, Kira and Thomas turned away. Behind them, they heard the door open. \"Miss? I know where Matt goed,\" the tyke\u0027s voice said. He emerged from the cott despite his mother\u0027s scolding voice and came to them. He was clearly Matt\u0027s brother. He had the same bright, mischievous eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you gimme?\" His finger went into his nose again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira sighed. Life in the Fen was apparently a series of barters. No wonder Matt had become such a clever manipulator and entrepreneur. She looked helplessly at Thomas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have anything to give you,\" she explained to the tyke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eyed her appraisingly. \"How about that there, miss?\" he suggested, pointing to Kira\u0027s neck. She touched the thong from which hung the polished stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she told the tyke, and her fingers curled protectively around the stone. \"This was my mother\u0027s. I can\u0027t give it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her surprise, he nodded as if that made sense to him. \"That there, then?\" He pointed to her hair. Kira remembered that she had tied it back that morning, as she often did, with a simple leather cord of no value. Quickly she pulled it loose and held it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tyke grabbed it and thrust it into his pocket. It seemed to be a satisfactory payment. \"Our mum, she thrashed Matt so hard he was horrid bloody, and so him and Branchie, they goed on a journey and they not be coming back, not to the Fen,\" the tyke announced. \"Matt, he got friends who be taking good care of him, not thrashing him never! And they give him food, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas laughed a little. \"And they make him take baths,\" he added, though the tyke just stared, not understanding the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he meant us!\" Kira pointed out. \"We\u0027re the friends he meant!\" She was concerned. \"If he tried to come to us, where is he? It was two days ago that he left here, and no one\u0027s seen him since. He knew the way to —\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt\u0027s brother interrupted her. \"Him and Branchie, they goed someplace else first. He be getting a giftie for his friends. That be you, miss? And you?\" He looked at Thomas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt, he say that a giftie makes a person like you best of all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira sighed in exasperation. \"No, that\u0027s not the way it is. A gift —\" She gave up. \"Never mind. Tell us where he went.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He be getting you some blue!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blue? What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dunno, miss. But Matt, he said it. He be saying they got blue yonder, and he be getting you some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman reappeared in the open doorway and called in a shrill and angry voice to the tyke, who retreated inside. Thomas and Kira turned away and began to retrace their steps on the muddy path back toward the village. Silent watchers still lurked in doorways. The fetid air still hung humid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira whispered to Thomas. \"When Matt disappeared, I thought perhaps we would find that he had been taken too. Like Jo.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gathering-blue-the-giver-quartet-2/page-18.html","bookId":1702,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:33 AM"}
