Do we have any scissors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody took Tommy by the sleeve a few inches above where Scott was clamped. \"You ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy nodded and she ripped his sleeve off at the shoulder. Scott skulked into the bedroom, the sleeve still clamped in his jaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was my best shirt,\" Tommy said, looking at his bare arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, but we\u0027ve got to clean this place up and get a story together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did she call from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was at the Fairmont Hotel. We\u0027ve got maybe ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she won\u0027t be staying with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? My mother under the same roof where people are living in sin? Not in this lifetime, turtleboy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy took the turtleboy shot in stride. This was an emergency and there was no time for hurt feelings. \"Does you mother use phrases like \u0027living in sin\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she has it embroidered on a sampler over the telephone so she won\u0027t forget to use it every month when I call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy shook his head. \"We\u0027re doomed. Why didn\u0027t you call her this month? She said you always call her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody was pacing now, trying to think. \"Because I didn\u0027t get my reminder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What reminder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My period. I always call her when I get my period each month\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; just to get all the unpleasantness out of the way at one time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When was the last time you had a period?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody thought for a minute. It was before she had turned. \"I don\u0027t know, eight, nine weeks. I\u0027m sorry, I can\u0027t believe I forgot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy went to the futon, sat down, and cradled his head in his hands. \"What do we do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody sat next to him. \"I don\u0027t suppose we have time to redecorate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next ten minutes, while they cleaned up the loft, Jody tried to prepare Tommy for what he was about to experience. \"She doesn\u0027t like men. My father left her for a younger woman when I was twelve, and Mother thinks all men are snakes. And she doesn\u0027t really like women either, since she was betrayed by one. She was one of the first women to graduate from Stanford, so she\u0027s a bit of a snob about that. She says that I broke her heart when I didn\u0027t go to Stanford. It\u0027s been downhill since then. She doesn\u0027t like that I live in the City and she has never approved of any of my jobs, my boyfriends, or the way I dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy stopped in the middle of scrubbing the kitchen sink. \"So what should I talk about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would probably be best if you just sat quietly and looked repentant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how I always look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody heard the stairwell door open. \"She\u0027s here. Go change your shirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy ran to the bedroom, stripping off his one-sleever as he went. I\u0027m not ready for this, he thought. I have more work to do on myself before I\u0027m ready for a presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody opened the door catching her mother poised to knock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom!\" Jody said, with as much enthusiasm as she could muster. \"You look great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Evelyn Stroud stood on the landing looking at her youngest daughter with restrained disapproval. She was a short, stout woman dressed in layers of wool and silk under an eggshell cashmere coat. Her hair was a woven gray-blond, flared and lacquered to expose a pair of pearl earrings roughly the size of Ping-Pong balls. Her eyebrows had been plucked away and painted back, her cheekbones were high and highlighted, her lips lined, filled, and clamped tight. She had the same striking green eyes as her daughter, flecked now with sparks of judgment. She had been pretty once but was now passing into the limbo-land of the menopausal woman known as handsome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I come in,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody, caught in the half-gesture of offering a hug, dropped her arms. \"Of course,\" she said, stepping aside. \"It\u0027s good to see you,\" she said, closing the door behind her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy bounded from the bedroom into the kitchen and slid to a stop on stocking feet. \"Hi,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody put her hand on her mother\u0027s back. Frances flinched, ever so slightly, at the touch. \"Mother, this is Thomas Flood. He\u0027s a writer. Tommy, this is my mother, Frances Stroud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy approached Frances and offered his hand. \"Pleased to meet you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clutched her Gucci bag tightly, then forced herself to take his hand. \"Mrs. Stroud,\" she said, trying to head off the unpleasantness of hearing her Christian name come out of Tommy\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody broke the moment of discomfort so they could pass into the next one. \"So, Mom, can I take your coat? Would you like to sit down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Stroud surrendered her coat to her daughter as if she were surrendering her credit cards to a mugger, as if she didn\u0027t want to know where it was going because she would never see it again. \"Is this your couch?\" she asked, nodding toward the futon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a seat, Mother; we\u0027ll get you something to drink. We have...\" Jody realized that she had no idea what they had. \"Tommy, what do we have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy wasn\u0027t expecting the questions to start so soon. \"I\u0027ll look,\" he said, running to the kitchen and throwing open a cabinet. \"We have coffee, regular and decaf.\" He dug behind the coffee, the sugar, the powdered creamer. \"We have Ovaltine, and...\" He threw open the refrigerator. \"Beer, milk, cranberry juice, and beer\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; a lot of beer\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; I mean, not a lot, but plenty, and...\" He opened the chest freezer. Peary stared up at him through a gap between frozen dinners. Tommy slammed the lid.\"... that\u0027s it. Nothing in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Decaf, please,\" said Mother Stroud. She turned to Jody, who was returning from balling up her mother\u0027s cashmere coat and throwing it in the corner of the closet. \"So, you\u0027ve left your job at Transamerica. Are you working, dear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody sat in a wicker chair across the wicker coffee table from her mother. (Tommy had decided to decorate the loft in a Pier 1 Imports cheap-shit motif. As a result it was only a ceiling fan and a cockatoo away from looking like a Thai cathouse.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody said, \"I\u0027ve taken a job in marketing.\" It sounded respectable. It sounded professional. It sounded like a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might have told me and saved me the embarrassment of calling Transamerica only to find out that you had been let go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I quit, Mother. I wasn\u0027t let go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy, trying to will himself invisible, bowed his way between them to deliver the decaf, which he had arranged on a wicker tray with cream and sugar. \"And you, Mr. Flood, you\u0027re a writer? What do you write?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy brightened. \"I\u0027m working on a short story about a little girl growing up in the South. Her father is on a chain gang.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re from the South, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Indiana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she said, as if he had just confessed to being raised by rats. \"And where did you go to university?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I, um, I\u0027m sort of self-educated. I think experience is the best teacher.\" Tommy realized that he was sweating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" she said. \"And where might I read your work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not published yet.\" He squirmed. \"I\u0027m working on it, though,\" he added quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you have another job. Are you in marketing as well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody intervened. She could see steam rising off Tommy. \"He manages the Marina Safeway, Mother.\" It was a small lie, nothing compared to the tapestry of lies she had woven for her mother over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Stroud turned a scalpel gaze on her daughter. \"You know, Jody, it\u0027s not too late to apply to Stanford. You\u0027d be a bit older than the other freshmen, but I could pull a few strings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow does she do this? Jody wondered. How does she come into my home and within minutes make me feel like dirt on a stick? Why does she do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother, I think I\u0027m beyond going back to school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Stroud picked up her cup as if to sip, then paused. \"Of course, dear. You wouldn\u0027t want to neglect your career and family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a verbal sucker punch delivered with polite, extended-pinky malice. Jody felt something drop inside her like cyanide pellets into acid. Her guilt dropped through the gallows\u0027 trap and jerked with broken-neck finality. She regretted only the ten thousand sentences she had started with, \"I love my mother, but...\" You do that so people don\u0027t judge you cold and inhuman, Jody thought. Too late now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Perhaps you\u0027re right, Mother. Perhaps if I had gone to Stanford I would understand why I wasn\u0027t born with an innate knowledge of cooking and cleaning and child-rearing and managing a career and a relationship. I\u0027ve always wondered if it\u0027s lack of education or genetic deficiency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Stroud was unshaken. \"I can\u0027t speak for your father\u0027s genetic background, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy was grateful that Mother Stroud\u0027s attention had turned from him, but he could see Jody\u0027s gaze narrowing, going from hurt to anger. He wanted to come to her aid. He wanted to make peace. He wanted to hide in the corner. He wanted to wade in and kick ass. He weighed his polite upbringing against the anarchists, rebels, and iconoclasts who were his heroes. He could eat this woman alive. He was a writer and words were his weapons. She wouldn\u0027t have a chance. He\u0027d destroy her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he would have. He was taking a deep breath to prepare to light into her when he saw a swath of denim disappearing slowly under the frame of the futon: his dismembered shirt sleeve. He held his breath and looked at Jody. She was smiling, saying nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Stroud said, \"Your father was at Stanford on an athletic scholarship, you know. They would have never let him in otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you\u0027re right, Mother,\" Jody said. She smiled politely, listening not to her mother, but to the melodic scraping of turtle claws on carpet. She focused on the sound and could hear the slow, cold lugging of Scott\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Stroud sipped her decaf. Tommy waited. Jody said, \"So how long will you be in the City?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just came up to do some shopping. I\u0027m sponsoring a benefit for the Monterey Symphony and I wanted a new gown. Of course I could have found something in Carmel, but everyone would have seen it already. The bane of living in a small community.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody nodded as if she understood. She had no connection to this woman, not anymore. Frances Evelyn Stroud was a stranger, an unpleasant stranger. Jody felt more of a connection with the turtle under the futon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the futon, Scott spotted a pattern of scales on Mother Stroud\u0027s shoes. He\u0027d never seen Italian faux-alligator pumps, but he knew scales. When you are lying peacefully buried in the muck at the bottom of a pond and you see scales, it means food. You bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrances Stroud shrieked and leaped to her feet, pulling her right foot free of her shoe as she fell into the wicker coffee table. Jody caught her mother by the shoulders and set her on her feet. Frances pushed her away and backed across the room as she watched the snapping turtle emerge from under the futon merrily chomping on the pump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that? What is that thing? That thing is eating my shoe. Stop it! Kill it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy hurdled the futon and dived for the turtle, catching the heel of the shoe before it disappeared. Scott dug his claws into the carpet and backed off. Tommy came up with heel in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got part of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody went to her mother\u0027s side. \"I meant to call the exterminator, Mother. If I\u0027d had more notice...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Stroud was breathing in outraged yips. \"How can you live like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy held the heel out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want that. Call me a cab.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy paused, considered the opportunity, then let it pass and went to the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t go out without shoes, Mother. I\u0027ll get you something to wear.\" Jody went to the bedroom and came back with her rattiest pair of sneakers. \"Here, Mom, these will get you back to the hotel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Stroud, afraid to sit down anywhere, leaned against the door and stepped into the sneakers. Jody tied them for her and slipped the uneaten pump into her mother\u0027s bag. \"There you go.\" She stepped back. \"Now, what are we going to do for the holidays?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Stroud, her gaze trained on Scott, just shook her head. The turtle had wedged himself between the legs of the coffee table and was dragging it around the loft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cab pulled up outside and beeped the horn. Mother Stroud tore her gaze away from the turtle and looked at her daughter. \"I\u0027ll be in Europe for the holidays. I have to go now.\" She opened the door and backed out through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Bye, Mom,\" Jody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice meeting you, Mrs. Stroud,\" Tommy called after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the cab pulled away, Tommy turned to Jody and said, \"Well, that went pretty well, didn\u0027t it? I think she likes me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody was leaning against the door, staring at the floor. She looked up and began to giggle silently. Soon she was doubled over laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Tommy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody looked up at him, tears streaming her face. \"I think I\u0027m ready to meet your folks, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. They might be sort of upset that you\u0027re not a Methodist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Return of Breakfast\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor lay spread-eagle on the end of a dock in the Saint Francis Yacht Club Marina, watching clouds pass over the bay. Bummer and Lazarus lay beside him, their feet in the air, dozing. The three might have been crucified there, if the dogs hadn\u0027t been smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Men,\" the Emperor said, \"it seems to me now that there is, indeed, a point to that Otis Redding song about sitting on the dock of the bay. After a long night of vampire hunting, this is a most pleasant way to spend the day. Bummer, I believe a commendation is in order. When you led us down here, I thought you were wasting our time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBummer did not answer. He was dreaming of a park full of large trees and bite-sized mailmen. His legs twitched and he let out a sleepy ruff each time he crunched one of their tiny heads. In dreams, mailmen taste like chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor said, \"But pleasant as this is, it tastes of guilt, of responsibility. Two months tracking this fiend, and we are no closer to finding him than when we started. Yet here we lay, enjoying the day. I can see the faces of the victims in these clouds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus rolled over and licked the Emperor\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, Lazarus, without sleep we will not be fit for battle. Perhaps, in leading us here, Bummer was wiser than we thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor closed his eyes and let the sound of waves lapping against the piers lull him to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying at anchor, a hundred yards away, was a hundred-foot motor yacht registered in the Netherlands. Belowdecks, in a watertight stainless steel vault, the vampire slept through the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy had been asleep for an hour when pounding on the door downstairs woke him. In the darkness of the bedroom he nudged Jody, but she was out for the day. He checked his watch: 7:30 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loft rocked with the pounding. He crawled out of bed and stumbled to the door in his underwear. The morning light spilling though the loft\u0027s windows temporarily blinded him and he barked his shin on the corner of the freezer on his way through the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming,\" he yelled. It sounded as if they were using a hammer on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did a Quasimodo step and slid down the stairs, holding his damaged shin in one hand, and cracked the downstairs door. Simon peeked through the crack. Tommy could see a ball-peen hammer in his hand, poised for another pound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon said, \"Pardner, we need to have us a sit-down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sleeping, Sime. Jody\u0027s sleeping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re up now. Wake up the little woman, we need breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy opened the door a little wider and saw Drew dazzling a stoned and goofy grin behind Simon. \"Fearless Leader!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the Animals were there, holding grocery bags, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy thought, This is how Anne Frank felt when the Gestapo came to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon pushed through the door, causing Tommy to hop back a step to avoid having his toes skinned. \"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon looked at Tommy\u0027s erection-stretched jockey shorts. \"That just a morning wood, or you in the middle of something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, I was sleeping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re young, it could still grow some. Don\u0027t feel bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy looked down at his insulted member as Simon breezed past him up the stairs, followed by the rest of the Animals. Glint and Lash stopped and helped Tommy to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was sleeping,\" Tommy said pathetically. \"It\u0027s my day off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLash patted Tommy\u0027s shoulder. \"I\u0027m cutting class today. We thought you needed moral support.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what? I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cops came by the store last night looking for you. We wouldn\u0027t give them your address or anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cops?\" Tommy was waking up now. He could hear beers being popped open in the loft. \"What did the cops want with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wanted to see your time cards. They wanted to see if you were working on a bunch of nights. They wouldn\u0027t say why. Simon tried to distract them by accusing me of leading a black terrorist group.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was nice of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, he\u0027s a sweetheart. He told that new cashier, Mara, that you were in love with her but were too shy to tell her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive him,\" Clint said piously. \"He knows not what he does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon popped out onto the landing. \"Flood, did you drug this bitch? She won\u0027t wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay out of the bedroom!\" Tommy shook off Lash and Clint and ran up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto chewed an unlit cigar. \"I say we go to the kid\u0027s house and lean on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera looked up from a stack of green-striped computer printout. \"Why? He was working when all the murders happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he\u0027s all we\u0027ve got. What about the prints on the book; any thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were half a dozen good prints on the cover. Nothing the computer could match. Interesting thing is, none of the prints were the victim\u0027s. He never touched it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the kid; a match?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way to tell, he\u0027s never been printed. Let it go, Nick. That kid didn\u0027t kill these people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto ran his hand over his bald head as if looking for a bump that would hold an answer. \"Let\u0027s arrest him and print him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On what charges?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll ask him. You know what the Chinese say, \u0027Beat a kid every day; if you don\u0027t know why, the kid will. \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ever think about adopting, Nick?\" Rivera flipped the last page of the printout and threw it into the wastebasket by his desk. \"Justice doesn\u0027t have shit. All the unsolved murders with massive blood loss involve mutilation. No vampires here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor two months they had avoided using the word. Now, here it was. Cavuto took out a wooden match, scraped it against the bottom of his shoe, and moved it around the tip of his cigar. \"Rivera, we will not refer to this perp by the V-word again. You don\u0027t remember the Night Stalker. This fucking Whiplash Killer thing the press has picked up is bad enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t smoke in here,\" said Rivera. \"The sprout eaters will file a grievance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck \u0027em. I can\u0027t think without smoking. Let\u0027s run sex offenders. Look for priors of rapes and assaults with blood draining. This guy might have just graduated to killing. Then let\u0027s run it with cross-dressers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cross-dressers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I want to put this thing with the redhead to bed. Having a lead is ruining our perfect record.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke to a miasma of smells that hit her like a sockful of sand: burned eggs, bacon grease, beer, maple syrup, stale pot smoke, whiskey, vomit and male sweat. The smells carried memories from before the change\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; memories of high school keggers and drunken surfers face-down in puddles of puke. Hangover memories. Coming as they did, right after a visit from her mother, they carried shame and loathing and the urge to fall back into bed and hide under the covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought, I guess there\u0027s a few things about being human that I don\u0027t miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled on a pair of sweatpants and one of Tommy\u0027s shirts and opened the bedroom door. It looked as if the good ship International Pancakes had run aground in the kitchen. Every horizontal surface was covered with breakfast jetsam. She stepped through the debris, careful not to kick any of the plates, frying pans, coffee cups, or beer cans that littered the floor. Beyond the freezer and the counter she spotted the shipwreck survivor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy lay on the futon, limbs akimbo, an empty Bushmill\u0027s bottle by his head, snoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood there for a moment running her options over in her head. On one hand, she wanted to fly into a rage; wake Tommy up and scream at him for violating the sanctity of their home. A justifiable tantrum was strongly tempting. On the other hand, until now Tommy had always been considerate. And he would clean everything up. Plus, the hangover he was about to experience would be more punishment than she could dole out in a week. Besides, she wasn\u0027t really that angry. It didn\u0027t seem to matter. It was just a mess. It was a tough decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought, Oh heck, no harm, no foul. I\u0027ll just make him coffee and give him that \"I\u0027m-so-disappointed-in-you\" look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tommy,\" she said. She sat down on the edge of the futon and jostled him gently. \"Sweetheart, wake up; you\u0027ve destroyed the house and I need you to suffer for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy opened one bloodshot eye and groaned. \"Sick,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody heard a convulsive sloshing in Tommy\u0027s stomach and before she could think about it she had caught him under the armpits and was dragging him across the room to the kitchen sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God!\" Tommy cried, and if he was going to say anything else it was drowned out by the sound of his stomach emptying into the sink. Jody held him up, smiling to herself with the satisfaction of the self-righteously sober.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few seconds of retching, he gasped and looked up at her. Tears streamed down his face. His nose dripped threads of slime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheerfully, Jody said, \"Can I fix you a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God!\" His head went back into the sink and the body-wrenching heaves began anew. Jody patted his back and said \"Poor baby\" until he came up for air again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about some breakfast?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dived into the sink once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter five minutes the heaves subsided and Tommy hung on the edge of the sink. Jody turned on the faucet and used the dish sprayer to hose off his face. \"I guess you and the guys had a little party this morning, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy nodded, not looking up. \"I tried to keep them out. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m scum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are, sweetheart.\" She ruffed his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll clean it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you will,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m really sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are. Do we want to go back to the futon and sit down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Water,\" Tommy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran him a glass of water and steadied him while he drank, then aimed him into the sink when the water came back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you finished now?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dragged him into the bathroom and washed his face, rubbing a little too hard, like an angry mother administering an abrasive spit-bath to a chocolate-covered toddler. \"Now you go sit down and I\u0027ll make you some coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy staggered back to the living room and fell onto the futon. Jody found the coffee filters in the cupboard and began to make the coffee. She opened the cupboard to look for a cup but the Animals had used them all. They were strewn around the loft, tipped over or half full of whisky diluted by melted ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIce?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tommy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned and grabbed his head. \"Don\u0027t yell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tommy, did you guys use the ice from the freezer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Simon was bartending.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJody brushed the dishes and pans from the lid of the chest freezer and threw it open. The ice trays, the ones Tommy had bought for the drowning experiment, were empty and scattered around the inside of the freezer. Peary\u0027s frosty face stared up at her. She slammed the lid shut and stormed across the room to Tommy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, Tommy, how could you be so careless?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t yell. Please don\u0027t yell. I\u0027ll clean it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clean it up my ass. Someone was in the freezer. Someone saw the body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m going to be sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they come into the bedroom while I was sleeping? Did they see me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy cradled his head as if it would crack at any moment and spill his brains onto the floor. \"They had to get to the bathroom. It\u0027s okay; I covered you up so the light wouldn\u0027t get to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You idiot!\" She snatched up a coffee cup and prepared to throw it at him, then caught herself. She had to get out of here before she hurt him. She shook as she set the cup on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going out, Tommy. Clean up this mess.\" She turned and went to the bedroom to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she emerged, still shaking with anger, Tommy was standing in the kitchen looking repentant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you be home before I leave for work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at him. \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ll be back. Why didn\u0027t you just put a sign on the door, \u0027See the Vampire\u0027? This is my life you\u0027re playing with, Tommy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer. She turned and walked out, slamming the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll feed your turtles for you,\" he called after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodsucking-fiends-a-love-story-a-love-story-1/page-14.html","bookId":2047,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:46 PM"}
