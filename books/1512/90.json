His team, O\u0027Connell, and the Americans were all under their control.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O\u0027Connell laughed. \"See, I told you I already killed the mummy. You are making a fuss about nothing!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng sighed and said. \"No, the mummy is not dead. He\u0027s a monster, normal bullets are useless against him. No, all types of bullets should be useless against him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No one aside from the players knew what he was saying. The leader of the men in black, a man with a tattoo on his face, said. \"All of you leave this place at once! Don\u0027t ever come back... This is the city of the dead. If you come back again, I don\u0027t mind making you dead!\" Then he led his group down into the tomb.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To be honest, after what they just experienced, no one wanted to stay here. So they went back to their camp quietly and packed their stuff. Then left on their horses and camels.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The players followed at the back of the group. It wasn\u0027t until now that they had a chance to look at their watch. Usually once the plot started moving forward, their restrictions would also disappear. And of course they were no longer restricted by distance when they look at their watch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng said. \"Now that we are not restricted by distance, what should be do next? Wait here for team India? Since we are more familiar with this place... or follow O\u0027Connell and go along with the original plot? Honglu, do you have any suggestion?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Honglu was riding on a camel in the center of the group. He replied calmly. \"No, I don\u0027t have any good suggestion, but I have two questions... 1. What is team India\u0027s mission? Eliminate Imhotep or something else?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"2. Does team India also know of the special effect of the Book of the Dead and want to obtain it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng was confused. \"What do you mean by special effect?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tengyi said with a little embarrassment. \"When I came out from the tomb, I picked up the book and took a look. The moment I touched the book, I received a notification from God about obtaining a quest item... It said I can learn black magic. If I know hieroglyphs then it won\u0027t cost any points, otherwise every spell costs 1000 points. But I must return to God\u0027s dimension to learn it...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They all looked at Tengyi in surprise. Then Honglu said. \"Even though I don\u0027t know the reason but we can also use Book of the Dead. Oh, does it take a lot of points to learn a spell in God\u0027s dimension?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lan replied. \"Not only points but also lots of ranked rewards. Like I have two simple spells that can increase your stats temporarily, yet it took me several thousand points and rank D rewards. Offensive spells will need rank C or even B rewards to learn. Only 1000 points for one...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tengyi said humbly. \"I\u0027m sorry... I can read hieroglyphs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone fell into a silence then after a minute Zheng, Zero and Jie pulled out their guns, Yinkong also took out her dagger. They controlled their camels to run over to the Americans... The Book of the Dead was currently in the hands of the professor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Americans didn\u0027t notice the group until Zheng moved in front of them and blocked their way. That was when they saw the guns in shock.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, bro, this isn\u0027t funny...\" One of the Americans shouted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng sprayed at the ground in front of them and they stopped their horses. Everyone aside from the professor also put up their hands... They had seen the power of these guns, which were enough to tear them apart at such close distance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng said in a calm voice. \"I don\u0027t want to say much. Hand me the Book of the Dead. It isn\u0027t useful to you... And the mummy will come after you if you have it. I think you don\u0027t want to see that monster anymore right? Give me the Book of the Dead... I can give you gold in exchange.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Americans were giving each other signs, preparing to take out their guns at any moment. The professor held onto the book tightly, and stared at Zheng.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once they heard the word \u0027gold\u0027, the Americans\u0027 eyes lit up. \"Gold... how much gold?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O\u0027Connell and the other characters also came over to the Americans, but Zheng ignored them. He took out a gold bar from the ring and said. \"Ten gold bars like this just for a book. Do you think it\u0027s worth it?\" Then he threw the gold over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An American catched the gold bar anxiously. It felt heavy as he held it. It was real gold, several fingers thick.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He pinched it then bit it with his teeth then said to his partner. \"Real, it\u0027s real... this is a real gold bar!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The other American also took over the gold and did the same thing then he looked at Zheng with greed. \"Ten... fifteen gold bars! Give me fifteen gold bars then we have a deal!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ok, fifteen!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng didn\u0027t care. He took out another gold bar from the ring and as he was going to take out another one, an American suddenly pulled out his gun. However he didn\u0027t point it at Zheng but instead he shot the professor at once. Then the American grabbed the book from the professor\u0027s hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Book of the Dead was stained with blood... \n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both\"\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-5-chapter-5-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-5-chapter-5-3\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-5-chapter-5-2","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
