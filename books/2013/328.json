She felt no different now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were thousands. There must have been. How, then, could they hide? How could they have hidden for so long, all this time, invisible to us, invisible to the Awl?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless Redmask knows. And now, working in league with the strangers from the sea, they prepare an ambush. Our annihilation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right to be frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be one more battle. Neither side had anything left for more than that. And, barring more appalling displays of murderous skill from the mage-killer, Letherii sorcery would achieve victory. Brohl Handar’s scout had returned with the stunning news that Redmask had led his people out onto Q’uson Tapi, and there would be no negation of magic on the flat floor of a dead sea. Redmask forces the issue. Once we clash on Q’uson Tapi, our fates will be decided. No more fleeing, no more ambushes-even those Kechra will have nowhere to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErrant, heed me please. If you are indeed the god of the Letherii, deliver no surprises on that day. Please. Give us victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe column marched on, towards the ancient shore of a dead sea. Clouds were gathering on the horizon ahead. Rain was thrashing down on that salt-crusted bed of clay and silt. They would fight in a quagmire, where cavalry was useless, where no horse would be quick enough to outrun a wave of deadly magic. Where warriors and soldiers would lock weapons and die where they stood, until one side stood alone, triumphant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon now, they would have done with it. Done with it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince noon Redmask had driven his people hard, out onto the seabed, racing ahead of the rain-clouds. A league, then two, beneath searing sun and air growing febrile with the coming storm. He had then called a halt, but the activity did not cease, and Toc Anaster had watched, bemused at first and then in growing wonder and, finally, admiration, as the Awl warriors set down weapons, divested themselves of their armour, and joined with the elders and every other non-combatant in pulling free from the wagons the tents and every stretch of hide they could find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the wagons themselves were taken apart, broken down until virtually nothing remained but the huge wheels and theit axles, which were then used to transport the planks of wood. Hide and canvas were stretched out, pegged down, the stakes driven flush with the ground itself. Wooden walkways were constructed, each leading back to a single, centrally positioned wagon-bed that had been left intact and raised on legs of bundled spear-shafts to create a platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe canvas and hides stretched in rows, with squares behind each row, linked by flattened wicker walls that had been used for hut-frames. But no-one would sleep under cover this night. No, all that took shape here served but one purpose-the coming battle. The final battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask intended a defence. He invited Bivatt and her army to close with him, and to do so the Letherii and the Piste Edur would need to march across open ground-Toc sat astride his horse, watching the frenzied preparations and occasionally glancing northwestward, to those closing stormclouds-open ground, then, that would be a sea of mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe might decide to wait. I would, if I were her. Wait until the rains had passed, until the ground hardened once again. But Toe suspected that she would not exercise such restraint. Redmask was trapped, true, but the Awl had their herds-thousands of beasts most of whom were now being slaughtered-so, Redmask could wait, his warriors well fed, whilst Bivatt and her army faced the threat of real starvation. She would need all that butchered meat, but to get to it she had to go through the Awl; she had to destroy her hated enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, she might be less dismayed than Redmask would think, come the day of battle. She has her mages, after all. Not as many as before, true, but still posing a significant threat-sufficient to win the day, in fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask would have his warriors standing on those islands of dry ground. But such positions-with reserves on the squares behind them-offered no avenue of retreat. A final battle, then, the fates decided one way or the other, Was this what Redmask had planned? Hardly. Praedegar was a disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorrent rode up. No mask of paint again, a swath of red hives spanning his forehead. ‘The sea will live once more,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hardly,’ Toc replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Letherii will drown nonetheless.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Those tarps, Torrent, will not stay dry for long. And then there are the mages.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Redmask has his Guardians for those cowards.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Cowards?’ Toc asked, amused. ‘Because they wield sorcery instead of swords?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-328.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
