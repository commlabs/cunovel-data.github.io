We\u0027ll have to read through these notes and -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\" Amy\u0027s whole body tensed. An acrid smell filled the air. \"Is someone smoking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Alistair and Dan looked around in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Amy saw it. White smoke was thickening across the ceiling, drifting down in a deadly haze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fire!\" Dan yelled. \"Get to the stairs!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Amy froze. She was mortally afraid of fire. It brought back bad memories. Very bad memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" Dan tugged her hand. \"Saladin -- we have to find him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat jolted Amy into action. She couldn\u0027t let anything happen to the cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no time!\" Uncle Alistair insisted. \"We must get out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy\u0027s eyes stung. She could hardly breathe. She searched for Saladin, but he\u0027d disappeared. Finally, Dan dragged her up the stairs and shoved his shoulder against the secret bookshelf door. It wouldn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lever.\" Dan coughed. \"There\u0027s got to be a lever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan was usually good at figuring out mechanical stuff, but they groped around for a switch or a lever and found nothing. The smoke was getting thicker. Amy pushed on the wall and yelped. \"The surface is getting hotter! The fire\u0027s coming from the other side. We can\u0027t open it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to!\" Dan insisted, but it was Amy\u0027s turn to pull him along. She dragged him back down the stairs. The smoke was so bad now they could barely see each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get as low as you can!\" Amy said. She and Dan crawled through the library, desperately looking for another exit. She had no idea where Uncle Alistair had disappeared. The bookshelves were combusting -- old dry paper, the perfect kindling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy pulled herself up on a table and found the jewelry box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t take valuables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that was one of the first rules for getting out of a fire alive. But she scooped up the box and kept going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heat was getting worse. The air filled with ash. It was like breathing in a poison fog. Amy couldn\u0027t even crawl fast because she was wearing her stupid funeral dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard Dan coughing and wheezing behind her. His asthma -- he hadn\u0027t had an attack in months, but this smoke might kill him if the heat didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink, she ordered herself. If she were Grace, she would never make a secret room with only one exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy sank to the floor, coughing and choking. All she could see was the oriental carpet -- a parade of woven silk dragons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragons ... like the one on Grace\u0027s necklace. And they were all flying in the same direction, like they were leading the way. It was a crazy idea, but it was all she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow me!\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan was wheezing too badly to answer. Amy crawled along, looking back now and then to make sure he was still behind her. The dragons led them between two burning bookshelves and dead-ended in front of an air grate about three feet square. Not very big, but maybe big enough. Amy kicked at the grate with her feet. On the third try it rattled off, revealing a stone shaft slanting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dan!\" she yelled. \"Go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed him through and realized with a start that he was holding Saladin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, he\u0027d found the cat, and the cat was not happy about it. Saladin clawed and growled, but Dan held him tight. Amy followed, gasping for breath. Her eyes felt like they were being sandblasted. They climbed up the dark shaft, and after what seemed like ages, Dan stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Amy demanded. The heat wasn\u0027t as bad now, but the smoke was still thickening around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blocked!\" Dan wheezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Push it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn total darkness, she crawled up next to him and together they pushed on a flat smooth stone that was blocking their path. It had to open. It had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, it did -- popping up like a lid. Daylight blinded their eyes. They crawled out into fresh air and collapsed on the grass. Saladin got free with an indignant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MRRRRP!\" and shot off into the trees. They were lying in the cemetery, not fifty feet from Grace\u0027s newly filled grave. The slab they\u0027d pushed aside was somebody\u0027s tombstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dan, you okay?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan\u0027s face was streaked with soot. Steam rose from his hair and his clothes were even blacker than they had been before. He was breathing heavily. His arms bled from a hundred cat scratches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think ...\" He wheezed. \"Don\u0027t want ... collect tombstones ... after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoke poured out of the tunnel like a chimney, but that was nothing compared to what Amy saw when she looked up at the hill. Her throat constricted. \"Oh, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe family mansion was a roaring inferno. Flames winked in the windows and lapped up the sides of the building. As Amy watched, one stone tower collapsed. The beautiful stained glass windows melted. The family crest above the main entrance -- that old stone crest Amy had always loved -- crashed down and shattered on the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy ...\" Dan\u0027s voice sounded like it was about to break to pieces. \"The house ... we can\u0027t let it... we have to ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t finish. There was nothing they could do. A section of the roof crumpled, belching a fireball into the sky. Despair crushed the air right out of Amy\u0027s lungs, like the house was collapsing on top of her. She reached for Dan and hugged him. He didn\u0027t even protest. His nose was runny. His lower lip trembled. She wanted to comfort him, to tell him it would be all right, but she didn\u0027t believe it herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she noticed something that jolted her out of her daze. In the driveway lay a collapsed figure, a man in a gray suit. \"Mr. McIntyre!\" Amy cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to run to his aid when her brother gasped, \"Get down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t as strong as she was, but he must\u0027ve been desperate, because he tackled her with so much force she just about ate the lawn. He pointed up the road that led through the hills -- the only exit from the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout five hundred yards away, half hidden in the trees, a man in a black suit was standing very still. How Dan had spotted him so far away, Amy didn\u0027t know. She couldn\u0027t make out the man\u0027s face, but he was tall and thin, with gray hair, and he was holding binoculars. With a chill, Amy realized he was watching them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy said, \"Who -- \" But she was distracted by the chirping sound of a car alarm being deactivated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlistair Oh, sooty and smoky, burst out of the mansion\u0027s main entrance and hobbled toward his BMW, cradling something against his chest. He looked terrible. His pants were ripped and his face was white with ash. Amy had no idea how he\u0027d managed to get out. She almost called to him, but something held her back. Alistair staggered past William McIntyre with hardly a glance, jumped in his car, and peeled out down the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy looked back toward the woods, but the man with the binoculars had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay here,\" she told Dan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran toward Mr. McIntyre. Dan, of course, didn\u0027t obey orders. He followed her, coughing the whole way. By the time they got to Mr. McIntyre, the entire mansion was collapsing. The heat was like a new sun. Amy knew there would be nothing left to salvage -- nothing except the jewelry box she was still clutching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set down the box and rolled Mr. McIntyre over. He groaned, which at least meant he was alive. Amy wished she had a cell phone of her own, but Aunt Beatrice had never allowed them to have one. She fished around in Mr. McIntyre\u0027s pockets, found his phone, and dialed 911.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He took it,\" Dan wheezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Amy wasn\u0027t really listening. She sank to her knees and watched as the only place she\u0027d ever cared about went up in flames. She pictured Grace telling her stories in the library. She remembered running down the halls, playing tag with Dan when they were little. She thought of the secret nook in the bedroom where she liked to read with Saladin on her lap. All gone. Her whole body shook. Tears welled up in her eyes. For the second time in her life, fire had robbed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy.\" Dan sounded close to tears, but he put a hand on her shoulder. \"You\u0027ve got to listen. He took it. Alistair did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy wanted to tell Dan to shut up and let her mourn in peace, but then she realized what he was talking about. She got unsteadily to her feet and stared into the distance, where the BMW\u0027s taillights were disappearing around a hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlistair Oh had tricked them. He\u0027d stolen the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Richard\u0027s Almanack with their mother\u0027s notes -- their only lead in the quest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan had always wanted to ride in a police car, but not like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chest still hurt from the smoke. He sat in the backseat of the police car with Saladin on his lap and tried not to wheeze, but every breath was like inhaling sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027d just brought your inhaler...\" Amy chided. But he hated his inhaler. It made him feel like Darth Cahill or something. Besides, he hadn\u0027t had an attack in forever, and he didn\u0027t know they were going to get caught in a stupid fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t believe the family mansion was gone. He\u0027d woken up this morning sure that Amy and he would inherit the place. Now there was nothing left -- just a smoking mountain of rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police detectives hadn\u0027t given them many answers. It looked like arson, they said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire spread too quickly to be an accident. They said William McIntyre would be okay. Amazingly, no one else had been hurt. Dan had told the police about Alistair Oh leaving the mansion in a big hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe figured he might as well try to get the old creep in trouble. But Dan had said nothing about the thirty-nine clues or the secret library or the strange guy with the binoculars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was the man in black?\" Amy whispered, like she\u0027d been thinking the same thing. She had Grace\u0027s jewelry box on her lap, and she was twisting her hair the way she always did when she was nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know,\" Dan said. \"Alistair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t have been in two places at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Holt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Holt\u0027s not that old, and he\u0027s a lot more buff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aunt Beatrice dressed as a man?\" Personally, Dan liked this idea, because Beatrice definitely had the \"evil\" factor going for her. After all, she\u0027d just left them at the mansion without a second thought. But Amy rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t anybody we know, Dan. At least, I\u0027m pretty sure. But he was watching us, like he wanted to see if we got out. I think he set that fire to trap us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrrp,\" Saladin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree with the cat,\" Dan said. \"After that man in black and Uncle Alistair, I say we make a new RESOLUTION. Stay away from old guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to be more careful about everybody.\" Amy lowered her voice even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dan, our mother was involved in the thirty-nine clues. That writing -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but that\u0027s impossible. The contest just started!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Mom\u0027s writing. I\u0027m sure. She said, Follow Franklin, first clue. Maze of Bones. We have to find out what that means. This is just the kind of mystery Mom would\u0027ve loved!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan knew he shouldn\u0027t have felt annoyed, but he hated that Amy remembered more about their parents than he did. He would never have recognized their mom\u0027s handwriting. He had no idea what kind of person she\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We lost the book,\" he grumbled. \"We kind of failed already, didn\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy traced the monogram on top of Grace\u0027s jewelry box. \"Maybe not. I have an idea, but we\u0027re going to need an adult. Alistair was right about that. We\u0027ll never be able to travel without one.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-maze-of-bones-the-39-clues-1/page-7.html","bookId":1546,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:27 PM"}
