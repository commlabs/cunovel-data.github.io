In the gap his arms made for his face he stared at inky darkness, and his gasps snatched up dust from the ground. Deafened by the futile clack of bladed jaws, buried in riotous darkness, he held on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel the mind of the d’ivers now. Its fury was not for him alone. Who stung you so? Who in this desert drove you away? Why are you fleeing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe being was ancient. It had not sembled in a long time – thousands of years, perhaps more. Lost now to the primitive instincts of the insects. Shards opals diamonds gems leaves drinkers – the words slithered into him as if from nowhere, a girl’s sing-song voice that now echoed in his mind. Shards opals diamonds gems leaves drinkers – go away!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a deafening roar the vast weight on Mappo’s back burst apart, exploded outward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up, tilted back his head. ‘Shards opals diamonds gems leaves drinkers – go away. Go away. Go!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA song of banishing .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cloud heaved upward, twisted, and then churned past him. Another seething wave of butterflies, and then they too were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned, Mappo looked round. He was alone. Child, where are you? Such power in your song – are you Forkrul Assail? No matter. Mappo thanks you .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was covered in bruises. Every bone ached. But still alive .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Child, be careful. This d’ivers was once a god. Someone tore it apart, into so many pieces it can never heal. It can’t even find itself. All it knows now is hunger – not for you or me. For something else. Life itself, perhaps. Child, your song has power. Be careful. What you banish you can also summon.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard her voice again, fainter now, drifting away. ‘ Like the flies. Like the song of the flies .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrunting, he climbed to his feet. Drew his sack round and loosened the drawstrings, reached in and lifted out a waterskin. He drank deep, sighed, drank a second time and then stuffed the skin back into the sack. Tightening the shoulder straps again, he faced east, and resumed running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the edge of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nice sword.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Alas, this one I must use. I will give my two Letherii swords to you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyadd Eleis leaned back against the knobby stone of the cave wall. ‘How did they get the dragons on that blade?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin continued studying the weapon he had unsheathed. The flames of the hearth danced up and down its length. ‘There is something wrong with this,’ he said. ‘The House of Hust burned to the ground with everything else – not Kharkanas itself, of course, that city didn’t burn. Not precisely. But Hust, well, those forges were a prize, you see. And what could not be held had to be destroyed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyadd glanced away, at the pearl sky beyond the cave mouth. Another dawn had arrived. He’d been alone for some time. Awakened to find that the Tiste Andii had returned sometime in the night, blown in like a drift of snow. ‘I don’t understand what you’re saying.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white face took on an almost human hue, bathed as it was in the firelight. But those red eyes were as unnerving as ever. ‘I thought I knew all the weapons forged by the Hust. Even the obscure ones.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That one does not look obscure, Silchas,’ said Ryadd. ‘It looks like a hero’s weapon. A famous weapon. One with a name.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As you say,’ Silchas agreed. ‘And I am not so old as to forget the ancient warning about trusting shadows. No, the one who gave me this sword is playing a game.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Someone gave it to you? In return for what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I wish I knew.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyadd smiled. ‘Never bargain knowing only the value of one side of the deal. Onrack said that to me once. Or maybe it was Ulshun Pral.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas shot him a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyadd shrugged, lifting himself to his feet. ‘Do we now resume our journey?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheathing the sword, Silchas straightened as well. ‘We have gone far enough, I think.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you mean?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I needed to take you away from Starvald Demelain, and now I have done so.’ He faced Ryadd. ‘This is what you must learn. The Eleint blood within you is a poison. I share it, of course. My brother and I chose it for ourselves – we perceived a necessity, but that is the fatal lure of power, isn’t it? With the blood of T’iam within our veins, we could bring peace to Kurald Galain. Of course, that meant crushing every House opposing us. Regrettable, but that sentiment was as far as the poison would permit us to go in our thoughts. The thousands who died could not make us hesitate, could not stop us from continuing. Killing thousands more.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-203.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
