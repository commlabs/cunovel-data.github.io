Her eyebrows furrowed. “Who says you’re going to prom?” She tilted her chin. “If you want answers from me, then we’re sticking to my schedule. My list. No balls for you, Cinderella.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily blinked hard. “But . . . I thought maybe . . . I mean, this is important. I thought you’d understand. As, you know, a friend.” As soon as she said it, she realized she meant it. They sort of had become friends, in a weird way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris crossed her arms over her chest, a look of hurt passing across her face. “Friends don’t lie, Emily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stared at her. Iris looked genuinely shattered—over such a small lie. Then again, maybe it wasn’t small to her. Emily suddenly wondered how many friends someone like Iris could have made in The Preserve. Probably not many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth, wishing she could tell Iris the truth, but then reality slammed back. She swallowed the thought and stared out the windshield. “Okay,” she said quietly. “Your list it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria Opens Up\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school that day, Aria climbed the stairs in her house holding a lacquered tray her father had brought back from a trip to China. On it were two plates of fried tofu spring rolls that she’d specially made for her and Noel. She’d garnished each dish with basil, green onions, soy sauce, and even two red roses she’d plucked from her mother’s vase in the kitchen. Ella’s boyfriend, an artist named Francis who was on a month-long trip to Berlin, had sent them to her, but he sent her roses all the time, so Aria figured Ella wouldn’t miss a couple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicked open the door to find Noel splayed on her bed, reading ESPN magazine. “Dinner is served,” she chirped in a faux French accent. “I think I even got the wraps right.” They’d learned to make them in a cooking class they’d taken together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel smiled at the steaming food. “This smells way better than when we made it in class. Have you been practicing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria propped up a fringed pillow against the headboard. “Maybe a little . . . for you.” She touched his hand. “We haven’t seen each other much lately. And the last time was so . . . weird.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to spit the word out. Weird didn’t begin to describe her Ali-terrogation. Since she wasn’t texting or calling, she and Noel had barely spoken in the past few days. Aria hadn’t realized how much they relied on technology to communicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe it was good: She needed some space to clear her mind. Though she’d never admit it to her friends, there were a few other things about Noel she couldn’t get out of her head. Like how Noel’s house was filled with pictures of the family at the picnic grounds at Keppler Creek—Mr. Kahn said the fishing there was the best in the state. Noel had gone hiking and fishing there with his brothers a few times last winter, spring, and summer. Some of the trips had been before Real Ali reappeared, some of them after. He’d never invited Aria, and she’d thought nothing of it. Should she have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel popped a spring roll into his mouth and swooned. “You can even make tofu taste awesome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s one reason to keep me around,” Aria teased, trying to make her voice sound carefree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can think of a few other reasons, too.” Noel set his plate on the end table, grabbed her around the waist, and pulled her on top of him. “The only tastier thing than this dinner is you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria snuggled into his neck. Noel ran his hands through her hair and kissed her lips. She shut her eyes and tried to relax. A traitor wouldn’t touch her like this. Even the best actor in the world wouldn’t be able to caress her so affectionately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria shot up in bed. She stared at her new phone. It wasn’t blinking . . . but Noel’s, which was sitting on Aria’s desk next to his wallet, was. He sat up and studied the screen. “Huh. Is this an international number?” he asked, showing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria tried to process the long string of numbers in the text box, but before she could, Noel opened the text. Normally, Aria would have looked away, but she caught sight of her name in the message. As she read the words, a sinking feeling crept over her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook in Aria’s closet. She has something to show you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel snorted. “Freaking international spam. They’re getting so good they know our names now.” He hit DELETE. “Look in Aria’s closet,” he said in a mock-ominous voice, punctuating it with a Dracula laugh. “What’s in there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” Aria squeaked. She tried to take a breath but hiccupped nervously instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel pulled away and searched her face. “Are you sure about that?” he teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still laughing, which made Aria feel even worse. “Yes!” she said, but her voice was too loud and high-pitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beat passed. Noel swung his legs off the bed and started toward the closet. He had the same look on his face he got when he was about to tickle her. “Is it the bogeyman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t open it. It’s a huge mess in there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel shrugged. “I bet mine’s messier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria glanced at Noel’s phone lying faceup on the bed. What the hell was she supposed to do now? She couldn’t tell him about the painting. It was bad enough the case had been reopened and that the police had new evidence and an anonymous tip—which Aria was sure was from A. She couldn’t involve Noel in this. The last thing she wanted was for him to go away for life, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come here,” Aria said, pulling Noel back to the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed his neck softly, hoping it would distract him. But his muscles were stiff; he pulled away from her and inspected her carefully. “What’s with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” Aria peppered his cheek with kisses. “I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel sat up. “You’re totally not fine. I don’t get you lately. Like, really don’t get you. And it’s starting to scare me. I’m starting to think you’re . . . I don’t know. Not telling me something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Aria’s turn to tense up. “Don’t think that,” she squeaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel sat back. “Whatever it is, I’ll still love you. But don’t lie to me anymore. There’s something. I can tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s jaw started to tremble. It felt like Noel could see her secret, ugly and wrinkled inside her. If she insisted it was nothing, he would just keep asking . . . or maybe check the closet for real. Besides, coming clean would eliminate some of A’s power: A would surely let it slip to Noel about Olaf soon enough if Aria didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath, staring at one of the prisms hanging in the window to steady her nerves. “Okay, I have been keeping something. Something I’m not really proud of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel pressed his lips together. “Okay,” he said in a brave voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria cleared her throat, her heart hammering fast. “The reason I was asking you about kissing Ali the other day is because . . . I was feeling guilty about something I did. And, um, if you would have said you liked kissing Ali—even a little bit—it might have made me feel a little better.” As she fumbled her way through the words, she was surprised to realize they were actually true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel’s brow furrowed. “Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria held her up her hand to stop him. “Just let me finish. So, uh, you know Olaf, from Iceland?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The bearded dude?” A hint of a smirk appeared on Noel’s face. “Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria started to tremble. “Something sort of . . . happened between us when I was there. I meant to tell you a long time ago, but I was afraid. But you need to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car engine grumbled out the window. The house made a settling sound. Noel turned away sharply. “I knew it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did?” Aria bit her lip hard. Was she that transparent? Had Noel seen them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Aria and Olaf had snuck outside, the door had creaked a few times, like it was about to open, but then it hadn’t. Perhaps Noel had peeked out and saw them. But why wouldn’t he have stormed into the alleyway, punched Olaf in the face, and broken up with Aria on the spot? Noel could have easily taken Olaf in a fight. So maybe he didn’t know that night—maybe A had told him later. But if that was the case, why wouldn’t he have said something as soon as he found out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel paced the room. He stopped at Aria’s desk, laced his hands over the back of her swivel chair, and glared at her. “You accused me the other day of cheating on you with Ali, and here you cheated on me for real. Jesus, Aria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears rolled down Aria’s cheeks. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done it. I’ve felt terrible ever since. I love you, Noel. I was really drunk. It meant nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel scoffed. “Are you upset now because you really feel bad, or because you got caught? I always suspected something happened, but I hoped . . .” He trailed off and bit his lip. Then he whirled around and kicked the garbage can under her desk hard. It made a metallic clang and rolled against the wall. Aria gasped and jumped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Noel swiveled around and grabbed his cell phone. “This is an Icelandic number, isn’t it? Is it from Olaf? Are you still in touch with him? You gave him my number?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Aria cried. “I’m not in touch with Olaf. Olaf is . . .” She couldn’t say missing or dead. Noel would ask how she knew that, and then she’d have to bring up the newspaper article she’d found on her bed . . . or else she’d have to pretend she’d Googled him, which would make her seem like she liked him. Nor could she say who had really sent Noel that text just now—she couldn’t put Noel in jeopardy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know who that text is from,” she admitted. “Maybe Olaf, though I never gave him your number. I guess it was someone’s way of getting me to tell you the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look in Aria’s closet. She has something to show you,” Noel repeated nastily. “A skeleton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears pricked Aria’s eyes. “I’m so sorry.” She hated the way he was looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that all you have to tell me, or is there something more?” Noel demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s stomach swirled. “Th-that’s all. I swear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel raised one eyebrow, like he didn’t believe her. Then he turned and stomped out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noel!” Aria cried, chasing after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go,” Noel said gruffly as he thundered down the stairs. He grabbed his keys off the table near the door, whipped it open, and ran out onto the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait!” Aria yelled. By the time she was at the door, Noel was in his car. Its headlights snapped on, and he backed out jerkily, without bothering to look if anyone was on the road. The taillights disappeared down the street quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stood in the chilly night, rubbing her bare arms. It felt like there was a huge weight sitting square on her chest, preventing her from taking a full breath. Noel’s words swam back to her. Is that all you have to tell me? What did that mean? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crushed-pretty-little-liars-13/page-24.html","bookId":2389,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM"}
