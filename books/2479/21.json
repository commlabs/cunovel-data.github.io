The water was rising in the bottom of the boat again, and Dan put aside the paddle for a few minutes while he and Arden cupped their hands and bailed. Then he shook off the sleep that was closing in on him and-paddled them down the center of the bayou with slow, smooth strokes. He watched Arden\u0027s head droop as she fell asleep sitting up, and then he was alone with the noises of the swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while his eyelids became leaden and he couldn\u0027t keep them open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heat pressed on him, lulling him to sleep.

Electric lights cast their glary circles on a dock where an assortment of motor skiffs and two houseboats were tied up. On the dock were gas pumps and an attendant\u0027s shack, also lit up with electricity supplied from a rumbling generator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlank walkways connected the buildings, and Dan and Arden saw two men standing in conversation next to the gas pumps and a couple of other men on the walkways. A rusty barge loaded with sections of metal pipe, coils of wire, and other industrial items was anchored past the dock at a concrete pier where a long building with corrupted aluminum walls stood, the legend WAREHOUSE # I painted in red across the building\u0027s doorway. Beyond the warehouse loomed oil storage tanks and twelve or more spidery derricks rising up from the swamp.

Dan ventured along one of the walkways, heading toward the buildings, and Arden followed close behind. The place made Dan think of a Wild West frontier town, except it had been built up from the muck instead of being carved from the desert. It was a carpenter\u0027s nightmare, the structures cobbled together with pressure-treated pineboards and capped by rusted tin roofs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElectrical cables snaked from building to building, carrying the juice from generator The walkways were so close to the water that in some places reeds stuck up between the planks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a store whose sign announced it as R.J\u0027S GROCERY and next to it was a little narrow structure marked sr. NAnAsE posr oFRcE. A Laundromat with three washers and dryers and two pool tables was lit up and doing business. Dan noted that the men they saw gazed hungrily at Arden\u0027s body, but when they looked at her face they averted their eyes as quickly as Tully had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSt. Nastase, Dan had realized, most likely never closed down, to accommodate the crews who were off shift. Dan figured that the men here had siped on with the company for three or four months at a stretch, which meant prostitutes in houseboau could make some money plying their trade. It occurred to him that Lorraine had thought Arden was a \"new chickie\" because the only women who dared to go there were selling sex, and he was unaware of it but Arden had come to the same conclusions about ten seconds ahead of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn another moment they heard the mingled music of a fiddle and an accordion. The smell of food caught their nostrils. Ahead was a building with a sign that said simply cAn. The place had a pair of batwing doors, like a western saloon. The music was coming from within, accompanied now by whoops and hollers. Dan figured this could be a hell of a rowdy joint, and again he wished Arden wasn\u0027t around because he was going to have to be responsible for her safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Stick close to me,\" and then Arden followed him a.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough the batwings, her right hand clenching the pink drawstring bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cafe was dimly lit, blue-hazed with cigarette smoke, and at the ceiling a fan chugpd around in a futile attempt to circulate the humid, sweat-smelling air. Hanging from the ceiling as well were maybe three hundred old, dirty brown caps with red GSP logos. At rough plank tabla sat twenty or more men, a few of them clapping their hands in time with the jerky, mucous music, while four of their fellows danced with ladies of the evening. The fiddler and accordionist both wore company caps, and a thick-shouldered black men got up from his table, sat down at a battered old piano, and began to beat out a rhythm that added to the merry clamor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the men glanced eagerly at Arden, but they looked away when Dan put\u0027his arm around her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe guided her toward a bar where metal beer @, canned soft drinks, and bottles of water were on display. Behind it, a horned-looking man with glasses, a beard, and slicked-back dark hair was drawing beer into mugs, sweat stains on ins red-chocked shirt and a cigar stub gripped between his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class\u003d\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail\u003d\"b6c5d7dbf6\"\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/a\u003e\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto eat?\" Dan asked over the noise, and the bartender said, \"Burgers a buck apiece, gumbo two bucks a bowl.

Nobody would\u0027ve traveled in that damn thing unless they\u0027d been forced to, he reasoned. \"How long have you been sittin\u0027 here?\" he asked the drenched man, who was watching Pelvis clamber out of the boat with Mama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gotta be kiddin!\" the man said, unable to take his eyes off Pelvis. \"What is this, Candid Camera?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, listen up!\" Flint demanded, his patience at its bitter end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint-who was equally as tired and crankyjerked under his shirt, and Flint put an arm across his chest to hold his brother down. \"I\u0027m looking for a man and a woman.

Dan\u0027s face was strained with anger, his eyes hard and shiny. \"The ladies are talkin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mister, you let go of me or I\u0027m gonna have to knock the shit outta your ears!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u0027No fightin\u0027 in here!\" Burt warned. \"You wanna fight, get out back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re drunk, friend.\" Dan kept his face close to Cal\u0027s, his arm low across the man\u0027s body so the beer mug wouldn\u0027t come up and smash him in the teeth. \"Don\u0027t let your mouth get you in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" Arden said.

At the same time, Dan felt the little barrel of a gun press against his ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The game\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan jerked his head around and looked into the pallid face he\u0027d seen by the flashlight\u0027s glare in Basile Park, only now it was blotched with mosquito bites.
