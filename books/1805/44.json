You can have the captain,” the third guard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Having a change of heart about partners, Foss?” Gemma’s card partner asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You betcha. I didn’t think I would have to carry Captain through the whole game,” the guard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Might I remind you, Foss, that I’m the one who will be writing your recommendation—or demotion—to the Guard Lieutenant?” the captain said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir!” Foss said with a salute, drawing an amused, arched eyebrow from Gemma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She looks fine,” Prince Toril whispered in Lady Linnea’s ear. “She’s just playing Karn?ffel—and doing well, I think. Lady Linnea!” he hissed when Lady Linnea sank to the ground, relief making her light-headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine. I just,” Lady Linnea couldn’t continue and instead shut her eyes and rested her head against the grimy dungeon wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s safe,” Prince Toril said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Lady Linnea smiled. “She is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment Prince Toril asked, “Are you strong enough to stand? I would prefer to not let them know we are here,” he said, tipping his head in the direction of the chattering card game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can manage,” Lady Linnea said, standing. Her legs shook like a newborn foal, but she brushed off her dress—which was dirtied beyond repair—and heaved her chin up, regaining some of her confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“May I escort you out?” Prince Toril asked, offering his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Linnea took it with the composure of a queen and allowed Prince Toril to lead her up the dungeon stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I find it refreshing that you care so much about your servant,” Prince Toril said, breaking the silence when they returned to the palace hallways. “She is lucky to have such a caring mistress.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is my close companion,” Lady Linnea said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, because you allow her to be so,” Prince Toril said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait, you think that this is just a case of me being kind to a servant because I am a loyal person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?” Prince Toril said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh. I’m beginning to see why you didn’t go after Princess Elise,” Lady Linnea said, dropping Prince Toril’s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” Prince Toril asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think you understand the balance of relationships. They are give-and-take. I’m not Gemma’s superior in our friendship because I’m trying to get her through this alive—which is rather what I suspect you think. I’m frantic to protect her, yes, not because I’m some bleeding-heart noble, but because Gemma is my best friend,” Lady Linnea firmly said. “Gemma has my loyalty because she’s earned it, and I have Gemma’s trust because I’ve earned it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But surely you have more to give,” Prince Toril said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You would think that, and perhaps that is the circumstance right now, but before I felt like I could never repay Gemma for everything she’s done for me,” Lady Linnea said. She tilted her head and studied Prince Toril with pursed lips. “It takes work to build a lasting relationship, My Lord. You cannot expect someone to give you their everything just because.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think I understand,” Prince Toril said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not surprised, looking at your sparkling parentage,” Lady Linnea said, stopping their stroll down the hallway. “Allow me to rephrase it. A friendship is filled only with as much love as you give. Gemma has my heart because I chose to give it to her. And my choice paid off, because there is no one in this horrible, tattered world that I trust more than Gemma Kielland. And so we are two best friends, walking together to achieve what neither of us could do alone. Do you understand it now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Toril wore a very sad smile, one that pained Lady Linnea to see on the normally sunny—if not slightly dopey—prince’s face. “Princess Elise said something similar to me, once.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She said she wasn’t the only woman capable of deep love, and that before I found such a woman who would love me like that, I had to learn how to give that kind of love, too,” Prince Toril said. “She meant the give-and-take loyalty you’re talking about, didn’t she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Lady Linnea said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see it, now,” Prince Toril said, looking up at the ceiling. “You have given me much to think about, Lady Linnea,” he said when he finally lowered his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am glad. I would rather have you learn about it now, Toril, than to continue in ignorance,” Lady Linnea said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I think so, too…” Prince Toril trailed off before he shook himself, putting a smile back on his face. “In any case, I will show you a way out. I have an appointment with a Farset ambassador that I will be late for if I do not hurry. This way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, My Lord.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve brought your lunch, Miss Kielland,” B?rres said, setting her tray down. “Meatcakes, carrots, and potatoes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, B?rres,” Gemma said, smiling at the guard. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rumpelstiltskin-timeless-fairy-tales-4/page-44.html","bookId":1805,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:58 PM"}
