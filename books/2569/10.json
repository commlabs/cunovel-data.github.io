By the time he’d swept the floor the whole incident was gone from his conscious mind. Secretly and quietly shoved down by some unknown hand into a darker and less accessible place inside. He did not even remember that he couldn’t remember. He finished his chores by eight-thirty, picked a magazine off the rack, and sat down on the stool behind the counter to wait for the day to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt nine o’clock precisely, the bell above the door tinkled and Mike looked up from the latest copy of Cemetery Dance to see a police officer enter the shop. He was a big, brawny, blond-haired cop with a very neatly pressed uniform, highly polished leather gun belt, and gleaming chrome cuffs that jingled as he walked. The blacking on his shoes looked like polished coal, but despite his fastidious clothing he walked with a noticeable limp and both of his hands were lightly bandaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike’s heart froze in his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Tow-Truck Eddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewton sat at his desk with his main computer on in front of him and his laptop open to his left. He had several Google search pages open on each and a half dozen Word documents. His fourth cup of coffee was cooling to tepid sludge as his fingers blurred over the keys, typing in search arguments, scrolling through the lists of web pages, cutting and pasting information and URLs. He’d been at this for hours now, ever since driving back from the hospital. No shower, no change of clothes, no food except for the cups of coffee that had long since turned his stomach to acid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillard Fowler Newton was furious. He was hurt and scared, too, but mostly he was absolutely livid. Twenty-four hours ago he was just another third-string reporter in a fifth-rate town like Black Marsh. A day ago he was, he knew, a geek. Nerdy and kind of annoying—insights often provided for him by people he met, even strangers. He was content to be a geek. He could do geek without effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was caught up in something that involved vampires. Actual vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what made Fowler so furious. Vampires should not be any part of the world in which he lived. Vampires were TV and movies. Buffy and Blade and Barnabas-fricking-Collins. Vampires were Halloween costumes and Count Chocula. Vampires were fiction. At worst they were supposed to be myths and legends. Vampires weren’t real. Vampires and geeks do not belong in the same reality, of that he was quite certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn vampire stories there were only two kinds of characters—victims and heroes. Newton knew that there was nothing remotely heroic in his nature, but he sure as hell did not want to be a victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaking up and discovering that the world now included vampires and werewolves—let’s not forget werewolves—was too much to ask. Not just one…but two monsters…the big two. The classics. Right here in River City. Shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow was the hero, Newton knew. He’d already shown that by facing Ruger twice. Val was a hero, too. She’d fought Ruger herself, and she’d killed Boyd. At best, Newton knew, he was the squatty sidekick who would probably not make it to the final reel. Like George from Seinfeld, with a stake and hammer. Yeah, there were good odds on that game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what could he do? Running was an option, and he gave that a lot of thought. No one would blame him; no one ever blames the geek for being a coward. After all…we were talking supernatural monsters here. He didn’t have a black belt like Crow or a will of iron and a big-ass pistol like Val. All he had was…what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the thought process that took him from sitting in his car after leaving the hospital—crying like a baby and praying to a God he hadn’t said “boo!” to since his bar mitzvah—to where he was right now. Parked at his computer, working the Net, working sources. Finding stuff out. It’s what a geek would do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept at it for hours, researching everything he could find, punishing the keys with stabbing finger hits. He searched on vampires and werewolves, and at first the enormity of the available information nearly stopped him in his tracks. When he typed “Vampire” into Google the search told him there were 54,200,000 hits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holy shit!” he breathed, then tried adding an “s” to make it “Vampires.” That dropped the number of websites down to 18 million. “Werewolf” 11,400,000 hits. He chewed a plastic pen cap for a few moments, then he tried it as “vampire folklore” which eliminated most of the film and fiction references and that dropped it down to 773,000 sites. On a whim he refined it even more by adding the word “university,” hoping to score experts. That dropped it down even further to 276,000 sites, and from there Newton plowed it, looking for thesis papers, studies, published works, and for names that popped up over and over again: J. N. Corbiel, an assistant professor of folklore at the University of Pennsylvania.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewton recognized that name and pulled open his file drawer for the folder of notes he’d made when researching material following his interview with Crow. He riffled the pages until he found one whose contents jarred him. One he’d read but put out of his mind at the time—could that just be a day or two ago? The printout was a historical account of a man named Peeter Stubbe, known in folklore as the Werewolf of Bedburg, a mass murderer executed in 1589 following the most famous werewolf trial in history. Under brutal torture Stubbe confessed to having been a sorcerer and lycanthrope who had practiced black magic since boyhood and who transformed regularly into a savage wolf for the purpose of hunting humans for sport and food. The article also gave the many aliases Stubbe used over the years: Peter Stubb, Peter Stumpf, Abel Greenwyck, Abel Griswald…and Ubel Griswold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis skin crawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a URL on the printout and he typed it in, bringing up a page with a lot of history about that and similar werewolf trials, most of which had been conducted by the Inquisition. Dr. Corbiel had a typically dry and detailed academic style, but the case details were nonetheless bloody and sensational.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewton sat back in his chair and considered this, tapping his lower teeth with the cap of his pen. U of P was in Philly, maybe fifty, sixty miles from where he sat. Maybe he could meet with this Professor Corbiel, pick his brain. Pretend to be doing a story on the folklore behind the pop culture, something like that. Or maybe writing a pop-culture book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked for an e-mail address and found it on the staff directory, and clicked on it to load an e-mail screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dear Professor Corbiel,” he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Weinstock even had the door closed, Val said, “Crow told me everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he said carefully, glancing at Crow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow nodded. “She knows what we know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was fast, don’t you think? Val needs rest and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen to me, the both of you,” Val interrupted. “I know I’m hurt, I know I’m pregnant, and I know that Mark and Connie’s deaths haven’t really hit me yet, not like they will…but if either of you starts walking softly around me, or hides stuff from me because you don’t want to upset me or some such crap, I’ll skin you both alive. You know I’m not joking here. My family is dead and I need to understand why…and how.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at each of them in turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow took the lead. “Believe me, sweetie, this isn’t a matter of the manly men not wanting to upset the womenfolk. The real problem, at least for me, is that I don’t know how to talk about this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeinstock nodded agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVal nodded. “Then that’s a problem we’re going to have to solve right now, boys. Are we talking past or present tense?” When they looked perplexed, she added, “Did Boyd’s death end it, or does…what happened last night…indicate that this is still happening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve been chewing on that all morning,” Weinstock said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The way I see it,” Crow said, “this part of it—the, um, vampire, part of it—started with Ruger and Boyd coming to town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know that or are you guessing?” Weinstock asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guessing, but before they got here we didn’t have vampires.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” Val said. “And how do you know that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…well…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeinstock jumped in on Val’s side. “We can’t make assumptions here. Are you suggesting that Ruger and Boyd were vampires already?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Crow said. “At least Ruger wasn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wasn’t,” Val agreed. “Not when he was at our house, not that first night. I think I would have known…and he probably wouldn’t have bothered with a gun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow nodded. “Absolutely. When he and I fought outside your house he was human enough, but when he showed up at the hospital it was like fighting a whole other person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what happened during those two days?” Weinstock pursed his lips. “I mean…I’ve seen enough Dracula films to know how vampires are made, but doesn’t it take three or four days?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow shook his head. “I doubt we can trust what’s in the movies. I mean…this is real, and when it comes to vampires being real, what do we actually know? What are vampires, after all? I’ve read a lot of books…nonfiction stuff, folklore, and there are all sorts of vampires out there, all the way back through history. Hundreds of different kinds in different cultures. The whole idea of a vampire being some guy in a tuxedo and an opera cloak is for the movies. Even in the novel, Dracula, the vampire was different than they showed in the films. I don’t even think they staked him in the book. It’s been a while since I read it, but I seem to remember that Dracula was stabbed or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That doesn’t fit with what’s been happening here,” Val said. “I shot Boyd over and over again, and he lived through it, if ‘lived’ is the right word. It was only after I shot him in the head that he went down and stayed down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s more like those zombies in those Living Dead films,” Weinstock offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They were undead ghouls, not zombies,” Crow corrected. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-moon-rising-pine-deep-3/page-10.html","bookId":2569,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:26 PM"}
