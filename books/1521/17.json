Instead I think it\u0027s your weather. No one will want to conquer a land in which it rains so much,\" Oppius remarked, whilst tossing another piece of wood onto the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind the rain. Which way do you think the wind will blow, in regards to what Caesar will do next? Did he give you any indication at your dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caesar wishes to re-draw the maps and frontiers of the world, but ultimately Rome is his home. Also securing peace in Gaul is more important than making war in Britain. I warrant that we\u0027ll be sailing back soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you consider Rome to be your home too? Do you have anyone waiting for you? Who wants to see you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother still lives in a village outside of Rome. There\u0027s also my ex-wife. Whether she wants to see me or not the channel and climate will thankfully help keep her at bay,\" the centurion remarked, breaking off another leg of his wood pigeon as he did so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you not love her once? Is there still a spark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was lust more than love, attraction more than affection,\" Oppius replied, looking wistful for once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The usual. Life gets in the way of love. I didn\u0027t spend enough time with her\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and she spent too much of my money. What about you? Is there a particular flower in the garden of Britain that you pine for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There used to be too many\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I was the chieftain\u0027s son after all\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;which is why there was never just one. Sometimes I feel I missed out.
