The warmth of it is something I haven’t had in a long time. Not without heating it on a fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watches me and feels the water running from my hand to hers. She puts a hand out and smiles at me. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve seen her smile. Her teeth are gleaming white. It doesn’t suit the rest of her face. She steps into the water and lets it rain down on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It feels great doesn’t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance back at the lady watching us. It makes me uncomfortable she is there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember my first shower too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice is hollow. She hasn’t been here since the beginning. She works here because she was captured. Her dark eyes give me a knowing look when she smiles under the space suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The soap is a special kind. It will wash anything off of you that you don’t want there. Do your hair too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringe. I can\u0027t help but wonder if she was one of the ladies who got to stay behind in the truck for a bit when it arrived at the farm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up the bar of wrapped soap. I peel back the plastic. The girl watches me and does the same. I smell the soap and almost moan. It smells like lavender and tea tree. Of course it does. Natural cleaners for the body. Tea Tree became a hot commodity when everything stopped being produced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lather and scrub. At one point I sit on the floor and scrub my toes out. I don’t even care how bizarre I look. I scrub the wound on my leg trying not to cry out in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther women start to filter in. They cry with joy as the warm water washes them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpace suit points to a hallway, \"This way.\" I walk with the girl holding my hand. I look back at the shower and miss it already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy nerves are shot. I need to find Anna. I need to protect the girl beside me. I need to find out how to get us all out without casualties. I might need one more shower before we escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m dripping wet as I pad along the cold cement floor. I shiver. She takes us to a stack of towels in plastic. She passes them to us. I tear the plastic and pull a white terry towel robe from it. I pull it on and instantly feel better. White terry towel slippers fall onto the cement floor. I turn them over with my toes and look at the girl. She has the robe and slippers on, but on her they are swimming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins and hugs herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can she speak?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I don’t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She isn’t yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head again, \"No.\" I grin at the girl, \"We found each other in the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpace suit walks through a weird shower. Her space suit is rinsed completely. She steps out and points, \"Okay this way please.\" Space suit looks annoyed suddenly. We follow her through a huge white door and we are in the white rooms and hallways again. The cement and stainless steel is gone. We walk in our plush clothes to a waiting room, \"The doctor will be with you in a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go and sit on the white plastic chair that looks formed. Everything sparkles. It feels sterile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl sits in the chair next to me and space suit leaves us there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no magazines like a real doctors office or windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the little girl who apparently can talk, \"Me too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo more ladies come and are seated next to us. I\u0027d bet they\u0027re in their late twenties or early thirties if I had to guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chubby one smiles at me and speaks with a bubbly voice, \"Has anything happened since you got here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowns, \"God. I hope this doesn’t take all day. I\u0027m exhausted. I heard we get our own beds and rooms and food at every meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skinny mean looking lady next to her grimaces, \"Did you see what they were doing to the women at the back of the truck? We aren’t here for a vacation. We\u0027re here to be raped and reproduce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl. \"Don’t.\" My eyes dart to the little girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mean looking lady rolls her eyes and crosses her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl smiles at me. I smile back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man comes holding something in his hands. He looks like a doctor. He is older and has glasses on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glances up at us and smiles, \"You.\" He points at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around at the others. They all look frightened. The girl grips me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wants to come with me.\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at the little girl, \"It\u0027s your choice. She should be with the other healthy children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hug her to me as I stand, \"She comes with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs and turns and walks down the white hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks to a room with a bed, just like my doctor back home had. There is another chair and a curtain and a small desk. Everything is white. I feel like I can\u0027t actually see the depth of things because of all of the white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe points a hand toward the bed, \"Have a seat. Are you sure you want her to see this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up and frown, \"See what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to give you an internal to make sure you\u0027re healthy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn’t that what the tube was for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts the thing in his hands on the desk and pushes his glasses up. He closes the door, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the curtain, \"Can you pull that around us so she can see my face.\" I don’t want her traumatized. It\u0027s bad enough one of us is about to be traumatized. I know what an internal is. I read about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit her on the chair across the room. I hold both of her shoulders, \"It\u0027s going to be okay. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods. She looks scared but I can see her being brave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the bed and climb on. I lay back. He pulls the curtain around us so only my face is showing. I turn my head to her and smile. I\u0027m dying inside but I can\u0027t show her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back as he places my slippers into a pair of metal grips. He slides something and I feel the bottom part of the bed is gone. My butt feels like it\u0027s sitting on the edge. He puts gloves on and smiles at me, \"Relax okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard and nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls my knees apart. I feel a tear slip from my eye. I can\u0027t look at her. I look up at the white ceiling. I don’t feel anything. I close my eyes and I\u0027m high in a tree. The wind is pushing and pulling me, swaying the tree and me. I feel the breeze on my face. I hear the birds and the sound the branches make when the wind plays with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething stabs me sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try not to cry out but it hurts badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks hardened and distant from me, \"Sorry. I didn’t realize you were virginal. Most girls your age, well you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know. Most girls what? My stomach hurts like a monthly cramp for a second. He steps back and removes bloody gloves and I see a glint of metal. \"All done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slips some thick cotton white underwear into my hand, \"You will need these. Go back to the waiting room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the padding in the center of them. They are like the rags I\u0027ve made myself. I feel sick. He leaves the curtained area and then the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl looks worried. I shake my head, \"It\u0027s okay.\" She isn’t fooled. The tears streaming down my face tell her otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull the underwear on over my slippers and lift my butt to get them underneath of me. They feel thick and heavy between my thighs. My chest is rising and falling rapidly. I don’t want to scare the little girl but I am a little girl too. In my heart I\u0027m still the nine-year-old running through the woods. The nine-year-old who was lost and confused. I don\u0027t feel as though I\u0027ve aged. I\u0027ve grown cold and bitter but aged, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push myself up and sit on the bed for a minute. I see half her face through the curtain from where I sit. She looks scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step gingerly off the bed and walk around the curtain. My stomach hurts like I\u0027m having my monthly. It\u0027s never hurt like this though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stands and takes my finger. We walk from the room and down the hallway. The other women in the waiting room look me over. I see relief on their faces when they don’t see a difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel broken for the first time ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit back down and try to ignore the feeling of the warmth in my underwear. She snuggles into me. If we could join skin and become one person I think she would ask for me to do it. She is terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can come with me now.\" I glance up at a woman in a white coat and matching pale blue pants and top. The other women want to ask me things. I can feel the tension in the air from it. I look at them. I can\u0027t smile and tell them it will be okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand. The girl follows and walks along in the crook of my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now that that part is over with we will assign you a room. This is where you will stay for your duration with us.\" She has short brown hair that’s styled with big round curls. She is shiny and clean. I\u0027ve never seen anyone like her. Her skin glows. There is no old dirt anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is the whitest person I\u0027ve ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Gloria. I\u0027ll be here with you guys. We do a rotation, four nights and then four days and then four off. If you don’t see me for four days don’t panic. It\u0027s just my days off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what she\u0027s talking about. Days off from what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ll be in the wing where the women who are younger stay until they give birth. How old are you sweetie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up. She is raising a perfect brown eyebrow at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nineteen.\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. So yeah the girls in your wing are anywhere from about sixteen to twenty eight.\" She lowers her gaze as she walks, \"And how old are you honey?\" The little girl ignores her and tightens her grip on me. The nurse shrugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t place her age. She is ageless. She acts like the older women in the towns but she looks my age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at the girl who is curled into me. \"I think she\u0027s about twelve at the most.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes don’t rise to meet mine. They stay fixated on the girl, \"You sure you wouldn’t be happy with the other younger girls? They all live together. They have TV\u0027s and video games over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see her little head trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGloria\u0027s eyes meet mine again, \"Give her a little time. She\u0027ll be begging to get away from the lot of you hormonal women.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-21.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM"}
