She\u0027s Back! 格芙老师回来了！","content":"Deedee ran across the playground screaming.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At first Louis thought she was just having fun, but then he realized something was wrong. He hurried after her and grabbed her arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Deedee, are you all right?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She stared at him wide-eyed as she continued to scream.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Several other kids gathered around. \"What\u0027s wrong with Deedee?\" asked Myron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 84\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Deedee hiccupped three times, then gasped, \"I saw her!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who?\" asked Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Deedee didn\u0027t answer-she just stared right through him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But everyone else knew whom Deedee had seen. Most of them had seen her too, during the last two weeks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where was she?\" asked Todd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"On the monkey bars,\" said Deedee, still trembling and breathing hard. \"I was hanging upside down, and suddenly she was hanging upside down right next to me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did she wiggle her ears?\" asked Jenny.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Only one,\" said Deedee. \"I jumped off and ran away before she could wiggle the other one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s good,\" said Rondi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who is she?\" asked Louis. \"A hippopotamus?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No!\" said Myron with a laugh. \"Why do you say that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because when a hippopotamus gets mad, it wiggles its ears.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s worse than a hippopotamus,\" said Allison.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I saw her last week, at the water fountain,\" said Todd. \"I bent down to get a drink, and then there she was, drinking at the faucet next to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I saw her on the stairs,\" said Rondi. \"I was going up the stairs, and she went right past me, sliding down on the banister.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 85\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who?\" asked Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mrs. Gorf!\" said Deedee. Just saying the name sent a shiver of fear through her body.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, your old teacher,\" said Louis with a shrug. \"Is she back? I always wondered what happened to her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The children looked at each other. Mrs. Gorf was the teacher they had had before Mrs. Jewls took over. They had never told anyone how they had gotten rid of her. They especially couldn\u0027t tell Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was the meanest teacher in the history of Wayside School. Of course there are other teachers at other schools who are meaner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis looked toward the monkey bars. \"I don\u0027t see her,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, she was there,\" Deedee insisted. \"I saw her!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You just imagined you saw her, Deedee,\" said Louis. \"If you hate somebody, or if you love somebody, you often think you see that person when she isn\u0027t there. It\u0027s very common. It\u0027s just like Mrs. Drazil.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who\u0027s Mrs. Drazil?\" asked Todd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She was the worst teacher I ever had,\" said Louis. He shivered just thinking about her. \"She was my teacher when I was your age. I sometimes think I see her, too. And I still have nightmares about her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Was she mean?\" asked Rondi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She was horribler said Louis. \"Every morning she used to check our fingernails. If they were dirty, she\u0027d\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e tell the whole class. \u0027Louis has dirty fingernails this morning,\u0027 she\u0027d say in a really nasty voice. And if you talked in class, she would pick up the wastepaper basket and put it over your head. You had to leave it on your head until the bell rang.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did she ever put it over your head?\" asked Todd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lots of times,\" said Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everybody laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It wasn\u0027t funny,\" said Louis. \"My mother always knew when I got in trouble, because I\u0027d have bits of trash stuck in my hair.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did it get stuck in your mustache, too?\" asked Rondi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Louis didn\u0027t have a mustache when he was our age!\" said Allison. \"Did you, Louis?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly, Louis screamed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone stared at him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s back!\" he shouted, as he shook with fear. Then he slapped himself in the face. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"Sorry. For a second I thought I saw Mrs. Drazil.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned to Deedee. \"C\u0027mon, let\u0027s go to the monkey bars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No!\" declared Deedee. \"I\u0027m not going back. I\u0027m never getting on the monkey bars again!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis took hold of her hand. \"Mrs. Gorf isn\u0027t there,\" he said. \"You just imagined her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They headed to the monkey bars. No one else dared to follow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 87\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If she starts to wiggle her ears, run away as fast as you can,\" warned Deedee. She held tightly on to Louis\u0027s hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they reached the monkey bars, no one was there. \"Where were you when you saw her?\" Louis asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was hanging upside down over there,\" said Deedee, pointing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Okay, go hang upside down,\" said Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No!\" exclaimed Deedee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be right here in case anything happens.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It had rained during the night, so the sand under the monkey bars was wet and somewhat hard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Deedee walked across the sand and pulled herself up on the bar. She hooked her legs over, then hung from her knees.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, do you see her?\" Louis asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ao sjnoq \u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Am U33S\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e jsnui i m^u 3.1. noA ssan \\ PT^s ,/AVOU ajBS s.ji \u0027ON,,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Deedee pulled herself right side up, then hopped down from the monkey bars. She and Louis walked away hand in hand. She held Louis\u0027s hand not because she was scared, but because she liked him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mrs. Drazil sounds almost as bad as Mrs. Gorf,\" said Deedee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 88\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She was,\" said Louis. \"She once made me put gum on my nose, because I was chewing it in class.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How can you chew your nose?\" asked Deedee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Behind them, Deedee\u0027s footprints could be seen in the wet sand under the monkey bars. There was also another set of footprints, made by a person who had much bigger feet.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56872.html","bookId":626,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:36 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:36 AM"}
