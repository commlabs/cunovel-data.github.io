{"id":107922,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\u003cp\u003eJACOBBLACK\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob, do you think this is going to take too much longer?\" Leah demanded. Impatient. Whiney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy teeth clenched together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike anyone in the pack, Leah knew everything. She knew why I came here - to the very edge of the earth and sky and sea. To be alone. She knew that this was all I wanted. Just to be alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Leah was going to force her company on me, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides being crazy annoyed, I did feel smug for a brief second. Because I didn\u0027t even have to think about controlling my temper. It was easy now, something I just did, natural. The red haze didn\u0027t wash over my eyes. The heat didn\u0027t shiver down my spine. My voice was calm when I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jump off a cliff, Leah.\" I pointed to the one at my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, kid.\" She ignored me, throwing herself into a sprawl on the ground next to me. \"You have no idea how hard this is for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you?\" It took me a minute to believe she was serious. \"You have to be the most self-absorbed person alive, Leah. I\u0027d hate to shatter the dream world you livein - the one where the sun is orbiting the place where you stand - so I won\u0027t tell you how little I care what your problem is. Go. Away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just look at this from my perspective for a minute, okay?\" she continued as if I hadn\u0027t said anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she was trying to break my mood, it worked. I started laughing. The sound hurt in strange ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop snorting and pay attention,\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I pretend to listen, will you leave?\" I asked, glancing over at the permanent scowl on her face. I wasn\u0027t sure if she had any other expressions anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered back to when I used to think that Leah was pretty, maybe even beautiful. That was a long time ago. No one thought of her that way now. Except for Sam. He was never going to forgive himself. Like it was his fault that she\u0027d turned into this bitter harpy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer scowl heated up, as if she could guess what I was thinking. Probably could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is making me sick, Jacob. Can you imagine what this feels like to me? I don\u0027t even like Bella Swan. And you\u0027ve got me grieving over this leech-lover like I\u0027m in love with her, too. Can you see where that might be a little confusing? I dreamed about kissing her last night! What the hell am I supposed to do with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stand being in your head anymore! Get over her already! She\u0027s going to marry that thing. He\u0027s going to try to change her into one of them! Time to move on, boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" I growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be wrong to strike back. I knew that. I was biting my tongue. But she\u0027d be sorry if she didn\u0027t walk away. Now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll probably just kill her anyway,\" Leah said. Sneering. \"All the stories say that happens more often than not. Maybe a funeral will be better closure than a wedding. Ha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I had to work. I closed my eyes and fought the hot taste in my mouth. I pushed and shoved against the slide of fire down my back, wrestling to keep my shape together while my body tried to shake apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was in control again, I glowered at her. She was watching my hands as the tremors slowed. Smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re upset about gender confusion, Leah . . . ,\" I said. Slow, emphasizing each word. \"How do you think the rest of us like looking at Sam through your eyes? It\u0027s bad enough that Emily has to deal with your fixation. She doesn\u0027t need us guys panting after him, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePissed as I was, I still felt guilty when I watched the spasm of pain shoot across her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scrambled to her feet - pausing only to spit in my direction - and ran for the trees, vibrating like a tuning fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed darkly. \"You missed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam was going to give me hell for that, but it was worth it. Leah wouldn\u0027t bug me anymore. And I\u0027d do it again if I had the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause her words were still there, scratching themselves into my brain, the pain of it so strong that I could hardly breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter so much that Bella\u0027d chosen someone else over me. That agony was nothing at all. That agony I could live with for the rest of my stupid, too long, stretched-out life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it did matter that she was giving up everything - that she was letting her heart stop and her skin ice over and her mind twist into some crystallized predator\u0027s head. A monster. A stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have thought there was nothing worse than that, nothing more painful in the whole world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, if he killed her . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I had to fight the rage. Maybe, if not for Leah, it would be good to let the heat change me into a creature who could deal with it better. A creature with instincts so much stronger than human emotions. An animal who couldn\u0027t feel pain in the same way. A different pain. Some variety, at least. But Leah was running now, and I didn\u0027t want to share her thoughts. I cussed her under my breath for taking away that escape, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands were shaking in spite of me. What shook them? Anger? Agony? I wasn\u0027t sure what I was fightingnow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to believe that Bella would survive. But that required trust - a trust I didn\u0027t want to feel, a trust in that bloodsucker\u0027s ability to keep her alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would be different, and I wondered how that would affect me. Would it be the same as if she had died, to see her standing there like a stone? Like ice? When her scent burned in my nostrils and triggered the instinct to rip, to tear . . . How would that be? Could I want to kill her? Could I not want to kill one of them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the swells roll toward the beach. They disappeared from sight under the edge of the cliff, but I heard them beat against the sand. I watched them until it was late, long after dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing home was probably a bad idea. But I was hungry, and I couldn\u0027t think of another plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a face as I pulled my arm through the retarded sling and grabbed my crutches. If only Charlie hadn\u0027t seen me that day and spread the word of my \"motorcycle accident.\" Stupid props. I hated them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing hungry started to look better when I walked in the house and got a look at my dad\u0027s face. He had something on his mind. It was easy to tell - he always overdid it. Acted all casual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also talked too much. He was rambling about his day before I could get to the table. He never jabbered like this unless there was something that he didn\u0027t want to say. I ignored him as best I could, concentrating on the food. The faster I choked it down . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". . . and Sue stopped by today.\" My dad\u0027s voice was loud. Hard to ignore. As always. \"Amazing woman. She\u0027s tougher than grizzlies, that one. I don\u0027t know how she deals with that daughter of hers, though. Now Sue, she would have made one hell of a wolf. Leah\u0027s more of a wolverine.\" He chuckled at his own joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited briefly for my response, but didn\u0027t seem to see my blank, bored-out-of-my-mind expression. Most days that bugged him. I wished he would shut up about Leah. I was trying not to think about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seth\u0027s a lot easier. Of course, you were easier than your sisters, too, until . . . well, you have more to deal with than they did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, long and deep, and stared out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly was quiet for a second too long. \"We got a letter today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell that this was the subject he\u0027d been avoiding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A letter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A . . . wedding invitation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery muscle in my body locked into place. A feather of heat seemed to brush down my back. I held onto the table to keep my hands steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly went on like he hadn\u0027t noticed. \"There\u0027s a note inside that\u0027s addressed to you. I didn\u0027t read it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled a thick ivory envelope from where it was wedged between his leg and the side of his wheelchair. He laid it on the table between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You probably don\u0027t need to read it. Doesn\u0027t really matter what it says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid reverse psychology. I yanked the envelope off the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was some heavy, stiff paper. Expensive. Too fancy for Forks. The card inside was the same, too done- up and formal. Bella\u0027d had nothing to do with this. There was no sign of her personal taste in the layers of see- through, petal-printed pages. I\u0027d bet she didn\u0027t like it at all. I didn\u0027t read the words, not even to see the date. I didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a piece of the thick ivory paper folded inhalf with my name handwritten in black ink on the back. I didn\u0027t recognize the handwriting, but it was as fancy as the rest of it. For half a second, I wondered if the bloodsucker was into gloating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m breaking the rules by sending you this. She was afraid of hurting you, and she didn\u0027t want to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emake you feel obligated in any way. But I know that, if things had gone the other way, I would have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewanted the choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI promise I will take care of her, Jacob. Thank you - for her - for everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake, we only have the one table,\" Billy said. He was staring at my left hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers were clamped down on the wood hard enough that it really was in danger. I loosened them one by one, concentrating on that action alone, and then clenched my hands together so I couldn\u0027t break anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, doesn\u0027t matter anyway,\" Billy muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up from the table, shrugging out of my t-shirt as I stood. Hopefully Leah had gone home by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not too late,\" Billy mumbled as I punched the front door out of my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was running before I hit the trees, my clothes strewn out behind me like a trail of crumbs - as if I wanted to find my way back. It was almost too easy now to phase. I didn\u0027t have to think. My body already knew where I was going and, before I asked it to, it gave me what I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had four legs now, and I was flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trees blurred into a sea of black flowing around me. My muscles bunched and released in an effortless rhythm. I could run like this for days and I would not be tired. Maybe, this time, I wouldn\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wasn\u0027t alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo sorry, Embry whispered in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see through his eyes. He was far away, to the north, but he had wheeled around and was racing to join me. I growled and pushed myself faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait for us, Quil complained. He was closer, just starting out from the village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeave me alone, I snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel their worry in my head, try hard as I might to drown it in the sound of the wind and the forest. This was what I hated most - seeing myself through their eyes, worse now that their eyes were full of pity. They saw the hate, but they kept running after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new voice sounded in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet him go. Sam\u0027s thought was soft, but still an order. Embry and Quil slowed to a walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only I could stop hearing, stop seeing what they saw. My head was so crowded, but the only way to be alone again was to be human, and I couldn\u0027t stand the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhase back, Sam directed them. I\u0027ll pick you up, Embry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst one, then another awareness faded into silence. Only Sam was left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you, I managed to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome home when you can. The words were faint, trailing off into blank emptiness as he left, too. And I was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much better. Now I could hear the faint rustle of the matted leaves beneath my toenails, the whisper of an owl\u0027s wings above me, the ocean - far, far in the west - moaning against the beach. Hear this, and nothing more. Feel nothing but speed, nothing but the pull of muscle, sinew, and bone, working together in harmony as the miles disappeared behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the silence in my head lasted, I would never go back. I wouldn\u0027t be the first one to choose this form over the other. Maybe, if I ran far enough away, I would never have to hear again. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed my legs faster, letting Jacob Black disappear behind me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-29.html","bookId":2025,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM"}
