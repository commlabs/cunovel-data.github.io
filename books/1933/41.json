We’d concocted a story about my hospital visit having to do with a routine check-up. My mother had been all too willing to accept the lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong before I was ready to confront the inevitable, Peggy came into the waiting area. This time she wasn’t holding that monstrosity of a medical file in her arms. “Dr. Wilson will see you now,” she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t meet her eyes, although I heard hope and encouragement in her voice. I considered Peggy a friend, but that friendship wasn’t exclusive. She was wonderful to all of Dr. Wilson’s patients. I realized how difficult this must be for her, too. So often, she had to silently stand by and watch Dr. Wilson’s patients lose their battles with cancer. It wasn’t a position I envied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret was on her feet before I’d managed to put my magazine down and pick up my purse. I was certainly in no hurry to have my deepest fears confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy led us into Dr. Wilson’s private office. His framed degrees lined the walls; he displayed a few family photos, which were artfully arranged on a credenza. The mahogany desk was polished and uncluttered, with my file set to one side. I’d been in his private office twice before, and each time I’d been devastated by his news. I didn’t expect anything different this go-round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Wilson wasn’t in the room when we arrived, but he walked in directly behind us. My sister shook hands with him after a murmured introduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Wilson rolled out his big, high-back leather chair and sat down. He reached for my file, which he brought to the center of the table. He paused and then….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The cancer is back.” I didn’t make it a question. The tumor was gone, but I was sure there’d be more, growing in areas not as accessible as this one had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it?” Margaret asked and to my surprise her voice quavered slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo often in our lives, I’ve wanted to prove to Margaret that I was right and she was wrong. Call it sibling rivalry. This time, however, I’d have given anything to be wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I’d said earlier, there was nothing to be optimistic about. The disease refused to leave my body. I opened my mouth to announce that I’d refuse treatment. I had neither the will nor the strength to face a third battle. Not without my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because of your history,” Dr. Wilson began, “I felt it was doubly important to be certain before I made a prognosis. I had the biopsy sent to the top brain cancer specialist in the country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held my breath almost afraid to hope, certain the news would devastate me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he say?” Margaret asked, slipping closer to the edge of her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She agrees with me. The tumor was benign.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Benign,” I repeated, wanting to be sure I’d heard him correctly. The tumor was benign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Dr. Wilson smiled at me but I was too shocked to react. “Everything’s going to be all right this time, Lydia. You’re cancer-free.” He stood up and walked over to an X-ray display panel on his wall. He removed two X-rays from inside an envelope and clipped them onto the lit panel. Taking out his pen, he pointed to the film. “This is the first X-ray we took and this is the one following the surgery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you saying I won’t need radiation or chemotherapy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “No reason for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up straighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s very good news, don’t you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too numb to agree with him or even nod. Dr. Wilson’s voice faded as the realization slowly came. My life had been given back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure when I rose to my feet but suddenly I was standing. I covered my mouth and feared I was about to embarrass myself by bursting into tears. I noticed, to my astonishment, that Margaret was weeping. She rose and hugged me and started sobbing louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going to be all right,” she kept repeating. “Oh, Lydia, you’re going to be all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Wilson was explaining a new medication he’d prescribed for me and the side effects, but nothing he said made sense just then. I was too happy to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret and I both went from open weeping to ridiculous amusement, and our reactions were almost perfectly synchronized. Our giggles must have sounded hysterical. Margaret placed the tips of her fingers against her lips and refused to look at me. She made an effort to focus on what Dr. Wilson was trying to explain. None of it mattered. All I knew was that I had my life back. My beautiful, wonderful life was my own once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot until we were outside the office did I think about Brad. “Margaret,” I said, gripping my sister by the arm as the happiness drained out of me. We stood in front of the elevator. Margaret must have heard the distress in my voice because her smile faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brad…I was so cruel to him when all he wanted to do was help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret was obviously struggling not to scream I told you so at me, but all she said was, “Talk to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d missed Brad dreadfully and I longed to call him, but I couldn’t. He’d attempted to visit me twice more while I was hospitalized, but I’d refused to see him. He’d asked the nurse to deliver a letter to me. I knew if I read it he’d change my mind, so I’d asked her to take it away, sight unseen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater the nurse returned and told me Brad had been waiting for a reply and she’d been forced to tell him I wouldn’t read his letter. Now it all seemed melodramatic and senseless. I might well have ruined the most promising relationship of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can try to talk to Brad, but I don’t know if he’ll listen.” I wouldn’t blame him if he never wanted to see me again. My one hope was that he couldn’t very well ignore me when he made deliveries to my store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBright and early Tuesday morning, I was back in business. I can’t even begin to explain the thrill it gave me to walk into my shop and turn the CLOSED sign to read OPEN. Even the noise from the construction across the street couldn’t dampen my good mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReality intruded with a list of instructions from Dr. Wilson. I was apparently a good candidate for this new drug treatment to prevent the growth of future tumors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy morning was constantly busy as customers streamed into the store, all with questions as to why I’d been away for most of a week. It turns out that many of them had learned I was back—one person phoned another who called a third, and so forth. I can’t even describe how gratifying that was. Margaret had done her best to be helpful, keeping the store open for part of every day, but my customers were accustomed to dealing with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret seemed to have enjoyed working at the store. As little as three months ago, I couldn’t have imagined thinking warmly of my older sister. I was deeply appreciative of everything she’d done for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt noon, when I had my first lull of the day, I glanced anxiously out the shop windows, hoping for a glimpse of Brad. When the big brown truck rolled to a stop in front of the floral shop, I nearly raced out the door. But the UPS driver wasn’t Brad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Brad?” I blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe replacement glanced over his shoulder at the abruptness of my question. “Brad is no longer on this route.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean he’s no longer on this route?” I demanded. It felt as if the sidewalk had started to buckle beneath my feet. I couldn’t believe Brad would do anything as drastic as this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brad’s delivering in the downtown area now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what had happened. “He requested a transfer, didn’t he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UPS driver shrugged. “I wouldn’t know about that. Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you ever see him?” I asked, hoping to use the other man to relay a message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not much.” He was preoccupied, and I was clearly detaining him, so I returned to my store, my steps dragging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that what I’d done to Brad was wrong. I’d badly hurt the one person who’d proved himself to me over and over. All I could do was hope it wasn’t too late to make amends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 41\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJACQUELINE DONOVAN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“J acqueline.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer name seemed to come from far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jacqueline.” It was louder this time and she recognized Reese’s voice. Her eyes flew open and she stared up in the darkness to find her husband standing over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong?” she asked, rubbing her eyes. Something drastic must have happened for Reese to enter her bedroom in the middle of the night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Paul just phoned—Tammie Lee’s in labor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did a baby ever decide to arrive at a decent hour?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obviously didn’t expect a response and she didn’t give him one. “What did Paul say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just that he’s been at the hospital since ten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick glance at her clock told her it was nearly five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s close to delivery,” her husband finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline didn’t hesitate. She tossed aside the comforter and automatically reached for her robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You actually want to go to the hospital?” Reese sounded surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” He could do as he damn well pleased and, as a matter of fact, had for the last twelve years of their marriage. But nothing he said would keep her away from the birth of her granddaughter. Already Jacqueline had thrust her feet into her slippers and started toward her bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m coming, too,” Reese announced as if he anticipated an argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do whatever you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored her petulant remark. “Don’t take long,” he warned. “From what Paul said, it could be any time now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be ready in ten minutes.” In the best of circumstances, that was a stretch, but Jacqueline was determined to keep her word. Exactly thirteen minutes later, she met Reese who sat in the car waiting. He had the garage door open and the engine running, ready to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were silent on the ride to the hospital and Jacqueline wondered if his thoughts were the same as hers. It’d been on a night such as this that he’d rushed her to the hospital to deliver Paul. Her water had broken in the middle of the night and in a panic, fearing any movement might endanger the baby, she’d clung to Reese. Her one concern was to keep the cord from tangling around the baby’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn true heroic fashion, Reese had swept her into his arms, carried her to the car and driven to the hospital. Fortunately, there was virtually no traffic, since he took the corners at a speed any racecar driver might have envied. Then her hero had carried her into the hospital waiting area. Reese had stayed with her until Paul entered the world. Closing her eyes, she could still hear her son’s first high-pitched wail. At the time, it had been the most glorious sound she’d ever heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they arrived at the hospital, they parked quickly. Together, walking side by side, they hurried into the lobby and were directed to the birthing center on the fifth floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the reception desk, Reese gave their names to the nurse, who suggested they take a seat in the waiting room. While Jacqueline sorted through the magazines, Reese went to see if he could round them up a cup of coffee. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shop-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-1/page-41.html","bookId":1933,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM"}
