Genevieve, no shock to spare for his surprising vocabulary, had to agree with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe greasy smell of dead blood hit her like a bullet in the belly. She had to hold the doorframe to keep from fainting. She had seen the leavings of murderers before; and blood-muddied battlefields, and plague holes, and torture chambers, and execution sites. 13 Miller\u0027s Court was the worst of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Seward knelt in the middle of a ruin barely recognisable as a human being. He was still working, apron and shirtsleeves dyed red. His silver scalpel flickered in the firelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Kelly\u0027s room was cramped: a bed, a chair, a fireplace, and barely enough floor to walk around them. Jack\u0027s operation had spread the girl across the bed and the floor, and up the walls to the height of three feet. The cheap muslin curtains were speckled with halfpenny-sized dots. There was a mirror, its dusty glass marked with bloody splashes. In the grate, a bundle of clothes burned, casting a red light that seared into Genevieve\u0027s night-sensitive eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack was not overly concerned with their intrusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nearly done,\u0027 he said, easing out something from a pie-shaped expanse that had been a face. \u0027I have to be sure Lucy is dead. Van Helsing says her soul will not rest until she is truly dead.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was calm, not ranting. He performed his butchery with a surgeon\u0027s precision. In his mind, there was purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There,\u0027 Jack said. \u0027She is delivered. God is merciful.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles had his pistol out and aimed. His hand was trembling. \u0027Put down the knife and step away from her,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack placed the knife on the bedspread and stood up, wiping his hands on an already-bloody patch of apron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027See, she is at peace,\u0027 Jack said. \u0027Sleep well, Lucy my love.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Jane Kelly was truly dead. Genevieve had no doubt about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s over,\u0027 Jack said. \u0027We\u0027ve beaten him. We\u0027ve defeated the Count. The contagion cannot spread.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve had nothing to say. Her stomach was still a tight fist. Jack seemed to notice her for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Lucy,\u0027 he said, alarmed. He was seeing someone else, somewhere else. \u0027Lucy, it was all for you...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent to pick up his silver scalpel and Charles shot him in the shoulder. He spun around, fingers grasping air, and slammed against the mantel. He pressed his gloved hand to the wall and sank downwards, knees protruding as he tried to make his body shrink. Jack was huddled, holding his wound. The shot had gone completely through and torn the murder out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve snatched the scalpel away from the bed. Its silver blade made her itch, so she shifted to hold it by the enamelled grip. It was such a small thing to have done so much hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We have to get him out of here,\u0027 Charles said. \u0027A mob would tear him apart.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve hauled Jack upright and between them they managed him into the courtyard. His clothes were tacky from the drying gore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nearing morning, and Genevieve was suddenly tired. The cold air did not dispel the throbbing in her head. The image of 13 Miller\u0027s Court was imprinted in her mind like a photograph upon paper. She would never, she thought, lose it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack was easy to manipulate. He would walk with them to a police station, or to Hell. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-55.html","bookId":2524,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:17 PM"}
