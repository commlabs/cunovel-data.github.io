The last time Draconus had stopped her, appearing as if out of nowhere to grasp her wrist, staying the dagger’s point a finger’s breadth from Ublala’s right eye. He’d then slapped the woman, hard enough to send her sprawling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Best we kill her now, Ublala .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubbing the sleep from his face. ‘ No, please, don’t do that. I love her. It’s just a spat of some sort, Draconus, and as soon as I figure out what we’re arguing about I’ll fix it, I swear .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Ublala —’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Please! We’re just disagreeing about something .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ She means to kill and then rob us .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ She had cruel parents, and was bullied as a child, Draconus. Other girls pulled her braids and spat in her ears. It’s all a misunderstanding! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ One more chance, then. My advice is to beat her senseless, Ublala. It’s likely that’s how Barghast men treat murderous women, as necessity demands .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ I can’t do that, Draconus. But I’ll comb her hair .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was what he had been doing when she’d finally come round. Lacking a comb, he’d been using a thorny twig, which probably wasn’t ideal, especially on her fine eyebrows, but they’d since taken care of the infections and she was looking almost normal again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo maybe she really was asleep, and now that she had no weapons left, why, she was as harmless as a twill-mouse, except for the big rocks she kept close at hand every night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least she had stopped complaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala twisted to see if he could find Draconus – the man never seemed to sleep at all, though he’d lie down on occasion, which is what he’d been doing when Ralata had tried knifing Ublala. Wasn’t she surprised!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was standing facing north, something he had been doing a lot of, lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople like him had too many thoughts, Ublala decided. So many he couldn’t even rest from himself, and that had to be a hard thing to live with. No, it was better to have hardly any thoughts at all. Like earth. Yes, that’s it all right. Dirt .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut those tusks were scary, and that laughing was even worse!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new scent on the cool breath drifting in from the west. Perhaps some ancient memories were stirred by it, something that left the pack agitated. She watched the lord stretching and then padding up to the rise. He possessed such power, as did all lords – he could stand on a high place, exposed to all four winds, and feel no fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others remained in the high grasses of the slope, the young males pacing, the females in the shadow of the trees, where pups crawled and tumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellies were full, but the herds wending up from the plains to the south were smaller this season, and there was a harried air to their long flight from thirst and heat, as if pursued by fire or worse. Hunting the beasts had been easy – the animal they’d brought down had already been exhausted, and the taste of old terror was in its blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lord stood on the ridge. His ears sharpened and the others quickly rose – even the games of the pups ceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lord staggered. Three sticks were jutting from it now, and from the slope beyond came strange excited barks. Blood threaded down from the sticks as the lord sank down, head twisting in a vain effort to reach the shafts. Then it fell on its side and stopped moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was motion on all sides now, and more sticks whipped through foliage and grasses, sinking into flesh. The pack erupted in snarls of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figures that rushed in moved on their hind legs. Their skins gleamed with oil and their smell was that of crushed plants over something else. They flung more sticks. There was white around their eyes and they had small mouths from which came their wild barking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped as fire tore into her flank. Blood filled her throat, sprayed out from her nostrils and then poured from her jaws. She saw an attacker reach down and grasp a pup by its tail. He swung it and then slammed the little one against the bole of a tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn old scent. They are among us again. There is nowhere to hide. Now we die .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVision blurred, Setoc withdrew her hand from the bleached wolf’s skull they’d found in the crotch of the gnarled tree growing from the edge of the dried-up spring. The rough, tortured bark had almost devoured the bleached bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first tree they’d found in weeks. She wiped at her eyes. And this .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t enough to grieve. She saw that now. Not enough to wallow in the anguish of blood on the hands. It wasn’t enough to fight for mercy, to plead for a new way of walking the world. It wasn’t enough to feel guilt. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-80.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
