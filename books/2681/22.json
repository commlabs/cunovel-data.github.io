then he stopped himself~ It was true, he realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had simply done what was necessary to rescue the situation; but it was not impossible, in the bureaucratic Third Reich, for an officer to be arraigned for using his initiative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart sank, and he had to feign confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead, report me, I think I can justify myself in front of a tribunal.\" \"You actually fired your gun!\" Dieter could not resist saying, \"I suppose that\u0027s something you haven\u0027t often witnessed, in your military career.\" Weber flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never seen action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guns should be used against the enemy, not fellow officers.\" \"I fired into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry if I frightened you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were in the process of ruining a first-class counterintelligence coup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t you think a military court would take that into account?

It would be difficult, but there was no alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried one more threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you\u0027re willing to bear the consequences of this refusal, Willi? You\u0027re going to get into the most dreadful trouble.\" \"On the contrary, I think it is you who are in trouble.\" Dieter shook his head in despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no more to

explained the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went to the back of the chateau, where the engineering section was housed in the former servants\u0027 quarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night Hans had arranged to borrow a PTT van and a moped, the kind of motorized bicycle whose small engine was started by pedaling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter wondered whether Weber might have found out about the vehicles and ordered the engineers not to lend them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped not: dawn was due in half an hour, and he did not have time for more arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter and Hans put on overalls and drove away, with the moped in the back of the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went to Reims and drove along the rue du Bois.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey parked around the corner and Hans walked back, in the faint light of dawn, and put the envelope containing the photo of Flick into the letter box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelicopter\u0027s bedroom was at the back, so there was no serious risk that he might see Hans, and recognize him later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was rising when they arrived outside Michel Clairet\u0027s house in the center of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans parked a hundred meters down the road and opened a PTT manhole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pretended to be working while watching the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a busy street with numerous parked vehicles, so the van was not conspicuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter stayed in the van, keeping out of sight, brooding over the row with Weber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was stupid, but he had a point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter was taking a dangerous risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelicopter could give him the slip and disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Dieter would have lost the thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe safe and easy course would be to torture Helicopter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut though letting him go was risky, it promised rich rewards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf things went right, Helicopter could be solid gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dieter thought of the triumph that hung just beyond his grasp, he lusted for it with a passion that made his pulse race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, if things went wrong, Weber would make the most of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would tell everyone how he had opposed Dieter\u0027s risky plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Dieter would not allow himself to worry about such bureaucratic point-scoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen such as Weber, who played those games, were the most contemptible people on earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe town came slowly to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst to appear were the women walking to the bakery opposite Michel\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shop was closed, but they stood patiently outside, waiting and talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBread was rationed, but Dieter guessed it sometimes ran out anyway, so dutiful housewives shopped early to make sure they got their share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen eventually the doors opened, they all tried to get in at once-unlike German housewives, who would have formed an orderly queue, Dieter thought with a feeling of superiority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw them come out with their loaves, he wished he had eaten some breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, the working men appeared in their boots and berets, each carrying a bag or cheap fiber case containing his lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children were just beginning to set out for school when Helicopter appeared, pedaling the bicycle that had belonged to Marie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter sat upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bicycle\u0027s basket was a rectangular object covered with a rag: the suitcase radio, Dieter guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans put his head up out of the manhole and watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelicopter went to Michel\u0027s door and knocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no reply, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood on the step for a while, then looked in at the windows, then walked up and down the street looking for a back entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was none, Dieter knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter had suggested to Helicopter what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to the bar along the street, Chez Regis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrder coffee and rolls, and wait.\" Dieter\u0027s hope was that the Resistance might be watching Michel\u0027s house, alert for an emissary from London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not expect full-time surveillance, but perhaps a sympathetic neighbor might have agreed to keep an eye on the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelicopter\u0027s evident guilelessness would reassure such a watcher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone could tell, just by the way he walked around, that he was not a Gestapo man or an agent of the Milice, the French security police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter felt sure that somehow the Resistance would be alerted, and before\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoo long someone would show up and speak to Helicopter-and that person might lead Dieter to the heart of the Resistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later Helicopter did as Dieter had suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wheeled his bicycle along the street to the bar and sat at a pavement table, apparently enjoying the sunshine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got a cup of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be ersatz, made with roasted grain, but he drank it with apparent relish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter twenty minutes or so he got another coffee and a newspaper from inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to read the paper thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a patient air, as if he was prepared to wait all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning wore on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter began to wonder whether this was going to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe the Bollinger circuit had been so decimated by the slaughter at Sainte-Cecile that it was no longer operational, and there was no one left to perform even the most essential tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be a profound disappointment if Helicopter did not lead him to other terrorists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it would please Weber no end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time approached when Helicopter would have to order lunch to justify continuing to use the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA waiter came out and spoke to him, then brought him a pastis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, too, would be ersatz, made with a synthetic substitute for aniseed, but all the same Dieter licked his lips: he would have liked a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother customer sat down at the table next to Helicopter\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were five tables, and it would have been natural to take one farther away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter\u0027s hopes rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newcomer was a long-limbed man in his thirties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore a blue chambray shirt and navy canvas trousers, but to Dieter\u0027s intuition he did not have the air of a workingman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was something else, perhaps an artist who affected a proletarian look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat back in his chair and crossed his legs, resting his right ankle on his left knee, and the pose struck Dieter as familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad he seen this man before? The waiter came out and the customer ordered some- thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a minute or so nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas the man covertly studying Helicopter? Or just waiting for his drink? The waiter brought a glass of pale beer on a tray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man took a long pull and wiped his mouth with a satisfied air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter began to think gloomily that he was just a man with a thirst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at the same time he felt he had seen that mouth-wiping gesture before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the newcomer spoke to Helicopter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter tensed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould this be what he had been waiting for?
