Ridge walks swiftly behind them. Warren comes from Ridge’s bedroom and tosses him a pair of shoes. Ridge puts them on, then signs something else to Warren and slips out the door behind the gurney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as Warren rushes to his room. He reemerges with a shirt and shoes on and his baseball cap in hand. He grabs his keys off the bar and heads back into Ridge’s bedroom. He comes back out with a bag of Ridge’s things and heads for the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait!” I yell. Warren turns to look at me. “His phone. He’ll need his phone.” I rush to the bathroom, grab Ridge’s phone from the floor, and take it back to Warren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m coming with you,” I say, slipping my foot into a shoe by the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you’re not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at him, somewhat in shock at the harshness of his voice as I slip my other shoe on. He begins to pull the door shut on me, and I slap a palm against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m coming with you!” I say again, more determined this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns and looks at me with hardened eyes. “He doesn’t need you there, Sydney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea what he means by that, but his tone pisses me off. I push against his chest and step outside with him. “I’m coming,” I say with finality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk down the stairs just as the ambulance begins to pull away. Ridge is standing with his hands clasped behind his head, watching as it leaves. Warren makes it to the bottom of the stairs, and as soon as Ridge sees him, they both rush toward Ridge’s car. I follow them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren climbs into the driver’s seat, Ridge into the passenger seat. I open the door to the backseat and pull it shut behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren pulls out of the parking lot and speeds until we’re caught up to the ambulance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge is terrified. I can see it in the way his arms are wrapped around himself and he’s shaking his knee, fidgeting with the sleeve of his shirt, chewing on the corner of his bottom lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still have no idea what’s wrong with Maggie, and I’m scared that she might not be okay. It still doesn’t feel like my business, and I’m definitely not about to ask Warren what’s going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nervousness seeping from Ridge is making my heart ache for him. I move to the edge of the backseat and reach forward, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. He lifts his hand to mine and grabs it, then squeezes it tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to help him, but I can’t. I don’t know how. All I can think about is how completely helpless I feel, how much he’s hurting, and how scared I am that he might lose Maggie, because it’s so painfully obvious how that would kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brings his other hand up to mine, which is still gripping his shoulder. He squeezes both of his hands around mine desperately, then tilts his face toward his shoulder. He kisses the top of my hand, and I feel a tear fall against my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and press my forehead against the back of his seat, and I cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re in the waiting room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Warren and I are in the waiting room. Ridge has been with Maggie since we arrived an hour ago, and Warren hasn’t spoken a single word to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is why I’m not speaking to him. He obviously has an issue, and I’m not really in the mood to defend myself, because I’ve done absolutely nothing to Warren that should even require defending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slouch back in my chair and pull up the search browser on my phone, curious to know about what Warren said to the 911 operator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI type CFRD into the search box and hit enter. My eyes are pulled to the very first result: Managing cystic fibrosis–related diabetes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI click on the link, and it explains the different types of diabetes but doesn’t explain much more. I’ve heard of cystic fibrosis but don’t know enough about it to know how it affects Maggie. I click a link on the left of the page that says, What is cystic fibrosis? My heart begins to pound and my tears are flowing as I take in the same words that stick out on every single page, no matter how many pages I click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenetic disorder of the lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife-threatening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortened life expectancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo known cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurvival rates into mid- and upper thirties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t read any more through all the tears I’m crying for Maggie. For Ridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close the browser on my phone, and my eyes are pulled to my hand. I take in the unread words in Ridge’s handwriting across my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need you to move out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Warren and Sydney spring to their feet when I round the corner to the waiting room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is she?” Warren signs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better. She’s awake now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren nods, and Sydney is looking back and forth between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The doctor says the alcohol and dehydration probably caused her . . .” I stop signing, because Warren’s lips are pressed into a firm line as he watches my explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Verbalize for her,” I sign, nodding my head toward Sydney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren turns and looks at Sydney, then refocuses his attention on me. “This doesn’t concern her,” he signs silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell is his problem?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s worried about Maggie, Warren. It does concern her. Now, verbalize what I’m saying for her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren shakes his head. “She’s not here for Maggie, Ridge. She doesn’t care how Maggie’s doing. She’s only worried about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bury my anger, then slowly step forward and stand directly in front of him. “Verbalize for her. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren sighs but doesn’t turn toward Sydney. He stares straight at me as he both signs and verbalizes for us. “Ridge says Maggie’s okay. She’s awake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSydney’s entire body relaxes as her hands go to the back of her head and relief washes over her. She says something to him, and he closes his eyes, takes a quick breath, then opens them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sydney wants to know if either of you need anything. From the apartment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Sydney and shake my head. “They’re keeping her overnight to monitor her blood sugar. I’ll come by tomorrow if we need anything. I’m staying a few days at her house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren verbalizes again, and Sydney nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You two head back and get some rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren nods. Sydney steps forward and gives me a tight hug, then backs away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren begins to turn toward the exit, but I grab his arm and make him look at me again. “I don’t know why you’re upset with her, Warren, but please don’t be a jerk to her. I’ve done that enough already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, and they turn to leave. Sydney looks back over her shoulder and smiles a painful smile. I turn and walk back to Maggie’s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head of her bed is slightly raised now, and she looks up at me. There’s an IV drip in her arm, replenishing her fluids. Her head slowly rolls across her pillow as her eyes follow me across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” she signs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, not even remotely wanting or needing any type of apology from her. “Stop. Don’t feel bad. Like you always say, you’re young. Young people do crazy things like get drunk and have hangovers and puke for twelve hours straight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs. “Yes, but like you always say, probably not young people with life-threatening conditions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile as I reach her bed, then scoot a chair close to it and take a seat. “I’m going back to San Antonio with you. I’ll stay a few days until I feel better about leaving you alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs and turns her head, looking straight up to the ceiling. “I’m fine. It was just an insulin issue.” She turns back to face me. “You can’t baby me every time this happens, Ridge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy jaw clenches at “baby me.” “I’m not babying you, Maggie. I’m loving you. I’m taking care of you. There’s a difference.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closes her eyes and shakes her head. “I’m so tired of having this same conversation over and over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. So am I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean back in my chair and fold my arms over my chest while I stare at her. Her refusal of help has been understandable up to this point, but she’s not a teenager anymore, and I can’t understand why she won’t allow things to progress with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean forward, touching her arm so she’ll look at me and listen. “You need to stop being so hell-bent and determined to have your independence. If you don’t take better care of yourself, these brief one-night hospital stays will be a thing of the past, Maggie. Let me take care of you. Let me be there for you. I constantly worry myself sick. Your internship is causing you so much stress, not to mention the thesis. I understand why you want to live a normal life and do all the things other people our age do, like go to college and have a career.” I pause to run my hands through my hair and focus on the point I want to make. “If we lived together, I could do so much more for you. Things would be easier for both of us. And when things like this happen, I’ll be there to help you so you don’t convulse alone on the bathroom floor until you die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathe, Ridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, that was harsh. Way too harsh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my neck and look down at the floor, because I’m not ready for her to respond yet. I close my eyes and try to hold back my frustration. “Maggie,” I sign, looking at her tear-soaked eyes. “I . . . love . . . you. And I am so scared that one of these days, I won’t be able to walk out of the hospital with you still in my arms. And it’ll be my own fault for allowing you to continue to refuse my help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer bottom lip is quivering, so she tucks it into her mouth and bites it. “Sometime in the next ten or fifteen years, Ridge, that will be your reality. You are going to walk out of the hospital without me, because no matter how much you want to be my hero, I can’t be saved. You can’t save me from this. We both know you’re one of the few people I have in this world, so until the day comes when I can absolutely no longer take care of myself, I refuse to become your burden. Do you know what that does to me? To know that I’ve put that much pressure on you? I’m not living alone simply because I crave independence, Ridge. I want to live alone because . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears are streaming down her cheeks, and she pauses to wipe them away. “I want to live alone because I just want to be the girl you’re in love with . . . for as long as we can draw that out. I don’t want to be your burden or your responsibility or your obligation. The only thing I want is to be the love of your life. That’s all. Please, just let that be enough for now. Let it be enough until the time comes when you really do have to go to the ends of the earth for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sob breaks free from my chest, and I reach forward and press my lips to hers. I grip her face desperately between my hands and lift my leg onto the bed. She wraps her arms around me as I pull the rest of my body on top of hers and do whatever I can to shield her from the unfairness of this evil, goddamned world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSydney\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close the door to Ridge’s car and follow Warren up the stairs toward the apartment. Neither of us said a word to each other on the drive home from the hospital. The rigidness in his jaw said all he needed to say, which was, more or less, Don’t speak to me. I spent the drive with my focus out the window and my questions lodged in my throat. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/maybe-someday/page-31.html","bookId":2711,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
