I seem to be inundated with threats and warnings from you lately. After a while it gets hard to take them all seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t sound terribly upset.\" Verity lifted her head, puzzled at the cheerfulness in his tone. \"I thought it would be a terrible shock for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the news did knock me on my ass at first, as you saw, but fortunately I recover fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity started to relax, truly relax, for the first time in days. A great sense of relief began to unfurl inside her. She hadn\u0027t realized how tense she had been. \"You really don\u0027t mind being a father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I minded,\" he told her softly, \"I wouldn\u0027t have forgotten to take precautions after we made a trip into the psychic corridor, or any other time we made love. I may have my faults, sweetheart, but I\u0027m good at details. Especially those kinds of details.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity smiled tremulously and swallowed tears that seemed to have welled up out of nowhere. \"My whole life is undergoing a massive change. It\u0027s scary, Jonas. I never thought much about having children. I think that somewhere along the line I just came to the conclusion that I wasn\u0027t the type or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think this must be the first and only time I\u0027ve ever seen you unsure of yourself,\" Jonas remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve recovered from the shock a lot faster than i have. I still fee! strange. I\u0027ve been feeling that way for days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just leave everything to me, boss. I\u0027ll take care of business for you. All you have to do is sit back and get fat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not funny, Jonas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been telling you for months you need to put on a little weight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a rather drastic way to do it,\" Verity muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas chuckled softly as he picked her up and carried her to the bed. \"One of these days you\u0027re going to have to learn a few facts of life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as the fact that there are some things even an independent, assertive, bossy little tyrant like you has no control over. I can\u0027t wait to watch you get nice and round with my baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas lay quietly studying the ceiling an hour later. Verity was dozing in his arm, her soft, inviting body relaxed and warmed from his lovemaking. Intermingled with the faint, womanly fragrance that teased his nostrils was his more pungent aroma. The primitive part of him always took satisfaction in the combination of scents that hovered in the air after he had made love to Verity. It was a subtle but absolute confirmation of his recent possession of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took enormous pleasure in the knowledge of what he could do to Verity. He could make her turn to fire in his arms—sweet, hot fire. He was thoroughly addicted to the way she made him feel, hooked on the satisfaction he got from satisfying her. He didn\u0027t even want to think about facing the hard, lonely world without her by his side. Verity had brought him the only peace of mind he had known in more years than he wanted to count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now she was pregnant with his baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knowledge gave him an odd, almost euphoric rush. Soon there would be three of them—a family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to have all the responsibilities and obligations of fatherhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a role he knew little about. His own father had walked out on his mother before he was born. But Jonas figured he knew what he had missed as a kid. A father\u0027s love, a firm hand when he\u0027d needed it, someone to talk with about life. Someone to help him prepare for the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, Jonas knew what being a father was going to entail. It meant giving his kid the things he had never gotten from his own father. No sweat, he could handle it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut first he had to give Verity what she needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been blind, deaf, and dumb not to realize how insecure and unstable their relationship had appeared to her. He had been so content with the situation that he hadn\u0027t bothered to consider how Verity felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that she had delayed so long in telling him about the baby was proof enough that he had been inexcusably remiss in making her feel secure. Emerson Ames loved his daughter dearly. He\u0027d taught her to look after herself and had given her a fine, albeit unusual, education. He had given her a lot, but the one thing Emerson had not been able to provide Verity was a stable home life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas chastised himself thoroughly for not having realized weeks ago that after the rootless upbringing she\u0027d had, Verity would need a strong sense of security before she would feel comfortable about having a baby. No wonder she had been distant and withdrawn. She was nervous, even scared, probably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas had invaded and taken over the neat, orderly, home-bound little world Verity had created for herself. Then, before she had fully adjusted to having him in her life, he had given her a baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady who had planned to be alone and independent all her life had suddenly had her whole world turned upside down, in the span of a few short months. Jonas mentally ticked off the things Verity now needed from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed to know she could count on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed a last name for the baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed a husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas rolled onto his side and gently shook Verity awake. Her lashes fluttered and then rose lazily, revealing the beautiful depths of her aquamarine eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" she asked, yawning. She stretched languidly, her br**sts gently undulating. \"Something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s wrong. I\u0027ve just decided we\u0027re going to get married,\" he announced. \"As soon as we get back to Sequence Springs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity, caught in midyawn, stared at him for a good thirty seconds. Then her mouth closed with a snap. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarried. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dumbfounded expression wasn\u0027t quite what he had expected. Jonas narrowed his eyes. \" Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For all the obvious reasons,\" he exploded. \"We\u0027re living together, and you\u0027re pregnant. How many more reasons do you need to get married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity sat up and reached for her robe. \"It just now occurred to you that maybe we ought to get married?\" she asked politely as she secured the robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was lying here thinking about the baby and the future, and how you grew up without a permanent home. I realized you\u0027d probably be a lot more happy about the baby if you had a sense of security. So I\u0027m going to marry you.\" Jonas realized he was sounding a bit pompous, perhaps even a touch patriarchal. He couldn\u0027t help it. He had expected her to leap at the idea of marriage. The fact that she wasn\u0027t absolutely thrilled left him floundering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s very nice of you to offer to marry me, Jonas, but I really don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary, thank you very much.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-39.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
