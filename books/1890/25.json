It\u0027s like the essence of peach is in the wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at his accent and palate, \"Exactly. Aging wine in oak is a great way to add flavor to the wine. The oak barrels will make the wine take on whatever flavor is present while it ages. So if ripe peaches were in the room as the wine aged, the oak would soak up the flavor in the air and infuse the wine with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sipped from the glass that looked like a toy in his huge hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cocked my head, \"I don’t know a lot of people from Israel but you seem huge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, \"I am above average for an Israeli man, but I\u0027m not Israeli. My mother is actually a Brit from Saudi Arabia and my father is half Bahraini and the other half British. My mother was raised in Saudi because her father was an ambassador and my father was raised in Bahrain until he was thirteen. Then he was sent to school in England. He and my mother met there, at Oxford. My father works in Bahrain in banking. His family has always been in oil, banking, and trade. I was raised the same way he was. When I was thirteen, I was sent to London for school but I wanted to play hockey. My uncle lived in California so I was sent there when I was fourteen, and played in prep schools there. I was drafted from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, \"How are you from Israel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, \"I\u0027m not. I lived there before I came here because I was in rehabilitation there. The best doctor for my injury lived there. I was in a car accident. Technically, I was drafted into the Italian league from Israel. I am not from there though. It is a beautiful place but not my homeland. I think of California as my home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and walked to the red wine table, \"So what are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, \"I am exactly what most Americans are, Heinz 57. I am mostly British with a quarter Bahraini and being born there, that is my nationality. I have duel citizenship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luce is an odd name, it sounds Italian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is. My mother\u0027s favorite teacher when she was a girl was an Italian named Lucian Merino. He was her philosophy teacher. I am Lucian Nooruddin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whistled, \"That must have been a blast when you were a child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoffed, \"Luce has always been my nickname.\" He nudged me, \"What are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"Same as you. My father is French, Croix is pretty obvious. My mother is English. Her family came over on the Mayflower, very old money. Unfortunately, they lost it all. My parents both grew up on the East Coast. My mother was in the Hamptons and New York mostly and my father was in New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance poked his head into our conversation, \"Your parents would love Luce\u0027s.\" His tone was harsh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled at him but Luce just laughed, \"She explained them to me earlier; I doubt very much even I would get their approval.\" He was giving France a compliment but he didn’t get it. France shrugged indifferently, \"They\u0027ll love the improvement in her. Caring about art, music, and theatre. You\u0027ll be a great influence on her. I mean, Phillip brought her so far, you should be able to get her the rest of the way, make a lady out of her, and get her the right connections. His family is friends with the Bush family and the Kennedys, you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy jaw dropped but Mike continued with his mockery. He pointed, \"You never know, Luce. I thought she came here to ruin my engagement like I did hers. But maybe her parents sent her to snatch you up instead. We both know you’re the better catch. Any guy here, technically, could have had her with the way she was throwing it out there, but I\u0027m glad it\u0027s you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce shoved him slightly, \"France, watch it, huh? You\u0027re drunk, stop. We\u0027re friends. You\u0027re being a dick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike shoved him back but Luce was sober. He pulled Mike\u0027s shirt over his head and held him down, \"Calm down, Mike. Stop. We\u0027re on the same team, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike tackled him into the table with the blush wines, crashing everything to the floor. The bottles smashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped at Luce, \"Are you aright?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike got up and shoved me back and grabbed Luce, lifting him off the ground and punched him in the jaw. Luce took the hit well and tackled Mike into the wall. The plaster cracked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"STOP!\" I screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTex grabbed Mike and Arthur grabbed Luce. They held them back with the help of the rest of the team. I could see blood on Luce\u0027s back from the bottle. I lifted his shirt and winced, \"You\u0027re going to need stitches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was breathing heavily when he shook his head, \"Fuck with me again, Mike, or her…\" He pointed. France looked at him from under the most evil face I\u0027d ever seen grace his brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela grabbed my arm, \"J.D., you okay? I\u0027m so sorry. I\u0027ll take him upstairs now. He\u0027ll be so sorry he said that tomorrow. You know how he feels about you. You\u0027re like a sister to him.\" She turned and gabbed France, \"You are an asshole and you owe her a huge apology.\" She scolded him as she dragged him from the room. I stood there, frozen in the silence of them all. I looked up at Luce, \"I\u0027m so sorry. Excuse me.\" My words were barely audible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and ran from the hotel. I ran down the street in the direction I hoped was the right one. I passed the piazza we had been at earlier and ran down the cobblestone street. My boots clicked against the stone. I ran past a road but stopped when I realized it was the turn to the Piazza di Trevi. I walked slowly into the piazza, awestruck by the pain in my heart and the lit-up piazza. The whole fountain had a warm glow to it and the lights under the water made it magical. I sat on the stone ledge and tried to breathe. A terrible lump formed in my throat. I heard footsteps, dreading seeing Luce. The sound of the running water was overtaken by the footsteps of the man I never wanted to see again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack.\" His panicked face was twisted as if he were in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears started instantly. The lump took over. I couldn’t talk or breathe. All I could do was sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged myself as he drew closer. I put a hand out, shaking my sobbing face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped, \"I don’t know what\u0027s gotten into me. I just don’t know which way is right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down, crying silently in the dark and nearly-empty piazza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to me slowly, \"You and me, we\u0027re crazy and explosive and fun. I wanted you my whole life and you refused to come down to my level. You let me touch you and be with you, but you never gave me a real chance. I thought if I did a grand gesture, you would see how much I loved you. I didn’t have the courage to do it so I got drunk and the courage came.\" He was right in front of me. He dropped to his knees, taking my hands in his, \"I fucked up so bad and I don’t know how to fix it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and let the silent tears drip down my cheeks. Small raindrops started to hit me sporadically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just make me feel so unworthy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up, \"I never meant to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. I could see the tears in his eyes, \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffled, \"I just never was as strong as you. I needed you to be brave. You made me strong. I could stand up to them and walk away because you were there for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran a hand down my cheek, \"But I wasn’t was I? I made you be brave and then I left you to deal with it all.\" He leaned in close to me, \"I\u0027m sorry, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"We can\u0027t do this. You\u0027re engaged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down, \"It\u0027s like you said. I was just rebounding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"You never even gave me a chance, Mike. You assumed how my life went and never gave me a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words became a whisper, \"You broke my heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Then I guess we\u0027re even.\" I pushed him back and got up. I hugged myself and walked to the road I had come in on. The skies opened and rained down on Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at him, barely able to hear him through the bouncing rain, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not even, Jack. Not by a long shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"What more can you ruin for me, Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and stormed across the piazza, lifting me up into his arms, \"I can ruin you for every other man in the world.\" He brushed his soaked lips against mine. The rain poured down on our kiss, mixing with my tears, washing them away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “You already did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whispered into the side of my face, “Then be mine, Jack. Be my girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, and let him kiss me harder, he finished and held me tightly. I took my chance at finally telling him the thing I needed to. “I have to tell you something first. Remember how I told you I wasn’t always a good girl? I had done some bad things that you didn’t know about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stayed frozen, holding onto me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a breath, “I had an abortion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body tensed around mine but I shook my head, “It wasn’t yours. It was Phil’s. That’s when I started taking the pills from Dr. Michaels. Phil didn’t want to have a baby yet. He talked to my dad and they agreed, and I let them make me agree too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “I may kill that man yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, “Just love me instead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed the top of my head, “Baby, I always have loved you. I have to go tell Daniela that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “I feel bad for her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, “Yeah well, she’s a big girl.” He sounded cold about it, like he was okay with the decision. We walked back to the hotel holding onto each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t feel better abut telling him my secret; nothing could ever make that okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday Morning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the ceiling of the room and wondered how it had gone. He was breaking things off with her. It didn’t feel right or wrong, it was too big to try to classify.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock at the door interrupted my pondering the essence of life and why God was against me. I got up, surprised to see Luce there. His lip was puffy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s your back?\" I asked quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grimaced, \"Six stitches.\" He turned around and lifted his shirt. There was a huge bandage covering it all. I could see bruises over his back muscles. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-25.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
