Holland: more than fifty expensively trained saboteurs had parachuted straight into the arms of the Germans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, the next agent sent by London would go to the crypt of the cathedral and find Mademoiselle Lemas waiting there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would take the agent home, and he would send a wireless message to London saying all was well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, when he was out of the house, Dieter could get hold of his code books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, Dieter could arrest the agent but continue to send messages to London in his name-and read the replies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn effect, he would be running a Resistance circuit that was entirely fictional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt

hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have preferred not to tell Weber anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was difficult to refuse without giving offense, and he needed the
