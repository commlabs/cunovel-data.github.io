Immediately, great joy surged onto her face. After which, she hugged Lin Dong violently before she cried continuously. After all, no one knew how badly her heart ached when she received news that Lin Dong was forced to flee from the Eastern Xuan Region by the Yuan Gate, and that no one knew if he was dead or alive. Fortunately, she subsequently received news that Lin Dong was alive and this helped to turn things around. Nevertheless, her heart still felt like it was being pierced by countless needles, when she thought of the hardships that Lin Dong must be suffering while roaming out in the world all by himself.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong hugged Liu Yan tightly as he gently leaned on her shoulder.

He looked at Lin Dong’s smiling face before his eyes involuntarily reddened. “Little fellow, you are as stubborn as always.

This young fellow has just returned. Let him speak to his mother first.” Lin Zhentian laughed out loud. Previously, he had mostly remained silent. However, as of now, his demeanor had changed completely. In fact, some tears were glimmering in his elderly eyes as he stared at Lin Dong. Meanwhile, his face was filled with pride.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Grandpa, despite your age, you are as fit as always.” Lin Dong looked at Lin Zhentian and laughed.

When they saw the skinny young man standing in front of Lin Xiao, all of them turned to look at each other. After all, many people here knew who Lin Dong was. Several years ago, Lin Dong was merely a youth when he left Great Yan Empire to participate in the Hundred Empire War. However, when he returned, that young man now had the makings of a grandmaster. In fact, he easily blocked the attack from a Samsara stage expert previously. Hence, just how frightening must he be, in order for him to do so?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Haha, it is actually young brother Lin Dong who has saved all of us.
