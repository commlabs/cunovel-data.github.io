She seemed off. Something wasn’t right. I’d never known her to take a nap during the day. And when she’d told me about her episode she hadn’t told me everything. I could see something in her eyes. A hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood at the door to the bedroom and watched her sleep. She was curled up in a ball, which she did often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing her on the ground when I’d walked in had been like a kick to the stomach. I’d feared driving home that this was what had happened. I hadn’t been sure until I’d seen her there struggling to get up. I hated the idea of it. I hated that she even had the damn things. I was getting her help. Immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father had also been conveniently missing today. I hadn’t been able to track him down and deal with him. It wasn’t fair that I had needed to leave Della here alone when she could have been at the club with me. I wasn’t doing this to her anymore. That was probably why she’d had the damn attack anyway. She’d been thinking about me hiding her from my dad and thinking she was a problem. I should have thought of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock on the door broke into my thoughts and I closed the bedroom door so whoever it was didn’t wake up Della before I went to answer it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp stood on the other side of the door with his hands tucked into the front of his jeans. I opened the door and stepped back to let him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tripp,” I said in greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Came to say goodbye. It’s time I left this place and found somewhere new. My dad came to see me yesterday and it didn’t go well,” he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood that. Maybe leaving was my only answer. It was his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where you headed?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “Don’t know yet. I’ll know it when I find it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and glanced down the hallway. “I’d invite you in for a drink but Della is asleep. She had a bad morning and I don’t want to disturb her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand. I wanted to tell her bye too but I don’t have to. Just tell her for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t like him thinking he needed to tell her anything but I nodded. I didn’t need to be an ass about it. “I will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She sticking around then, I guess?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And your dad is okay with this? I heard that Angelina knows now. Word kind of got out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haven’t talked to my dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to. Before he gets to her first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right, of course. I needed to make sure my dad stayed the hell away from Della.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she forever for you then? She’s worth throwing it all away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew he was asking as a friend who had made a similar choice but with a different outcome. “She’s it. No one else. She’s all I’m ever gonna want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp grinned. “Can’t believe Woods Kerrington actually fell in love.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word love surprised me but only because I hadn’t said it yet. It was foreign to me. I hadn’t thought to use that word but he was right. I was in love. I looked back at the door to the bedroom and thought about Della sleeping peacefully in there on my bed. I loved her. I loved knowing she was in there. That she was mine. That I could take care of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do love her,” I said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp slapped me on the back. “Good. She needs it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he opened the door and stepped outside. I didn’t look back to see him leave or wave goodbye. I went to the door and stood there on the other side of it. I put my hands on each side of the doorframe and rested my head against the door. I loved her. I loved her with a something so fierce I couldn’t even name it. Whatever I needed to do to help her I would. She’d be happy. I would spend every second of my life making her smile. I needed to find her a doctor. That was the first step, getting her help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorknob turned and the door slowly opened. I dropped my hands to my sides as Della’s eyes locked with mine. Her hair was mussed from sleep and she still looked tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You love me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing her say it made my heart soar. She knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. More than life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of throwing herself into my arms and telling me she loved me too she dropped her face into her hands and sobbed. I watched for a moment confused and completely mystified by her reaction. This wasn’t what I had expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Della?” I asked as panic started to take its place in my chest this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t love me. You deserve better. Not me,” she cried looking up at me. Her eyes were full of tears as several trickled down her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no one better than you, Della.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “No, no, no. Don’t you see? I’m not stable. Long term… later… in life I could become like my mother. You can’t love me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother? She wasn’t going to become her mother? Why would she even think that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re it for me, baby. Just you. You’re not going to be your mother. You’re special and unique and we’re going to get you help. But I will be right by your side the entire time. I’ll never leave you. I swear it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDella’s tear streaked face stared up at me. I reached over to wipe the tears from her cheeks and pulled her closer so I could kiss her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to destroy you,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Losing you would be the only thing that could destroy me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes tightly. “But what if I lose my mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to get her to see that I wasn’t going to let that happen. She wasn’t her mother, dammit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t. I won’t let you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDella sniffled and shook her head. “You can’t control it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I could. I would find a fucking way to control it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are mine. Do you hear me? You are mine, Della Sloane. I will take care of you. Nothing is taking you away from me. Nothing.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-perfection-perfection-1/page-34.html","bookId":1991,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:18 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:18 AM"}
