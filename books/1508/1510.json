In that moment, a terrifying power rushed into his body. This was the power condensed by the God Beast array formation, and now it was pouring into his body, breaking into his inner world!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Ming had already foreseen this change when he unraveled the seal, but he didn’t expect the impact to be so wild and intense. His inner world seemed as if it couldn’t withstand this strength and wanted to crack apart!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf his inner world cracked open then his fate could be imagined. In this life or death moment, Lin Ming had an obvious choice; he could open his inner world and let this tyrannical strength gallop outwards. In doing so, although it would make things safe for him, it would actually waste away a large amount of essence energy that the God Beast array formation had accumulated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA sharp light blew up in Lin Ming’s eyes. He didn’t open his inner world. Instead, he relied on this ferocious strength to begin rapidly increasing the boundaries of his inner world!

Underneath the torrents of so much wild energy, if he couldn’t withstand the pressure of this energy then his inner world would develop cracks all over it and it would be nearly impossible to recover from. The reason Lin Ming dared to do this was because he had absolute confidence in his own foundation as well as the intensity of his body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs energy filled him, Lin Ming’s body emitted explosive crackling sounds.

Divine Lord, Divine Lord, the meaning of that was to truly become divine! Of course, this ‘divine’ was relative to common mortals. A Divine Lord martial artist could hold a world within their body and enjoy the worship of mortals. To mortals, they would be a god. As for the True Divinity boundary in the road of martial arts, this was a divine god of martial artists. A True Divinity powerhouse could control an entire universe.

From birth you possessed an unachievable talent that mortals could only dream of as well as the support of endless precious resources. I am simply a martial artist that came from the lower realms, moreover I am even a martial artist that originates from the most common stock of mortals. Although I encountered my own lucky chance in the lower realms that changed my fate, relying on that alone would not have been able to make up the difference between us. I had to risk everything I had.

Now, she had confirmed this from Lin Ming himself. Not only was he a common person, but he was even a common person of the lower realms. Within the entire Divine Realm as well as the billion plus worlds of the lower realms, there were countless common mortals, but their lives only lasted for a mere several dozen years.
