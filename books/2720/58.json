At times they might sound wonderful, but they let you down the moment you really needed them. You could never find the right words, never, and where would you look for them? The heart is as silent as a fish, however much the tongue tries to give it a voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrianna turned her back on him and buried her face in her horse’s mane, while the soldier went on standing by the well, acting as if he were nothing but thin air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s what I wish I was, too, thought Dustfinger. Just thin air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it’s the truth! He couldn’t come back!” Farid stationed himself protectively in front of Dustfinger. “There wasn’t any way! It’s exactly like he says – he was in an entirely different world, but it’s as real as this one. There are many, many worlds, they’re all different, and they’re written down in books!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrianna turned to him. “Do I look like a little girl who still believes in fairy tales?” she asked scornfully. “Once, when he stayed away so long that my mother’s eyes were red with crying every morning, the other strolling players told me stories about him. They said he was talking to the fairies, or he’d gone to see the giants, or he was down at the bottom of the sea looking for a fire that even water can’t put out. I didn’t believe the stories even then, but I liked them. Now I don’t. I’m not a little girl anymore. Not by any means. Help me mount my horse!” she ordered the soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obeyed without a word. Jehan stared at the sword hanging from his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay and eat with us!” said Roxane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Brianna just shook her head and turned her horse in silence. The soldier winked at Jehan, who was still gazing at his sword. They rode away on their horses, which seemed much too large for the narrow, stony path leading to Roxane’s farm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxane took Jehan indoors with her, but Dustfinger stayed out by the stable until the two riders had disappeared into the hills. Farid’s voice quivered with indignation when he finally broke the silence. “But you really couldn’t come back!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No .. but you must admit your story didn’t sound very convincing.” “It’s exactly what happened, all the same!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustfinger shrugged and looked at the place in the distance where his daughter had disappeared. “Sometimes even I think I only dreamed it all,” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chicken squawked angrily behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where the devil is Jink?” With a curse, Dustfinger opened the stable door. A white hen fluttered past him into the open; another fowl lay in the straw, her feathers bloody. A marten was sitting beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jink!” Dustfinger scolded. “Damn it, didn’t I tell you to leave the chickens alone?” The marten looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeathers were sticking to the animal’s muzzle. He stretched, raised his bushy tail, came to Dustfinger, and rubbed against his legs like a cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, what do you know?” whispered Dustfinger. “Hello, Gwin.” His death was back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 29 – New Masters\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyrants smile with their last breath\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor they know that at their death,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyranny just changes hands,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerfdom lives on in their lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– Heinrich Heine, “King David”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Prince of Sighs, once the Laughing Prince, died scarcely a day after Meggie had been to the castle with Fenoglio. He died at dawn, and the men-at-arms rode into Ombra three days later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeggie was in the marketplace with Minerva when they came. After her father-in-law’s death Violante had ordered the guard at the city gate to be doubled, but there were so many men-at-arms that the guards let them in without offering any resistance. The Piper rode at their head, his silver nose like a beak in the middle of his face, as shiny as if he had polished it up specially for the occasion. The narrow streets echoed with the snorting of horses, and it was quiet as the mounted men appeared among the buildings. The street cries of traders, the voices of women crowding around the stalls, all fell silent when the Piper reined in his horse and disapprovingly scrutinized the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make way!” he called. His voice sounded oddly strained, but what else would you expect of a man who had no nose? “Make way for the envoy of the Adderhead. We are here to pay his last respects to your dead prince and ensure that his grandson takes his rightful place as his heir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence continued, but then a single voice was raised. “Thursday’s market day in Ombra, always was, so if you gentlemen would like to dismount, we can get on with it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Piper looked for the speaker among the faces staring up at him, but the man was hidden by the crowd. A murmur of agreement rose in the marketplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, so that’s it!” cried the Piper through the confused voices. “You think we rode right through that accursed forest just to dismount here and make our way through a rabble of stinking peasants. As soon as the cat’s dead the mice dance on the table. But I have news for you. There’s a cat in your miserable town again, a cat with sharper claws than the old one!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word, he turned in the saddle, raised his black-gloved hand – and gave his men a signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he rode his horse straight into the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence that had been weighing down so heavily on the marketplace was torn like rending cloth. Screams rose in its enclosed space. More and more horsemen rode in from among the houses around it, so heavily armed they looked like iron reptiles, their helmets drawn so far down that you could see only their mouths and their eyes between nose guard and rim. There was a clinking of spurs, a clashing of greaves, and breastplates so brightly polished that they reflected the crowd’s horrified faces. Minerva pushed her children out of the way. Despina stumbled, and Meggie was going to her aid when she herself tripped over a couple of cabbages and fell flat. A stranger pulled her to her feet just before the Piper rode her down. Meggie heard his horse snorting above her, felt his gleaming spurs brush her shoulder. She took shelter behind a potter’s overturned stall, although she cut her hands on his broken pots. Trembling, she crouched among the shards, surrounded by smashed barrels and sacks that had burst open, watching helplessly as others, less lucky, fell under the horses’ hooves. The mounted men struck out at many in the crowd with their feet or the shafts of their spears. Horses shied, reared, and kicked at pots and people’s heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, just as suddenly as they had come, the men-at-arms were gone. Only the sound of their horses’ hooves could still be heard as they rode fast up the street to the castle. The marketplace was left looking as if a strong wind had blown through it, an ill wind breaking jugs and pots as well as human bones. There was a smell of fear in the air as Meggie crawled out from behind the barrels. Peasants were gathering up their trampled vegetables, mothers wiped tears from their children’s faces and blood from their knees, women stood looking at the broken earthenware dishes they had hoped to sell – and all was quiet in the marketplace again. Very quiet. The voices cursing the horsemen did so in undertones, and even the weeping and groaning were muted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinerva came over to Meggie, concern in her face, with the sobbing Despina and Ivo beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I think we have a new master now,” she said bitterly, helping Meggie to her feet. “Can you take the children home? I’ll stay here and see what I can do to help. There must be many broken bones, but luckily a few physicians can always be found here on market day.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inkspell-inkworld-2/page-58.html","bookId":2720,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:42:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:42:19 PM"}
