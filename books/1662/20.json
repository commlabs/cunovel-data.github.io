I closed my eyes as his fingers inched down my turtleneck, clearing a path for his lips to meet my wildly beating pulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not going to be easy,” he said. “It wasn’t three months ago and it won’t be three months from now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because of the rest of the Luxen?” My head tipped back, my thoughts swimming at his touch. There was something wicked in those hot little kisses he dropped all over my throat. “They’ll outcast you. Like—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” He let go of my turtleneck and slid his hand around the nape of my neck as his body pressed against mine. “I’ve thought about the repercussions—it’s all I’ve thought about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me had been yearning to hear him say that. A secret I’d kept close to my heart—the same heart that was jumping in my chest. I opened my eyes. His were glowing. “And this has nothing to do with the connection or Blake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said, and then sighed. “Yes, some of it has to do with that human, but it’s about us. About what we feel for each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was attracted to him on a level that was nearly painful. Being around him had every cell in my body burning, but this was Daemon. Caving to him was like saying the way he’d treated me was okay. And more importantly, it required blind faith in the theory that our feelings were real. And when they turned out not to be? It would be heartbreak, because I would seriously fall for him—fall more than I already had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiggling down, I dipped under his arms. A dull ache shot through my injured leg as I backed up. “Is this like a ’I didn’t want you until someone else wanted you’ type of thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon leaned against the table. “That’s not what this is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what is it, Daemon?” Tears of frustration built in my eyes. “Why now, when three months ago you couldn’t stand to breathe the same air as me? It’s the connection between us. It’s the only thing that makes sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit. Do you think I don’t regret acting like such a douche to you? I’ve apologized.” He stood there, towering over me. “You don’t get it. None of this is easy for me. And I know this is hard for you. You have a lot to deal with. But I have my sister and an entire race counting on me. I didn’t want you to get close to me. I didn’t want another person to care about, to worry about losing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in a breath, and he went on. “It wasn’t right how I acted. I know that. But I can do better than that—better than Benny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blake.” I sighed, limping away from him. “I have a lot in common with Blake. He likes that I read a lot—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do, too,” Daemon challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And he also blogs.” Why did I feel like I was grasping at straws?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon caught a piece of my hair and wrapped it around his finger. “I have nothing against the Internet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knocked his hand away. “And he doesn’t like me because of some stupid alien connection or because some other guy likes me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t either.” His eyes flashed. “You can’t keep pretending. It’s wrong. You’ll break that boy’s poor little human heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I won’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will, because you want me and I want you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep down, I did want to be with him. And I wanted him to want me, not because we were the same atom split or because someone else liked me. Shaking my head, I went for the door. “You keep saying that…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does that mean?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed my eyes shut briefly. “You say you want me, but that’s not enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I show you that I do, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacing him, I cocked an eyebrow. “You do not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that?” Daemon gestured at the table, and I flushed. People eat at that table… “I think I showed you that I like you. I can do it again if you’re not clear on what that was. And I’ve brought you a smoothie and a cookie to school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You stuck the cookie in your mouth!” I threw my hands up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at that, like it was a good memory. “The table…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Humping my leg like a dog in heat every time I’m around you doesn’t prove you like me, Daemon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon clamped his mouth shut, and I could tell he was fighting back laughter. “Actually, that’s how I show people I like them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Fine. Whatever. None of this matters, Daemon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not going anywhere, Kat. And I’m not giving up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I really believed he would. I reached for the door but he stopped me. “Do you know why I met you that day in the library?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I faced him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Friday you came back after being sick?” He ran a hand through his hair. “You were right. I picked the library because no one would see us together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth snapped shut and a sick feeling leached up my throat, causing it to burn. “You know what, I’ve always wondered if your ego was so big you didn’t want to eat crow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And as always, you jump to the wrong assumption.” His eyes pierced mine. “I didn’t want Ash or Andrew to start giving you a bunch of crap because of me like they did with Dawson and Beth. So if you think I’m embarrassed of you or not ready to make my intentions very public, then you better get that idea out of your head. Because if that’s what it takes, then it’s on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. What in the hell was I supposed to say to that? Yeah, a part of me had believed it. How many people would kick a chick out of the cafeteria like he had and then start wooing her? Not many. And then I remembered the lump of spaghetti hanging off his ear, heard Daemon’s amused laughter from the day that felt so long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daemon…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was really starting to concern me. “I told you, Kitten. I like a challenge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesa practically pounced on me the moment I sat down in class. “Did you hear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf asleep, I shook my head. I’d had a hell of a time going to bed last night after everything with Daemon. The fluttering my stomach was doing had to be a consequence of no breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Simon is missing,” Lesa said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Missing?” I didn’t pay attention to the warm tingling on my neck or when Daemon sauntered into class. “Since when?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since this past weekend.” Lesa’s eyes flicked up behind me and widened. “Wow. Now that’s even more unexpected.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething smelled sweet and familiar. Confused, I twisted around. A single rose in full bloom, a vibrant red, brushed against the tip of my nose. Tan fingers held the green stem. My eyes lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon stood there, his eyes glittering like green tinsel. He patted me on the nose with the rose again. “Good morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDumbfounded, I stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is for you,” he added when I didn’t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery single person in class was staring as my fingers wrapped around the cool, damp stem. Daemon sat down before I could say anything. I sat there, holding the rose until the teacher walked in and started calling off names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s throaty chuckle warmed my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheeks flaming, I placed the rose on my desk, and I honestly don’t think I took my eyes off it. When Daemon had said he wasn’t giving up, I had no idea he was going to go all balls-to-the-wall right off the bat. Why would he? Maybe he just wanted to have sex with me. And that had to be all, right? Hatred turned to lust. He’d been so against me months ago and now he wanted to be with me, going against the wishes of his race? Maybe he had a secret drug habit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light caught the moisture on the rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up, catching Lesa’s gaze. She mouthed, Nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice? It was nice and sweet and romantic and about a thousand other things that had my heart doing backflips. Sneaking a peek at Daemon over my shoulder, I watched him scribble along a blank piece of notebook paper. His brows were lowered in concentration. Thick, sooty lashes hid his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey lifted and his lips spread into a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in so much trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCops were everywhere over the next couple of days, asking students and teachers questions about Simon. Daemon and I ended up being some of the first people they talked to. As if we were a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, plotting to take out jocks everywhere. Well, the fact that Daemon had beaten the crap out of Simon didn’t look good. But the cops didn’t treat us like suspects. After my first and only questioning with them in the principal’s office, I determined that two of the state troopers were aliens. And I also got the distinct impression they suspected I knew their secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if someone had let the alien out of the bag. Ash was the most likely suspect, especially since Daemon had become the bearer of gifts. One day he brought me a pumpkin spiced latte—my favorite—then an egg and bacon breakfast croissant, glazed doughnuts on Thursday, and a lily on Friday. He did nothing to hide his intentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me actually felt bad for Ash. She’d spent her whole life expecting to be with Daemon. I couldn’t even imagine what she was thinking—if she was mourning the final downfall of their relationship or if it was just that she’d lost something she’d believed was hers. If I ended up being found in a ditch somewhere, my bets would be on Ash or Andrew. Adam had left the dark side and was now sitting with Dee at lunch. They literally couldn’t keep their hands off each other…or our food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach night, Daemon soaked up my time. Keeping an eye on me was what he claimed to be doing, waiting to see if I was attacked by a chair again. In his world, that translated into time suckage that involved every possible way he could get close to me. Like, really, will-breaking, body-tingling close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake…well, Blake spoke to me in class. He texted a few times at night, and I always had to wait until Daemon decided to leave before I could call him back, but there had been no talk of another date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon had been successful with the scare tactics, which he was unabashedly proud of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday afternoon, I was in a marathon review-writing spree when someone knocked on my front door. Finishing up my last sentence—Mesmerizing debut, heart-stopping action, and swoon-worthy romance, The Hidden Circle is a forget-your-homework, don’t-feed-your-kids, and quit-your-job one-sit read—before shutting my laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I neared the door, I felt the tingling on my neck. Daemon. I tripped over the upturned corner of the area rug and took a second to straighten the ribbed sweater that had ridden up before I snatched open the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFamiliar feelings of anxiety slid through me. What did he have up his sleeve today? In other words, how much more could he possibly complicate my life? My no-kiss policy had remained strong since Monday. But strangely, even as innocent and clandestine as our meetings were, there was still a level of intimacy that couldn’t be denied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon was changing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was used to the sarcastic and rude Daemon. In an odd way, that version was easier to deal with. We could trade insults all day. But this Daemon…this one who wouldn’t give up was kind and gentle, funny and—dear God—thoughtful. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-20.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
