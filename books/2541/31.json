I was growing weary of tortuous effort. Rashly, I made my point direct. \"Do you ever eat or drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe averted her eyes with a hiss of irritation. \"What do you think?\u0027\u0027 she snapped. I tried walking closer to her only to stop as Ginger growled again. \"Why does she keep doing that?\u0027\u0027 I asked. I sounded irritated now. \"I\u0027m not here to hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t if you wanted to,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost answered in kind. God help me, Robert. There to assist her and I almost responded with anger. Closing my eyes, I fought to regain my motivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I opened my eyes again, I noticed her car outside and yet another notion came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that the only car you have?\u0027\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the third time, that critical look. \"We all have cars,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Being used, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By your children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your husband\u0027s car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you he was in an accident,\" she said, stiffening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone said you have a camper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the place where we had always kept it parked and a look of confusion distorted her face.

She blinked, looked momentarily disturbed. Then the vacant look was back again. \"I don\u0027t remember,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sure I have it written down some--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke off as I pointed at her car. \"How did it get dented?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone hit it in a parking lot while I was shopping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was bitter. \"That\u0027s the way people are,\" she said. \"Whoever did it just left without telling me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were shopping?\" I asked. \"I thought you said you never left the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a tinge of instability in her voice as she answered, \"That was before the battery went dead.\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were back where we started, the convoluted turnings of her mind endlessly thwarting me. No matter what I tried, I couldn\u0027t make a point she\u0027d recognize much less react to. This gray world she existed in made sense to her. Horrible, depressing sense but sense nonetheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wheels in my mind were turning more slowly now. I could think of nothing new to try and, so, returned to an earlier approach. Maybe if I pushed it harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never told me what your children\u0027s names are,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have to leave?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started, not expecting that. I\u0027d forgotten this was life to her. In life, she would have wondered why a strange man lingered in her house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave soon,\" I said. \"I just want to talk to you a little longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. \"Because I\u0027m new in the neighborhood.\" It seemed like a feeble answer but, for some reason, she didn\u0027t question it. \"What did you say your children\u0027s names are?\" I asked. She turned from the window, walking toward the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time she\u0027d avoided a question by refusing to answer, I thought. Was this a positive sign? I followed her and Ginger, asking, \"Is your younger son named Ian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in school,\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is his name Ian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be home later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is his name Ian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better leave.

Was it feigned or actual?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is your older girl named Louise?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced across her shoulder as she moved into the living room. \"Why don\u0027t you--?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Louise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you go home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Louise ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if it is?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My older daughter\u0027s name is Louise too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How interesting.\" Sarcasm as resistance now. She walked to the glass door, Ginger at her heels. Was she retreating from me bodily now? And did she know that she was doing it? \"Is your older son\u0027s name Richard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at that pool,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is your older son\u0027s name Richard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, an expression of resentment on her face. \"Look, what do you want?\" she asked, her voice rising\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost said it all--unvarnished, laid out in a row. Then something stopped me. It was amazing I still had that much awareness. My perceptions were becoming more and more blunted as time passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled as nicely as I could. Love, I thought. It has to be done with love. \"I\u0027m just interested in the remarkable similarities in our lives,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What similarities?\" she lashed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I look like your husband for one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t.\" She cut me off. \"Not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I was wrong!\" she flared. Growling, Ginger showed her teeth once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. I had to be more careful. \"I wasn\u0027t trying to make trouble. It just seemed remarkable to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gazed out through the glass door again. \"I don\u0027t see anything remarkable at all,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... my wife named Ann. My children\u0027s names the same as yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned on me again. \"Who said they were the same?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my name Chris,\u0027\u0027 I said. She twitched sharply, gaping at me. For an instant, something lifted from her eyes instead of settling over them. I felt my heartbeat jolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt passed as quickly as it came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burst of raging anguish filled me. Damn this filthy place! I thought. I shuddered with the rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd felt myself grow denser with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop! I thought. I couldn\u0027t though. I had no ability to reverse the process. Instead of helping her, I was descending to her world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I thought. I won\u0027t do that. I was here to take her from this place, not join her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d turned away again by then, staring through the murky glass, once more drawing her oppression around her like a guarding mantle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why I don\u0027t just put this place up for sale and leave,\" she said. Another sound of embittered humor. \"Who\u0027d buy it though?\" she continued. \"The best real estate agent in the world couldn\u0027t sell it.\" She shook her head in disgust. \u0027 The best real estate agent in the world couldn\u0027t give it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes now, lowering her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I keep polishing the furniture,\" she said, \"but dust keeps settling on it. It\u0027s so dry; so dry. We haven\u0027t had a drop of rain in such a long time, I--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke off. That, too, I thought, despondently. Of course that would be part of Ann\u0027s particular hell: lack of rain and browning greenery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stand filth and confusion,\" she said, her voice beginning to break. \"Yet all I see is filth and confusion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started forward once again and Ginger braced herself to leap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, can\u0027t you see I only want to help,\u0027\u0027 I said, my voice rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn jerked around, recoiling from me and I felt a burst of agonized reproach inside myself. I drew back quickly as Ginger started for me, snarling. \"All right, all right,\" I murmured, raising my hands in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ginger,\u0027\u0027 Ann said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinger stopped and looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind felt numb with defeat. Everything I\u0027d tried had failed. Now this blunder. For all I knew, I was farther from helping Ann now than before I\u0027d arrived. How vividly I saw what Albert had meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis level was a cruel and cunning trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People borrow books and don\u0027t return them,\" Ann said, continuing as though nothing had occurred. \"My best jewelry is gone. I can\u0027t find it anywhere. My best clothes are missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her with no idea whatever what to say or do. She was hiding again, holding the details of her plight between herself and any possible understanding of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know who took those chessmen either,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My wife had a chess set like that made for me,\" I told her. \"One Christmas. A man named Alexander built it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn shuddered. \"Why don\u0027t you leave me alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lost control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must know why I\u0027m here,\" I said. \"You must know who I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat maddening look in her eyes again; the filming away, the blind withdrawal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ann,\" I said. I reached out, touching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped as though my fingers burned and, suddenly, I felt Ginger\u0027s teeth clamp hard into my arm. I cried out and tried to pull away but she tightened her grip so that I dragged her across the carpeting by her hind legs. \"Ginger!\" I \"shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voicing of her name came simultaneously with Ann\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, the bite was released and she was back beside Ann, trembling with reaction. Raising my arm, I looked at it. Yes, pain was definitely possible there. And blood. I watched it oozing darkly from the punctures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterlife, I thought. It seemed a mockery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo flesh, yet pain and blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is only death!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI LOOKED UP from my arm to see Ann start to cry. She was stumbling across the room, tears running down her cheeks. As I watched, she slumped down on the sofa and pressed her left hand over her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain in my arm seemed slight now compared to the new despair I felt. Without thinking, I started toward her again, then jerked to a halt as Ginger made a lurching movement toward me, her growl now mixed with a frantic wheezing sound which told me how disturbed she was. I drew back hastily as Ann looked up, her face a mask of wretched anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you go?\" she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backed off slowly, watching Ginger. As she settled down into a nervous crouch, I stopped. Looking behind me, I saw that I was standing near the piano bench and, backing up another few feet, I lowered myself onto it slowly, my gaze still fixed on Ginger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want Chris,\" Ann murmured, sobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her, completely helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want him back. I need him,\" she said. \"Where is he? Oh, God, where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. My throat was dry; it hurt. My arm ached from the bites. I might as well be alive again. This level was so horribly close to life. And yet so horribly far, only racking sensations present, no compensations of any sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about him,\" I heard myself ask. I didn\u0027t know why I said it. I was straining now. The effort grew more arduous with every passing moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe only wept. \"What did he look like?\" I asked. Once again, I knew what I\u0027d begun. What I didn\u0027t know was if it would work. Why should it? Nothing else had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I went on. \"Was he tall?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew in shaking breath, fingering tears from her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded jerkily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As tall as I am?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t reply.

Had the significance of what I\u0027d said reached her mind in any way at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked another question. \"Was he blond?\u0027\u0027 She nodded once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer teeth clenched again. \"No.\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fought an overwhelming urge to give up, stand, walk out of the house, go back to Summerland and wait. It all seemed so utterly hopeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he do?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had her eyes shut.

It was so incredibly obvious. Yet she didn\u0027t. Never had the meaning of the phrase been so vivid to me: None so blind as those who will not see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to leave But I couldn\u0027t desert her. \"Were his eyes green?\" I asked, plodding on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine are too,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered fitfully. \"Ann, can\u0027t you see who I am?\" I pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes and, for another of those moments, I had the feeling that she recognized me. I tightened, leaning toward her. Then she averted her face and I shuddered again. Dear God, was there no way in heaven or hell of reaching her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back quickly. \"Why are you doing this to me?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to convince you who I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for her inevitable question: Who are you? It never came. Instead, she slumped back on the sofa, closing her eyes, shaking her head in slow, weary turns from side to side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have nothing,\" she said. I couldn\u0027t tell if she was speaking to herself or me. \"My husband\u0027s gone. My children are grown. I\u0027m all alone. Deserted. If I had the courage I\u0027d kill myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words horrified me. To have committed suicide and ended up in a place so dreadful that it made her think of committing suicide. A twisted, unrelenting reflection within a reflection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel so heavy,\" she said. \"So tired and heavy. I can barely lift my feet. I sleep and sleep but always wake exhausted. I feel empty. Hollow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbert\u0027s words returned to torment me. \"What happens to suicides,\" he\u0027d said, \"is that they have a feeling of being hollowed out. Their physical bodies have been prematurely eliminated, their etheric bodies filling the void. But those etheric bodies feel like empty shells for as long a time as their physical bodies were meant to live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came to me, at that moment, why it had been impossible to reach her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy placing herself in this spot, she had removed her mind from all positive memories. Her punishment--albeit self-inflicted--was to recall only the inimical things in her life. To view the world she remembered through a lens of total negativism. To never see light but only shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it like to be here?\" I asked impulsively. There was a cold sensation in my stomach. I was starting to feel afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn looked at me but seemed to gaze into the darkness of her thoughts as she answered. Speaking at length for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see but not clearly,\" she said. \"I hear but not clearly. Things happen that I can\u0027t quite grasp. Understanding always seems a few scant inches from me. I can never reach it though. Everything is just beyond me. I feel angry for not seeing or hearing distinctly, for not understanding. Because I know it isn\u0027t me that\u0027s missing things. But that everything around me is vague and held those few, scant inches from my understanding. That I\u0027m being fooled somehow. Tricked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things happen right in front of me and I see them happen but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m getting them even though it seems I am. There\u0027s always something more going on that I can\u0027t figure out. Something I keep missing even though I don\u0027t know how I\u0027m missing it or why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I keep trying to understand what\u0027s happening but I can\u0027t. Even now, as I speak to you, I feel as though I\u0027m missing something. I tell myself that I\u0027m all right, that everything around me is distorted. But, even as I\u0027m thinking it, I get a premonition that it is me. That I\u0027m having another nervous breakdown but can\u0027t identify it this time because it\u0027s all too subtle and beyond my comprehension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything eludes me. I can\u0027t describe it any better. Just as nothing works in the house, nothing works in my mind either. I\u0027m always confused, off center. I feel like my husband must have, in dreams he used to have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself leaning toward her, anxious to capture every word she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d be in New York City, for instance, and be unable to get in touch with me no matter how he tried. He\u0027d talk with people and they\u0027d seem to understand him and he\u0027d seem to understand them. But nothing they\u0027d say would work out. He\u0027d dial telephones and get wrong numbers. He\u0027d be unable to keep track of his belongings. He couldn\u0027t remember where he was staying. He\u0027d know he was in New York for a reason but couldn\u0027t remember what the reason was. He\u0027d know he didn\u0027t have enough money to get back to California and all his credit cards were missing. He\u0027d never be able to figure out what was going on. That\u0027s how I feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know this isn\u0027t a dream then?\" I asked. A glimmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I see and hear things,\" she answered. \"I feel things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see and hear... you--feel in dreams too,\" I replied. My mind was laboring but I sensed that there was something there. A connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a dream,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\" \"It isn\u0027t a dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that?\" She sounded upset again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to help you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe answered, \"I wish I could believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as though a faint light touched the shadows in my mind. She hadn\u0027t believed me at all before. Now she was wishing she could believe. It was a small step but a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new idea occurred; the first I\u0027d had in a long time, I realized. Was something clearing in my mind? \"My son, Richard, has been ...\" I paused, the word eluding me. \"--looking into ESP,\" I finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027d spoken his name, her face had tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s been talking to a psychic,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the tension in her face. Was I harming her or helping? I didn\u0027t know. But I had to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s come, after much thought, to believe--\" I braced myself. \"--that there\u0027s life, after death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s stupid,\" she said immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I shook my head. \"No, he believes it. He feels there\u0027s proof that survival exists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head but didn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He believes that murder is the worst crime anyone can commit,\" I said. I looked directly into her eyes. \"And suicide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered violently; tried to stand but didn\u0027t have the strength and sank back down again. \"I don\u0027t see...\" she said. My mind felt clearer now. \"He believes that the taking of life is reserved to God alone,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you telling me this?\" she asked in a low, shaking voice. She trembled as she spoke, huddling against the sofa. Ginger was looking at her frightenedly, ears back. She knew something was wrong but couldn\u0027t fathom what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I braced myself. \"I\u0027m telling you because my wife committed suicide,\" I said. \"She took an overdose of sleeping pills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat blank look crossing her eye again. For some reason, it lifted almost instantly as though she couldn\u0027t manage to retain it. She shook her head. \"I don\u0027t believe...\" she started. Her voice sounded feeble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind felt clearer yet. \"What bothers me is that Richard believes she still exists,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sound. A shaking of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That she\u0027s in a place not unlike our house,\" I said. \"But a gloomy, negative version of it. Everything depressing and cold. Not functioning. Dirty and disordered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head kept shaking. She mumbled inaudible words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he\u0027s right,\" I said. \"I think that death is a continuation of life. That the person we are persists afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" An escape of sound, like a stricken breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you see?\" I asked. \"Your house was beautiful and warm and bright. Why should it be like this? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept drawing back. I knew she was terrified but had to continue. This was the first approach that had accomplished anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should your house look so ugly?\" I asked. \"Does it make any sense? Why should the gas and electricity and water and telephone all be off? Is there any logic to that? Why should the lawns and bushes and trees all be dying? Why should the birds all be dying? Why shouldn\u0027t it rain? Why should everything in your life go bad at the same time?\" Her voice was faint. I think she said, \"Leave me alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept it up. \"Don\u0027t you see that this house is only a replica of the home you knew? That you\u0027re only here because you believe it\u0027s real? Don\u0027t you see you\u0027re making this existence for yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, looking like a panicked child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you understand why I\u0027m telling you these things?\" I said. \"It\u0027s not just that my children have the same names as yours. Not just that my wife has the same name as yours. Your children are my children. You are my wife. I\u0027m not just a man who looks like your husband. I am your husband. We\u0027ve survived--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI broke off as she lurched to her feet. \"Lies!\" she shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I jumped up. \"No, Ann!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lies!\" she screamed at me. \"There is no afterlife! There is only death!\u0027\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/what-dreams-may-come/page-31.html","bookId":2541,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:37 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:37 AM"}
