He had stopped over at Niagara and Cincinnatiâ€”a day or so at each place. He gratified his desire to see the great cataract, and felt repaid for doing so, though the two stops trenched formidably upon his small capital. Indeed, at the moment when he is introduced anew to the reader\u0027s notice he had but ten dollars remaining of the sum with which he started.
