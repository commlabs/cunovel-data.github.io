She sprung to her feet and faced him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [223]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where is my child?\" she cried, wildly. \"Speak, for the love of Heaven, I pray you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It will cost you just another thousand dollars to find that out. Bring me that amount here to-morrow night at the same hour, and I will give you full information. Isn\u0027t that fair enough?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pleadings and prayers were alike unavailing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you suppose I am going to tell you for nothing, when I can make you pay handsomely?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I haven\u0027t the money,\" she sobbed, \"and—and you know it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How did you get this thousand?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then Ida told him all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You were a fool to get rid of the diamonds before you had asked Eugene Mallard for the money and been refused. Go to him and ask him for the money now. He does not know how to refuse a woman, and he will give it to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And if I refuse?\" she asked, desperately.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He shrugged his shoulders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you and the man you love will be thrown into prison,\" Royal declared, \"to serve a term of fifteen or twenty years. After that you can not complain as to how I brought up your daughter, if she follows in the footsteps of her mother!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He could not have used a more conclusive argument.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you no heart, man—no mercy?\" cried Ida.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come, come, I say, do not be theatrical; the role does not become you! Better be sensible, and consider the proposition I make you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will leave you now,\" he said; \"but I will be here, at this same hour, to-morrow night.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, no!\" she cried. \"Give me a week to think it[224] over, and—and to see what I can do about raising the money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, then, a week, if you must have it,\" he replied; \"but no longer. Here, you can take these proofs of my story regarding your child and look them over at your leisure,\" he said, thrusting the package into her hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next moment he was gone. She did not faint; she knew that if she did she would be found there with the package in her hand. She was so dazed, so bewildered, she never remembered how she reached the house and her own room. Again she rang the bell for Nora.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You may bring me another cup of tea,\" she said, faintly, \"as strong as the last one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The girl, noticing how pale and ill her mistress looked, thought it would be best to bring her a glass of wine as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Unless I am very much mistaken, she has a sick spell coming on. Her face is pale, but every now and then it flushes burning red.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ida did not seek her couch that night until she had eagerly scanned every article of clothing the parcel contained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her excitement knew no bounds as she read the letter from the superintendent of the foundling asylum, concerning all that he knew of the baby\u0027s parentage, in which he stated that the doctor who had attended the young mother had brought the child to the institution in a dying condition, as he supposed, and was hastily called abroad, and had barely time to make the outgoing steamer. He had told them that they could tell the hapless young mother when she was able to bear the sad news.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ida wept as she had never wept before as she read those written words, and her excitement increased as she[225] saw that the letter was directed to the village merchant\u0027s wife, Mrs. Lester, who had taken the child.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was, then, her own child that she had clasped in her arms, the eyes of her own babe into which she had gazed with such agony and yet with such rapture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then another fear seized her. She had not seen the little one for weeks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Was it ill? Had anything happened to it? She could not visit Mrs. Lester\u0027s home until the day broke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How came her little child in the possession of Royal Ainsley?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The suspense which she endured almost drove her insane. The next morning she was up as early as the servants were.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Joe,\" she said to the old coachman, \"I want you to harness up the swiftest horses you have in the stable, and take me to the village. I want to go to the store kept by the Lesters.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You will not find it open so early in the mornin\u0027, ma\u0027am,\" declared Joe. \"Dem village folk am pow\u0027ful lazy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We will go to their garden, and perhaps be fortunate enough to find them there,\" said Ida, eagerly. \"Harness the horses at once, Joe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The hapless young mother scarcely breathed during that ride.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After what seemed to her almost an endless ride, they drew up before the village store kept by the Lesters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Joe had predicted, the door was closed, and the blinds drawn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There they are in the garden yonder; at least, there am Mrs. Lester in the strawberry-patch, and there am her husband, off further in the fields.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [226]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will go to her,\" said Ida, stepping quickly from the carriage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So busy was Mrs. Lester with her task of gathering the ripe fruit, that she did not know of the presence of her visitor until she stood beside her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mrs. Lester,\" said a quick, eager, husky voice, \"I do hope I have not surprised you this morning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, well, you have surprised me, for a fact. I suppose you want to get something from the store.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I do, but not just now,\" returned Ida, with feverish impatience. \"Let me sit down here a few moments and talk with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly,\" said the woman; \"but I haven\u0027t anything out here to invite you to sit upon, save that little garden-seat which I always take around with me, so that I can rest myself when I get tired.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It will do very well, thank you,\" said Ida, feeling so weak and faint that she could hardly stand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have not seen you nor your little child lately,\" began Ida.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then she stopped short, lest her quivering voice should betray her terrible anxiety.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" returned Mrs. Lester. \"I no longer have the little one, bless its poor, dear little heart!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Has anything happened to it?\" asked Ida, the agony of death in her voice. \"Oh, tell me, where is it? Is the little baby dead?\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1691/49825.html","bookId":1156,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM"}
