And suddenly Trull Sengar’s advance stalled, and then he was being driven back, as those swords, hammering the shaft of his spear, tore away bronze sheathing, began splintering the wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Trull Sengar recognized, before him, his own death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnrack the Broken saw his friend’s attack fail, saw the fight turn, and saw that Trull Sengar was doomed to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he did not move. Could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt his own heart tearing itself to pieces, for the man behind him-the Imass, Ulshun Pral-was, Onrack knew at once, of his own blood. A revelation, the summation of a thousand mysterious sensations, instincts, the echoing of gestures-Ulshun Pral’s very stance, his manner of walking, and the talent of eyes and hand-he was, oh he was…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull Sengar’s spear exploded in the warrior’s hands. A sword lashed out-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blow to her shoulder had driven Seren Pedac down to her knees, then pitched her sideways-and she saw, there before Silchas Ruin, Trull Sengar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClip, blood streaming down his face, had turned back to pursue Udinaas, who was, crawling, scrabbling towards Kettle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd before her rose a choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr Udinaas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, alas, Seren Pedac was never good with choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her hands she sent the stone spear skittering towards Trull Sengar-even as his own weapon shattered into pieces. And, tearing the dagger from her shoulder, she renewed her Mockra assault on Clip-staggering the bastard once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the sword swung to take Trull in the side of his head, he dropped down, then rolled to evade the second weapon that chopped down. He wasn’t fast enough. The edge slammed deep into his right hip, stuck fast in solid bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull took hold of the Betrayer’s forearm and pulled as he twisted-the pain as he sought to trap that embedded sword momentarily blinded him, filling his skull with white fire-and against the other sword he could do nothing-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Betrayer, pulled slightly off balance, took a step to the side to right himself-onto the shaft of the stone spear which promptly rolled beneath his weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd down he went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull saw the spear, reached for it. Closed both hands about the shaft, then, still lying on his side, one of the singing swords pinned beneath him-the Betrayer’s arm stretched out as he sought to maintain his grip-Trull drove the butt end of the spear into his opponent’s midsection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePunching all the air from his lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plunged backward, rolled, and the sword under Trull slapped down as the Betrayer’s hand involuntarily released it. And Trull pounded a hand down on the weapon, dislodging it from the bone of his hip. The white fire remained in his mind, even as he forced himself onto his knees, then upward. The leg beneath the wound refused to obey him and he snarled in sudden rage, willing himself into a standing position-then, leg dragging, he closed in on the Betrayer-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac-all her efforts at incinerating Clip’s brain failing-shrank back as the now grinning Tiste Andii, abandoning his hunt for Udinaas, turned about and advanced on her, drawing out knife and rapier. Crimson teeth, crimson streaks from his eyes like tears-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, impossibly, Trull Sengar hurt Silchas Ruin-drove the White Crow onto his back where his head snapped back to crunch against the floor, stunning him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Clip turned, saw, and raced in a low blur towards Trull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeeting a spear that lashed out. Clip parried it at the last moment, surprise on his features, and he skidded to a halt, and was suddenly fighting for his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst a crippled Tiste Edur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho drove him back a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWounds blossomed on Clip. Left arm. Across the ribs on the right side. Laying open his right cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a sudden, appallingly fast-shifting attack, Trull Sengar reversed the spear and the stone shaft cracked hard into Clip’s right forearm, breaking it. Another crack, dislocating the right shoulder-and the knife spun away. Third time, this one on the upper left thigh, hard enough to splinter the femur. A final one, against Clip’s left temple-a spray of blood, the head rocking to one side, the body collapsing utterly beneath it. Rapier clunking from a senseless hand. And Trull then whirled back to Silchas Ruin-But his wounded leg failed him and he fell-Seren heard his curse like a sharp retort- \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-417.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
