The young man who pushed it stood in obvious awe of Gallow. His eyes took in every move his boss made and his hands shook as they distributed the dishes on a small folding table. He served the steaming food into bowls and Keel smelled the delicious tang of fish stew. When the steward finished laying out the bread and a small cake dessert he picked up a small dish of his own and spooned a taste of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, Keel thought, Gallow\u0027s afraid he\u0027s going to be poisoned. He was glad to see the orderly delicately taste Keel\u0027s portions, as well. Things are not going quite as Gallow would like us to believe. Keel couldn\u0027t let the moment pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you taste to educate your palate?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orderly shot a quizzical look at Gallow and Gallow smiled back. \"All men in power have enemies,\" he said. \"Even yourself, I\u0027m told.

It shattered. One shard of it skidded up to Keel\u0027s foot and spun there like an eccentric top winding down. Gallow dismissed the orderly with a sharp chop of his hand. The hatch closed quietly behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGallow threw down his spoon. It caught the edge of his bowl and splattered Keel with stew. Gallow dabbed at Keel\u0027s tunic with his cloth, leaning across the rickety table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My apologies, Mr. Justice,\" he said. \"I\u0027m generally not so boorish.

Eating causes pain, and the food merely passes undigested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGallow pushed himself back from the squat table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not catching, Mr. Gallow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A defect,\" Keel said. \"Our bioengineers helped me up to this point, but now the Greater Committee takes matters out of our hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Greater Committee?\" Gallow asked. \"You mean that there is a group topside more powerful than yours? A secret clan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel laughed, and the laugh added frustration and confusion to Gallow\u0027s otherwise perfect face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Greater Committee goes by many names,\" Keel said. \"They are a subversive bunch, indeed. Some call them Ship, some call them Jesus - not the Jesus Lewis of your school-day histories. This is a difficult committee to confront, as you can see.

He extricated himself from the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case,\" Gallow announced, \"if you want to save those kids, you\u0027ll do exactly as I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... it comes to pass that the same evils and inconveniences take place in all ages of history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Niccolo Machiavelli, Discourses, Shiprecords\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his position at the foil\u0027s controls, Brett watched the late afternoon sun kindle a glow in the cloud bank ahead of him. The foil drove easily across deep storm swells, picking up speed on each downslope, losing a bit on each advancing wave. It was a rhythm that Brett had come to understand without conscious attention. His body and senses adjusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gray wall of rain skulked a couple of hundred meters above the wavetops to the right. A line storm, it appeared to be rolling away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett, his attention divided between the course monitor above him and the seas ahead, abruptly throttled back. The foil dropped off its step and moved with minimal headway beside a kelp bed that stretched away into the storm track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe change in motion aroused the others, who, except for Bushka and the captive Merman, whom Bushka had locked in the cargo bay with the survivors of the LTA, were sprawled around the cabin catching what rest they could. Bushka sat in regal isolation on the couch at the rear of the cabin, his eyes oddly indrawn, his face a mask of concentration as he stroked a fragment of kelp that lay across his lap. The bit of kelp had come up from the sea on Twisp\u0027s rescue line and had attracted little attention until Bushka plucked it off and kept it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanille spoke from the copilot\u0027s seat as he came abruptly alert. \"Something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett indicated the green glow of their position on the course monitor. \"We\u0027re only a couple of klicks out.\" He pointed at the line squall. \"The outpost is in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp spoke from behind them: \"Bushka, you still going through with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no choice.\" Bushka\u0027s voice carried a distant tone. He stroked the fragment of kelp, which had begun to dry and crisp. It rasped under his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp nodded at the net of weapons Bushka had taken from the LTA survivors. \"Then maybe we all better be armed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking on it,\" Bushka said. Again, his hand rasped across the drying kelp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Panille,\" Twisp said, \"how are outposts defended?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi, seated on the deck across from Twisp, answered for him. \"Outposts aren\u0027t expected to need defenses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have the usual sonar, perimeter alarms against dashers, that sort of thing,\" Panille said. \"Each outpost has at least one LTA for weather observation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what weapons?\" Twisp asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tools, mostly,\" Scudi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka nudged the netful of captured weapons at his feet. \"They will have lasguns. Gallow arms his people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they\u0027d be effective only inside the outpost compound,\" Panille said. \"We\u0027re safe in the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is why I stopped here,\" Brett said. \"Do you think they know we\u0027re here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They know,\" Bushka said. \"They just don\u0027t know who we are.\" He peeled the dried kelp from his dive suit and dropped it to the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi stood and moved to Brett\u0027s side, resting an arm on the back of his seat. \"They will have welders, plasteel cutters, some stunshields, knives, pry-bars. Tools are very effective weapons.\" She looked at Bushka. \"As Guemes should have taught us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanille swiveled and looked at the passage that led back to the cargo compartment. \"Some of those people back there might know some details about what we can expect down there -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is stupid!\" Brett said. \"What can we do against Gallow and all his men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will wait for nightfall,\" Bushka said. \"Darkness is a great equalizer.\" He looked at Scudi. \"You say you\u0027ve worked at this outpost. You can draw up a plan of the access hatches, the power station, tool storage, vehicle bays ... that sort of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi looked at Brett, who shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp glanced once at the lasgun in Bushka\u0027s hand, then at his face. \"You really mean for us to attack them, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unarmed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will have the inestimable arm of surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp let out a barking laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me talk to Kareen,\" Panille said. \"She can\u0027t be one of them. She may have learned -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not to be trusted,\" Bushka said. \"She belonged to Ryan Wang when he was alive, and now she belongs to Gallow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she doesn\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Men are so easily manipulated by sex,\" Bushka sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanille\u0027s dark face darkened further with anger, but he held his silence for a blink. Then: \"The kelp! The kelp can tell us what we need to know!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not trust the kelp, either,\" Bushka said. \"Every sentient thing in this universe thinks of itself first. We don\u0027t know what the kelp fears or desires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanille glanced at the bit of dried kelp on the deck. \"Scudi, what do you say about the kelp? You\u0027ve worked in and around it more than any of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is Ryan Wang\u0027s daughter!\" Bushka blared. \"You ask the enemy for advice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ask where I might get an answer,\" Panille said. \"And if you\u0027re not going to use that lasgun, quit waving it around.\" He turned from a flabbergasted Bushka to Scudi. \"What\u0027s the kelp\u0027s range, from your experience?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worldwide,\" she said, \"and almost instantaneous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That fast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi shrugged. \"And what it learns, it never forgets.\" She noted the look of surprise on Panille\u0027s face and went on. \"We\u0027ve made reports. Most supervisors don\u0027t go out there, so they write this off to narcosis and keep us out of deep water for a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else might help us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are weak spots,\" Scudi said. \"Immature kelp is strictly a conductor. Mature kelp carries a presence all its own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Twisp asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I touch a young patch of kelp and you touch a mature one, we sense each other. But now ... it is doing something more.

But they have open land at the center. They could shelter a lot more people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett turned to Bushka. \"Does Gallow have three hundred people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka nodded. \"More.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we can\u0027t confront them,\" Twisp said. \"This is crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to kill Gallow,\" Bushka said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" Twisp demanded. \"That\u0027s all? Then they\u0027ll quit and go home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka would not meet Twisp\u0027s gaze. \"All right,\" he said with a flick of the weapon, \"let\u0027s see what Kareen Ale has to say. Put the foil on autopilot, Brett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Autopilot?\" Brett asked. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re all going back to see Kareen,\" Bushka said. \"Everybody move easily, no sudden surprises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one argued with those jumpy, glittering eyes. Brett and Scudi led the way through the hatch and down the passageway. At the cargo hatch Bushka motioned Twisp to the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open the exterior hatch first,\" he ordered. \"We might want to throw something overboard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, reluctantly, Twisp obeyed. A fresh breeze tasting of iodine and salt ricocheted through the hatchway. Wave-slaps against the hull were loud in the passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open the cargo hatch and stand aside,\" Bushka said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp lifted the security bar, released the latch and slid the hatch to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout warning, Brett was knocked down by something wet and ropy coming from behind him. A large strand of kelp snaked past him, swerved left and slammed the LTA\u0027s survivors against the bulkhead. It held them there. The thumpings of the kelp turned the passageway into a great drum. Brett snatched a grab, caught his balance and saw the rapt features of Iz Bushka, who was held in loops of kelp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka stood with both arms upraised, the lasgun still clutched in his right fist. Strands of kelp caressed his body, their leaves particularly drawn to his face and hands. More strands lay like ropes on the deck, fanned out on both sides. Scudi and the others were not in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA branch of kelp detached itself from the captives and undulated toward Brett. The fronded tip lifted and enclosed Brett\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett heard whistling - the wind against the foil, but enhanced, every tonal component identifiable. He felt his senses amplified - the touch of the deck, other people around him ... many others ... thousands. He sensed Scudi then, as though the kelp gave her to him with her thoughts clear. Bushka was there, an enraptured Bushka drinking from the kelp\u0027s reservoir of memories. A historian\u0027s paradise: firsthand history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi spoke in Brett\u0027s head: \"The rocket is up. They\u0027re on their way to get the hyb tanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett saw it then, a fiery ascent that flamed through the cloud cover and became an orange glow on the gray until it vanished and only the clouds remained. With the vision went a questioning thought, a profound wonder that was not human. The rocket was a wondrous thing of anticipation in this thought. It was a seeking after great surprises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought and the vision vanished. Brett found himself sitting on the deck in the foil\u0027s passage and looking into the cargo bay. Bushka sat there sobbing. The bay behind him was empty. The kelp was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett heard others then and Scudi\u0027s voice came overloud. \"Brett! Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrambled to his feet, turning. Scudi stood there with movements of others behind her, but Brett could focus only on Scudi. \"As long as you\u0027re here, I\u0027m all right,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSymbols are worth a damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Duque Kurz\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19(?)

They stood, each with an arm around the other\u0027s waist, looking out on the lowering gray sky visible through the open hatchway. The foil circled on autopilot in a wide pool of open water surrounded by kelp. The outpost lifted from the sea about ten klicks away - a foam-collared pillar of rock set in a ring of kelp. A kelp-free area surrounded the outpost. The rock appeared to be at least one klick away from this vantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett found himself alarmed by the change in Bushka. What had the kelp done to Bushka there in the cargo bay? And where were the other captive Mermen? Only Ale, Panille and Nakano remained of those rescued from the LTA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp voiced it for all of them: \"What did the kelp do to you, Iz?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka looked down at the net of weapons by his right foot. His gaze passed over the lasguns he had already distributed to the others - to everyone except Nakano. A look of childlike bewilderment swept over Bushka\u0027s face. \"It told me ... it told me ...\" He brightened. \"It told me we must kill Gallow and it showed me how.\" He turned and stared past Ale and Panille at the kelp drifting on the surging waves. A rapt expression came over his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you agreed, Nakano?\" Twisp demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes little difference,\" Nakano said, his voice gruff. \"The kelp wants him dead but he will not be dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp shuddered and looked at Scudi and Brett. \"That\u0027s not what it said to me. How about you, kid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It showed me the launching of the rocket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett closed his eyes. Scudi pressed herself against him, leaning her head into his shoulder. He knew the experience they had shared: thousands of people alive now only in the kelp\u0027s memories. The last agony of the Guemes Islanders was there and everything the dead had ever thought or dreamed. He had heard Scudi exclaiming in his mind: \"Now, I know what it feels like to be a Mute!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi pushed herself a bit away from Brett\u0027s embrace and looked at Twisp. \"The kelp said it\u0027s my friend because I\u0027m one of its teachers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did it say to you, Twisp?\" Brett asked. Brett opened his eyes wide and stared hard at the long-armed fisherman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp inhaled a deep, quick breath and spoke in a sharp voice: \"It just told me about myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It told him he\u0027s a man who thinks for himself and likes to keep his thoughts private,\" Nakano said. \"It told me we\u0027re alike in this. Isn\u0027t that it, Twisp?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More or less.\" Twisp sounded embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It said our kind\u0027s dangerous to leaders who demand blind obedience,\" Nakano said. \"The kelp respects this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There! You see?\" Bushka smiled at them, lifting a lasgun out of the pile of weapons he had taken from the people off the LTA. He balanced the lasgun on his open palm, staring at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanille turned from the hatchway and looked at Bushka. \"You all accept this?\" His voice was flat. He glared at Nakano. \"Only you and Kareen and I are left!\" He jerked his chin toward the hatchway. \"Where are the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled over the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanille turned toward the perimeter of kelp visible in the darkening light. He remembered hurdling the glut of kelp and reaching for Kareen as a giant vine released her. She had grabbed him close and they had clung to each other while cries of fear lifted all around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that instant of kelp-awareness, he had been inundated by Kareen: Gallow\u0027s captive - sent with Nakano to be used as bait in the capture of Dark Panille. She had her loyalty problems, too. Her family, with all its power, wanted a hold on Gallow in case he was victorious. But Kareen loathed Gallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKareen\u0027s fingers had held a painful grip on Panille\u0027s water-frizzed hair while she cried against his neck. Then the kelp had returned ... and touched them once more. They had both felt the kelp\u0027s selective fury, sensed the leaves and vines writhing seaward ... bottomward. Presently, the hatchway had framed a churning gray sea, not a sign there to betray the fact that humans had been removed from the foil ... and drowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was the past. Bushka cleared his throat, breaking Panille\u0027s reverie. \"They were Gallow\u0027s people,\" Bushka said. \"What does it matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nakano was one of Gallow\u0027s people,\" Twisp said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not an easy choice,\" Nakano said. \"Gallow saved my life once. But so did you, Twisp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you go with whoever saved you most recently,\" Twisp said, scorn in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNakano spoke in a curious lilting tone: \"I go with the kelp. There is my immortality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett\u0027s throat went dry. He had heard that tone in Guemes fanatics, the hardest of the hard-core WorShipers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp, obviously having a similar reaction, shook his head from side to side. Nakano did not care who he killed! The kelp justified everything!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gallow wants Vata,\" Bushka said. \"We can\u0027t allow that.\" He passed the lasgun to Nakano, who slipped it into its holster at his thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Bushka\u0027s movement, Twisp put his hand on his own weapon. He did not relax even when Nakano displayed empty hands and smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven of us,\" Twisp said. \"And we\u0027re supposed to attack a place that could have more than three hundred armed people in it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka closed the hatchway before looking at Twisp. \"The kelp told me how to kill Gallow,\" he said. \"Do you doubt the kelp?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re damned right I do!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we are going to do it,\" Bushka said. He pushed past Twisp and went up the passageway toward the pilot cabin. Brett took Scudi\u0027s hand and followed. He could hear the others coming after them, Twisp muttering: \"Stupid, stupid, stupid ...\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-26.html","bookId":2171,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:13 PM"}
