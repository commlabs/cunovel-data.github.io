I had left Blaire upset and it was all Nan’s fucking fault. If she weren’t so damn selfish, I wouldn’t even be here. I needed to tell her that she had to grow up and deal. I was done. I couldn’t keep on doing this. She had to figure this out. I was her crutch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knocked on the door to her hotel room and waited. I’d checked with the doorman and Nan had returned about fifteen minutes ago so I knew she was here. I waited a few minutes then knocked again and got nothing. More damn games. I started pounding on the door harder. “Nannette, open this door,” I called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bellman paused when he saw me beating on Nan’s door. “My sister’s in here and she isn’t answering. I’m worried about her,” I lied. “Could you open the door?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man still didn’t look too sure about me. I could tell by the look on his face he was close to calling security. Nan would love that. I reached in my back pocket and pulled out my wallet. “Check my license. I’m Rush Finlay. My sister Nannette is in that room. Having me escorted out is a really bad idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes sir,” the bellman replied. He had recognized my last name. In LA that happened a hell of a lot more than it did in Florida.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the door opened and I was stalking inside the suite getting ready to yell at Nan for being a child when I saw her crumpled body on the sofa. She was lying there in an unnatural position. I ran over to her and felt for a pulse to find a weak one against my fingers. I wanted to weep from relief. “I need paramedics, NOW,” I roared as the bellman stood at the door gaping at Nan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir,” he replied and took the phone from his waist and started telling whoever was on the other end exactly what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you do, Nan?” I asked as my heart slammed painfully against my chest. My throat was tight and I couldn’t get a deep breath. I hadn’t believed her. I had thought she was trying to get attention. I’d become like everyone else in her life. I had ignored her. I was a horrible brother. I held her against my chest as my phone vibrated in my pocket. I pulled it out, saw Harlow’s name on the screen and tossed it aside. I wasn’t in the mood to talk to Harlow. She was part of what tormented Nan. I didn’t have anything to say to her at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rocked her in my arms gently. This was Kiro’s fault. He’d pay for this. If something happened to her he’d pay for this. “I have you Nan. I won’t leave you but you can’t leave me,” I whispered as we waited for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like forever before I heard feet pounding down the hall and the doorman say, “In here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree paramedics came rushing into the room and I handed Nan over to them. They began checking her vitals as I stood there and watched helplessly. I heard my phone ring from where I’d tossed it on the floor. I should get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s taken something. Do you know what it is?” one of the men asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I just got here,” I replied, numb. She’d overdosed. Holy shit. I ran to the bathroom and found two empty prescription bottles in the sink. Too many pain killers. “FUCK!” I roared. A paramedic was beside me taking the bottles from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to get her stomach pumped. Are you family?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brother,” I managed to get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll do. Let’s get her out of here. You can ride in the ambulance,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched in a daze of disbelief as they put Nan’s unresponsive body on a stretcher and began carrying her out of the room. I followed. My phone rang in the distance but I left it. Right now I had to save my sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix hours later I sat beside Nan’s hospital bed. She hadn’t woken up yet but the doctors said they thought she’d have a full recovery. Apparently, I’d found her in time. She’d just passed out from the pills when I’d arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t have my phone and I needed to call Blaire. She’d be worried about me by now. I hadn’t been ready to talk to her just yet. This wasn’t Blaire’s fault but I had been too sensitive to talk to anyone. I had needed them to tell me Nan would live before I could think about anyone or anything else. Now, I felt guilty for not calling Blaire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving my phone at Nan’s hotel hadn’t been smart. I had just been in a state of shock and nothing made sense at the time. I was going to get Nan some help and then I was getting Blaire out of LA and back to Rosemary. I needed to call my mother. She should be dealing with this. Not me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiro wasn’t going to do anything about it. Nan wanted something she would never have. It was time she let it go. A nurse opened the door and walked in. I looked up at her and decided it was time I gave up trying to be everything to Nan because I sucked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to speak with the doctor. When she is ready I want her admitted into a facility that will help her get a grip on things. She needs help I can’t give her,” I said aloud for the first time in my life. I was admitting I’d failed my little sister. Instead of feeling guilty, I felt a huge burden lift from my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doctor Jones will be in shortly. He’ll want to admit her as well. She does need help; I’m glad you’re in agreement. That always makes these things easier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing about this would be easy but it was what was best for everyone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-too-far-too-far-3/page-21.html","bookId":1995,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:37 AM"}
