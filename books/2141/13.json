Led by Obould-who-was-Gruumsh and anchored by a horde of frost giants greater than any that had been assembled in centuries, the orc swarm trampled the brush and sent the animals small and large fleeing before it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in tendays, King Obould Many-Arrows met up with his son, Urlgen, in a sheltered ravine north of the sloping battleground where the dwarves had entrenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrlgen entered the meeting full of fury, ready to demand more troops so that he could push the dwarves over the cliff and back into their holes. Fearing that Obould and Gerti would blame him for his lack of a definitive victory, Urlgen was ready to go on the offensive, to chastise his father for not giving him enough force to unseat the dwarves from the high ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he entered his father\u0027s tent, though, the younger ore\u0027s bluster melted away in confusion. For he knew, upon his very first glance, that the brutish leader sitting before him was not his father as he had known him, but was something more. Something greater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shaman that Urlgen did not know sat in place before, below, and to the side of Obould, dressed in a feathered headdress and a bright red robe. To the side, against the left-hand edge of the tent, sat Gerti Orelsdottr, and she seemed to the younger orc leader not so pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly though, Urlgen focused on Obould, for the brash young orc was barely able to take his eyes off his father, off the bulging muscles of the intense ore\u0027s powerful arms, or the fierce set of Obould\u0027s face, seeming on the verge of an explosion. That was not so uncommon a thing with Obould, but Urlgen understood that the danger of Obould was somehow greater than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have not pushed them back into Mithral Hall,\" Obould stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrlgen could not tell if the statement was meant as a mere recitation of the obvious or an indictment of his leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are a difficult foe,\" Urlgen admitted. \"They reached the high ground before we caught up to them and immediately set about preparing their defenses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And those defenses are now entrenched?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Urlgen said with some confidence. \"We have struck at them too often. They continue to work, but with arms weary from battle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then strike at them again, and again after that,\" Obould demanded, coming forward suddenly and powerfully. \"Let them die of exhaustion if not at the end of an orc spear. Let them grow so weary of battle that they retreat to their dark hole!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need more warriors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need nothing more!\" Obould screamed right back at Urlgen, and he came right out of his seat then and put his face just an inch from his son\u0027s. \"Fight them and stab them! Crush them and grind them into the stone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrlgen tried hard to match his father\u0027s stare, but to no avail, for more than anger was driving the younger orc then. Obould had marched in with a force ten times the size of his own, and with a horde of giants beside him. One concentrated attack would force the dwarves into complete retreat, would chase them all the way back into Mithral Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I go east,\" Obould announced. \"To seal the dwarves\u0027 gate along the Sur-brin and chase them underground. There I will meet with the troll Proffit, who has overrun Nesme, and I will arrange for him to begin the underground press upon our dwarf enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us close this western gate first,\" Urlgen suggested, but his father was snarling and shouting \"No!\" before he ever finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Obould repeated. \"It will not be enough to let these smelly dwarves run back into Mithral Hall. Not anymore. They have chosen to stand against us, and so they will die! You must hold them and batter at them. Keep them in place, but keep them weary. I return soon, and we will see to the end of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have lost hundreds,\" Urlgen protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you have hundreds more to lose,\" Obould calmly replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My warriors will break rank and flee,\" Urlgen insisted. \"They splash through the blood of their kin. They climb over orc bodies to get to the dwarves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould let out a long, extended growl. He reached up and grasped Urlgen by the front of his tunic. Urlgen grabbed Obould\u0027s hand with both of his own, and tried to twist free, but with a flick of his wrist, Obould sent his startled son flying across the room to crash down by the flap of the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will not dare flee,\" Obould insisted. He turned to the red-robed shaman as he spoke. \"They will see the glory of Obould.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obould is Gruumsh!\u0027 Arganth Snarrl insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrlgen stared incredulously at his father, stunned by the sheer strength of Obould and the sheer intensity in his simmering yellow eyes. A glance to Gerti showed Urlgen that she was horrified by the display and similarly frustrated. Most of all, Urlgen recognized that frustration, and only then did it occur to him that Gerti had not said a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerti Orelsdottr, the daughter of the great Jarl Greyhand, who had always held the upper hand in all dealings with the orcs, had not said a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a great yawning river, the swarm of King Obould\u0027s orcs began their pivot and deliberate flow out to the east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrlgen Threefist, stung and afraid, watched the turn and march from a high ridge at the back of his own forces. His father had reinforced him, but with nothing substantial. Enough to hold on, enough to keep the dwarves under pressure, but not enough to dislodge them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor suddenly King Obould didn\u0027t want to dislodge them. His reasoning had seemed sound - keep the dwarves fighting and separated so that they could completely cut them off and kill as many as possible before Mithral Hall\u0027s western door banged closed - but Urlgen could not dismiss the feeling that part of the delaying tactic was for no better reason than to push the credit for success squarely off of Urlgen\u0027s shoulders and squarely onto Obould\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA noise from behind and below turned Urlgen from his contemplations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feared you would not come,\" the orc said to Gerti as the giantess climbed up to stand just below him, which put her face level with his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it not I who asked you to come out here at this time?\" the giantess replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrlgen bit back a sharp retort, for he still had not reconciled within himself the value of any dialogue with Gerti, whom he hated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have come to fear my father,\" the orc did say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you state any differently?\" Gerti asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has grown,\" Urlgen admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obould seeks to dominate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"King Obould,\" Urlgen corrected. \"You would ask me to help the giants prevent the rise of the orcs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not of the orcs,\" Gerti clarified. \"I would ask you, for the sake of Urlgen and not of Gerti, to check the rise of King Obould. Where will Urlgen fit in under the god-figure that Obould is fast becoming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn light of the weight of that question, Urlgen didn\u0027t question Gerti\u0027s omission of his father\u0027s title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will Urlgen find any credit and glory?\" Gerti asked. \"Or will he serve as convenient scapegoat at the first sign of disaster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrlgen\u0027s lip curled in a snarl, and as much as he wanted to lash out at the giantess (though of course he would never dare do anything of the sort!), his anger came more from the fact that Gerti\u0027s reasoning was sound than from the obvious insult to him. Obould was holding him from gaining a great victory there and, but should he fail, Urlgen held no doubts of the severity of his powerful father\u0027s judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you need from me?\" Gerti surprised him by asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrlgen glanced back at the marching thousands, then turned to Gerti once more, staring at her curiously, trying to read the message behind her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the time comes to destroy the dwarves before you, you wish to make certain that the orcs praise Urlgen,\" Gerti reasoned. \"I will help you to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrlgen narrowed his eyes but was nodding despite his cynicism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that the orcs praise Gerti,\" he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we share in Obould\u0027s glory, we will help ensure that we do not suffer all the blame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made sense, of course, but to Urlgen, it all seemed so surreal. He had never been close to Gerti in any form. He had often argued with his father against even enlisting the giants as allies. And for her part, Urlgen understood that Gerti despised him even more than she hated Obould and the other orcs. To Gerti, Urlgen had never been anything more than a wretch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, there they were, sharing plans behind the back of Obould.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrlgen led Gerti\u0027s gaze to the south, to the steeply rising ground and the distant dwarven encampment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need giants,\" he said. \"To secure my lines and throw huge stones!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The high ground gives the dwarves the advantage of range,\" Gerti replied. \"I will not see the orc bodies covered by those of my kin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what do you offer?\" Urlgen asked, growing more and more frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerti and Urlgen both scanned the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" the giantess said, pointing to the high ridge far to the west. \"From there, my kin will be out of the dwarves\u0027 range and on ground as high as that of our enemies. My kin will serve as your flank and your artillery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A long throw for a giant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not for a giant-sized catapult,\" said Gerti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are tunnels beneath the ridge,\" Urlgen explained. \"The dwarves have taken them and secured them. It will be difficult to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As difficult as arguing your cause when your father declares that you have failed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat straightened Urlgen, and straightened his thinking as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the ridge, and I will give you the warriors to secure it and to strike out against the dwarves, for the glory of us both,\" Gerti promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No easy task.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerti led Urlgen\u0027s gaze back up the slope, to the piles and piles of orc bodies rotting in the morning sun, letting the implication speak for itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bash! They\u0027re fightin\u0027 again, and we\u0027re stuck here watching!\" the old dwarf Shingles McRuff grumbled to Torgar Hammerstriker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar moved to the opening in the ridge\u0027s eastern wall, overlooking the mountain slope that had served as battlefield for so many days. Sure enough, the charge was on again in full, with orcs and goblins running up the steep ascent, howling and hooting with every stride. A look back to the south told the dwarf that his kin were ready to meet that charge, their formations already composing, Catti-brie\u0027s devastating bow already sending lines of sizzling arrows streaming out at the oncoming horde. Every now and then, there came a small explosion among the front ranks of the charging orcs, and Torgar smiled, knowing that Ivan Bouldershoulder had put that clever hand crossbow of his to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he held all confidence that Banak and the others would stave off the assault, Torgar was soon chewing his lower lip with frustration that he and half the dwarves of Mirabar could not stand beside them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were needing us here,\" Shingles reminded Torgar, and he dropped his hand hard onto Torgar\u0027s strong shoulder. \"We\u0027re serving King Bruenor well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In holding tunnels that ain\u0027t getting attacked,\" Torgar muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words had hardly left his mouth when shouts echoed back at him and Shingles from the deeper tunnels to the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orcs!\" came the cry. \"Orcs in the tunnels!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShingles and Torgar turned wide-eyed expressions at each other, both fast shifting into snarling battle rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orcs,\" they muttered together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orcs!\" Shingles echoed loudly, for the benefit of all those dwarves nearby, particularly those back toward the southern entrance. \"Get yer axes up, boys. We got orcs to kill!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith energy, enthusiasm, and even glee, the dwarves of Mirabar set off to predetermined positions to support those farther to the north, where, they learned almost immediately from ringing steel and cries of rage and pain, the battle had already been joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar barked out orders with every stride, reminders that he knew he really didn\u0027t have to offer to his disciplined warriors. The Mirabarran dwarves understood their places, for in the days they had been in the tunnels, they had come to know every turn in every corridor and every chamber where defenses could be, and had been, set. Still, Torgar barked reminders, and he told them to fight for the glory of Bruenor Battlehammer and Mithral Hall, their new king, their new home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar had set the defenses purposefully, designing them with every intent that he and Shingles would not be left out of the fighting. The pair rushed down one descending corridor and came out onto a ledge overlooking an oval-shaped chamber, and below they found their first orcs, engaged with a force of more than a dozen Mirabarran dwarves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardly slowing, Torgar leaped from the ledge, crashing in hard among the orc ranks, bringing a pair down beside him. He was up on his feet in an instant, his axe sweeping back and forth - but in control. Shingles was airborne by that time, along with several others who had followed the pair to that room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose dwarves up front pressed on more forcefully with the arrival of the reinforcements, hacking their way through orcs as they tried to link up with Torgar and the others. Almost immediately, the battle turned in favor of the dwarves. Orcs fell and orcs tried to flee, but they were held up by their stubborn kin trying to filter out of the tunnel and join in the fray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill enough and they\u0027ll run off!\" Torgar roared, and of course, that was indeed the expectation when fighting orcs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany minutes later and with the floor covered in orc blood, the dwarves had reached the tunnel entrance, driving back the invaders. With Torgar centering them, the dwarves formed an arc around the narrow opening, so that many weapons could be brought to bear against any orc that stepped through. Surprisingly, though, the orcs still came through, one after another, taking hits and climbing over the fast-piling bodies of their fallen kin. On and on they came, and five orcs fell for every dwarf that was forced back with wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn stubborn lot!\" Shingles cried at Torgar\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe accentuated his shout with a smash of his hammer that laid yet another brute low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too stubborn,\" Torgar replied - quietly, though, and under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t want the others to take note of his alarm. Torgar could hardly believe that orcs were still squeezing out of that tunnel. Every other one never even got a single step back into the room before being chopped down, but still they came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCries echoing from the tunnels near to them told Torgar that it was not a unique occurrence in that particular battle, that his boys were being hard-pressed at every turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore minutes passed, and more orcs crowded into the room, and more orcs died on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar glanced back at the ledge, where an appointed dwarf was waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Position two!\" he cried to the young scout and the dwarf ran off, shouting the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye heard him!\" Shingles cried to the others in the room. \"Tighten it up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he finished, Shingles spun around a large rock that had been set in place at the side of the tunnel entrance, bracing his back against the unsteady stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On yer call!\" Shingles cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar pressed his attack on the nearest orc, shifting as he swung so that he could directly confront the next creature as it tried to come out of the tunnel. Behind him, his boys went into a frenzy, finishing those in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he thought the door temporarily secured, Torgar shouted, \"Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA great heave by Shingles sent the rock falling across the door, and Torgar had to scamper back to avoid getting clipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go! Go! Go!\" Shingles cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarves gathered up their wounded and dead and retreated fast to the opposite end of the room and out to the south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore they could get through that other door, though, the orcs had already breached the makeshift barricade and a pair of spears arced out, one scoring a hit on poor Shingles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, me bum!\" he cried, grabbing at the shaft that was protruding from his right buttock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he already had one unconscious dwarf over his other shoulder, Torgar hooked his dearest friend under the arm and pulled him along, out of the room and down the southern tunnel, where a series of stone drops had been set in place to slow any pursuit in just such a situation. All across the tunnel complex beneath the western ridge, the dwarves were forced into organized retreats, but they had been in the tunnels for several days and that was more than any dwarves ever needed to prepare a proper defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar was back in battle soon enough, and even a limping Shingles returned to his side, hammer swinging with abandon. They and a handful of other dwarves had made a stand in a stalagmite-filled room that sloped up to the south behind them. Figuring to make the orcs pay for every foot of ground across the wide chamber, the dwarves battled furiously, and again, the orc blood began to flow and the orc bodies began to pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still the stubborn creatures came on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn stupid lot!\" Shingles cried out yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar didn\u0027t bother replying to the obvious or to the hidden message of his friend. They were beginning to catch on that the orcs meant to take the tunnels, whatever the cost. That troublesome thought only gained even more credence a few moments later when another group of dwarves unexpectedly crashed into the room from a western corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Giants!\" they cried before Torgar could even ask them why they had abandoned the organized retreat that would have had them bypassing that chamber altogether. \"Giants in the tunnels!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Giants?\" Shingles echoed. \"Too low for giants!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarves charged across and launched themselves into the fray, slaughtering the orcs that stood between them and Torgar\u0027s group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Giants!\" one insisted when he came up before the leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar didn\u0027t question him, for in looking over his shoulder, the dwarf leader saw the truth of the words in the form of a giant, a giantess actually, crouching, even crawling in places, to arrive at the entrance of the western corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get that one!\" Torgar demanded, eager to claim that greater prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis boys rushed past him, and past those who had just entered, lifting warhammers to throw and ignoring the warning cries of their newly arrived companions to stay back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen hammers went spinning across the expanse, and every throw seemed true - until the missile neared the pale, bluish-skinned creature and simply veered away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Magic?\" Torgar whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost as if she had heard him, almost as if she was mocking him, the giantess smiled wickedly and waggled her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar\u0027s boys began their charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they were stumbling, slipping, and blinded, as a sudden burst of sleet filled the room, slicking up the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close ranks!\" Torgar shouted above the din of the magical storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bright burst of fire appeared, reaching down from the chamber\u0027s ceiling and immolating a trio of dwarves who were trying to do just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run away!\" yelled Shingles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Torgar muttered, and with rage burning in his eyes almost as brightly as the magical fire of the giantess, the refugee from Mirabar stalked through the sleet at the kneeling behemoth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him, her eyes blazing with hatred, and she began to mutter yet another spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar increased his stride into a run and lifted his axe. He roared above the din, denying the storm, denying his fear, denying all the magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo strides away, he threw himself forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was hit by wracking pains, by a sudden, inexplicable magical grasp that closed upon his heart and stiffened him in midflight. He tried to bring his arms forward to strike with his axe, but they wouldn\u0027t move to his call. He could not get past that burst of agony, that grasp of ultimate pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar smashed into the giantess, who didn\u0027t move an inch, and he bounced away. He tried to hold his balance for just a moment, but his legs were as useless as his arms. Torgar fell back several stumbling steps. He stared at the giantess curiously, incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he fell over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, dwarves swarmed into the room, crying for their leader, bend-ing their backs against the continuing sleet, and Gerti (for it was indeed Gerti herself who had entered the fray), her most powerful enchantments spent, wisely retreated, covering her departure by launching a host of orcs into the fray behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the pain in his rump, ignoring the fresh flow of blood down the back of his leg and the new wounds, Shingles scrambled to Torgar\u0027s side. He slapped Torgar hard across the face and shouted for him to wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasping, Torgar did manage to look at his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurts,\" he whispered. \"By Moradin, she\u0027s crushed me heart!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah, but yer heart\u0027s stone,\" Shingles growled at him. \"So quit yer whinin\u0027!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, Shingles hoisted Torgar over his shoulder and started back the other way, determinedly and carefully putting one foot in front of the other as he struggled up the icy slope with his dear friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did get out of the room and out of many more, and while the fighting raged outside, the dwarves from Mirabar battled and battled for every inch of ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut stubborn indeed were the orcs, and willing to lose ten-to-one against their enemies. By the sheer weight of numbers, they gained ground, corridor to corridor and room to room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack near the southern end of the tunnel complex, Shingles reluctantly ordered the last and most definitive ceiling drops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told all his boys, even the wounded, \"Ye dig in and be ready to die for the honor o\u0027 Mithral Hall. They took us in as brothers, and we\u0027ll not fail them Battlehammers now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cheer went up around him, but he could hear the shallowness of it. For nearly a third of their four hundred were down, including Torgar, their heart and soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dwarves did as Shingles ordered, without a word of complaint. The last ground in the tunnels, the first ground they had claimed in entering the complex, was the best prepared of all, and if the orcs meant to push them back out the exits near to the cliff overlooking Keeper\u0027s Dale, they were going to lose hundreds in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarves dug in and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey propped those with torn legs against secure backing and gave them lighter weapons to swing, and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wrapped their more garish wounds without complaint, some even tying weapons to broken hands, and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey kissed their dead good-bye and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the orcs, with three quarters of the ridge complex conquered, did not come on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The most stubborn they been yet,\" Banak observed when the orcs and goblins finally turned and retreated down the slope. For more than an hour they had come on, throwing themselves into the fray with abandon, and the last battle piled more orc and goblin bodies on the blood-slicked slope than all the previous fights combined. And through it all, the dwarves had held tight to their formations and tight to their defensible positions, and never once had the orcs seemed on the verge of victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still they had come on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stubborn? Or stupid?\" Tred McKnuckles replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid,\" Ivan Bouldershoulder decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brother added, \"Hee hee h - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel\u0027s laugh was cut short, and Banak\u0027s response did not get past his lips, for only then did they see the very telling movement in the west of Torgar\u0027s retreat, only then did they see the lines of wounded dwarves streaming out of the tunnels, those able enough carrying dead kin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By Moradin,\" Banak breathed, realizing then that the huge battle on the open slopes had been nothing more than a ruse designed to prevent reinforcements from flocking to Torgar\u0027s ranks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanak squinted, a prolonged wince, as the lines of limping wounded and borne dead continued to stream out from the southern entrance of the complex. Those dwarves had just joined Mithral Hall - most of them had never even seen the place that had drawn them from the safety of their Mirabar homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The retreat\u0027s organized,\" Ivan Bouldershoulder observed. \"They didn\u0027t get routed, just pushed back, I\u0027m guessin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go find Torgar,\" Banak instructed. \"Or whoever it is that\u0027s in charge. See if he\u0027s needing our help!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an \"Oo oi!\" from Pikel, the Bouldershoulders rushed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTred offered a nod to Banak and ran right behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo others came up to the dwarf leader at just that moment, grim-faced and covered in orc blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the point of it?\" Catti-brie asked, observing the lines. \"They gave so many dead to take the tunnels, but what good are those tunnels to them anyway? None connect to Mithral Hall proper - not even close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they don\u0027t know that,\" said Banak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie didn\u0027t buy it. Something else was going on, she believed, and when she looked at Wulfgar, she could see that he was thinking the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Wulfgar offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got them Bouldershoulders and Tied going to Torgar now,\" Banak told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar shook his head. \"Not going to Torgar,\" he corrected. \"There is nothing in those tunnels worth this to our enemies,\" he added, sweeping his arm out to highlight the sheer carnage about the mountain slopes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanak nodded his agreement but kept his real fear unspoken. It was coming clearer to him and to the others, he knew, why the orcs had so desperately played for those tunnels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar and Catti-brie sprinted away, actually catching and passing by the three dwarves heading to find Torgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going up top,\" Catti-brie explained to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then take me brother!\" Ivan called. \"He\u0027s more help out of doors than in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me brudder!\" shouted Pikel, and he veered from his dwarf companions toward the duo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout complaint, having long before learned to not underestimate and to appreciate the dwarf \"doo-dad,\" Catti-brie and Wulfgar continued along. They got to the southern end of the ridge and began to scale, beside the tunnel entrance from which came the line of wounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re holding!\" one badly injured but still-walking dwarf proudly called to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We never doubted that ye would!\" Catti-brie yelled back, allowing her Dwarvish accent to strike hard into her inflection. In response, the dwarf punched a fist into the air. The movement had him grimacing with pain, though he tried hard not to let it show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar led the way up the rocky incline, his great strength and long legs allowing him to scale the broken wall easily. At every difficult juncture, he stopped and turned, reaching down and easily hoisting Catti-brie up beside him. A couple of points presented a more difficult challenge concerning short Pikel, though, for even lying flat on the stone, Wulfgar couldn\u0027t reach back that low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel merely smiled and waved him back, then went into a series of gyra-tions and chanting, then stopped and stared at the flat stone incline, giggling all the while. The green-bearded dwarf reached forward, his hand going right into the suddenly malleable stone. He reshaped it into one small step after another. Then, giggling still, the dwarf simply walked up beside the two humans and motioned them to move along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top of the ridgeline was broken and uneven but certainly navigable, even with the wind howling across the trio, left to right. Downwind as they were of the western slopes, they actually caught scent of the enemy before ever seeing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fell back behind a high jut and watched as the first frost giant climbed to the ridge top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie put up Taulmaril and took deadly aim, but Pikel grabbed the arrow, shook his hairy head, and waggled the finger of his free hand before her, then pointed out to the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere more giants were coming up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One shot,\" Wulfgar whispered. He grasped Aegis-fang tightly. \"Be running as you let fly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready,\" Catti-brie assured him, and she motioned for Pikel to let go of her arrow, then for him to be off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a porcine squeal, Pikel sprinted out from behind the jut, running full out to the south. The nearest giant howled and pointed and started to give chase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then a streaking arrow hit the behemoth in the chest, staggering him backward, and a spinning warhammer followed the shot, striking in almost exactly the same place. The giant staggered more and tumbled off the western side of the ridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar and Catti-brie heard the roar but didn\u0027t see it, for they were already in a dead run. They caught up to Pikel near to the southern descent, and without a word, Wulfgar merely scooped the dwarf up in his powerful grasp and ran on, hopping from ledge to ledge all the way back to the ground. Soon after they came down, boulders began to skip all around them, and the trio worked hard to help those dwarves still in the area back into the shelter of the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot so far in, they rejoined Ivan and Tred, along with Shingles McRuff and a very shaken Torgar Hammerstriker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Casters,\" Shingles explained to them. \"Giant witch reached out and nearly crushed me friend\u0027s heart!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he finished, he patted Torgar on the shoulder, but gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurts,\" Torgar remarked, his voice barely audible. \"Hurts a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah, ye\u0027re too tough to fall to a simple witch trick,\" Shingles assured his friend, and he started to slap Torgar again, but Torgar held up a hand to deny the blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Giants up above,\" Wulfgar explained to the dwarves. \"We should move in deeper in case they come down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t move south,\" Catti-brie reasoned. \"They wanted the high ground, and so they got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And them orcs ain\u0027t coming on anymore, neither,\" said Shingles. \"We dropped the roof on them, but they could\u0027ve gotten to us by now if they\u0027d wanted to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have what they came for,\" Catti-brie replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced back to the southern exit, and all seemed calm again, the rock shower having ended. Still, Wulfgar and the others gave it some time before daring to exit the tunnel again. The long shadows of twilight greeted them, along with an unsettling quiet that had descended over the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie looked back to the main dwarven force, far to the east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too far for a giant\u0027s throw,\" she said, and she glanced back up at the ridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar started up immediately, and the woman went right behind. Back on the ridge top, even in the deepening gloom of night, they quickly came to understand what the assault had been all about. Far to the north on the ridge, giants were hauling huge logs up the western slope, while others were assembling those logs into gigantic war engines. Catti-brie looked back to the dwarves\u0027 position, with alarm. The distance was too far for a giant\u0027s throw, indeed, but was it too far for the throw of a giant-sized catapult?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, it truly hit the woman just how much trouble they were in. For the orcs to sacrifice so many, for them to allow hundreds of their kin to be slaughtered simply to earn a tactical advantage in the preparation of the battlefield, revealed a level of commitment and cunning far beyond anything the woman had ever seen from the wretched, pig-faced creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bruenor\u0027s often said that the only reason the orcs and goblins didn\u0027t take over the North was that the orcs and goblins were too stupid to fight together,\" the woman whispered to Wulfgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now Bruenor is dead, or soon will be,\" Wulfgar replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grim tone confirmed to Catti-brie that he had come to fathom the situation along similar lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in trouble. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lone-drow-hunter-s-blades-2/page-13.html","bookId":2141,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:51 PM"}
