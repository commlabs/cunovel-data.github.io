I’ll give her a quick call and tell her to pick up enough for five.” He grinned. “I eat as much as two normal people, so she automatically buys two of everything when she’s feeding me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lunch,” Bethanne said sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax nodded reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, Susie arrived about ten minutes later and the men met her in the driveway. Al and Max brought in grocery bags and two six-packs of beer, plus an equal number of sodas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusie was a petite woman who stood a full foot and a half shorter than her husband. She had curly brown hair and big hazel eyes. Clearly she adored Max and welcomed Bethanne with a warm smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t tell you how happy I am to meet you,” she said, rushing inside. “Al and I were so thrilled to hear from Max, we immediately changed our plans and headed for the lake house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne followed Susie into the kitchen and began unpacking groceries, setting the food on the kitchen counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else can I do to help?” Bethanne asked when she’d finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grab those bags over there,” Susie said, pointing to the chips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne was put to work opening bags of potato chips and emptying them into plastic bowls while Susie made a salad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl and Max moved onto the deck, where Al turned on the barbecue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long have you and Max been together?” Susie asked as she sliced tomatoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne peeled a cucumber. “We aren’t exactly together. We only met a few days ago.” Although it felt as though she’d known him for a lot longer…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? Well, you found yourself a gem of a guy. I don’t know what happened to him. Max has never spoken about why he lives the way he does, but it’s obvious there’s some tragedy in his past.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Max hadn’t explained, then Bethanne didn’t feel she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s done so much for others,” Susie went on. “Rooster told us that he helped a handicapped woman in Boston by replacing her roof. And a friend of ours told us about a family who was about to lose their home due to the husband’s unemployment. When the bank threatened to repossess it, Max stepped in and made the late payments.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Max appeared in the kitchen doorway. “What are you two talking about?” he asked suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusie rolled her eyes. “Why do men always assume we’re talking about them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ego,” Bethanne said, and they laughed. If any man didn’t suffer from an outsize ego—in her opinion, anyway—it was Max.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Max, I bought you chocolate ice cream,” Susie said as she arranged silverware on the table on the deck. Smiling at Bethanne, she added, “He’s got a weakness for chocolate ice cream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax snuck up behind Bethanne and slipped his arms around her. “What I have is a weakness for you,” he said, kissing her cheek. He whispered, “Promise me you won’t believe a word these people tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And why is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already told you, Bethanne, I’m no saint.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You make it sound as if you’re ashamed of helping other people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not, but I don’t like to broadcast it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you’re a lone wolf, a drifter who needs no one, riding off into the sunset.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned and muttered, “You making fun of me?” in a mock-ferocious voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne laughed. “Guess so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate hot-off-the-grill cheeseburgers around three o’clock. Bethanne liked his friends. Al and Susie carried the conversation, regaling her with stories about their children. Sherry was the youngest of three, and their problem child, although she’d successfully gone through rehab and had now returned to school. In large part due to Max, as the couple were quick to remind Bethanne. Max scowled every time they mentioned his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne helped with the cleanup and Max suggested they leave close to five. The afternoon had been perfect in every way. Al and his wife both hugged her before she went out to join Max on the Harley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He needs you,” Susie whispered to her. “He’s a lost soul.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne smiled and hugged the other woman back. “I’m so glad I met you and Al.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, too. I hope we’ll see you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the helmet on and climbed onto the bike. As they took off, engine roaring, Bethanne slipped her arms around Max’s middle and relaxed against him. After a while she loosened her grip. Occasionally she even stretched her arms out at her sides, feeling free and unencumbered. She sensed that she was finally getting to know him—that they’d breached some barrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe return to Branson seemed to take far less time than the trip to the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie was sitting in the lobby waiting for Bethanne. “Mom!” she cried. “Where did you go? Why didn’t you answer your phone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did you call?” Her purse had been near her most of the day, but she hadn’t heard her cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Half an hour ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat explained it. “What did you need?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everybody left me,” Annie complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne managed not to sigh—or say something sarcastic. “Where’s Grandma?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s still out with Rooster. They went to see the Oak Ridge Boys. At breakfast I said I didn’t want to go and Rooster jumped at the chance. I haven’t seen them since.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth had gone with Rooster. That was a shock. “You spent the entire day on your own?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie nodded, then shrugged. “I had fun shopping, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s my girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, where were you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax stood beside her and they held hands. “I was with Max.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Annie,” he said, giving her a friendly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, duh, I figured that much,” she told her mother. “Hi,” she muttered grudgingly in Max’s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We went to see some friends of his.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we could all go to dinner tonight,” Bethanne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie didn’t show much enthusiasm. “We’re leaving in the morning, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, and according to your grandmother’s schedule, we’re headed for New Orleans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That sounds great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Max says it’s a real party town. Should be lots of fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More fun than Vegas?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A different kind of fun,” Max said. “I wish I could go, but I’m headed somewhere else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie didn’t look at all disappointed. She glanced at the doors and suddenly her face lit up. “Grandma!” she shouted, jumping to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne turned to see Ruth and Rooster walking into the hotel. “Rooster and I had the most wonderful day,” Ruth said, hurrying toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two shows, one right after the other, and both of them exceptional.” Rooster looked delighted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m ready to get out of Missouri,” Annie announced to anyone who cared to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about dinner?” Bethanne asked once again. “All of us together. Max and Rooster are leaving tomorrow, and so are we.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Count me out on dinner,” Ruth said. “I’m exhausted and we’ve got a full day coming up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go with Grandma,” Annie said, as if she was glad of an excuse to escape. “We’ll just get room service.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You two are on your own,” Rooster said as the three of them strolled over to the elevator a few minutes later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax looked at Bethanne. “Maybe we should say our goodbyes now, as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about a glass of wine?” she suggested instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, then nodded slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found a vacant table in the lounge, and Bethanne studied the wine list. For the first time it felt awkward between them, as though they both feared what would happen next. In the morning they’d go their separate ways, and after that—she didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey each ordered a glass of red wine, an Australian shiraz, which was promptly delivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne gazed down at her wine, hardly noticing its rich ruby color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to be in California next week. I don’t have a choice about that,” Max said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax’s hand closed over hers. “My brother’s handled the business ever since Kate died. It’s time I went back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re really going home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax gave her a lopsided grin. “Luke was beginning to think I was never going to return. A lot has changed in the past three years—in the business, in his life, in mine. I’m ready now, only I didn’t realize it until a few days ago. Until…you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met his gaze and held it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll go on to Florida, and we’ll connect again later this summer. If that’s what you decide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne started to say that was too long to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “No, you need to be with Ruth and Annie, with your son and his bride. With Grant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne opened her mouth to protest, but again he stopped her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make no mistake, I’d welcome the opportunity to explore where this relationship will take us, but I have things I need to attend to and so do you.” His expression was determined. Unwavering. “While you’re in Florida, you and Grant will have the chance to work this out—or not. Until you do, I’ll stay out of your life. I’ll abide by whatever decision you make.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if…what if Grant and I don’t get back together?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then let me know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll come to Seattle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll come wherever you are. Anyplace. Anytime. All you have to do is contact me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded risky to Bethanne, scary, especially when she wasn’t sure of her own mind. She wanted Max to convince her they were meant to be together. He hadn’t. She wanted him to fight for her. He wouldn’t. The decision was hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like this,” she confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bethanne, we’re both high on emotion.” His hand cupped her cheek as if he felt the need to touch her, to hold on to her as long as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey finished their wine, then returned to the front porch and sat in the swing, Max’s arm possessively around her. She rested her head on his shoulder, closing her eyes. She wanted to keep these feelings with her forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of her wanted to argue with him, say she’d already made up her mind. Only she hadn’t. Not really. Twenty years with Grant couldn’t be easily shoved aside or forgotten. Max was right; they were high on emotion, on discovery. What they shared was fresh and new. Their feelings for each other had yet to be tested. All she had were these few days with Max. Seven days that had indelibly marked her. But could it be more than just a memory, significant though that memory was? Should it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax escorted her to her room and kissed her good-night. Bethanne felt an urge to weep—but this time for reasons she understood far too well. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8/page-33.html","bookId":1940,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM"}
