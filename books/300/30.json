PACKARD\u0027S HOME AT RED GULCH.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Mr. Packard\u0027s cattle ranch was located in one of the extensive parks for which Colorado is noted. It included several square miles of territory. The cattleman had erected a dwelling, covering a good deal of ground, but only one story high. While it was comfortable, it was easy to see that it was the home of a bachelor. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had as housekeeper the widow of a herdsman, or perhaps I may say, cowboy, who had died a year before.

His housekeeper was an excellent cook, and his table was well supplied. But the days seemed long without employment.
