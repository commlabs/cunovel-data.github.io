V.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eRemind God of His entire responsibility. \"There is none beside thee to help.\" The odds against Asa were enormous. There was a million of men in arms against him, besides three hundred chariots. It seemed impossible to hold his own against that vast multitude. There were no allies who would come to his help; his only hope, therefore, was in God. It may be that your difficulties have been allowed to come to so alarming a pitch that you may be compelled to renounce all creature aid, to which in lesser trials you have had recourse, and cast yourself back on your Almighty Friend.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePut God between yourself and the foe. To Asa\u0027s faith, Jehovah seemed to stand between the might of Zerah and himself, as one who had no strength. Nor was he mistaken. We are told that the Ethiopians were destroyed before the Lord and before His host, as though celestial combatants flung themselves against the foe in Israel\u0027s behalf, and put the large host to rout, so that Israel had only to follow up and gather the spoil. Our God is Jehovah of hosts, who can summon unexpected reinforcements at any moment to aid His people. Believe that He is there between you and your difficulty, and what baffles you will flee before Him, as clouds before the gale. – F. B. Meyer.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e“When nothing whereon to lean remains,\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen strongholds crumble to dust;\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen nothing is sure but that God still reigns,\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat is just the time to trust.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e“’Tis better to walk by faith than sight.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn this path of yours and mine;\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd the pitch-black night, when there’s no outer light\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIs the time for faith to shine.”\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAbraham believed God, and said to sight, “Stand back!” and to the laws of nature, “Hold your peace!” and to a misgiving heart, “Silence, thou lying temper!” He believed God. – Joseph Parker\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e一月五日\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e“耶和华啊，惟有你能帮助…” （代下十四：11）\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　让我们提醒神，叫祂负完全的责任，“惟有你能帮助…”攻击亚撒的有兵士百万、战车三百。亚撒和犹太人要抵挡古实王的大军似乎是不可能的一回事。没有联盟军队去援助他；所以，他惟一的盼望是神。或许你也有这般可怕的难处逼你放弃你平时所有的依据，而专一投靠全能的神。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　亚撒的信心看见耶和华站在那耀武扬威的谢拉和毫无力量的自己中间。他并没有错误。我们看见古实人果然败在耶和华和祂军队面前，所以犹太人只要跟在祂后面收集掠物就是了。我们的神是万军之耶和华，祂能随时召集援军来拯救祂的子民。相信祂站在你和你的难处中间，无论什么困难都会在祂面前逃跑，如云在疾风面前被吹散一般。━梅尔\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e当堡垒碎成瓦砾，\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e正是你无所依恃，\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e除了神以外，一无可靠\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e这正是信主之时。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e在你我所行这条路口，\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e信心比眼见更可依仗，\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e虽然茫茫夜色黑暗，\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e但是信心能放光亮。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　亚伯拉罕信神，对眼见说：“退去”！对自然的定律说：“不要作声”！对疑惧的心说：“闭口，你这谎言的诱惑者”！祂信神。━帕克约瑟  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/4826.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:37:09 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:37:09 AM"}
