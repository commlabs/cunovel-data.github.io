She glanced behind and saw Victor, standing at the doorway, watching as a group of men dressed in pale Skaladeska clothing tramped through the door and after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina turned back to watch her own footsteps and stumbled to a halt seconds before Gabe did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood at the top of a small hill, and down below them —ten feet or so—was blue-grey water, as far as the eye could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-45-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 14, 2007\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindsor, Ontario\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen looked at her watch. Eleven-fifteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had twenty-five minutes to apprehend the bomber and reconnect with Gabe and Marina Alexander, who were God knew where, and have her translate the code … .and hope that it worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer underarms were soaking wet and her heart drummed so fast in her chest that she thought it was going to erupt from her body like Alien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst things first. She had to do her part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you get him yet?” she bellowed into her cell phone. Thank God she’d had some manpower near the tunnel that went under the Detroit River to Windsor and sent them over immediately. Fortunately, the Windsor police were as dedicated to keeping the peace as she and her people were, and they didn’t start any turf wars or jurisdiction games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was always the chance that their target had moved; but he couldn’t have gone far if he was keeping control of the bombs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s got a green and blue shirt on. Dark hair. He could be in a vehicle, or standing outside. Or in a nearby building.” Stay calm. Follow the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, the Taurus her aide was driving blasted through the Tunnel onto the Canadian side of the river and turned north. Her fingertips were tingling in earnest now; she knew she was close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrging Colin Bergstrom, who’d somehow commandeered driving her car, she pointed in the general direction she knew they needed to go. “Along the river! Go, go, go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at her watch. Eleven-twenty. Jesus-peets, if she made this … ..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop!” she screeched, flipping off her seatbelt so hard it smashed against the window. She was out of the vehicle before it came to a halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanking the Beretta from the holster at her waist, Helen streaked across the road, heedless of the oncoming cars. She’d seen a flash of green and blue under a streetlight, and, by God, she was going to get him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop! I have you covered!” she yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, it felt good to be moving; to be doing something. She ran onto the grass, half-lit by the lamps high above, and hurried after the man who was rapidly disappearing into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t catch him; she couldn’t catch up to him. He was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he hadn’t been carrying anything … so the box, the box that she knew had to be at least twelve inches square, and that he had not been carrying—it had to be around somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellowing into her cell phone, Helen ordered her men to look for the box. “It could be under a park bench. In a car. Anywhere! Grab anything you find that looks suspicious and bring it back.” She sited and selected a landmark that was easily found, even in the dark, and even to agents not familiar with the area, and started running back to the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was almost there when she saw it. A faint gleam of metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen veered to the side, shouting for Colin to follow her back to the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it!” she screamed, recognizing the box as she ran up to it. She was already digging the phone from her pocket and stabbing at the keys to call back Marina Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease let her answer. Please let this go through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreen to the left. She remembered that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEleven-twenty-seven. She looked at Colin, who crouched next to her. His rugged face wore the same intensity, the same worry she knew her own did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease connect. Please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the box, already trying to tear into it. Colin’s thick fingers, surprisingly nimble, pushed and shoved and poked at the box in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Green to the left,” she repeated aloud. What did that mean? “Green to the left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled the phone away from her ear to look at the screen. It was still trying to connect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on. Come on!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, on the bottom, a panel slid away from the box, falling into Colin’s lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtons and dials. They were all there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA green one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Colin—their eyes locked. Holding her breath, Helen turned it to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened. That was good. She heard him expel his breath, heard his murmur, “Good girl.” He looked at her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease! Connect!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen suddenly, it did. The phone was ringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Green to the left,” came a voice over the phone. She was running; moving; Helen could hear it in her breaths. “Blue down … .Red down.” Marina was panting into the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes, come on!” Helen said. “Blue down, red down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Black and white, cross over right—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Helen looked down. There was no black and white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was eleven-twenty-eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-46-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina jammed the phone back into her pocket. She’d given as much as she could from memory of the code before the phone cut out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Gabe were stumbling down a small hillock, toward the water that lapped trustingly below them, knowing their pursuers were on their heels. Hearing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nippy breeze blasted her in the face as she pushed Gabe along the shore. There had to be something … somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Skaladeskas had reached the top of the crest behind them, and Marina’s back itched. She felt as though there should be gunfire raining down on them; but there was not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething else whizzed through the air and thunked into the ground an inch from where her foot had been. An arrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pick it up, Gabe!” she shouted encouragement between snagging breaths. “Toward those rocks over there. I can try to call Helen again then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they ran, she tried to look again at the green sheet so she could spit out the code as soon as she had the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother arrow whizzed by, brushing the top of her hair, and Marina chanced a look back. Some of them stood on the top of the hill, firing; while another group chased them down the hill and along the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater splashed beneath her feet, cold and dark, and Marina veered away from it. Gabe was slowing down again. Bright red blood soaked his shirt, and flung from his arm as he ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Try Helen again,” he said, gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rocks were only a few meters ahead; but what good would they do? A quick duck behind them and their pursuers would reach them in moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Black and white cross right to green,” Marina mumbled. The air she managed to drag into her lungs seared her mouth dry, and burned in her lungs. It was thin, and she suspected too late that they were at a high elevation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then … she saw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mirage? Good Lord, please don’t let it be a mirage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A fucking boat!” Gabe shouted the words before Marina could reconcile it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey kicked up their speed; the boat, a small cruiser, was sitting just beyond the boulders they’d been aiming for. Hidden. As if waiting for such an escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Victor known about the boat? The chance for escape?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina shoved Gabe the last few inches onto the boat and leaped on after. He was already untying its mooring, and she dashed over to the motor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Out of my way. This is mine,” Gabe commanded, and before she could speak, he’d started the motor with a smooth purr. “Call Helen!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d almost forgotten. Pushing buttons frantically, she placed the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulled the green sheet from her pocket again and started to reread it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd realized she’d translated wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot black and white … .orange and yellow. Cross right to left. She read the next line to be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Helen!” Marina yelled into the phone as the boat cruised into the lake. “It’s not black and white. It’s orange and yellow! Cross right to left!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one was on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Helen!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as she waited, listening for that connection over the roar of the boat, she heard, somehow, the faint call of her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, out over the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did he get there? What was he doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was struggling, in the water, his arms raised as he went under. His face glowing white above the dark water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Skaladeskas swarmed along the shore; arrows flying. Marina felt like she was in a medieval war zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gabe!” she shouted, still holding the phone to her ear, still waiting for Helen’s voice. “Look!” She pointed. “Circle around!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to drown. Surely one of the Skaladeskas would pull him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marina!” Gabe shouted at her. “Talk to Helen. We have to get out of here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just one pass. I can’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone connected just as Marina felt the answering swerve of the boat. She shouted into the phone, “Helen! It’s not black and white. It’s orange and yellow. Hear me? Orange and yellow cross right to left.” She looked up and saw Victor slide under the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of the others appeared to notice or to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat wheeled around, and he didn’t come up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina’s heart pounded. She looked at the phone, held it to her ear. Nothing. Nothing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow rose from the water again. Slower. Barely moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina’s palms grew wet with sweat. She looked down into the black water; the cold, black, churning water that was waiting to swallow her. Smother her. She couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease come up. Please don’t make me do this. Dad!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed the button on the phone, held it to her ear, listened to nothing. How much time had elapsed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down over the water again, ignoring Gabe’s shout. It was as if everything stopped, slowed, dissolved away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad or Helen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad or Helen? One man, here … or many men, half a world away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand moved in the water, reaching—she could barely see it—reaching from the inky liquid. Then slid back into the depths. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/siberian-treasure/page-48.html","bookId":2353,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:32 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:32 AM"}
