The weight of his guilt bore down against his heart, crushing the strength right out of him. If it weren\u0027t for his need for revenge and his promise to see Noelle safely through this mess, he didn\u0027t think he\u0027d have the will to keep breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as he wanted to see the Swarm wiped out, he hated the thought of pulling Noelle into the middle of this dangerous mess. What if he wasn\u0027t strong enough to keep her safe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long until we move her, sir? It\u0027s scary as hell to have her sitting around in a place as open as this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonroe leaned back in the office chair that had been brought in as part of his mobile office. One of the bedrooms in the old house had been converted into a work space, containing a computer, printer/fax machine, communications equipment and a closed-circuit TV screen that monitored the room where Noelle was being held. Nothing matched as it was all cast-off furniture from renovated offices, but it functioned, and that was all that mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m waiting on details regarding her transfer now,\" said Monroe. \"There are three facilities fighting over her. I\u0027m waiting for the pissing contest to run out of ammunition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid pulled in a deep breath, trying to convince his , body that he was relaxed rather than ready to strangle someone. \"I want to be assigned to her protection team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonroe nodded his steel gray head. \"You can escort her to her final destination, but after that, we\u0027re going to need you in the field, Captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid hated leaving Noelle alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, not alone, he corrected himself. She\u0027d be guarded 24/7 deep in the bowels of some impenetrable compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafer than she would be with him around. He couldn\u0027t let himself get involved. He couldn\u0027t forget what happened the last time he cared about a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid cursed and slugged back the hot coffee fast enough it didn\u0027t have time to spill. The black liquid burned all the way down, making him feel more alert already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like it\" David admitted, though he wasn\u0027 t specific about exactly which part he didn\u0027t like. Let the colonel figure it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll be fine. And when it\u0027s all over, we can even let you come for a visit, if you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did like, and that was the problem. \"I just want to get this over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonroe gave a whatever-you-want shrug but said nothing about David\u0027s choice. \"I\u0027ll call in and see if there\u0027s any news on where she\u0027s moving. Why don\u0027t you go sit with her and bring her something to eat? It looks like you both could use a decent meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid glanced at the screen, which showed Noelle curled into a ball on the chair with her legs tucked up under her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was covered completely by his jacket but still shaking visibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she\u0027d been sick, they let her clean herself up while someone got rid of the trash can and the photos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought her color had been better when he left the room and that she might actually sleep a little, but it was obvious now that she was a long way from sleeping anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid knew the feeling and felt that selfish need to comfort her again, as if he could make himself feel better by making her feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo little, too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, sure,\" said David, and went to the farmhouse kitchen in search of some food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lock on the door grated, making Noelle jump. She was beginning to dread that door opening. Every time it did, things got worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid came in, carrying a cupboard shelf like a tray. \"You hungry?\" he asked, his eyes roaming over her, covering every inch as if looking for something. She had no idea why he did that every time he came around, but she was a long way from being used to his scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really just want to get out of here. If I never see this room again, it will be too soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can arrange that. Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke quietly to the guards outside the door and led her to a smaller room that must have been a child\u0027s bedroom at one point, judging by the faded Mickey Mouse wallpaper. The floors were bare wood and there was a smaller table set up in here—the old-fashioned drop-leaf style just big enough for two. Even though it was still a prison of sorts, it was much better than the last room, with its stagnant air and recent, but horrible, memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid set down the shelf, revealing several sandwiches, a couple of cans of Coke and a bowl of canned chicken noodle soup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored her statement and popped the top on a Coke. \u0027This should help settle your stomach if it\u0027s still bothering you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle took the drink and sipped. Her stomach did settle some, but she thought it was more due to David being here than the soda. As unnerving as this whole mess was, he was a constant for her. Something in his steady strength and unwavering honesty gave her a slim thread of comfort, which was more than she found from anyone else. \"When can I leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid bit into a sandwich and chewed. \"Soon. You\u0027ll be taken somewhere safe where you can work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know yet, but we\u0027ll find out soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon? Soon as in minutes, hours, days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes slid to the soup. \"You should eat something. There\u0027s no telling how long it may be until you get another hot meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want food. What I want is to get out of here right now. Barring that, I\u0027d like some more aspirin since I puked up the last ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can do the aspirin, at least—if you promise to eat something so they don\u0027t make you sick again. The rest is out of my hands.\" He sounded truly sorry about that last part, which didn\u0027t do anything to make Noelle feel better about what was going to happen next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle took a sip of the soup just to get him moving toward those pills. Her headache was really getting bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You took off your vest,\" he said, his tone casual, as if he hadn\u0027t just told her she was going to die a few minutes ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was bothering me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get you a smaller one. I want you wearing it at all times. Just in case.\" He pinned her with a laser stare that would have made her cower if her circumstances had been different. She\u0027d faced death today—both hers and that of countless others—she could certainly face his glower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left and came back shortly with aspirin and a smaller vest. Again, he watched her swallow the pills as if he was making sure she didn\u0027t hide them in her cheek or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of a life did he have not even to trust someone to take medicine that she\u0027d asked for in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t sure she wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle made quick work of donning the vest. This one fit her just right, and she had to take off all but the innermost T-shirt she wore to get the straps fastened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid watched her the whole time, chewing and swallowing mechanically as he did. He\u0027d already plowed through two sandwiches and was starting on the third. From the looks of it, she doubted he\u0027d tasted any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hard edges of the vest bit into her skin, but she welcomed the protection that the vest brought, limited though it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come finish your soup,\" he said when she was done dressing. \"I promise it will make you feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle wasn\u0027t sure a bit of chicken broth and noodles was going to do much toward making her feel better, but it could hardly make things worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom outside the door came a loud boom, followed by rattling walls and the frantic shouting of orders. David was on his feet with his gun drawn before Noelle\u0027s heart had time to pump adrenaline through her system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face turned into something feral, predatory. She thought she\u0027d just imagined that he\u0027d looked like that the night she\u0027d been attacked, but now she knew she\u0027d been wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the other side of David—the warrior. The killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the gun in her hands, clicking the safety off. \"Stay here. If anyone you haven\u0027t seen today comes through that door, point and pull the trigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" she started to say, but David was already out the door with his second weapon in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gun burned her fingers with the weight of cold violence. She\u0027d never even held a weapon in her hands before all this happened, but she knew about how the safety switch worked and that there\u0027d be one heck of a kick if she pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe also knew that yesterday, there would have been no situation in which she would have considered using such a weapon. But a lot had happened since yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle turned the small table on its side, spilling soup and Coke everywhere. She slid behind the barrier, propping the heavy gun up on the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Swarm was here, she wasn\u0027t going to let them take her alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid ordered the guards to stand at Noelle\u0027s door and went to find the colonel. He found Monroe at a window, a sniper\u0027s rifle in his capable hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re alive!\" shouted Monroe, as David neared, keeping his head down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. What\u0027d you expect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I expected to find you\u0027d been blown to hell by that RPG that just blasted a hole in the back wall of the house. It went right into the interrogation room. Someone knew where we were holding Noelle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. That wasn\u0027t good news. If it hadn\u0027t been for her request for a relocation and his uncommon softness toward her comfort, they\u0027d both be dead right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it the Swarm?\" asked David as he moved in to take the colonel\u0027s place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know, but that\u0027s where my money is. Get the girl out of here. Now!\" Monroe had to shout to be heard over the last volley of gunfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Swarm, or whoever was out there, had obviously found someone on the inside who would leak information about Noelle\u0027s whereabouts, or they wouldn\u0027t be here. Her location was top secret. \"I\u0027m not taking her to any of the official facilities. It\u0027s not safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I trust your judgment. Just go! Take my Bronco, it\u0027s bulletproofed.\" Monroe slid keys and a satellite phone off his belt and pushed them across the floor to David, then he took the envelope containing the sample of text, crumpled it to make it more aerodynamic and threw that at David as well. \"I\u0027ll contact you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" said David. \"I\u0027ll contact you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now\u0027s not the time to argue, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An attack on this site means that one of your team has been compromised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn. You\u0027re right.\" Monroe\u0027s face was grim and pissed. Someone\u0027s head was going to roll for this. \"Where are you going to take her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready his mind was flying, trying to decide where to take her. Any official location he took her to would be an obvious target. Even if the secure facilities were safe, getting there wouldn\u0027t be. If he was running the Swarm, he\u0027d have teams stationed on all routes leading into those locations. That way, they could get to Noelle before she was locked away safe and sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to get her someplace defensible. Chances were they wouldn\u0027t get out of here without a tail. He needed it to be remote so that when the bullets started flying, no innocents would get hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew just where to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll figure something out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a plan, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Just make sure it\u0027s a good one. We need her alive, Wolfe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" said David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll order the men to cover your exit. You\u0027ve got ninety seconds to get moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid nodded and ran in a low crouch back toward Noelle. He detoured by Monroe\u0027s office to grab her laptop, still in its case, knowing that she was going to need it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/no-regrets-delta-force-1/page-12.html","bookId":2374,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 AM"}
