{"id":19206,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"Mrs. Gorf had a long tongue and pointed ears. She was the meanest teacher in Wayside School. She taught the class on the thirtieth story.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you children are bad,\" she warned, \"or if you answer a problem wrong, I\u0027ll wiggle my ears, stick out my tongue, and turn you into apples!\" Mrs. Gorf didn\u0027t like children, but she loved apples.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joe couldn\u0027t add. He couldn\u0027t even count. But he knew that if he answered a problem wrong, he would be turned into an apple. So he copied from John. He didn\u0027t like to cheat, but Mrs. Gorf had never taught him how to add.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One day Mrs. Gorf caught Joe copying John\u0027s paper. She wiggled her ears-first her right one, then her left- stuck out her tongue, and turned Joe into an apple. Then she turned John into an apple for letting Joe cheat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, that isn\u0027t fair,\" said Todd. \"John was only trying to help a friend.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Gorf wiggled her ears-first her right one, then her left-stuck out her tongue, and turned Todd into an apple. \"Does anybody else have an opinion?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nobody said a word.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Gorf laughed and placed the three apples on her desk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Stephen started to cry. He couldn\u0027t help it. He was scared.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I do not allow crying in the classroom,\" said Mrs. Gorf. She wiggled her ears-first her right one, then her left-stuck out her tongue, and turned Stephen into an apple.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For the rest of the day, the children were absolutely quiet. And when they went home, they were too scared even to talk to their parents.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Joe, John, Todd, and Stephen couldn\u0027t go home. Mrs. Gorf just left them on her desk. They were able to talk to each other, but they didn\u0027t have much to say.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Their parents were very worried. They didn\u0027t know where their children were. Nobody seemed to know.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next day Kathy was late for school. As soon as she walked in, Mrs. Gorf turned her into an apple.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Paul sneezed during class. He was turned into an apple.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nancy said, \"God bless you!\" when Paul sneezed. Mrs. Gorf wiggled her ears-first her right one, thenher left-stuck out her tongue, and turned Nancy into an apple.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Terrence fell out of his chair. He was turned into an apple.\n\u003cbr\u003e Maurecia tried to run away. She was halfway to the door as Mrs. Gorf\u0027s right ear began to wiggle. When she reached the door, Mrs. Gorf\u0027s left ear wiggled. Maurecia opened the door and had one foot outside when Mrs. Gorf stuck out her tongue. Maurecia became an apple.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Gorf picked up the apple from the floor and put it on her desk with the others. Then a funny thing happened. Mrs. Gorf turned around and fell over a piece of chalk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The three Erics laughed. They were turned into apples.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Gorf had a dozen apples on her desk: Joe, John, Todd, Stephen, Kathy, Paul, Nancy, Terrence, Maurecia, and the three Erics-Eric Fry, Eric Bacon, and Eric Ovens.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis, the yard teacher, walked into the classroom. He had missed the children at recess. He had heard that Mrs. Gorf was a mean teacher. So he came up to investigate. He saw the twelve apples on Mrs. Gorf s desk. \"I must be wrong,\" he thought. \"She must be a good teacher if so many children bring her apples.\" He walked back down to the playground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next day a dozen more children were turned into apples. Louis, the yard teacher, came back into the room. He saw twenty-four apples on Mrs. Gorf s desk. There were only three children left in the class. \"She must be the best teacher in the world,\" he thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By the end of the week all of the children were apples. Mrs. Gorf was very happy. \"Now I can go home,\u0027\u0027 she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t have to teach anymore. I won\u0027t have to walk up thirty flights of stairs ever again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re not going anywhere,\" shouted Todd. He jumped off the desk and bopped Mrs. Gorf on the nose. The rest of the apples followed. Mrs. Gorf fell on the floor. The apples jumped all over her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Stop,\" she shouted, \"or I\u0027ll turn you into applesauce!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the apples didn\u0027t stop, and Mrs. Gorf could do nothing about it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Turn us back into children,\" Todd demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Gorf had no choice. She stuck out her tongue, wiggled her ears-this time her left one first, then her right-and turned the apples back into children.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right,\" said Maurecia, \"let\u0027s go get Louis. He\u0027ll know what to do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No!\" screamed Mrs. Gorf. \"I\u0027ll turn you back into apples.\" She wiggled her ears-first her right one, then her left-and stuck out her tongue. But Jenny held up a mirror, and Mrs. Gorf turned herself into an apple.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The children didn\u0027t know what to do. They didn\u0027t have a teacher. Even though Mrs. Gorf was mean, they didn\u0027t think it was right to leave her as an apple. But none of them knew how to wiggle their ears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis, the yard teacher, walked in. \"Where\u0027s Mrs. Gorf?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nobody said a word.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Boy, am I hungry,\" said Louis. \"I don\u0027t think Mrs. Gorf would mind if I ate this apple. After all, she always has so many.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He picked up the apple, which was really Mrs. Gorf, shined it up on his shirt, and ate it.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56808.html","bookId":627,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM"}
