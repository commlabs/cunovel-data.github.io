Sometimes they\u0027ll make a person look guilty when he\u0027s not, especially if the operator isn\u0027t very good at what he\u0027s doing. But if they say you\u0027re innocent, it\u0027s a pretty good bet you are. I think they ought to be admissible in court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had always felt that way myself. I sat there for a while trying to run it all through my mind until everything fell into place. It took its time. Meanwhile, Guzik went on talking about the interrogation of Beverly Ethridge, pointing up his remarks with observations on what he would like to do with her. I didn\u0027t pay him much attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"The car wasn\u0027t him. I should have realized that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The car,\" I said. \"I told you a car took a shot at me one night. The same night I spotted Lundgren for the first time, and the place was the same as where he came at me with the knife, so I had to think it was the same man both times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never saw the driver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I figured it was Lundgren because he\u0027d been dogging me earlier that night and I thought he\u0027d been setting me up. But it couldn\u0027t have been that way. It wouldn\u0027t be his style. He liked that knife too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then who was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spinner said somebody ran up onto a curb after him. The same bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plus the voice on the phone. Then there were no calls any more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t follow you, Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him. \"Trying to make the pieces fit. That\u0027s all. Somebody killed Spinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The question is who.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"That\u0027s the question,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the other people he gave you the dope on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They all check out,\" I said. \"Maybe he had more people after him than he ever told me about. Maybe he added somebody to the string after he gave me the envelope. The hell, maybe somebody rolled him for his cash, hit him too hard, panicked, and threw the body in the river.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure it happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think we\u0027ll ever find out who did him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Guzik said. \"No, I don\u0027t think we ever will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had never been in the building before. There were two doormen on duty, and the elevator was manned. The doormen made sure that I was expected, and the elevator operator whisked me up eighteen floors and indicated which door was the one I was looking for. He didn\u0027t budge until I had rung the bell and been admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apartment was as impressive as the rest of the building. There was a stairway leading to a second floor. An olive-skinned maid led me into a large den with oak-paneled walls and a fireplace. About half the books on the shelves were bound in leather. It was a very comfortable room in a very spacious apartment. The apartment had cost almost two hundred thousand dollars, and the monthly maintenance charge came to something like fifteen hundred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you\u0027ve got enough money, you can buy just about anything you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will be with you in a moment,\" the maid said. \"He said for you to help yourself to a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed to a serving bar alongside the fireplace. There was ice in a silver bucket, and a couple of dozen bottles. I sat in a red leather chair and waited for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have to wait very long. He entered the room. He was wearing white flannel slacks and a plaid blazer. He had a pair of leather house slippers on his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now,\" he said. He smiled to show how genuinely glad he was to see me. \"You\u0027ll have something to drink, I hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a little early for me too, as a matter of fact. You sounded quite urgent on the phone, Mr. Scudder. I gather you\u0027ve had second thoughts about working for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I received the impression-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was to get in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"I\u0027m not sure I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m really not sure whether you do or not, Mr. Huysendahl. I think you\u0027d better close the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care for your tone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to care for any of this,\" I said. \"You\u0027ll like it less with the door open. I think you should close it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to say something, perhaps another observation about my tone of voice and how little he cared for it, but instead he closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Mr. Huysendahl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was used to giving orders, not taking them, and I thought he was going to make an issue out of it. But he sat down, and his face wasn\u0027t quite enough of a mask to keep me from knowing that he knew what it was all about. I\u0027d known anyway, because there was just no other way the pieces could fit together, but his face confirmed it for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to tell me what this is all about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m going to tell you. But I think you already know. Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over his shoulder at an oil painting of somebody\u0027s ancestor. Maybe one of his. I didn\u0027t notice any family resemblance, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You killed Spinner Jablon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re out of your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already found out who killed Jablon. You told me that the day before yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re driving at, Scudder-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A man tried to kill me Wednesday night,\" I said. \"You know about that. I assumed he was the same man who killed Spinner, and I managed to tie him to one of Spinner\u0027s other suckers, so I thought that cleared you. But it turns out that he couldn\u0027t have killed Spinner, because he was on the other side of the country at the time. His alibi for Spinner\u0027s death was as solid as they come. He was in jail at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him. He was patient now, hearing me out with the same intent stare he had fixed on me Thursday afternoon when I told him he was in the clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I should have known he wasn\u0027t the only one involved, that more than one of Spinner\u0027s victims had decided to fight back. The man who tried to kill me was a loner. He liked to use a knife. But I\u0027d been attacked earlier by one or more men in a car, a stolen car. And a few minutes after that attack I had a phone call from an older man with a New York accent. I\u0027d had a call from that man before. It didn\u0027t make sense that the knife artist would have had anybody else in on it. So somebody else was behind the dodge with the car, and somebody else was responsible for knocking Spinner on the head and dumping him in the river.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t mean I had anything to do with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it does. As soon as the man with the knife is taken out of the picture, it\u0027s obvious that everything was pointing to you all along. He was an amateur, but in other respects the operation was all quite professional. A car stolen from another neighborhood with a very good man at the wheel. Some men who were good enough to find Spinner when he didn\u0027t want to be found. You had the money to hire that kind of talent. And you had the connections.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s nonsense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve been thinking about it. One thing that threw me was your reaction when I first came to your office. You didn\u0027t know Spinner was dead until I showed you the item in the paper. I almost ruled you out, because I couldn\u0027t believe you could fake a reaction that well. But of course it wasn\u0027t a fake. You really didn\u0027t know he was dead, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\" He drew his shoulders back. \"And I think that\u0027s fairly good evidence that I had nothing to do with his death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"It just means you didn\u0027t know about it yet. And you were stunned by the realization both that Spinner was dead and that the whole game didn\u0027t end with his death. I not only had the evidence on you, I also knew you were tied to Spinner and a possible suspect in his death. Naturally that shook you up a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t prove anything. You can say that I hired someone to kill Spinner. I didn\u0027t, and I can swear to you that I didn\u0027t, but it\u0027s hardly something I can prove either. But the point is that it\u0027s not incumbent upon me to prove it, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you can accuse me of whatever you want, but you don\u0027t have a shred of proof either, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then perhaps you\u0027ll tell me why you decided to come here this afternoon, Mr. Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have proof. That\u0027s true. But I have something else, Mr. Huysendahl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have those photographs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gaped. \"You distinctly told me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I had burned them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d intended to. It was simpler to tell you it had already been done. I\u0027ve been busy since then, and didn\u0027t get around to it. And then this morning I found out that the man with the knife was not the man who killed Spinner, and I sifted through some of the things that I already knew, and I saw that it had to be you. So it was just as well that I didn\u0027t burn those pictures, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got slowly to his feet. \"I think I\u0027ll have that drink after all,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go right ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you join me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put ice cubes in a tall glass, poured Scotch, added soda from a siphon. He took his time building the drink, then walked over to the fireplace and rested with his elbow on the burnished oak mantel. He took a few small sips of his drink before he turned to look at me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027re back to the beginning,\" he said. \"And you\u0027ve decided to blackmail me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why else is it so fortunate for you that you didn\u0027t burn the pictures?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s the only hold I\u0027ve got on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what are you going to do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what you\u0027re going to do, Mr. Huysendahl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what am I going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to run for governor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me. I didn\u0027t really want to look at his eyes, but I forced myself. He was no longer trying to keep his face a mask, and I was able to watch as he tried on one thought after another and found that none of them led anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve thought this out, Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At length, I would suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s nothing you want, is there? Money, power, the things most people want. It wouldn\u0027t do any good for me to send another check to Boys Town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. He worried the tip of his chin with a finger. He said, \"I don\u0027t know who killed Jablon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assumed as much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t order him killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The order originated with you.

Not because I felt the killing could possibly be attributed to me, that any sort of trail would lead back to me. But because I honestly did not know whether I was in any way responsible for his death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t order it directly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not.
