You know my dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted me into his arms, “Then let’s make it a fun five days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, “I can\u0027t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered his face onto mine, “I can.” He brushed his lips against mine softly. It felt right, instantly. I pushed him back, “Fine, but none of that, okay? I wasn’t kidding when I said I wasn’t complicating this all with you and me. We are confused about what we are. Sex with another man isn’t going to fix my engagement to Phil and his cape.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I tore up some random dude’s number like two days ago. You sleep at my house at least a couple times a year. Don’t tell me what you are. I know what you are. It’s you that’s confused. Not me.” His face turned up into a grin, “I need to have a drink when you tell me this cape story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and shuddered, exhausted with my own shit, “Just let me process all this, and the cape, and the being disowned and everything, and then we can discuss kissing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, “I’ll wait for you to ask me to kiss you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and slid back against the wall, “You do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down on me, “I think you’re the prettiest girl I ever have seen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed out loud, “Liar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “Laugh all you want, but it’s true. There are fireworks inside of you that haven’t been lit since the last time me and you...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and pointed, “You keep that puck-fuck shit to yourself. I don’t want to hear the lines.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes sparkled, “You know you like it when I try.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, “‘Cause I know nothing is going to come of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat forward, “What do you want to do after the five days?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put a hand on my thigh, “Run away and drag you with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, “Okay, let me confront my family, and if I can\u0027t go back, I’ll run away with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head, “I need some kind of guarantee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and wiped away the water, “Shake on it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess. How about this? You don’t run away with me and you have to tell me that bad thing you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brow knit together, “Deal.” He shook my hand, pulling me in. He kissed along the side of my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up and offered me his hand. I waited a second and then took it. He lifted me up but didn’t let go of my hand. We just looked at each other for a minute. The shower got thick with the tense feeling of the forbidden kiss. He flashed me a grin until he finally smiled, “You have to say it or I won\u0027t kiss you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swatted him with my free hand, “It’s not going to happen.” I climbed out and dried off. I noticed the changes in his body. His body was thick and beefy, but toned. I had to pull my eyes away from the square of his jaw and soft lips, and the memory of how they felt against mine. His scruffy face made me want him more for some barbaric reason. I had the dirtiest thoughts ever and blushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you thinking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.” I answered too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made him smile, “Your face just went a hundred shades of red.” He winked, “I can imagine what you were thinking.” He scoffed and left the bathroom. I stood there clutching my towel and trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poked his head back in, “If you want me to kiss you, all you have to do is ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw a rolled towel at him. We were flirting. This was us half a decade ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dried off and started opening my boxes of stuff. I did my makeup without actually meeting my own gaze. I knew what was in there—the thoughts and feelings that I had been fighting for some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wore the robe out to the room and grabbed the clothes I’d asked for. I carried them into the bedroom and dressed. The bra and underwear made me uncomfortable, but I knew in boutiques they were not tried on. I slipped on the black dress I already owned. It was a classic sleeveless knit dress with pleats sewn into the skirt. It hung perfectly and was the most comfortable dress ever. I slipped the pearl earrings from my purse on and ran my fingers through my curly hair. The long, strawberry-blonde ringlets sat perfectly, thanks to hundreds of dollars worth of product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked good, like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got the hotel dry cleaning the clothes you had in the bags.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snapped around, “YOU WHAT?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back, “What’s happening here? Why are you yelling at me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stomped across to the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed it from my hands, “Are you insane? I did you a favor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growled through a clenched jaw, “That coat is my favorite. It’s discontinued and there is one Chinese lady I trust with my clothes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, actually in my face. I took a deep breath and turned and walked to the door, “Are you ready?” I was still raging inside, but I wasn’t about to show him my fucking fireworks. He was always patronizing me and making derogatory ‘ginger’ remarks about my temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped laughing, “Yeah.” He opened the door as I reached for it and placed his hand on my lower back. I walked fast, to get away from his hand. He grabbed my arm and pulled me back to him, pressing my back against the wall, “I was trying to be helpful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eglared, seething. I wasn’t a fan of being manhandled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe locked his gaze on mine, \"You\u0027re being insane. It\u0027s a fucking coat, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to laugh. The sentence was absurd—a coat? I pushed him back and walked to the elevator. He pushed me playfully from behind. I turned, \"Screw you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my hand, grinning like an idiot, and pulled me into his arms, \"I wanna screw. You keep saying no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, but it wasn’t the homicidal one I wanted it to be. It was genuine. \"Don’t say screw. Sometimes I hate you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrapped his huge arm around my shoulders, \"Nothing better than getting a princess to hate you and love you at the same time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes as he pushed the button. When we got inside, he nodded, \"Don\u0027t forget that I\u0027ll be swarmed if anyone recognizes me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"If I end up in pictures again, I\u0027m going to get disowned. My mother and father hate you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down on me, \"Your mom likes me. She grabbed my butt once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"That doesn’t mean she likes you. She doesn’t have to like you, to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled, \"Your mom is sort of a player.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe restaurant was full when we got down there. I ignored everyone as I sat and glanced at the wine list. The server walked up, smiling at me. He was sexy as hell and probably not much older than the little bartender that could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get you a drink to start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance shook his head, \"I\u0027ll just have some water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"Do you have any Lafite?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"The ‘95 Bordeaux.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winked, \"Excellent choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small chuckle slipped from my lips. I glanced at the confused and rigid-looking face of France and started to laugh harder. I shook my head, \"Just a coat? I can\u0027t even believe you said that. It\u0027s a one of a kind and some seventeen-year old is dry cleaning it now. That’s excellent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed after the server, \"I\u0027m not drinking that snooty wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned forward, \"You are. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he might growl but he sat back, relenting. \"So where should we go tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t know. You\u0027re the captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drummed his fingers on the chair, glancing about the busy dining room. He was avoiding me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want, I can just hop on a train or a bus.\" I shuddered as I imagined the feel of it, but I had to be realistic about what was happening. I ordered an entire bottle of wine; he would have half a glass and bitch the entire time about it. I would drink the rest, and then all my choices would be tainted by my undying love for him and delicious Bordeaux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, still averting his eyes, \"No. I want you to stay with me.\" An evil grin crossed his lips \"Besides, we both know you have never set foot on any form of public transit. You would panic and call me to come get you anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t fight the smile on my lips, \"Shut up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and my heart pitter-pattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe server brought the wine and poured him a small taste of it. He frowned, \"Well, fill it up, son. I don’t love it, but I can drink more than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"Just taste it and see if you like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe server looked confused as France lifted the glass and drank the little sip. He shuddered, \"Tastes like piss and vinegar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded at the flushed and upset face of the young man, \"It\u0027s perfect then. You may fill both glasses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated and poured us both a glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sipped, it was bliss. I might have even slipped out a moan. My dream had always been to own a vineyard. My parents always mocked my dream. Owning a vineyard was equivalent to farming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance took a sip and made a face, \"I can\u0027t, Jack.\" He looked at the young man, \"How about a Bud? You got beer here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got a nod and I got another wink as he left our table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance pointed, \"That kid winks at you one more time, I\u0027ll close his eye for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren’t my boyfriend, what do you care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice still sounded throaty from the sip of wine, \"He doesn\u0027t know that.\" His twang was thick suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed harder, \"You are cute jealous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed sarcastically, \"No, I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beer and an iced mug were delivered. Of course, he drank from the bottle. He sighed, \"That’s good.\" He sat back and nodded, \"Alright, tell me the story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the menu, \"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup. We\u0027re hundreds of miles away and I have you here and a beer in my hand. I can take it. I know he cheated. I know there was a cape. I know you’re pissed. Spill.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-12.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:45 PM"}
