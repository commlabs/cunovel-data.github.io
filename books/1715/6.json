That wouldn\u0027t be a problem - we\u0027re entirely self-sufficient - but Spaulding is nervous about pulling surface support when there are civilians below. I want to know your feelings.

He kicked one of the iron walls; it rang hollowly. They passed into C Cylinder, on their way to the bunks. \"I can\u0027t believe you people want to leave,\" Ted said. \"This is such an exciting discovery. How can you walk away from it? Especially you, Harry. The mathematical possibilities alone! The theory of the black hole - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - I\u0027ll tell you why,\" Harry said. \"I want to go because Barnes wants to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barnes doesn\u0027t want to go,\" Ted said. \"Why, he put it to a vote - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - I know what he did. But Barnes doesn\u0027t want to look as if he\u0027s made the wrong decision in the eyes of his superiors, or as if he\u0027s backing down. So he let us decide. But I\u0027m telling you, Barnes wants to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman was surprised: the cliche image of mathematicians was that they had their heads in the clouds, were absent-minded, inattentive. But Harry was astute; he didn\u0027t miss a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would Barnes want to go?\" Ted said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s clear,\" Harry said. \"Because of the storm on the surface.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The storm isn\u0027t here yet,\" Ted said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Harry said. \"And when it comes, we don\u0027t know how long it will last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barnes said twenty-four to forty-eight hours - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither Barnes nor anyone else can predict how long the storm will last,\" Harry said. \"What if it lasts five days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can hold out that long.

What\u0027re you so worried about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not worried,\" Harry said. \"But I think Barnes is worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing will go wrong, for Christ\u0027s sake,\" Ted said. \"I think we should stay.\" And then there was a squishing sound. They looked down at the all-weather carpeting at their feet. The carpet was dark, soaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say it was water,\" Harry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Salt water?\" Ted said, bending over, touching the damp spot. He licked his finger. \"Doesn\u0027t taste salty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom above them, a voice said, \"That\u0027s because it\u0027s urine.\" Looking up, they saw Teeny Fletcher standing on a platform among a network of pipes near the curved top of the cylinder. \"Everything\u0027s under control, gentlemen. Just a small leak in the liquid waste disposal pipe that goes to the H2O recycler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liquid waste?\" Ted was shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a small leak,\" Fletcher said. \"No problem, sir.\" She sprayed one of the pipes with white foam from a spray canister. The foam sputtered and hardened on the pipe. \"We just urethane the suckers when we get them. Makes a perfect seal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How often do you get these leaks?\" Harry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liquid waste?\" Ted said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard to say, Dr. Adams. But don\u0027t worry. Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel sick,\" Ted said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry slapped him on the back. \"Come on, it won\u0027t kill you. Let\u0027s get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m going to throw up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went into the sleeping chamber. Ted immediately ran off to the showers; they heard him coughing and gagging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor Ted,\" Harry said, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman said, \"What\u0027s all this business about a black hole, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A black hole,\" Harry said, \"is a dead, compressed star. Basically, a star is like a big beach ball inflated by the atomic explosions occurring inside it. When a star gets old, and runs out of nuclear fuel, the ball collapses to a much smaller size. If it collapses enough, it becomes so dense and it has so much gravity that it keeps on collapsing, squeezing down on itself until it is very dense and very small - only a few miles in diameter. Then it\u0027s a black hole. Nothing else in the universe is as dense as a black hole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they\u0027re black because they\u0027re dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They\u0027re black because they trap all the light. Black holes have so much gravity, they pull everything into them, like vacuum cleaners - all the surrounding interstellar gas and dust, and even light itself. They just suck it right up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They suck up light?\" Norman said. He found it hard to think of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what were you two so excited about, with your calculations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027s a long story, and it\u0027s just speculation.\" Harry yawned. \"It probably won\u0027t amount to anything, anyway. Talk about it later?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry rolled over, went to sleep. Ted was still in the showers, hacking and sputtering. Norman went back to D Cyl, to Tina\u0027s console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Harry find you all right?\" he said. \"I know he wanted to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. And I have the information he requested now. Why? Did you want to make out your will, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Adams said he didn\u0027t have a will and he wanted to make one. He seemed to feel it was quite urgent. Anyway, I checked with the surface and you can\u0027t do it. It\u0027s some legal problem about it being in your own handwriting; you can\u0027t transmit your will over electronic lines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Dr. Johnson. Should I tell the others as well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Norman said. \"Don\u0027t bother the others. We\u0027ll be going to the surface soon. Right after we have one last look at the ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE LARGE GLASS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time they split up inside the spaceship. Barnes, Ted, and Edmunds continued forward in the vast cargo bays, to search the parts of the ship that were still unexplored. Norman, Beth, and Harry stayed in what they now called the flight deck, looking for the flight recorder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTed\u0027s parting words were \"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done.\" Then he set off with Barnes. Edmunds left them a small video monitor so they could see the progress of the other team in the forward section of the ship. And they could hear: Ted chattered continuously to Barnes, giving his views about structural features of the ship. The design of the big cargo bays reminded Ted of the stonework of the ancient Mycenaeans in Greece, particularly the Lion Gate ramp at Mycenae. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ted has more irrelevant facts at his fingertips than any man I know,\" Harry said. \"Can we turn the volume down?\" Yawning, Norman turned the monitor down. He was tired. The bunks in DH-8 were damp, the electric blankets heavy and clinging. Sleep had been almost impossible. And then Beth had come storming in after her talk with Barnes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still angry now. \"God damn Barnes,\" she said. \"Where does he get off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s doing the best he can, like everyone else,\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun. \"You know, Norman, sometimes you\u0027re too psychological and understanding. The man is an idiot. A complete idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just find the flight recorder, shall we?\" Harry said. \"That\u0027s the important thing now.\" Harry was following the umbilicus cable that ran out the back of the mannequin, into the floor. He was lifting up floor panels, tracing the wires aft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Beth said, \"but he wouldn\u0027t speak like that to a man. Certainly not to Ted. Ted\u0027s hogging the whole show, and I don\u0027t see why he should be allowed to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does Ted have to do with - \" Norman began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - The man is a parasite, that\u0027s what he is. He takes the ideas of others and promotes them as his own. Even the way he quotes famous sayings - it\u0027s outrageous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel he takes other people\u0027s ideas?\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, back on the surface, I mentioned to Ted that we ought to have some words ready when we opened this thing. And the next thing I know, Ted\u0027s making up quotes and positioning himself in front of the camera.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well what, Norman? Don\u0027t well me, for Christ\u0027s sake. It was my idea and he took it without so much as a thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you say anything to him about it?\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I did not say anything to him about it. I\u0027m sure he wouldn\u0027t remember if I did; he\u0027d go, \u0027Did you say that, Beth? I suppose you might have mentioned something like that, yes. ...\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still think you should talk to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Norman, you\u0027re not listening to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you talked to him, at least you wouldn\u0027t be so angry about it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shrink talk,\" she said, shaking her head. \"Look, Ted does whatever he wants on this expedition, he makes his stupid speeches, whatever he wants. But I go through the door first and Barnes gives me hell. Why shouldn\u0027t I go first? What\u0027s wrong with a woman being the first, for once in the history of science?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beth - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - And then I had the gall to turn on the lights. You know what Barnes said about that? He said I might have started a short-circuit and put us all in jeopardy. He said I didn\u0027t know what I was doing. He said I was impulsive. Jesus. Impulsive. Stone-age military cretin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn the volume back up,\" Harry said. \"I\u0027d rather hear Ted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re all under a lot of pressure, Beth,\" Norman said. \"It\u0027s going to affect everybody in different ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at Norman. \"You\u0027re saying Barnes was right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saying we\u0027re all under pressure.

A colorful, engaging man, Stone had a reputation as a good researcher who used his graduate students like lab assistants, taking their results as his own. In this exploitation of others\u0027 work, Stone was not unique in the academic community, but he proceeded a little more ruthlessly than his colleagues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beth was living with him as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back in the early seventies. Apparently, she did a series of important experiments on the energetics of ciliary inclusion bodies. They had a big argument, and Stone broke off his relationship with her. She left the lab, and he published five papers - all her work - without her name on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very nice,\" Harry said. \"So now she lifts weights?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she feels mistreated, and I can see her point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Harry said. \"But the thing is, lie down with dogs, get up with fleas, you know what I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Beth said, returning. \"This is like \u0027The girl who\u0027s raped is always asking for it,\u0027 is that what you\u0027re saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Harry said, still lifting up floor panels, following the wires. \"But sometimes you gotta ask what the girl is doing in a dark alley at three in the morning in a bad part of town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in love with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still a bad part of town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was twenty-two years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old do you have to be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up yours, Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry shook his head. \"You find the wires, Butch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I found the wires.

Inside the cube was an intricate grid arrangement of fine glowing blue lines. Between the glowing lines, blue lights flickered intermittently.

With ceilings nearly a hundred feet high, it was enormous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could put a six-story building in this room, Norman thought.

Maybe it even rains in here sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was filled with machinery on an immense scale. At first glance, it looked like oversized earth-moving machinery, except it was brightly painted in primary colors, glistening with oil. Then Norman began to notice individual features.

And an array of buckets and receptacles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized suddenly he was looking at something very similar to the grippers and claws mounted on the front end of the Charon V submersible he had ridden down on the day before.
