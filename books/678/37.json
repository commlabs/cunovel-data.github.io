He thought he lived in a country where turkeys were the ruling class, and every year they held a feast to manifest their sense of Heaven’s goodness in sparing their lives to kill them later. One day, about a week before one of these feasts, he met the Supreme Gobbler, who said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“You will please get yourself into good condition for the Thanksgiving dinner.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, your Excellency,” replied the Pious Person, delighted, “I shall come hungry, I assure you. It is no small privilege to dine with your Excellency.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Gobbler eyed him for a moment in silence; then he said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“As one of the lower domestic animals, you cannot be expected to know much, but you might know something. Since you do not, you will permit me to point out that being asked to dinner is one thing; being asked to dine is another and a different thing.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith this significant remark the Supreme Gobbler left him, and thenceforward the Pious Person dreamed of himself as white meat and dark until rudely awakened by decapitation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/864/811.html","bookId":678,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 9:26:07 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 9:26:07 AM"}
