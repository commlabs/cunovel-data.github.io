{"id":68793,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eCharles Cohn had inspected five buildings erected by the Nova Scotia Construction Company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re a first-rate outfit,\" he had told Lara. \"You shouldn\u0027t have any problem with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Lara, Charles Cohn, and Buzz Steele were inspecting the new site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s perfect,\" Buzz Steele said. \"The measurements come to forty-three thousand five hundred sixty square feet. That will give you the twenty-thousand-square-foot building you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles Cohn asked, \"Can you have the building finished by December thirty-first?\" He was determined to protect Lara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sooner,\" Steele said. \"I can promise it to you by Christmas Eve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was beaming. \"How soon can you get started?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have my crew here by the middle of next week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching the new building going up was the most exciting thing Lara had ever experienced. She was there every day. \"I want to learn,\" she told Charles Cohn. \"This is just the beginning for me. Before I\u0027m through, I\u0027m going to put up a hundred buildings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCohn wondered whether Lara really knew what she was getting into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first men to set foot on the project site were members of the survey team. They established the legal geometric borders of the property and drove hubs into the ground at each corner, every hub painted with a fluorescent color for easy identification. The survey work was finished in two days, and early the following morning, heavy earth-moving equipment - a truck-mounted Caterpillar front-end loader - arrived at the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was there, waiting. \"What happens now?\" she asked Buzz Steele.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We clear and grub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara looked at him. \"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Caterpillar is gonna dig up tree stumps and do some rough grading.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next piece of equipment that came in was a backhoe to dig the trenches for foundations, utility conduits, and drainage piping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now the boarders at the house had all heard what was happening, and it became the main topic of conversation at breakfast and supper. They were all cheering for Lara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens next?\" they would ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was becoming an expert. \"This morning they put the underground piping in place. Tomorrow they start to put in the wood and concrete formwork, so they can wire-tie the steel bars into the skeletal gridiron.\" She grinned. \"Do you understand what I\u0027m saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePouring the concrete was the next step, and when the concrete foundation was cured, large truckloads of lumber rolled in, and crews of carpenters began to assemble the wooden frames. The noise was horrendous, but to Lara it was music. The place was filled with the sounds of rhythmic hammers and whining power saws. After two weeks the wall panels, punctuated with window and door openings, were stood upright as if the building had suddenly been inflated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo passersby, the building was a maze of wood and steel, but to Lara it was something else. It was her dream come to life. Every morning and every evening she went downtown and stared at what was being built. I own this, Lara thought. This belongs to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the episode with MacAllister, Lara had been terrified that she might become pregnant. The thought of it made her sick to her stomach. When her period came, she was weak with relief. Now all I have to worry about is my building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued to collect the rents for Sean MacAllister because she needed a place to live, but she had to steel herself to go into his office and face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had a good time in Halifax, didn\u0027t we, honey? Why don\u0027t we do it again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m busy with my building,\" Lara said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe level of activity began to heighten as the sheet metal crews, roofers, and carpenters worked simultaneously, the number of men, materials, and trucks tripling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles Cohn had left Glace Bay, but he telephoned Lara once a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is the building going?\" he had asked the last time he called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great!\" Lara said enthusiastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it on schedule?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s ahead of schedule.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful. I can tell you now that I wasn\u0027t really sure you could do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you gave me a chance anyway. Thank you, Charles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One good turn deserves another. Remember, if it hadn\u0027t been for you, I might have starved to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom time to time Sean MacAllister would join Lara at the building site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s coming along just fine, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacAllister seemed genuinely pleased. Lara thought: Mr. Cohn was wrong about him. He\u0027s not trying to take advantage of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of November the building was progressing rapidly. The windows and doors were in place, and the exterior walls were set. The structure was ready to accept the network of nerves and arteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Monday, the first week of December, work on the building began to slow down. Lara went to the site one morning, and there were only two men there, and they seemed to be doing very little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the rest of the crew today?\" Lara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re on another job,\" one of the men explained. \"They\u0027ll be here tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day no one was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara took a bus into Halifax to see Buzz Steele. \"What\u0027s happening?\" Lara asked. \"The work has stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing to worry about,\" Steele assured her. \"We ran into a little snag on another job, and I had to pull my men off temporarily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will they be coming back to work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next week. We\u0027ll be on schedule.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buzz, you know how much this means to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Lara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the building\u0027s not completed on time, I lose it. I lose everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, kid. I won\u0027t let that happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lara left, she had a feeling of unease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following week the workmen still had not appeared. She went into Halifax again to see Steele.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" the secretary said, \"Mr. Steele is not in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must talk to him. When will he be back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s out of town on a job. I don\u0027t know when he\u0027ll be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara felt the first stirrings of panic. \"This is very important,\" Lara insisted. \"He\u0027s putting up a building for me. It has to be finished in three weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t worry, Miss Cameron. If Mr. Steele said it will be finished, it will be finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But nothing\u0027s happening,\" Lara cried. \"No one\u0027s working on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to talk to Mr. Ericksen, his assistant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEricksen was a giant of a man, broad-shouldered and amiable. He radiated reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know why you\u0027re here,\" he said, \"but Buzz told me to assure you that you have nothing to worry about. We\u0027ve been held back a little on your project because of some problems on a couple of big construction jobs we\u0027re handling, but your building is only three weeks away from completion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s still so much to do...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to worry. We\u0027ll have a crew out there first thing on Monday morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Lara said, relieved. \"I\u0027m sorry to have bothered you, but I\u0027m a little nervous. This means a great deal to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" Ericksen smiled. \"You just go home and relax. You\u0027re in good hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday morning there was not a single workman at the site. Lara was frantic. She telephoned Charles Cohn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The men have stopped working,\" she told him, \"and I can\u0027t find out why. They keep making promises and breaking them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the name of the company - Nova Scotia Construction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call you back,\" Cohn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours later Charles Cohn telephoned. \"Who recommended the Nova Scotia Construction Company to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought back. \"Sean MacAllister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not surprised. He owns the company, Lara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara felt suddenly faint. \"And he\u0027s stopping the men from finishing it on time...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid it looks that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a nahash tzefa - a poisonous snake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was too kind to say that he had warned her. All he managed was: \"Maybe...maybe something will turn up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe admired the young girl\u0027s spirit and ambition, and he despised Sean MacAllister. But he was helpless. There was nothing he could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara lay awake all night thinking about her folly. The building she had put up would belong now to Sean MacAllister, and she would be left with a staggering debt which she would spend the rest of her life working to repay. The thought of how MacAllister might exact payment made her shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lara awakened, she went to see Sean MacAllister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, my dear. You\u0027re looking lovely today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara came right to the point. \"I need an extension. The building won\u0027t be ready by the thirty-first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacAllister sat back in his chair and frowned. \"Really? That\u0027s bad news, Lara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need another month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacAllister sighed. \"I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s not possible. Oh, dear, no. You signed a contract. A deal is a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Lara. On the thirty-first, the property reverts to the bank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the boarders at the house heard what was happening, they were furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That son of a bitch!\" one of them cried. \"He can\u0027t do this to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s done it,\" Lara said, despairingly. \"It\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going to let him get away with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, no. What have you got left - three weeks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara shook her head. \"Less. Two and a half weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man turned to the others. \"Let\u0027s go down and take a look at that building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What good will...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon half a dozen boarders were standing at the building site, carefully inspecting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The plumbing hasn\u0027t been put in,\" one of the men said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor the electricity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood there, shivering in the freezing December wind, discussing what still remained to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men turned to Lara. \"Your banker\u0027s a tricky fellow. He\u0027s had the building almost finished so that he wouldn\u0027t have much to do when your contract was up.\" He turned to the others. \"I would say that this could be finished in two and a half weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a chorus of agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was bewildered. \"You don\u0027t understand. The workmen won\u0027t come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, lassie, in your boardinghouse you\u0027ve got plumbers and carpenters and electricians, and we\u0027ve got lots of friends in town who can handle the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any money to pay you,\" Lara said. \"Mr. MacAllister won\u0027t give me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be our Christmas gift to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened after that was incredible. Word quickly spread around Glace Bay of what was happening. Construction workers on other buildings came to take a look at Lara\u0027s property. Half of them were there because they liked Lara, and the other half because they had had dealings with Sean MacAllister and hated him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s fix the bastard,\" they said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dropped by to lend a hand after work, working past midnight and on Saturdays and Sundays, and the sound of construction began again, filling the air with a joyful noise. Beating the deadline became a challenge, and the building was soon swarming with carpenters and electricians and plumbers, all eager to pitch in. When Sean MacAllister heard what was happening, he rushed over to the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there, stunned. \"What\u0027s going on?\" he demanded. \"Those aren\u0027t my workmen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re mine,\" Lara said defiantly. \"There\u0027s nothing in the contract that says I can\u0027t use my own men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I...\" MacAllister sputtered. \"That building had better be up to specifications.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be,\" Lara assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day before New Year\u0027s Eve the building was completed. It stood proud against the sky, solid and strong, and it was the most beautiful thing Lara had ever seen. She stood there staring at it, dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all yours,\" one of the workmen said proudly. \"Are we going to have a party or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night it seemed that the whole town of Glace Bay celebrated Lara Cameron\u0027s first building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no stopping Lara after that. Her mind was brimming with ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your new employees are going to need places to live in Glace Bay,\" she told Charles Cohn. \"I\u0027d like to build houses for them. Are you interested?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I\u0027m very interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara went to see a banker in Sydney and borrowed enough money on her building to finance the new project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the houses were finished, Lara said to Charles Cohn, \"Do you know what else this town needs, Charles? Cabins to accommodate the summer tourists who come here to fish. I know a wonderful place near the bay where I could build...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles Cohn became Lara\u0027s unofficial financial adviser, and during the next three years Lara built an office building, half a dozen seashore cottages, and a shopping mall. The banks in Sydney and Halifax were happy to loan her money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo years later, when Lara sold out her real estate holdings, she had a certified check for three million dollars. She was twenty-one years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day she said good-bye to Glace Bay and left for Chicago. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-shine-down/page-6.html","bookId":2364,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM"}
