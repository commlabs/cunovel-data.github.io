Shit, West, I told you we should have taped the note to the outside of the box. You didn’t see the note, and I bet you freaked out when you found the money gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest flops back into his chair. “A little overdramatic, don’t you think, Rach? I mean, who else is going to take your money? We said we’d pay you back, and we will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was my money!” I scream. “Give it back! Now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike always, the two continue their conversation as if I don’t matter. Ethan turns to West. “You’d flip if someone took over four thousand dollars from your room. By the way, Rach, what type of part were you planning on buying? You had to be saving for a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you two even try to pretend that you feel bad for stealing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest turns his back to me, preparing to rejoin his game. “We said we’d pay you back. Chill the fuck out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew it. I walk over to West’s desk and begin pulling on drawers, tossing papers and pens and books and crap onto the floor. If they won’t give it to me, then I’ll find it. My brothers shout as I rummage through the room. When they figure out yelling won’t stop me, one of them restrains me from behind. His hands become iron bands around my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m done being weak. I’m done being controlled. I kick and I scream and I only snap out of it when Ethan gets in my face. “Rachel!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy twin’s dark eyes bore into mine. When we were children, those eyes used to be right there when I fell asleep at night and there when I’d wake in the morning. Even when our parents forced us into our own rooms, we’d sneak away to be with each other. For years, we fought to be together and now, we seem forever apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You stole from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest holds my arms at my sides. “I stole from you. Ethan objected. Blame me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at Ethan. He’s been keeping something from me, and like he did with me over the panic attacks, I never asked. Maybe because I never wanted to know. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan presses his lips into a fine line. “Gavin has a gambling addiction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest releases my arms. “Ethan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan throws out his arms. “What? We took over four thousand dollars from her, West. That’s not money you take because you need gas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them argue as I stumble across the items I had tossed on the floor. Gavin, my oldest brother, the head of all of us, the strongest, the leader, has a problem. I sit on the bed and clear my throat, ignoring the raw pain. “How bad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWest shoves his hands in his pockets with such force that his boxers stick out. “Bad. None of us ever meant for it to happen. You know those nights you’d cover for Ethan, we figured out it worked for me, too, so the four of us started hanging.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course they did. Leaving me out would be the thing to do. I rub my forehead as the migraine from the panic attack sets in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We wanted to have fun,” says Ethan. “Away from Mom and Dad. It’s hard on Gavin and Jack. They hate being a part of this family. They look down the hall and they see Colleen’s room. They look at how Mom treated you and they felt like they were reliving the cancer. They saw you and...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey saw her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So one night we went to the riverboat.” West continues Ethan’s story, no doubt hoping I wouldn’t make the connection. “I’d scored me and Ethan some fake IDs. Gavin got hooked and we tried to help, but...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He found other ways to gamble when we stopped him from going to the boat,” finishes Ethan. “He owed some bad people money. Thank God you had enough to pay them off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lower my head into my hands. Isaiah and I are screwed. “You have no idea what you’ve done,” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bed shifts, and I peek to find Ethan sitting beside me and West standing in front of me. Both of them hold their shoulders slouched forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not enabling him.” West clearly believes that what I said means something completely different. “Gavin tried going to Dad, but Dad was too busy to listen, so Gavin came to me. He agreed to get help if I helped him pay the debt. And he’s going to get help. Gavin just didn’t want Dad to know how bad it was, and he never wants Mom to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rach,” says Ethan. “Gavin’s going to rehab after the charity dinner. Dad wants Mom to have one perfect night before Gavin goes and then Dad will tell Mom everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI massage my temples, wishing the throb would disappear. This entire family is one big mess. When I think my legs won’t give out, I stand. Ethan joins me, and West braces his arms as if I’m going to fall. I push past them and go for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going?” asks Ethan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause and choke back the automatic lie. What would this family have been like if Colleen had never died? “I’m going to see Isaiah, and you aren’t going to stop me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 57\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ROLL A GLASS JAR full of nuts against the tool bench at the garage. Completely broken, Rachel sits a few feet from me in the chair Abby dragged out of the office for her when her sobs became too intense for her to stand. Logan leans against the office window with the back of his head resting against the glass. This isn’t his problem, but he treats it like it is. For that, I have respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby crouches in front of Rachel, doing what I should be doing, consoling. Saying the words I should be saying, that’s it’s not her fault and it’ll be okay. Abby’s right. It’s not her fault. She did nothing wrong by protecting our money in her room. Her brothers on the other hand...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab the jar and throw it across the room. Glass shatters against the wall. My chest moves rapidly. We have seven hundred dollars. Four-thousand three hundred dollars short of what we need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Feel better?” asks Logan with absolutely no inflection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head falls back. “Some.” At least the anger is under control. That is, until I get my hands on her brothers. “The nitro system goes in my car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isaiah,” Logan says again. “Rachel’s car is the better one. Add the system to hers. We’ll have a better shot at winning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cross my arms over my chest, unmoved and unconvinced. Movies and television make nitro look like child’s play, but it’s not. The systems are tricky and too many things can go wrong. Even though she won’t be the person drag racing with it, I don’t want her in a car with that type of danger. “Not your call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel wipes her eyes and stands. “Then it’s mine. I don’t understand why you’re fighting us on this. We have a better chance to win with the system in my car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair moves with her frustrated breath. “If you won’t put the system in my car, then let me race against Zach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension cramps my neck and I pop it to the right. Drag racing is dangerous. Nitro is dangerous. If Zach is working with Eric, then Zach is lethal. Rachel is the one thing in my life I can’t lose. Why can’t she see how much I love her? That I need to protect her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan pushes off the wall. “The way I see it, you’re outvoted. It’s her car. If she wants the system in it, install it. Besides, you’ll be the one firing the tanks, not her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I don’t argue, I stay silent, but let my arms drop. Rachel misreads me and wraps herself around me. Last night, I spent a few hours in heaven by holding my angel tight. Rachel went home, and we were both sent to hell. I kiss the top of her head. I promised I’d take care of her, and I’ll do anything to keep that promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s Monday morning and because Pro Performance insists on a high school diploma along with the certification, I have to ignore my problems and go to school. The moment I walk into the building, Abby joins my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re actually going today?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. “Might as well. Occasionally I like to throw people off. By the way, I got my hands on a nitro system.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby matches my strides up the stairs. “Consider it a gift.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI freeze on the landing. “I thought you had to stay financially out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the second floor, Abby walks backward. “You aren’t the only one who had people owing them favors.” She enters the second room on the right and I smirk. I never knew she took honors math.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Holden calls me from the steps below and waits as I head back down. I jack my thumb in the other direction. “I don’t want to be late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll give you a slip,” he says, as if he ran to catch me. “We need to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and follow him. Instead of going to the school’s auto shop, he chooses an empty classroom and closes the door. “What’s going on?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Holden fiddles with his safety glasses. “There were some irregularities with the certification testing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say nothing, having no idea how this involves me. I knew everything on that test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Several of the guys you tested with had the same scores, missing the same questions. They reviewed the tapes and caught them cheating.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t cheat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” says Mr. Holden. “But this scandal has the testing facility questioning everything from that day. They’re zeroing in on you because of your score. They have adults who don’t score as well as you did, so it makes them wonder if you had outside help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slam my books on the desk beside me. “I studied for years for this test.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” says Mr. Holden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t cheat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe runs a hand over his salt-and-pepper hair. “I talked to the facility’s manager. Told him you’re a good kid so he agreed to let you retake the test.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy teeth click together. Retake the test. For once in my life, I followed proper society’s rules, and all I got was a kick in the nuts. “What happens when I ace that one? Are they going to accuse me of cheating again? Because there is no way a street punk foster kid can have a fucking brain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold my hand up, not wanting to hear the answer, and back away. The bell rings. Class has started for everyone else but I don’t see the point of attending anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the hallway, I catch Zach staring at me from a few doors down. Without a word, he slinks into a classroom. There’s no doubt in my mind now that the boy is working for Eric, because the guy I know would have never done something as low as this. Good thing for him that he’s on Eric’s payroll. Otherwise, he’d be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 58\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBESIDES THE TINKLING OF SILVERWARE against plates, dinner is unusually silent. The presence of Gavin and Jack at the dinner table every Monday usually means plenty of banter between my brothers, but each of them appears lost in their own thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long cherry table is made for eight people. Mom and Dad sit at either end. Gavin and Jack are seated closest to Dad. Ethan and West share the middle seats. My chair is next to Mom, and I stare at the only empty seat: the one meant for Colleen. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crash-into-you-pushing-the-limits-3/page-44.html","bookId":2754,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM"}
