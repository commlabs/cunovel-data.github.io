But without headlights, they couldn\u0027t see one from the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at it comin\u0027 down!\" whispered the deputy in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix, sitting beside him at the far end of the motorhome, nodded and put out his newly lit cigarette. It was too damn smoky in there already. But every time they tried to open the door to get some fresh air, the bloody thunderstorm about drowned them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix shook his head disgustedly. Midsummer, three o\u0027clock in the afternoon, and it was probably no more than fifty degrees out there. And the damned sky was green!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKer-plap! went another bolt of lightning, and everyone in the motorhome - which was everyone they had - jumped another foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do wish they\u0027d stop doing that!\" muttered Cat airily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hell,\" said Jack at last. \"I guess there goes today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" agreed Carl, staring out at the storm. \"Funny thing is: we could\u0027ve blown the whole damn mansion up in this stuff and I don\u0027t think even the next-door neighbors would have heard it.\" He looked at Davette and smiled. \"As \u0027next-door\u0027 as this neighborhood gets, I mean,\" be added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavette didn\u0027t smile. She just looked at the floor between her feet and continued hugging her elbows, her face drawn and tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t like being here, thought Felix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he wanted to go to her and do something or say something, but...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t. Too many people around and... and what was he going to say, anyway? They were going to do this one way or another, no matter how she felt. She was the reason they were here, if anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit!\" sputtered Jack Crow. \"I would like to know if they\u0027re here, at least. Joplin! Turn that thing on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t work,\" replied Carl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? Are they busted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re trying to read the house, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t reach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of the storm? It\u0027s only a couple of hundred feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl shook his head. \"It\u0027s not the storm. It\u0027s the location. I could read the house from here if I had a sensor in the house. But you gotta have a sensor on-site.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean already at the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl nodded. \"Or in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now there\u0027s a happy thought,\" offered Cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack looked at him. \"You up to it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat shrugged. \"I wish I had a shower cap,\" he said and began stripping off his chain mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think you\u0027re doing?\" Carl asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m not going in. An outside wall would be close enough, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix thought this was crazy. But he only said, \"Are you sure this is a good idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m sure,\" declared Joplin. \"It\u0027s a shitty idea.\" He looked square at Cat. \"It\u0027s also even stupider than your usual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Carl,\" urged Jack. \"It\u0027s just a matter of him taking it up there and stashing it in the bushes or somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" agreed Cat. \"Just Catting it in and Catting it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Carl Joplin all but erupted. \"Bullshit!\" he bellowed. \"Bullshit! It\u0027s been dark for what? Two hours already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but - \" Cat tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Yeah, but - \u0027 shit! You sit your butt back down or I\u0027ll dribble you from one end of this trailer to the other!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he stood over Cat, huffing and puffing, his arms out like a hungry linebacker, and it got very quiet until Cat spoke, in a small voice: \"Okay, Carl,\" he said, shrugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl nodded firmly. \"Okay,\" he confirmed, still heaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he noticed everyone watching him. He blinked, hesitated, then seemed to get more angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We meeting at Felix\u0027s bar, that Antwar place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl turned to Felix. \"You sure you got enough room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine!\" barked Carl. He looked around at the others. \"Fine,\" he repeated. \"I\u0027ll meet you there. I\u0027m gonna get some more bullets for the Gunman and a suit for the kid.\" He nodded toward Deputy Thompson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around at the others another moment, trying to think of something to say. Then he grabbed up the Blazer keys and stomped out into the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could just hear the Blazer\u0027s engine start over the storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get it,\" wondered Kirk out loud. \"What was he so mad about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabelle smiled. So did Jack and Cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t really mad, dear,\" Annabelle assured him. \"He was just worried about Cat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk nodded slowly. \"So that threat...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that wasn\u0027t a threat,\" Annabelle said quickly. \"That was a hug.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk looked at her. Then the dawning showed in his eyes. He smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I get it. Carl\u0027s shy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat and Jack nodded at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" muttered Cat, \"that\u0027s one way of putting it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix didn\u0027t much care how they put it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get going,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" replied Jack. He looked at Davette. \"Which way at the stop sign?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up vaguely, still clearly disturbed at where she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, why don\u0027t you turn right? No... Yes, right. And then...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix shook his head. \"Go straight. Then take the nex... Never mind. I\u0027ll drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he climbed over into the driver\u0027s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack studied him. \"You know this area?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix shrugged. \"I grew up about three blocks from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Davette\u0027s head came up quickly. \"You did?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"DeLoche Avenue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavette\u0027s head tilted toward him. She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How nice,\" breathed Cat. \"They\u0027re both aristocrats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cat,\" snarled Felix, starting the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Cat held up both palms in the air. \"I know. I know,\" he said. And then he added. \"But it\u0027s still sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix snarled as he made the motorhome move through the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to stop here,\" announced Annabelle as they passed a shopping center a few miles later. \"There. At the pharmacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack frowned, looked at his watch. \"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That,\" purred Annabelle sweetly, \"is none of your business. Felix, pull up close so we don\u0027t get wet and... Jack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her palm out to him and pointed to it with a long fingernail. Jack shrugged and dugout some money and started piling bills onto her palm. When she had about three times what they needed, Annabelle said, \"Stop. We\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she and Davette were out the door and tripping through the rain to the brightly lit automatic doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men just sat there, not talking, just waiting for the women to spend the money. Jack watched the deputy find himself a comfortable spot on the motorhome\u0027s sofa. Even in civilian clothes, the kid still looked like he was wearing a uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ought to talk to him about paying him, Jack thought. But he doesn\u0027t seem worried about it. Just slipped right into us. We were lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix sat drumming his fingers on the steering wheel, looking anxious but unworried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven you\u0027re coming along, Gunman, thought Jack next. That is, as far as you\u0027re willing to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think they\u0027ll remember cigarettes?\" Cat asked suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk waved at the smoky air. \"Hope not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey remembered. Felix cranked up the motorhome and they steamed through the rainy city to his bar. He was worried about the Antwar. He\u0027d only had one chance to talk to them since he\u0027d been with the Team, and he knew what happened to the staff of a cocktail lounge without someone standing over them. He had some pretty good people, but still...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it was raining! And the thunder and the lightning - it took him thirty minutes to cross town, using his headlights the entire time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt really does look like nighttime out there, he thought as be finally pulled onto his Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat was sitting behind him playing with Carl\u0027s detector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Felix! Maybe I\u0027ll quit, too, and write a book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smart move,\" said Felix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be all about a gay vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix frowned, Jack and Annabelle looked at one another and groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to hear the title?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. What\u0027s the title?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027The Tooth Fairy,\u0027 \"replied Cat happily, just as Felix pulled the motorhome up to the Antwar\u0027s front door and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the detector in Cat\u0027s hands went wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeep-Beep-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-... and Felix yanked the wheel away from the curb tromped on the gas and the huge motorhome skidded, righted itself, then vaulted down the street, fishtailing at the first turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Felix didn\u0027t let off. He knew what that meant! He knew! And he made that bloody jump!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felix!\" Jack yelled to him a few blocks later. \"They aren\u0027t coming!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix\u0027s foot hesitated over the throttle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure! Slow this thing down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix reluctantly obeyed, slowing it all the way down, finally pulling over to a stop at the curb and turning off key. Then he just sat there, in the silence and the rain, breathing hard, before he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They found me,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen: \"They know me, too. And they\u0027ve found me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s worse than that, Gunman, thought Jack Crow. Know you. They\u0027ve found you. And they\u0027re after you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t say this. He didn\u0027t say anything. He like he knew what Felix was feeling. And he couldn\u0027t but have sympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you\u0027re in it now, Felix, he thought. In to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Crow did not know how Felix felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix did not know how he felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt... nothing, really. Empty and numb and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew this would happen, he thought again and and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carl!\" whispered Cat suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" asked the Deputy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they thought enough to have somebody waiting Felix\u0027s bar - on the off chance he\u0027d be there...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then they\u0027re bound to have somebody at the house,\" Jack finished for him. And he was already Felix out of the driver\u0027s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get dressed,\" he told them and started the engine once more. \"We\u0027ll drop the ladies off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carl!\" whispered Cat again, almost to himself. He turned and looked at Annabelle\u0027s pale face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks like I feel, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl!
