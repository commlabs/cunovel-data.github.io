No one lurked near the metallic ashtrays. But then the double doors opened, and someone stepped onto the pavement. After the sun glare subsided, Iris shimmered into view. Emily rolled down the window. “You’re here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris gave her a strange look. “Where else would I be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily unlocked the car doors, and Iris climbed inside. Once they were on their way, Emily glanced at the Bloomingdale’s carrier bag in Iris’s arms. “You went shopping?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sort of,” Iris sang. She tossed something in Emily’s face. “For you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stared at the plaid scarf in her lap. It had a Burberry label. “Is this real?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope so,” Iris said. “I got your mom one, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Iris . . .” Emily trailed off. She’d always wanted a Burberry scarf . . . but not a stolen one. Still, she was oddly touched that Iris had thought of her. And her mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The light’s green,” Iris said loudly. “Turn left here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily turned on her signal. They were driving in the direction of Delaware. She glanced sidelong at Iris. “Where are we going, anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To Keppler Creek,” Iris answered. “I want to take out a paddleboat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily rolled to a stop at another light. “I don’t think the boats are open for the season yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris scoffed. “So we steal one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily looked at her hard. “I’m not stealing a paddleboat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris gave her a warning stare. “Come on. And besides, we’re not stealing it—just borrowing it for a little bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily felt a pang of longing. She and Jordan had borrowed a beautiful glass-bottomed boat in Puerto Rico—and it had been easy, for Jordan at least. They’d had their first kiss out on the water. It was the most public kiss Emily had ever had with a girl—there were tons of other sailboats, Jet Skis, and party ships nearby, with many people on board—and yet she hadn’t felt uncomfortable in the slightest. She missed Jordan so much she’d taken to sleeping in one of the T-shirts that she’d let her borrow for the cruise. If Emily breathed in hard enough, she could still smell Jordan’s jasmine perfume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must have sighed dreamily, because Iris giggled. “Who are you thinking about? A girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Emily said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris crossed her arms over her chest. “You can tell me. I’m not gonna judge you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily felt her cheeks flush. “Fine. I was thinking about this girl I met a few weeks ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s her name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jordan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris crossed and uncrossed her legs. “What’s she like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily smiled, trying to think of a simple way to sum up Jordan. “She’s funny. And brave. And beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she the first girl you’ve liked since Ali?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily slowed down to take a turn. “I had a girlfriend for a little while last year. Her name was Maya. She was cool, but she was also a little pushy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris twisted a silver ring around her finger. “Sounds like you fell for Ali all over again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily laughed uneasily, then glanced at Iris. “Was Ali pushy with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris wrapped a tendril of hair around her finger. “I guess. She was always manipulating me into doing things I didn’t want to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That sounds like her,” Emily said. Until she remembered: They were talking about two different Alis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came to a T in the road, and Iris told her to turn right. “So will you tell me about your crush?” Emily asked, remembering what Iris had said the other day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris twisted her mouth. “It’s boring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on. I told you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral houses flew past the window before Iris spoke again. “His name is Tripp,” she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily nodded, suddenly remembering Iris’s list. Find Tripp, it had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was a patient at The Preserve, too,” Iris went on. “We were really great friends, and things were definitely going in a romantic direction. Until they let him out. He promised to visit me every Saturday, but he never did. And we can’t make calls or send e-mails at The Preserve, so I had no idea where he was. I never heard from him again.” She sniffed loudly. “Then again, who wants a girlfriend in the loony bin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you have no idea what happened to him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.” Iris tied the Burberry scarf she’d stolen for Emily’s mom into a messy knot. “Which is why I want to find him. He owes me an explanation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily paused at a stop sign, waiting for two girls walking a standard poodle to pass. “Why were you at The Preserve in the first place?” she asked, choosing her words delicately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris snickered. “Isn’t it obvious?” She waved her hands up and down her frail, skinny body. “Anorexia nervosa. Sometimes, I choose not to eat. For days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily blinked hard. “Has being there . . . helped?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris’s shoulders rose and fell. “Some days yes, some days no. My therapist insists that I do the eating thing for attention. My dad left when I was really little. My mom had to work a bunch of jobs to support us, and then she started dating all these guys, each one worse than the last. She had no time for me anymore. Getting skinnier and skinnier got her to sit up and notice. But then I got dehydrated and ended up in the hospital for malnourishment. The doctor had this whole medical plan for me, and my mom tried to be there for a while, but she just couldn’t do it. So off to The Preserve I went.” She sucked in her teeth. “My home away from home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she paying for you to be at The Preserve?” Emily asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris smiled crookedly. “Her new boyfriend is. He’s rolling in cash—lucky me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily knew Iris wanted her to laugh, but it really wasn’t funny. Thinking of Iris’s mom, she felt a renewed sense of gratitude for her own family. Imagine if, instead of caring for Emily with ice cream and storybooks when she’d had her appendix out in sixth grade, her mother had declared Emily a burden and sent her off to a facility. Even Emily’s banishment to Iowa after she’d been outed by A had been short-lived: Her parents came to their senses quickly and begged for Emily’s forgiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp ahead on the road was a wooden sign that read KEPPLER CREEK STATE PARK. Emily pulled into a space in the parking lot and shut off the engine. A lake shimmered in the distance, but there was no one in the water; it was still too cold. The rental booth was shuttered, and there wasn’t a single paddleboat anywhere. Only a few fishermen in Woolrich plaid jackets sat on the other side of the pond, staring at their fishing poles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris got out of the car and surveyed the scene. “Well, this sucks,” she grumbled. “Now what are we going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily wandered over to a shed where the boats probably were kept, but when she tried the lock, it was bolted tight. “Is there something else you want to do instead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris didn’t answer. When Emily turned around, Iris was standing next to a tall oak tree, its branches still bare. There was a strange, faraway look on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” Emily asked, walking over to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris turned. “I used to come here when I was a lot younger with school friends. When Ali and I were at The Preserve together, we found out that she used to come here, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She did?” Emily asked, cocking her head. That didn’t make sense—the DiLaurentises had a bunch of kayaks, but they took them to Pecks Pond, which was much closer to Rosewood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris nodded. “She said she loved it here. She said she couldn’t wait to come back when she got out of the hospital.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shoved the toe of her sneaker into a tuft of dried grass. “Do you think she came here after she was released?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely.” Iris leaned against the tree trunk. “She even made plans. We weren’t allowed to watch TV at The Preserve, but we heard things. Even the nurses wanted to know what happened to poor Courtney DiLaurentis’s murdered sister. One had a portable radio, and we gathered near her office when the report came in that Ian Thomas had been arrested. Ali got this excited look on her face, and she kept glancing at her watch. My parents are coming, she kept saying. I just know it. They’re coming today. And then I’m going to Keppler Creek Park. We had no idea how she knew for sure that she was getting out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know how she knew,” Emily interjected. “Ali’s parents hid her away at The Preserve because they feared she had killed her sister—which, of course, she did. But when Ian was arrested, they thought they’d made a horrible mistake and immediately had her released.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That makes sense,” Iris said. “She seemed thrilled that Ian was arrested, too. At the time, I thought it was because she was glad someone had gotten caught, but maybe she was just glad that someone else had been pegged for something she did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait a minute.” A brisk wind kicked up, blowing hair into Emily’s face. “You didn’t know Ali killed Courtney?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris looked at her crazily. “No way.” She turned back to the tree, chipping away a piece of bark with her nail. “Anyway, her parents did show up that day, just like she predicted. As they were signing paperwork to check her out, Ali was packing up her stuff in our room. And she mentioned Keppler Creek again. She was like, This is awesome. I’m going to Keppler Creek as soon as I’m free. I’m going to see my best friend in the world. I can’t wait to see him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill whizzed up Emily’s spine. Him. “She was coming to meet a guy. Her boyfriend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So her boyfriend wasn’t a patient. He was on the outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corners of Iris’s mouth twisted into a smile. “Aren’t you clever? You’re right. It was someone on the outside. He used to visit her all the time. And I bet he carved this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped away from the tree and pointed at something in the bark. There, etched into the wood, were the words I love Ali D in a heart. At the bottom was the date. It was November of last year, a few days after Ian had been arrested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s breath caught, thinking of the time she’d carved Ali’s initials into a tree. If only whoever had cut this heart into the bark had added his initials, too, like Emily had. She touched the letters, then looked around for any video cameras on the nearby snack bar and bathroom structures. Unfortunately, there were none. Nothing had recorded Ali and whoever this person was meeting . . . but it had happened. I’m going to see my best friend in the world. Who? Had this guy transformed into Ali’s helper, the new A?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed Iris’s hand. “Please tell me his name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA torn look crossed Iris’s face. For a moment, she looked like she was going to tell, but then she yanked her arm away and started running toward the beach. “Hey, I know what we can do instead of take a boat out!” she called over her shoulder. “Skinny-dip!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crushed-pretty-little-liars-13/page-19.html","bookId":2389,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM"}
