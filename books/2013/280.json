Wood, sod and chinking bowed inward, and as the demon fell, the entire wall on that side of the doorframe went with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what am I doing? Damn me, what am 1 doing? Bottle leapt upright, desperately drawing on whatever warren first answered his summons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe axe-wielding demon surged towards Corabb. The wedge-blade slashed its deadly arc. Struck Corabb’s shield at an oblique angle, caromed upward and would have caught the side of Corabb’s head if not for the man’s stumbling, left knee buckling as he inadvertently stepped into a groundhog hole, losing his balance and pitching to one side. His answering sword-swing, which should have been batted aside by the demon’s swing-through, dipped well under it, the edge thunking hard into the demon’s right knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt howled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next instant Stormy, flanked by his heavies, arrived. Swords chopping, shields clattering up against the wounded Kenryll’ah. Blood and pieces of meat spattered the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother bellow from the demon as it launched itself backward, clear of the deadly infighting, gaining room to swing the wood-axe in a horizontal slash that crumpled all three shields lifting to intercept it. Banded metal and wood exploded in all directions. Saltlick grunted from a broken arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Clear!’ someone shouted, and Stormy and his heavies flung themselves backward. Corabb, still lying on the ground, rolled after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon stood, momentarily confused, readying its axe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiles’s hand-thrown sharper struck it on its left temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBright light, deafening crack, smoke, and the demon was reeling away, one side of its bestial face obliterated into red pulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet Bottle sensed the creature’s mind already righting itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler was yelling. ‘Withdraw! Everyone!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummoning all he had, Bottle assailed the demon’s brain with Mockra. Felt it recoil, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the ruined farmhouse, the second Kenryll’ah was beginning to clamber free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiles tossed another sharper into the wreckage. A second snapping explosion, more smoke, more of the building falling down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re pulling out!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottle saw Koryk and Tarr hesitate, desperate to close in on the stunned demon. At that moment Fiddler and Cuttle arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hood’s balls!’ Fiddler swore. ‘Get moving, Koryk! Tarr! Move!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler was making some strange gesture. ‘We go south! South!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaltlick and Shortnose swung in that direction, but Stormy pulled them back. ‘That’s called misdirection, y’damned idiots!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe squads reforming as they moved, eastward, now in a run. The shock of Uru Hela’s death and the battle that followed keeping them quiet now, just their gasping breaths, the sounds of armour like broken crockery underfoot. Behind them, smoke billowing from the farmhouse. An axe-wielding demon staggering about in a daze, blood streaming from its head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamned sharper should have cracked that skull wide open, Bottle well knew. Thick bones, I guess. Kenryll’ah, aye, not their underlings. No, Highborn of Aral Gamelon, he was sure of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy started up. ‘Hood-damned demon farmers! They got Hood-damned demon farmers! Sowing seeds, yanking teats, spinnin’ wool-and chopping strangers to pieces! Gesler, old friend, 1 hate this place, you hear me? Hate it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Keep quiet!’ Fiddler snarled. ‘We was lucky enough all those sharpers didn’t mince us on the road-now your bleating’s telling those demons exactly where we’re going!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I wasn’t going to lose any more,’ Stormy retorted in a bitter growl. ‘I’d swore it-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Should’ve known better,’ Gesler cut in. ‘Damn you, Stormy, don’t make promises you can’t keep-we’re in a fight here and people are going to die. No more promises, got me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA surly nod was his only answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ran on, the end of a long, long night now tumbled over into day. For the others, Bottle knew, there’d be rest ahead. Somewhere. But not him. No, he’d need to work illusions to hide them. He’d need to flit from creature to creature out in the forest, checking on their backtrail. He needed to keep these fools alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrawling from the wreckage of the farmhouse, the demon prince spat out some blood, then settled back onto his haunches and looked blearily around. His brother stood nearby, cut and lashed about the body and half his face torn away. Well, it had never been much of a face anyway, and most of it would grow back. Except maybe for that eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brother saw him and staggered over. ‘I’m never going to believe you again,’ he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-280.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
