However, the first wave of invading cultivators immediately began to reinforce the rift between the two Mountains and Seas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gap was how they could enter the Eighth Mountain and Sea, and as soon as they appeared, they began to set up numerous spell formations, almost like garrisons. They also attacked the rift itself in an attempt to open it wider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven more impressively, a large group of Seventh Mountain and Sea cultivators joined forces to summon an enormous nine-headed dragon. It was pitch black, and when it roared into the gap, it began to grow in size, causing the rift to rip open wider and wider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinds screamed, echoing out through the entire Eighth Mountain and Sea, carrying with them the voice of the Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am the great Sima Dao, Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea! Today... I declare war on the Eighth Mountain and Sea! All ye, shall either surrender, or die!” His voice was as cold as ice as it rang out through the entirety of the Eighth Mountain and Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea would not leave his home Mountain and Sea at this time. He would wait until the majority of the warrior cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea were deployed before making his appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he would most certainly call out... and declare war!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shocking words caused the Eighth Mountain and Sea to tremble. All cultivators and all sects heard him, and they were left in a state of shock and disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This.... This....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Seventh Mountain and Sea is invading!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Mountain and Sea War. A legendary Mountain and Sea War! I can’t believe it’s actually going to happen right now!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is too sudden. How could this be happening? The Seventh Mountain and Sea is actually inciting a Mountain and Sea War. But we’ve hardly had any dealings with them at all!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in the Eighth Mountain and Sea was shocked, especially the Heavengod Alliance. Orders were immediately dispatched calling for everyone to assemble as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe auxiliary branches of the Heavengod Alliance were included in that, as was the other of the Eighth Mountain and Sea’s great clans, the Han Clan. Grand protective spell formations were activated, and all stations were manned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA great storm was coming!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese preparations began in the very instant that the Seventh Mountain and Sea began to come through the rift. At the same time, back in the Meng Clan, the invading cultivators were cowering in front of Meng Hao. But then they sensed what was happening, and their expressions flickered with excitement and even joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Reinforcements from the Seventh Mountain and Sea are coming!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hahaha! The Mountain and Sea War is about to begin. We’re on the side of the Seventh Mountain and Sea, and they’re definitely going to win the war!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You in the Meng Clan, war will soon be upon you! Why haven’t you surrendered yet?!” The shouts of the invading cultivators turned into sound waves that rolled out across the cultivators of the Meng Clan, including Grandma Meng and the five seriously injured Dao Realm Patriarchs. The Patriarchs’ faces fell, completely draining of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the traitorous members of the Meng Clan, they threw their heads back and laughed uproariously. They sounded arrogant, and in very high spirits. They had just been quite cowed by Meng Hao, and now that the reinforcements from the Seventh Mountain and Sea were on the way they had gained their confidence back. In their minds, the threat of Meng Hao was not so deadly now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey firmly believed that both the Meng Clan and Meng Hao would now be struck with indecision, an indecision which... would ensure their own safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe invading cultivators weren’t stupid. The first to fall back were the black-robed men from the Seventh Mountain and Sea. They knew that since reinforcements had come, they were already in the superior position. Since they could not wipe out the Meng Clan immediately, they needed to consider their own safety first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn their minds, since the Meng Clan was hesitating, it was the perfect chance to retreat. Certainly, the Meng Clan wouldn\u0027t dare to pursue them now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was what the other invading sects were also thinking, as were the traitorous Meng Clan cultivators. Soon, everyone was falling back, preparing to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, their predictions were completely correct. The Meng Clan cultivators, including the five Dao Realm Patriarchs, stood there silently, not daring to continue the fight or attempt to prevent their enemies from leaving. When they thought about the imminent Mountain and Sea War, and the arrival of reinforcements from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, the entire Meng Clan was struck with stifling pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the invaders had miscalculated regarding one person in particular, and that was... Meng Hao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I say you people could leave?” he said coolly, hovering there in the starry sky. The Meng Clan was worried about the Seventh Mountain and Sea, as was the Heavengod Alliance. Meng Hao, on the other hand, couldn’t care less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only people he cared about in the Eighth Mountain and Sea were his Grandmother and her people. Whether or not everyone else lived or died didn\u0027t have anything to do with him. Nor could he really do anything to stop what was happening. He knew that soon, a massive and shocking war would strike the Mountain and Sea Realm. The two ancient forces outside of the 33 Heavens were coming, and that war... was unavoidable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words he had just spoken were like an icy wind that filled the invaders’ hearts with shock. They looked back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold voice rang out from within the crowds, “The reinforcements from the Seventh Mountain and Sea are already here. You\u0027re going to have your hands full defending your Meng Clan, do you really think you can spare the effort to stop us from leaving?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s expression was calm as his eyes scanned the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took a moment to find the cultivator who had just spoken, and the power in Meng Hao’s gaze suddenly rocketed up. A moment later, the man exploded. Meng Hao then leaped forward, waving his hand to summon the howling Blood Demon, which instantly slashed into the enemy forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blackpod imps screeched as they began to unleash slaughter. The Blood Spirit and the mastiff also joined in, murderous auras raging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You had the gall to invade this place, so you won\u0027t be leaving. I don’t really care about some war between the Eighth and Seventh Mountain and Sea, but I can tell you that I hate traitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whether you are a traitor to your clan or a traitor to the Mountain and Sea in which you live, it\u0027s all the same.” Meng Hao’s voice was cold as he once again waved his hand, unleashing his Ancient mana to summon numerous mountains, which began to descend from all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese mountains no longer surged with Immortal qi, but rather, had an ancient and archaic feel to them, as if they had existed for many, many years. These were ancient mountains, and as they appeared, they sent powerful ripples out into the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked coldly out at the Meng Clan cultivators, including the five Patriarchs. When his gaze fell on those Patriarchs, they immediately began to tremble. “Meng Clan,” he roared, “what are you doing standing there!? ATTACK!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had seen Meng Hao’s terrifying Ancient Tribulation, had watched as Xiao Yihan fled on his heels, and had personally witnessed Meng Hao’s horrifying power. Gritting their teeth, they decided to comply with his orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoaring, the five Patriarchs charged forward. “Cultivators of the Meng Clan. ATTACK! Slaughter all of the rebels and invaders!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other clan members hesitated for a moment, then joined voices in a powerful battle cry as they shot forward in attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battle resumed. However, this time, the Meng Clan was not in the weak position. Instead, the blood of the rebels and invaders flowed. Miserable screams rang out as endless lives were cut short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao took a step forward and vanished. When he reappeared, he was in front of a black-robed man, one of the old Dao Realm cultivators who had come along with Xiao Yihan. As soon as Meng Hao materialized, the old man bit his tongue, spraying out a mouthful of blood as he fell back at top speed. However, even as he did so, Meng Hao waved his finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was simple motion, but the result was that the starry sky shook as an invisible force coalesced around the man, instantly weighing down on him with incredible pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like the power of the Mountains and Seas themselves smashing down onto the old man, invoking a bloodcurdling scream. Even as the sound left his mouth, he was crushed to a bloody pulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mountain and Sea power,” Meng Hao murmured. He could now more clearly sense the power of the Mountain and Sea Realm inside of him, and also knew how to control some of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the other Dao Realm experts saw what he had just done, they were shocked. Just as they began to flee, Meng Hao turned to look at them and stepped forward, appearing in front of another Dao Realm expert. He waved his hand, causing an explosive wind to shoot out. Wherever it passed, screams rang out and powerful experts were wiped out of existence regardless of how they tried to defend themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Run! Run away!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A jinx! This guy is an evil jinx!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, the Seventh Mountain and Sea is going to wipe out the Meng Clan eventually!!” As the screams rang out, the beleaguered invaders and the Meng Clan traitors were overwhelmed by the fear of being killed, and could think of only one thing: how to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, only half of the original force of tens of thousands remained behind. Everyone was scattering, fleeing as quickly as they had ever moved, even using secret magics. The Meng Clan cultivators were hard-pressed to catch them, and soon, the invaders had completely scattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I wage war, I don\u0027t leave survivors,” Meng Hao said coolly. He stamped down with his right foot, causing a sea of flames to roar out. It was none other than Essence of Divine Flame, and it rapidly spread out with complete mercilessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took the blink of an eye for the Divine Flame to sweep out, surrounding the fleeing cultivators. It moved far, far faster than they could, and soon formed a ring around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao waved his hand, and the ring of fire transformed into a flaming wall, completely trapping the enemies and locking them down. Now, all avenues of escape were sealed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take no prisoners,” Meng Hao said, his voice cool. He waved his sleeve, causing a fierce wind to kick up. At the same time, the Meng Clan cultivators’ eyes turned bright red, and they charge forward in attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiserable screams rang out without end, and the sounds of slaughter rose up. Meng Hao focused on the Dao Realm experts, and let the members of the Meng Clan handle the general slaughter, which also served the purpose of getting them used to fierce fighting and warfare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne side fought brilliantly, the other screamed in terror. This was not a large-scale battle, and considering how mismatched the forces were, it only took a few hours for the traitors and invaders to be... completely put to death!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Meng Clan had paid a heavy price, and suffered many casualties. However, the survivors had experienced the baptism of battle, and had been transformed. Although they still felt fear, the fire of slaughter burned in their eyes. Soon, quietness spread out across the battlefield, and slowly, all of the members of the Meng Clan turned to look at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to say who said it first, but soon, everyone was kowtowing toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey joined their voices together and called out from the bottoms of their lungs, causing everything to shake. Surrounded by the mangled corpses and skeletons of their enemies, they shouted out in the starry sky: “Greetings, Patriarch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1280\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1282\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1281","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
