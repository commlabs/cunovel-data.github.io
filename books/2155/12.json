But there\u0027s nothing our parents did together, in public or in private, that we would not know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a brief instant Jessica found herself returning to the reaction which had come over her out there beside the qanat, but now she focused that reaction upon Ghanima.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He probably spoke of your Duke\u0027s \u0027rutting sensuality,\u0027 \" Ghanima said. \"Sometimes Leto needs a bridle on his mouth!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there nothing these twins cannot profane? Jessica wondered, moving from shock to outrage to revulsion. How dared they speak of her Leto\u0027s sensuality? Of course a man and woman who loved each other would share the pleasure of their bodies! It was a private and beautiful thing, not to be paraded in casual conversation between a child and an adult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChild and adult!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly Jessica realized that neither Leto nor Ghanima had done this casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Jessica remained silent, Ghanima said: \"We\u0027ve shocked you. I apologize for both of us. Knowing Leto, I know he didn\u0027t consider apologizing. Sometimes when he\u0027s following a particular scent, he forgets how different we are... from you, for instance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica thought: And that is why you both do this, of course.

When you try the hardest, just then, you most often fail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima touched her grandmother\u0027s arm. \"Your son left many things unsaid which yet must be said, even to you.

Dear Stil. Our father was his \u0027Doctor of Beasts\u0027 and Stil was no more than the green snail hidden in its shell.\" She hummed the tune from which she\u0027d taken these words.

But the intellect cannot react thus without involving the entire organism. Such an organism may be recognized by its burning, driving behavior. And thus it is with a society treated as organism. But here we encounter an old inertia. Societies move to the goading of ancient, reactive impulses. They demand permanence. Any attempt to display the universe of impermanence arouses rejection patterns, fear, anger, and despair. Then how do we explain the acceptance of prescience? Simply: the giver of prescient visions, because he speaks of an absolute (permanent) realization, may be greeted with joy by humankind even while predicting the most dire events. -The Book of Leto, After Harq al-Ada\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s liking fighting in the dark,\" Alia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paced the Council Chamber in angry strides, moving from the tall silvery draperies which softened the morning sun at the eastern windows to the divans grouped beneath decorated wall panels at the room\u0027s opposite end. Her sandals crossed spice-fiber rugs, parquet wood, tiles of giant garnet and once more, rugs. At last she stood over Irulan and Idaho, who sat facing each other on divans of grey whale fur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho had resisted returning from Tabr, but she had sent peremptory orders. The abduction of Jessica was more important than ever now, but it had to wait. Idaho\u0027s mentat perceptions were required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These things are cut from the same pattern,\" Alia said. \"They stink of a far-reaching plot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps not,\" Irulan ventured, but she glanced questioningly at Idaho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia\u0027s face lapsed into an undisguised sneer. How could Irulan be that innocent? Unless... Alia bent a sharp and questioning stare onto the Princess. Irulan wore a simple black aba robe which matched the shadows in her spice-indigo eyes. Her blonde hair was tied in a tight coil at the nape of her neck, accenting a face thinned and toughened by years on Arrakis. She still retained the haughtiness she\u0027d learned in the court of her father, Shaddam IV, and Alia often felt that this prideful attitude could mask the thoughts of a conspirator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho lounged in the black-and-green uniform of an Atreides House Guard, no insignia. It was an affectation which was secretly resented by many of Alia\u0027s actual guards, especially the amazons, who gloried in insignia of office. They did not like the plain presence of the ghola-swordmaster-mentat, the more so because he was the husband of their mistress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the tribes want the Lady Jessica reinstated into the Regency Council,\" Idaho said. \"How can that -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They make unanimous demand!\" Alia said, pointing to an embossed sheet of spice-paper on the divan beside Irulan. \"Farad\u0027n is one thing, but this... this has the stink of other alignments!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does Stilgar think?\" Irulan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His signature\u0027s on that paper!\" Alia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if he...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could he deny the mother of his god?\" Alia sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho looked up at her, thinking: That\u0027s awfully close to the edge with Irulan! Again he wondered why Alia had brought him back here when she knew that he was needed at Sietch Tabr if the abduction plot were to be carried off. Was it possible she\u0027d heard about the message sent to him by The Preacher? This thought filled his breast with turmoil. How could that mendicant mystic know the secret signal by which Paul Atreides had always summoned his swordmaster? Idaho longed to leave this pointless meeting and return to the search for an answer to that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no doubt that The Preacher has been off-planet,\" Alia said. \"The Guild wouldn\u0027t dare deceive us in such a thing. I will have him -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful!\" Irulan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed, have a care,\" Idaho said. \"Half the planet believe him to be -\" He shrugged. \"- your brother.\" And Idaho hoped he had carried this off with a properly casual attitude. How had the man known that signal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if he\u0027s a courier, or a spy of the -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s made contact with no one from CHOAM or House Corrino,\" Irulan said. \"We can be sure of -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can be sure of nothing!\" Alia did not try to hide her scorn. She turned her back on Irulan, faced Idaho. He knew why he was here! Why didn\u0027t he perform as expected? He was in Council because Irulan was here. The history which had brought a Princess of House Corrino into the Atreides fold could never be forgotten. Allegiance, once changed, could change again. Duncan\u0027s mentat powers should be searching for flaws, for subtle deviations in Irulan\u0027s behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho stirred, glanced at Irulan. There were times when he resented the straight-line necessities imposed on mentat performance. He knew what Alia was thinking. Irulan would know it as well. But this Princess-wife to Paul Muad\u0027Dib had overcome the decisions which had made her less than the royal concubine, Chani. There could be no doubt of Irulan\u0027s devotion to the royal twins. She had renounced family and Bene Gesserit in dedication to the Atreides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother is part of this plot!\" Alia insisted. \"For what other reason would the Sisterhood send her back here at a time such as this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hysteria isn\u0027t going to help us,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia whirled away from him, as he\u0027d known she would. It helped him that he did not have to look at that once-beloved face which was now so twisted by alien possession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Irulan said, \"the Guild can\u0027t be completely trusted for -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Guild!\" Alia sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t rule out the enmity of the Guild or the Bene Gesserit,\" Idaho said. \"But we must assign them special categories as essentially passive combatants. The Guild will live up to its basic rule: Never Govern. They\u0027re a parasitic growth, and they know it. They won\u0027t do anything to kill the organism which keeps them alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their idea of which organism keeps them alive may be different from ours,\" Irulan drawled. It was the closest she ever came to a sneer, that lazy tone of voice which said: \"You missed a point, mentat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia appeared puzzled. She had not expected Irulan to take this tack. It was not the kind of view which a conspirator would want examined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt,\" Idaho said. \"But the Guild won\u0027t come out overtly against House Atreides. The Sisterhood, on the other hand, might risk a certain kind of political break which -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they do, it\u0027ll be through a front: someone or some group they can disavow,\" Irulan said. \"The Bene Gesserit haven\u0027t existed all of these centuries without knowing the value of self-effacement. They prefer being behind the throne, not on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelf-effacement? Alia wondered. Was that Irulan\u0027s choice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Precisely the point I make about the Guild,\" Idaho said. He found the necessities of argument and explanation helpful. They kept his mind from other problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia strode back toward the sunlit windows. She knew Idaho\u0027s blind spot; every mentat had it. They had to make pronouncements. This brought about a tendency to depend upon absolutes, to see finite limits. They knew this about themselves. It was part of their training. Yet they continued to act beyond self-limiting parameters. I should\u0027ve left him at Sietch Tabr, Alia thought. It would\u0027ve been better to just turn Irulan over to Javid for questioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin her skull, Alia heard a rumbling voice: \"Exactly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up! Shut up! Shut up! she thought. A dangerous mistake beckoned her in these moments and she could not recognize its outlines. All she could sense was the danger. Idaho had to help her out of this predicament. He was a mentat. Mentats were necessary. The human-computer replaced the mechanical devices destroyed by the Butlerian Jihad. Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind! But Alia longed now for a compliant machine. They could not have suffered from Idaho\u0027s limitations. You could never distrust a machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia heard Irulan\u0027s drawling voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A feint within a feint within a feint within a feint,\" Irulan said. \"We all know the accepted pattern of attack upon power. I don\u0027t blame Alia for her suspicions. Of course she suspects everyone - even us. Ignore that for the moment, though. What remains as the prime arena of motives, the most fertile source of danger to the Regency?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CHOAM,\" Idaho said, his voice mentat-flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia allowed herself a grim smile. The Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles! But House Atreides dominated CHOAM with fifty-one percent of its shares. The Priesthood of Muad\u0027Dib held another five percent, pragmatic acceptance by the Great Houses that Dune controlled the priceless melange. Not without reason was the spice often called \"the secret coinage.\" Without melange, the Spacing Guild\u0027s heighliners could not move. Melange precipitated the \"navigation trance\" by which a translight pathway could be \"seen\" before it was traveled. Without melange and its amplification of the human immunogenic system, life expectancy for the very rich degenerated by a factor of at least four. Even the vast middle class of the Imperium ate diluted melange in small sprinklings with at least one meal a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Alia had heard the mentat sincerity in Idaho\u0027s voice, a sound which she\u0027d been awaiting with terrible expectancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHOAM. The Combine Honnete was much more than House Atreides, much more than Dune, much more than the Priesthood or melange. It was inkvines, whale fur, shigawire, Ixian artifacts and entertainers, trade in people and places, the Hajj, those products which came from the borderline legality of Tleilaxu technology; it was addictive drugs and medical techniques; it was transportation (the Guild) and all of the supercomplex commerce of an empire which encompassed thousands of known planets plus some which fed secretly at the fringes, permitted there for services rendered. When Idaho said CHOAM, he spoke of a constant ferment, intrigue within intrigue, a play of powers where the shift of one duodecimal point in interest payments could change the ownership of an entire planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia returned to stand over the two seated on the divans. \"Something specific about CHOAM bothers you?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s always the heavy speculative stockpiling of spice by certain Houses,\" Irulan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia slapped her hands against her own thighs, then gestured at the embossed spice-paper beside Irulan. \"That demand doesn\u0027t intrigue you, coming as it does -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right!\" Idaho barked. \"Out with it. What\u0027re you withholding? You know better than to deny the data and still expect me to function as -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There has been a recent very significant increase in trade for people with four specific specialties,\" Alia said. And she wondered if this would be truly new information for this pair. \"Which specialties?\" Irulan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swordmasters, twisted mentats from Tleilax, conditioned medics from the Suk school, and fincap accountants, most especially the latter. Why would questionable bookkeeping be in demand right now?\" She directed the question at Idaho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunction as a mentat he thought. Well, that was better than dwelling on what Alia had become. He focused on her words, replaying them in his mind mentat fashion. Swordmasters? That had been his own calling once. Swordmasters were, of course, more than personal fighters. They could repair force shields, plan military campaigns, design military support facilities, improvise weapons. Twisted mentats? The Tleilaxu persisted in this hoax, obviously. As a mentat himself, Idaho knew the fragile insecurity of Tleilaxu twisting. Great Houses which bought such mentats hoped to control them absolutely. Impossible! Even Piter de Vries, who\u0027d served the Harkonnens in their assault on House Atreides, had maintained his own essential dignity, accepting death rather than surrender his inner core of selfdom at the end. Suk doctors? Their conditioning supposedly guaranteed them against disloyalty to their owner-patients. Suk doctors came very expensive. Increased purchase of Suks would involve substantial exchanges of funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho weighed these facts against an increase in fincap accountants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prime computation,\" he said, indicating a heavily weighted assurance that he spoke of inductive fact. \"There\u0027s been a recent increase in wealth among Houses Minor. Some have to be moving quietly toward Great House status. Such wealth could only come from some specific shifts in political alignments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We come at last to the Landsraad,\" Alia said, voicing her own belief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The next Landsraad session is almost two standard years away,\" Irulan reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But political bargaining never ceases,\" Alia said. \"And I\u0027ll warrant some among those tribal signatories -\" She gestured at the paper beside Irulan. \"- are among the Houses Minor who\u0027ve shifted their alignment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" Irulan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Landsraad,\" Alia said. \"What better front for the Bene Gesserits? And what better agent for the Sisterhood than my own mother?\" Alia planted herself directly in front of Idaho. \"Well, Duncan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not function as a mentat? Idaho asked himself. He saw the tenor of Alia\u0027s suspicions now. After all, Duncan Idaho had been personal house guard to the Lady Jessica for many years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan?\" Alia pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should inquire closely after any advisory legislation which may be under preparation for the next session of the Landsraad,\" Idaho said. \"They might take the legal position that a Regency can\u0027t veto certain kinds of legislation - specifically, adjustments of taxation and the policing of cartels. There are others, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a very good pragmatic bet on their part if they take that position,\" Irulan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree,\" Alia said. \"The Sardaukar have no teeth and we still have our Fremen legions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful, Alia,\" Idaho said. \"Our enemies would like nothing better than to make us appear monstrous. No matter how many legions you command, power ultimately rides on popular sufferance in an empire as scattered as this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Popular sufferance?\" Irulan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean Great House sufferance,\" Alia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how many Great Houses will we face under this new alliance?\" Idaho asked. \"Money is collecting in strange places!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fringes?\" Irulan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho shrugged. It was an unanswerable question. All of them suspected that one day the Tleilaxu or technological tinkerers on the Imperial fringes would nullify the Holtzmann Effect. On that day, shields would be useless. The whole precarious balance which maintained planetary feudatories would collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia refused to consider that possibility. \"We\u0027ll ride with what we have,\" she said. \"And what we have is a certain knowledge throughout the CHOAM directorate that we can destroy the spice if they force us to it. They won\u0027t risk that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to CHOAM again,\" Irulan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless someone has managed to duplicate the sandtrout-sandworm cycle on another planet,\" Idaho said. He looked speculatively at Irulan, excited by this question. \"Salusa Secundus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My contacts there remain reliable,\" Irulan said. \"Not Salusa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then my answer stands,\" Alia said, staring at Idaho. \"We ride with what we have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy move, Idaho thought. He said: \"Why\u0027d you drag me away from important work? You could\u0027ve worked this out yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t take that tone with me!\" Alia snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho\u0027s eyes went wide. For an instant, he\u0027d seen the alien on Alia\u0027s face, and it was a disconcerting sight. He turned his attention to Irulan, but she had not seen - or gave that appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need an elementary education,\" Alia said, her voice still edged with alien anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho managed a rueful smile, but his breast ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We never get far from wealth and all of its masks when we deal with power,\" Irulan drawled. \"Paul was a social mutation and, as such, we have to remember that he shifted the old balance of wealth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such mutations are not irreversible,\" Alia said, turning away from them as though she\u0027d not exposed her terrible difference. \"Wherever there\u0027s wealth in this empire, they know this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They also know,\" Irulan said, \"that there are three people who could perpetuate that mutation: the twins and...\" She pointed at Alia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre they insane, this pair? Idaho wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will try to assassinate me!\" Alia rasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Idaho sat in shocked silence, his mentat awareness whirling. Assassinate Alia? Why? They could discredit her too easily. They could cut her out of the Fremen pack and hunt her down at will. But the twins, now... He knew he was not in the proper mentat calm for such an assessment, but he had to try. He had to be as precise as possible. At the same time, he knew that precise thinking contained undigested absolutes. Nature was not precise. The universe was not precise when reduced to his scale; it was vague and fuzzy, full of unexpected movements and changes. Humankind as a whole had to be entered into this computation as a natural phenomenon. And the whole process of precise analysis represented a chopping off, a remove from the ongoing current of the universe. He had to get at that current, see it in motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were right to focus on CHOAM and the Landsraad,\" Irulan drawled. \"And Duncan\u0027s suggestion offers a first line of inquiry for -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Money as a translation of energy can\u0027t be separated from the energy it expresses,\" Alia said. \"We all know this. But we have to answer three specific questions: When? Using what weapons? Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twins... the twins, Idaho thought. It\u0027s the twins who\u0027re in danger, not Alia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not interested in who or how?\" Irulan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If House Corrino or CHOAM or any other group employs human instruments on this planet,\" Alia said, \"we stand a better than sixty percent chance of finding them before they act. Knowing when they\u0027ll act and where gives us a bigger leverage on those odds. How? That\u0027s just asking what weapons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy can\u0027t they see it as I see it? Idaho wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Irulan said. \"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When attention is focused on someone else,\" Alia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attention was focused on your mother at the Convocation,\" Irulan said. \"There was no attempt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong place,\" Alia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is she doing? Idaho wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where, then?\" Irulan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here in the Keep,\" Alia said. \"It\u0027s the place where I\u0027d feel most secure and least on my guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What weapons?\" Irulan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Conventional - something a Fremen might have on his person: poisoned crysknife, maula pistol, a -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve not tried a hunter-seeker in a long while,\" Irulan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t work in a crowd,\" Alia said. \"There\u0027ll have to be a crowd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Biological weapon?\" Irulan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An infectious agent?\" Alia asked, not masking her incredulity. How could Irulan think an infectious agent would succeed against the immunological barriers which protected an Atreides?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking more in the line of some animal,\" Irulan said. \"A small pet, say, trained to bite a specific victim, inflicting a poison with its bite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The House ferrets will prevent that,\" Alia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of them, then?\" Irulan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t be done. The House ferrets would reject an outsider, kill it. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just exploring possibilities in the hope that -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll alert my guards,\" Alia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Alia said guards, Idaho put a hand over his Tleilaxu eyes, trying to prevent the demanding involvement which swept over him. It was Rhajia, the movement of Infinity as expressed by Life, the latent cup of total immersion in mentat awareness which lay in wait for every mentat. It threw his awareness onto the universe like a net, falling, defining the shapes within it. He saw the twins crouching in darkness while giant claws raked the air about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Alia looked at him as though surprised to find him still there.
