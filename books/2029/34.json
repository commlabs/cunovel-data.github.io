Wanda!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me! Kyle! The floor! Help!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had my face pressed against the stone, my eyes toward the cave entrance. The light was bright overhead as the day dawned. I held my breath. My arms screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda! Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan leaped through the door, the rifle in his hands, held low and ready. His face was the angry mask his brother had worn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch out!\" I screamed at him. \"The floor is breaking up! I can\u0027t hold him much longer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him two long seconds to process the scene that was so different from the one he\u0027d been expecting-Kyle, trying to kill me. The scene that had been, just seconds ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he threw the gun to the cave floor and started toward me with a long stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get down-disperse your weight!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped to all fours and scuttled to me, his eyes burning in the light of dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let go,\" he cautioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe assessed for another second, and then slid his body behind mine, pushing me closer to the rock. His arms were longer than mine. Even with me in the way, he was able to get his hands around his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One, two, three,\" he grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled Kyle up against the rock, much more securely than I\u0027d had him. The movement smashed my face into the pillar. The bad side, though-it couldn\u0027t get much more scarred at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to pull him to this side. Can you squeeze out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loosened my hold on Kyle, feeling my shoulders ache in relief, making sure Ian had him. Then I wriggled out from between Ian and the rock, careful not to put myself on a dangerous section of the floor. I crawled backward a few feet toward the door, ready to make a grab for Ian if he started slipping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan hauled his inert brother around one side of the pillar, dragging him in jerks, a foot at a time. More of the floor crumbled, but the foundation of the pillar remained intact. A new shelf formed about two feet out from the column of rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan crawled backward the way I had, dragging his brother along in short surges of muscle and will. Within a minute, we were all three in the mouth of the corridor, Ian and I breathing in gasps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What... the hell... happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our weight... was too... much. Floor caved in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you doing... by the edge? With Kyle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my head down and concentrated on breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat will happen then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know what will happen. Kyle broke the rules. Jeb will shoot him, or they\u0027ll kick him out. Maybe Ian will beat the snot out of him first. That would be fun to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie didn\u0027t really mean it-I didn\u0027t think so, anyway. She was just still mad at me for risking our lives to save our would-be murderer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExactly, I told her. And if they kick Kyle out for me... or kill him... I shuddered. Well, can\u0027t you see how little sense that would make? He\u0027s one of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve got a life here, Wanda. You\u0027re jeopardizing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s my life, too. And I\u0027m... well, I\u0027m me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie groaned in disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda?\" Ian demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a rotten liar. You know that, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my head down and breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I lied. Poorly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan put his hand under my chin, pulled my face up. \"Your nose is bleeding.\" He twisted my head to the side. \"And there\u0027s more blood in your hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-hit my head when the floor fell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On both sides?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan glared at me for a long moment. The darkness of the tunnel muted the brilliance of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should get Kyle to Doc-he really cracked his head when he went down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you protecting him? He tried to kill you.\" It was a statement of fact, not a question. His expression slowly melted from anger to horror. He was imagining what we had been doing on that unstable shelf-I could see that in his eyes. When I did not answer, he spoke again in a whisper. \"He was going to throw you in the river...\" A strange tremor shook his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan had one arm around Kyle-he\u0027d collapsed that way and seemed too tired to move. Now he shoved his unconscious brother away roughly, sliding farther from him in disgust. He slid into me and wrapped his arms around my shoulders. He pulled me close against his chest-I could feel his breath go in and out, still more ragged than normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt very strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should roll him right back in there and kick him over the edge myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head frantically, making it throb in pain. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saves time. Jeb made the rules clear. You try to hurt someone here, there are penalties. There\u0027ll be a tribunal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to pull away from him, but he tightened his grip. It wasn\u0027t frightening, not like the way Kyle had grabbed me. But it was upsetting-it threw me off balance. \"No. You can\u0027t do that, because no one broke the rules. The floor collapsed, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knew what he was doing. He\u0027s my brother, yes, but he did what he did, and you are... you are... my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did nothing. He is human,\" I whispered. \"This is his place, not mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not having this discussion again. Your definition of human is not the same as mine. To you, it means something... negative. To me, it\u0027s a compliment-and by my definition, you are and he isn\u0027t. Not after this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Human isn\u0027t a negative to me. I know you now. But Ian, he\u0027s your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fact that shames me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed away from him again. This time, he let me go. It might have had something to do with the moan of pain that escaped my lips when I moved my leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so. We need to find Doc, but I don\u0027t know if I can walk. I-I hit my leg, when I fell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA growl strangled in his throat. \"Which leg? Let me see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to straighten out my hurt leg-it was the right one-and groaned again. His hands started at my ankle, testing the bones, the joints. He rotated my ankle carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Higher. Here.\" I pulled his hand to the back of my thigh, just above the knee. I moaned again when he pressed the sore place. \"It\u0027s not broken or anything, I don\u0027t think. Just really sore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deep muscle bruise, at least,\" he muttered. \"And how did this happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must have... landed on a rock when I fell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"Okay, let\u0027s get you to Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kyle needs him more than I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go find Doc anyway-or some help. I can\u0027t carry Kyle that far, but I can certainly carry you. Oops-hold on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned abruptly and ducked back into the river room. I decided I wouldn\u0027t argue with him. I wanted to see Walter before... Doc had promised to wait for me. Would that first dose of painkiller wear off soon? My head swam. There was so much to worry about, and I was so tired. The adrenaline had drained, leaving me empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan came back with the gun. I frowned because this reminded me that I\u0027d wished for it before. I didn\u0027t like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout thinking, he handed the gun to me. I let it fall into my open palms, but I couldn\u0027t curl my hands around it. I decided it was a suitable punishment, to have to carry the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan chuckled. \"How anyone could be afraid of you...\" he mumbled to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked me up easily and was moving before I was settled. I tried to keep the tenderest parts-the back of my head, the back of my leg-from resting on him too hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d your clothes get so wet?\" he asked. We were passing under one of the fist-sized skylights, and I could see the hint of a grim smile on his pale lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I muttered. \"Steam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe passed into darkness again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re missing a shoe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe passed through another beam of light, and his eyes flashed sapphire. They were serious now, locked on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m... very glad that you weren\u0027t hurt, Wanda. Hurt worse, I should say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. I was afraid of giving him something to use against Kyle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb found us just before we hit the big cave. There was enough light for me to see the sharp glint of curiosity in his eyes when he saw me in Ian\u0027s arms, face bleeding, the gun resting gingerly on my open hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were right, then,\" Jeb guessed. The curiosity was strong, but the steel in his tone was stronger. His jaw was tight beneath the fan of his beard. \"I didn\u0027t hear a shot. Kyle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s unconscious,\" I said in a rush. \"You need to warn everyone-part of the floor collapsed in the river room. I don\u0027t know how stable it is now. Kyle hit his head really hard trying to get out of the way. He needs Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb raised one eyebrow so high it almost touched the faded bandanna at his hairline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the story,\" Ian said, making no effort to conceal his doubt. \"And she\u0027s apparently sticking to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb laughed. \"Let me take that off your hands,\" he said to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him have the gun willingly. He laughed again at my expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get Andy and Brandt to help me with Kyle. We\u0027ll follow behind you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep a close eye on him when he wakes up,\" Ian said in a hard tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb slouched off, looking for more hands. Ian hurried me toward the hospital cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kyle could be really hurt... Jeb should hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kyle\u0027s head is harder than any rock in this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long tunnel felt longer than usual. Was Kyle dying, despite my efforts? Was he conscious again and looking for me? What about Walter? Was he sleeping... or gone? Had the Seeker given up her hunt, or would she be back now that it was light again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill Jared still be with Doc? Mel added her questions to mine. Will he be angry when he sees you? Will he know me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached the sunlit southern cave, Jared and Doc didn\u0027t look like they\u0027d moved much. They leaned, side by side, against Doc\u0027s makeshift desk. It was quiet as we approached. They weren\u0027t talking, just watching Walter sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started up with wide eyes as Ian carried me into the light and laid me on the cot next to Walter\u0027s. He straightened my right leg carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter was snoring. That sound eased some of my tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What now?\" Doc demanded angrily. He was bending over me as soon as the words were out, wiping at the blood on my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared\u0027s face was frozen in surprise. He was being careful, not letting the expression give way to anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kyle,\" Ian answered at the same time that I said, \"The floor -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc looked back and forth between us, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan sighed and rolled his eyes. Absently, he laid one hand lightly on my forehead. \"The floor crumbled by the first river hole. Kyle fell back and cracked his head on a rock. Wanda saved his worthless life. She says she fell, too, when the floor gave.\" Ian gave Doc a meaningful look. \"Something,\" he said the word sarcastically, \"bashed the back of her head pretty good.\" He started listing. \"Her nose is bleeding but not broken, I don\u0027t think. She\u0027s got some damage to the muscle here.\" He touched my sore thigh. \"Knees sliced up pretty good, got her face again, but I think maybe I did that, trying to pull Kyle out of the hole. Shouldn\u0027t have bothered.\" Ian muttered the last part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything else?\" Doc asked. At that moment, his fingers, probing along my side, reached the place where Kyle had punched me. I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc tugged my shirt up, and I heard both Ian and Jared hiss at what they saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me guess,\" Ian said in a voice like ice. \"You fell on a rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good guess,\" I agreed, breathless. Doc was still touching my side, and I was trying to hold back whimpers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might have broken a rib, not sure,\" Doc murmured. \"I wish I could give you something for the pain -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about that, Doc,\" I panted. \"I\u0027m okay. How\u0027s Walter? Did he wake up at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it will take some time to sleep that dose off,\" Doc said. He took my hand and started bending my wrist, my elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis kind eyes were soft as he met my gaze. \"You will be. You\u0027ll just have to rest for a while. I\u0027ll keep an eye on you. Here, turn your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did as he asked, and then winced while he examined my wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not here,\" Ian muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t see Doc, but Jared threw Ian a sharp look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re bringing Kyle. I\u0027m not having them in the same room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc nodded. \"Probably wise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get a place ready for her. I\u0027ll need you to keep Kyle here until... until we decide what to do with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to speak, but Ian put his fingers on my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Doc agreed. \"I\u0027ll tie him down, if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we have to. Is it okay to move her?\" Ian glanced toward the tunnel, his face anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I whispered, Ian\u0027s fingers still touching my mouth. \"Walter. I want to be here for Walter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve saved all the lives you can save today, Wanda,\" Ian said, his voice gentle and sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to say... to say good-goodbye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan nodded. Then he looked at Jared. \"Can I trust you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared\u0027s face flushed with anger. Ian held up his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to leave her here unprotected while I find her a safe place,\" Ian said. \"I don\u0027t know if Kyle will be conscious when he arrives. If Jeb shoots him, it will upset her. But you and Doc should be able to handle him. I don\u0027t want Doc to be on his own, and force Jeb\u0027s hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared spoke through clenched teeth. \"Doc won\u0027t be on his own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan hesitated. \"She\u0027s been through hell in the past couple of days. Remember that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared nodded once, teeth still clamped together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be here,\" Doc reminded Ian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan met his gaze. \"Okay.\" He leaned over me, and his luminous eyes held mine. \"I\u0027ll be back soon. Don\u0027t be afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ducked in and touched his lips to my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one was more surprised than I, though I heard Jared gasp quietly. My mouth hung open as Ian wheeled and nearly sprinted from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Doc pull a breath in through his teeth, like a backward whistle. \"Well,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both stared at me for a long moment. I was so tired and sore, I barely cared what they were thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc -\" Jared started to say something in an urgent tone, but a clamor from the tunnel interrupted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive men struggled through the opening. Jeb, in front, had Kyle\u0027s left leg in his arms. Wes had the right leg, and behind them, Andy and Aaron worked to support his torso. Kyle\u0027s head lolled back over Andy\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stars, but he\u0027s heavy,\" Jeb grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared and Doc sprang forward to help. After a few minutes of cursing and groaning, Kyle was lying on a cot a few feet away from mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long has he been out, Wanda?\" Doc asked me. He pulled Kyle\u0027s eyelids back, letting the sunlight shine into his pupils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um...\" I thought quickly. \"As long as I\u0027ve been here, the ten minutes or so it took Ian to carry me here, and then maybe five more minutes before that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least twenty minutes, would you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Close to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we were consulting, Jeb had made his own diagnosis. No one paid any attention as he came to stand at the head of Kyle\u0027s cot. No one paid any attention-until he turned an open bottle of water over Kyle\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeb,\" Doc complained, knocking his hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Kyle sputtered and blinked, and then moaned. \"What happened? Where did it go?\" He started to shift his weight, trying to look around. \"The floor... is moving...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle\u0027s voice had my fingers clenching the sides of my cot and panic washing through me. My leg ached. Could I limp away? Slowly, perhaps...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027S okay,\" someone murmured. Not someone. I would always know that voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared moved to stand between my cot and Kyle\u0027s, his back to me, his eyes on the big man. Kyle rolled his head back and forth, groaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re safe,\" Jared said in a low voice. He didn\u0027t look at me. \"Don\u0027t be afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie wanted to touch him. His hand was close to mine, resting on the edge of my cot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease, no, I told her. My face hurts quite enough as it is!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe won\u0027t hit you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou think. I\u0027m not willing to risk it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie sighed; she yearned to move toward him. It wouldn\u0027t have been so hard to bear if I weren\u0027t yearning also.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive him time, I pleaded. Let him get used to us. Wait till he really believes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, hell!\" Kyle grumbled. My gaze flickered toward him at the sound of his voice. I could just see his bright eyes around Jared\u0027s elbow, focused on me. \"It didn\u0027t fall!\" he complained. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-34.html","bookId":2029,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM"}
