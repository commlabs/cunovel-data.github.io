It was well past the hour of midmeal, but he felt no hunger. Ship\u0027s air tasted stale in the tiny teaching cubby and this surprised him until he realized he had sealed off the secret hatch into this place, leaving only the floor vent. I\u0027ve been sitting on the floor vent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis amused him. He stood and stretched, recalling the lessons of the holo. Dreams of real dirt, real seas, real air had played so long in his imagination that he feared now the real thing might disappoint him. He knew himself to be no novice at image-building in his min.... and no novice to the disappointments of reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt such times he felt much older than his twenty annos. And he looked for reassurance in a shiny surface to reflect his own features. He found a small area of the hatch plate polished by the many passages of his own hand when entering this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes - his dark skin retained the smoothness of youth and the darker beard curled with its usual vigor around his mouth. He had to admit it was a generous mouth. And the nose was a pirate\u0027s nose. Not many Shipmen even knew there had ever been such people as pirates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes appeared much older than twenty, though. No escaping that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShip did that to me. N.... He shook his head. Honesty could not be evaded. The special thing Ship and I have between us - that made my eyes look old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were realities within realities. This thing that made him a poet kept him digging beneath every surface like a child pawing through pages of glyphs. Even when reality disappointed, he had to seek it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power of disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized that power as distinct from frustration. It contained the power to regroup, rethink, react. It forced him to listen to himself as he listened to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKerro knew what most people shipside thought about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were convinced he could hear every conversation in a crowded room, that no gesture or inflection escaped him. There were times when that was true, but he kept to himself his conclusions about such observations. Thus, few were offended by his attentions. No one could find a better audience than Kerro Panille. All he wanted was to listen, to learn, to make order out of it in his poems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was order that mattered - beautiful order created out of the deepest inspiration. Ye.... he had to admit it, Ship presented an image of infinite disorder. He had asked Ship to show its shape to him once, a whimsical request which he had half expected to be refused. But Ship had responded by taking him on a visual tour, through the internal sensors, through the eyes of the robox repair units and even through the eyes of shuttles flitting between Ship and Pandora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExternally, Ship was most confusing. Great fanlike extrusions dangled in space like wings or fins. Lights glittered within them and there were occasional glimpses of people at work behind the open shutters of the ports. Hydroponics gardens, Ship had explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShip stretched almost fifty-eight kilometers in length. But it bulged and writhed throughout that length with fragile shapes which gave no clue to their purposes. Shuttles landed and were dispatched from long, slender tubes jutting randomly outward. The hydroponics fans were stacked one upon another, built outward from each other like mad growths springing from mutated spores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanille knew that once Ship had been sleek and trim, a projectile shape with three slim wings at the midpoint. The wings had dipped backward to form a landing tripod. That sleek shape lay hidden now within the confusion of the eons. It was called \"the core\" and you caught occasional glimpses of it in the passage...thick wall with an airtight hatch, a stretch of metallic surface with ports which opened onto the blank barriers of new construction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInternally, Ship was equally confusing. Sensor eyes showed him the stacks of dormant life in the hybernation bays. At his request, Ship displayed the locator coordinates, but they were meaningless to him. Numbers and glyphs. He followed the swift movements of robox units down passages where there was no air and out onto Ship\u0027s external skin. There, in the shadows of the random extrusions, he watched the business of repairs and alterations, even the beginnings of new construction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanille had watched his fellow Shipmen at their work, feeling fascinated and faintly guilty. A secret spy intruding on privacy. Two men had wrestled a large tubular container into a loading bay for shuttle transshipment down to Pandora. And Panille had felt that he had no right to watch this without the two men knowing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the tour was over, he had sat back disappointed. It occurred to him then that Ship intruded this way all the time. Nothing any Shipman did could be hidden from Ship. This realization had sparked a momentary resentment which was followed immediately by amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am in Ship and of Ship and, in a deeper sense, I am Ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kerro!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden voice from the com-console beside his holo focus startled him. How had she found him here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Hali?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhhh, she had not found him. A search program had found him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m studying,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you walk with me for a while? I\u0027m really wound up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about the arboretum near the cedars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a few minutes to finish up here and meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not bothering you, am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noted the diffidence in her tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I need a break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you outside of Records.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the click of her signoff and stood a blink staring at the console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did she know I was studying in the Records section?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA search program keyed to his person would not report his location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I that predictable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up his notecase and recorder and stepped through the concealed hatch. He sealed it and slipped down through the software storage area to the nearest passage. Hali Ekel stood in the passageway beside the hatch waiting for him. She waved a hand, all nonchalance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of his mind was still back in the study. He blinked at her foolishly, mindful as usual of the sheer beauty of Hali Ekel. At times like this - meeting suddenly, unexpectedly in some passage - she often stunned him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clinical sterility of the ever-present pribox at her hip never distanced them. She was a med-tech, full time, and he understood that life and survival were her business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secret darkness of her eyes, her thick black hair, the lustrous brown warmth of her skin always made him lean toward her slightly or face her way in a crowded room. They were from the same bloodlines, the Nesian Nations, selected for strength, survival sense and their easy affinity with the highways of the stars. Many mistook them for brother and sister, a mistake amplified by the fact that true siblings had not existed shipside in living memory. Some siblings slept on in hyb, but none walked together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotes toward a poem flashed behind his eyes, another of the many she brought to his mind, that he kept to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh dark and magnificent star\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat little light I have, take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeave those supple fingers into mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel the flow!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could think of putting this into his recorder, it occurred to him that she should not be here so fast. There were no nearby call stations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where were you when you called me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Medical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up the passage. Medical was at least ten minutes away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how did yo....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keyed the whole conversation on a ten-minute delay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bu....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See how standard you are on com? I can tape my whole side of a conversation, with you and get it right down the line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But th....\" He nodded at the hatch into software storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s where you always are when nobody can find you - somewhere in there.\" She pointed to the storage area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm.\" He took her hand and they headed out toward the west shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why so thoughtful?\" she asked. \"I thought you\u0027d be amused, surprise.... laugh, or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. Lately it\u0027s bothered me when I do that. Never take time for people, never seem to have the flair fo.... the right word at the right time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pretty strong self-indictment for a poet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s much easier to order characters on a page or a holo than it is to order one\u0027s life. \u0027One\u0027s life\u0027! Why do I talk that way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slipped an arm around his waist and hugged him as they walked. He smiled. Presently, they emerged into the Dome of Trees. It was dayside, the sunglow of Rega muted through the screening filters. All the greens came with soothing blue undertones. Kerro took a deep breath of the oxygenated air. He heard birds twittering behind a sonabarrier off in heavier bushes to the left. Other couples could be seen far down through the trees. This was a favorite trysting place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHali slipped off her pribox strap and pulled him down beside her under a cover of cedar. The needle duff was warm and soft, the air thick with moisture and sun dazzled through the branches. They stretched out on their backs, shoulder to shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmmmm.\" Hali stretched and arched her back. \"It smells so nice here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It? What\u0027s the smell of an it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, stop that.\" She turned toward him. \"You know what I mean - the air, the moss, the food in your beard.\" She brushed at his whiskers, wove her fingers in and out of the coarse hairs. \"You\u0027re the only Shipman with a beard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027m told.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" He reached out and traced the curve of the small wire ring which pierced her left nostril. \"Traditions are strange. Where did you get this ring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A robox dropped it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dropped it?\" He was surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know - they don\u0027t miss much. This one was repairing a sensor outside that little medical study next to Behavioral. I saw the wire drop and picked it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was like finding a rare treasure. They leave so little around. Ship only knows what they do with all the scraps they carry off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slipped her arm around his neck and kissed him. Presently, she pulled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled away from her and sat up. \"Thanks, bu....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s always, \u0027Thanks, bu....\u0027\" She was angry, fighting the physical evidence of her own passion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not ready.\" He felt apologetic. \"I don\u0027t know why and I\u0027m not playing with you. I just have this compulsion toward timing, for the feeling of rightness in things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could be more right? We were selected as a breeding pair after knowing each other all this time. It\u0027s not like we were strangers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not bring himself to look at her. \"I kno.... anyone shipside can partner with anyone else, bu....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But!\" She whirled away and stared at the base of the sheltering tree. \"We could be a breeding pair! One pair i.... what? Two thousand? We could actually make a child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t that. It\u0027....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re always so damned historical, traditional, quoting social patterns this and language patterns that. Why can\u0027t you see wha....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached across her, put his fingers over her mouth to silence her and gently kissed her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear Hali, because I can\u0027t. For me partnership will have to be a giving so deep that I lose myself in the giving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled away and lifted her head to stare at him, her eyes glistening. \"Where do you get such ideas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They come out of my living and from what I learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ship teaches you these things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ship does not deny me what I want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared morosely at the ground under her feet. \"Ship won\u0027t even talk to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was barely audible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you ask in the right way, Ship always answers,\" he said. Then, an afterthought as he sensed it between them: \"And you have to listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve said that before but you never tell me how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no evading the jealousy in her voice. He found that he could only answer in one way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will give you a poem,\" he said. He cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blue itself\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eteaches us blue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowled, concentrating on his words. Presently, she shook her head. \"I\u0027ll never understand you any more than I understand Ship. I go to WorShip; I pray; I do what Ship direct....\" She stared at him. \"I never see you at WorShip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ship is my friend,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity overcame her resentments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does Ship teach you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many things to tell here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just give me one thing, just one!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Very well. There have been many planets and many people. Their languages and the chronicle of their years weave a magic tangle. Their words sing to me. You don\u0027t even have to understand the words to hear them sing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt an odd sense of wonder at this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ship gives you words and you don\u0027t understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I ask for the original.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why do you want words that you don\u0027t understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To make those people live, to make them mine. Not to own them, but to become them, at least for a blink or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and stared at her. \"Haven\u0027t you ever wanted to dig in ancient dirt and find people nobody else even knew existed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their bones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Their hearts, their lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t understand you, Kerro. But I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded silently, thinking: Yes, love doesn\u0027t have to understand. She knows this but she won\u0027t let it into her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recalled the words of an old earthside poem: \"Love is not a consolation, it is a light.\" The thought, the poem of life, that was consolation. He would talk to her of love sometime, he thought, but not this dayside. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-6.html","bookId":2170,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM"}
