{"id":20143,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI. REPELLING BOARDERS.","content":"That had been a cleverly managed stroke, and it left the young officer simply paralyzed. All he could do was to stare into the muzzle of that weapon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He realized of course in a flash how he had been duped. And he was in a trap!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Half dazed he looked and saw a Spanish sailor in the act of lifting himself up to the deck to join his superior. And Clif had no doubt there were half a dozen others following.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was of course nothing that Clif could do; a movement on his part would have been sheer suicide.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He thought the case was hopeless; he had let himself be caught napping.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the cadet had forgotten that there were other Americans on that vessel besides himself. And there were no revolvers threatening the others.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The rage of the Yankee tars at what seemed to them a cowardly and sneaking way to capture the ship was too great for them to control. Prudence would have directed surrender, for the Maria had not a gun on board and the Spaniard might blow her out of the water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But nobody thought of that; the same instant the Spanish officer presented his weapon and disclosed his real nationality, there were two sharp cracks in instant succession from the bow of the imperiled ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the officer staggered back with a gasp. He dropped his weapon to the deck, reeled for an instant and then vanished over the side in the darkness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a moment of horror, and then Clif heard him strike with a thud on the small boat below.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the same time there was a bright flash just in front of Clif, and a bullet whistled past his ear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Spanish sailor, who had only half reached the deck, had fired at him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By that time there was no longer any hesitation as to what course to pursue. The sailors had decided it by their fatal shots. It was resistance to the death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Clif whipped out his own weapons and sent the sailor tumbling backward to follow his officer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he drew his sword and with two slashing strokes severed the ladder. From the yells and confusion that followed there must have been quite a number clinging to the rope.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But where they were or what their fate was nobody had any time to learn. Everything was moving like lightning on the merchantman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif leaped into the pilot house and signaled full speed. There was no further need of lookouts and so the two sailors rushed down into the engine-room to see that the order was obeyed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The big vessel started slowly forward. The cadet sprang to the wheel, his mind in a wild tumult as he strove to think what he should do.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As if there were not confusion enough at that instant there were several loud reports in quick succession, followed by deafening crashes as shots tore through the vessel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Spaniards had opened fire!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But they\u0027ll have to stop to pick up that boat\u0027s crew!\" gasped Clif. \"We may get away!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And that being the case every minute was precious; the vessel had swung round, but there was no time to turnâ€”she must run as she was for a while.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And from the way the vessel trembled and shook it could be told that the irate tars down below were making things hum.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They may burst the boilers if they can,\" thought Clif, grimly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The new course they were taking was south, exactly the opposite of the way they had been going. But Clif did not care about that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The storm will drive us faster!\" he gasped. \"And every yard counts.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Spanish gunboat (nobody on the Maria, of course, knew but what she was a big cruiser) fired only about half a dozen shots at her daring enemy; then the yells of the crew of the small boat must have attracted her attention and forced her to desist for a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And now\u0027s our chance,\" was the thought of the Americans.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were making the most of it, that was certain; they were fairly flying along with the great waves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif himself was at the wheel, seeing that not an inch was lost by steering wrongly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ll know soon,\" he muttered. \"Very soon, for she\u0027ll chase us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The scene at this time was intensely dramatic; for the big ship had glided out into the darkness and those on board of her could not see their pursuer. They had no means of telling where she was, or whether they had escaped or not.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They could only keep on listening anxiously, tremblingly, counting the seconds and waiting, almost holding their breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They knew what the signal would be. The signal of their failure. If the Spaniard succeeded in finding them, he would open fire and soon let them know.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif tried to guess how long it would take them to pick up the unfortunate occupants of that small boat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027ll be raging mad when they do,\" he thought. \"Gorry! they\u0027ll murder every one of us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For they would probably call the shooting of that officer a murder; it did not trouble Clif\u0027s conscience, for he knew that a merchant vessel has the same right to resist the enemy that a warship has. It was not as if they had surrendered and then imitated the example of the treacherous Ignacio.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder how Ignacio likes this anyhow,\" thought Clif.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But he had no time to inquire the Spaniard\u0027s views on the struggle; Clif was too busily waiting and counting the seconds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did not think it would be very long before the enemy\u0027s ship would be after them again; and yet several minutes passed before any sign of the pursuit was given.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif began to think that possibly they had eluded their would-be captors. But his hopes were dashed, for suddenly there came the dreaded warning shot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And it was fired from so close that, though the Americans had been listening for it, it made them start. It was evident that the enemy\u0027s vessel had come close to do the business; her first shot seemed fairly to tear the big merchantman to pieces.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Clif shut his teeth together with a snap.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027re in for it now,\" he muttered. \"That settles it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was no longer the last hope of escape. There was no longer even any use of keeping on. There were but two things to be considered, sink or surrender.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a grim smile on the cadet\u0027s face as he turned away from the wheel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tell the two men to come up from below,\" he said to one of the sailors.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then he went out on deck, staring in the direction of the pursuing vessel. There was no difficulty in telling where she was now, for a continuous flashing of her guns kept her in view.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif was cool, singularly cool, as he stood in his exposed position. He was no longer anxious, for he had no longer any hope. There was nothing on board the Maria that could cope with the enemy\u0027s guns. There was only the inevitable to be faced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cadet soon guessed the nature of the pursuer from the way she behaved. Her guns were all low down and close together. They were about three-pounders, and rapid-firing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s a gunboat like the Uncas,\" he muttered. \"Gorry! how I wish the Uncas would come back!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the Uncas was then near Havana, far from any possibility of giving aid. And Clif knew it, so he wasted no time in vain regrets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By that time the Spanish vessel had gotten the range, and her three or four guns were blazing away furiously. The gunboat was alight with the flames of the quick reports, and the sound was continuous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They aren\u0027t doing as well as I did,\" Clif said. \"But still, they\u0027ll manage to do the work.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And so it seemed, for shot after shot crashed through the hull of the already battered vessel. The Spaniards were mad, evidently. There was no hail this time and proposal to surrender. But only a calm setting to work to finish that reckless ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sailors came on deck and Clif, when he saw them, turned and pointed to the Spaniard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There she is, men,\" he said. \"Look her over.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a moment nobody said anything; the little group stood motionless on the deck. They were in no great danger for the firing was all directed at the hull.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then suddenly Clif began again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I guess this vessel is about done for,\" he said. \"She will be either sunk or captured. The only question is about usâ€”what\u0027s to become of us. I leave it to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e None of the men spoke for a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose,\" Clif said, \"that we can manage to let her know we surrender if we choose. We can scuttle the ship before we do it. But you know what we may expect; after our shooting those two men they\u0027ll probably murder us, or do things that are a thousand times worse.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif stopped for a moment and then he turned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Think, for instance,\" he said, \"of being at the mercy of that man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was pointing toward Ignacio, who lay near them, glowering in his hate, and the sailors looked and understood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s better to drown, sir,\" said one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the rest thought so, too, and declared it promptly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well, then,\" was the cadet\u0027s quiet answer, \"we will stay on board. We have faced death before.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That resolution made there was little else left to be determined.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We can sink the ship, or wait and let them sink it,\" the cadet said. \"Or elseâ€”there\u0027s one thing more. We are headed in the right direction. We can smash her upon the rocks of the Cuban coast.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the sailors stared at him for a moment eagerly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And stand a chance of getting ashore in safety!\" they cried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At which the cadet smiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s very little chance,\" he said. \"But it\u0027s as good as anything else. We\u0027ll try it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You two go down to the engine room again, and keep things moving. And the others stay on deck and make sure those Spaniards don\u0027t try to board us again. I can handle the wheel myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And with that the brave cadet turned away and sprang toward the pilot house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3248/89002.html","bookId":606,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:32:18 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:32:18 AM"}
