Bobby Hughes ordered it done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone just stares at me blankly from across the table like I\u0027ve lost it or as if losing it isn\u0027t understandable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ward-\" Palakon starts, his patience dropping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you, Palakon!\" I\u0027m screaming. \"Who in the f**k do you work for?\" I\u0027m at the table now, gripping its edges, glaring into Palakon\u0027s face. \"Fucking tell me who you work for,\" I\u0027m screaming at maximum volume, my face twisted into a grimace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon draws in a breath and stares icily at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says, simply, \"I work for your father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon pauses, looks away, sighing, then back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I work for your father, Mr. Ward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is uttered so matter-of-factly, delivered so deadpan, that its existence opens a door and if you looked through that door you would see me moving above a winter road then descending rapidly and no one\u0027s there to catch me and I\u0027m hitting pavement. What this implies simply is that truth equals chaos and that this is a regression. A physical sensation causes me to ignore everything in this room-to turn away from Russell running his hand through his hair, turn away from the Japanese man lighting another cigarette, turn away from the fly buzzing around my head. These men are perpetrators and the table they\u0027re sitting behind suddenly seems vaster and they\u0027re making plans, they\u0027re jotting memoranda, they\u0027re casting motives, they\u0027re plotting itineraries. Something invisible is forming itself in the cold air in the interrogation room and it\u0027s directed at me, wheeling forward. But the familiarity of the inspector from Interpol interrupts everything, makes me remember an earlier scene, and something emerges, obliterates the fuzz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" I ask quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hired by your father,\" Palakon says. \"He came to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly move away from the table, my hand on my mouth, and I\u0027m sitting back down in the chair I\u0027d kicked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ward,\" the Japanese man starts, with a thick accent. \"Your father is leaving the U.S. Senate quite soon. Is this correct?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare blankly at him. \"I... don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Japanese man continues. \"Your father will be making a bid for the-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I say, cutting him off. \"What does this have to do with anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor,\" Palakon starts, \"your father-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Japanese man interrupts. \"Mr. Palakon, please.
