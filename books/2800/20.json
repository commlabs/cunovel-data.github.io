Finding his arm, I follow the trail down until I reach his hand and link our fingers. I apologize quietly, “I’m sorry, babe. I know I’m not being fair. It’s so easy for me to forget that I’m still being protected. Sometimes, I just want to be me again, you know? Without the dramatics and over the top security.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting my hand to his mouth, he kisses my palm, and silently drives us on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drive for around half an hour. I know this because Nox won’t let me turn on the radio due to the fact that I’ll easily figure out where we are, so I spend the time mentally counting the seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI count twenty-seven minutes and three seconds, total, before the van comes to a stop and Nox gets out. He opens my door and I lift my hands to remove the blindfold, but he stops me with, “Signs, babe. I’ll tell you when you can take it off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I step out of the van, I hear it. The swirling. The crashing. The soft buzz in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing deeply, I smell it too. A huge smile breaks out on my face and I bounce excitedly. Nox says in mock sternness, “Uh oh. You’re ruining my surprise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding his hand with both of mine, I beg quickly, “Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bends down to remove my shoes and socks; we walk forward a little while, and my feet come into contact with cool, smooth sand. I mentally squeal but laugh out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox stops suddenly and firmly says, “Do not remove the blindfold, Lily. I’m warning you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlacing my index and middle fingers at my forehead, I give him a salute and wait patiently. After a minute, he guides me with a hand on the small of my back. I hear him sit, and gently, he pulls me down to sit on the blanket, between his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls up the blindfold and I gasp softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling like an idiot, I push back into his body. He wraps his arms tightly around my middle and presses his lips to my cheek. His breath warms me. “’Kay, babe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI answer quietly, “This is the best thing anyone’s ever done for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe responds just as quietly on a body squeeze, “You’re welcome, princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sit and watch the ocean, allowing the sights and sounds to wash over us and take us away from reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, we’re just Nox and Lily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot protector and protected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beach is deserted. And this is our happy place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur bubble. Us against the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thought suddenly comes to mind. “What’s your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stills behind me and I wonder if I’ve somehow screwed up by asking. I think it’s a fair question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox grumbles, “It doesn’t matter. I’m not him anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning my head to the side, I kiss his chin and admit gently, “It does matter. It’s important to me. I want to know you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long silence follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen finally, “Adam Christian Taylor. Born March eighteenth, nineteen eighty four in White Deer, Texas to a single mother, Clare.” The southern twang I’ve heard escape his voice so many times comes out to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh wow!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, I kneel in the space between his legs and reach up to cup his cheeks. He watches me cautiously, but I smile, then flip off his ball cap. Leaning forward, I peck softly at his lips and say between kisses, “Hi, Adam. I’m Lily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands span my hips and he presses his lips deeper into mine. Against them, he smiles and simply says, “Hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kiss softly, unrushed, for a long time, and it’s out of this world. But something’s bothering me. Pulling back a little, I ask, “Is it bad that I still want to call you Nox?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head and replies, “Is it bad that I still want you to call me Nox?” I shrug and he utters, “Adam’s all but gone, princess. He’s just a memory to me. I’ve been Nox for a long time. I am Nox.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, I say honestly, “I don’t care what you call yourself.” Placing my palm over his heart, I add, “You’re still the same man in here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling his eyes, he whines loudly, “Lily!” It’s so out of character for him that I still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea what I’ve done wrong, so I shrink back and he catches it. He points a finger at me, “Don’t. Don’t do that.” Then he sighs, “Fuck me.” Placing my hair behind my ear, he murmurs an awestruck, “So much sweet tucked behind the fierce. I don’t know what to do with you, girl. You’re killin’ me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink. My response drips sarcasm. “Would you like for me to spit on you to even it out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he smiles. Bright and all teeth. And I want to drown in that smile. From now ‘til the end of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper, “It would be totally stupid for me to fall in love with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile fades, but only a little. He nods in agreement. “It would be totally stupid.” He pecks my lips once, twice, three times. Pulling back, I look into his deep-blue eyes and see nothing but sincerity. He adds gently, “Can’t help who you fall in love with, princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge of my nose tingles. My eyes mist and I bite my lip, trying to hold it together. I sniffle. “Best day ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox looks at my face, wide eyed. “Clearly, what with all the crying and shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bark of laughter escapes me. I smack him. “Ass.” Then I add, “Wanna be someone else for today? Just today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes crinkle and he says in his most southern accent, “Sure thing, darlin’. I’ll be Hank and you can be Maude.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laughter bursts out of me. I laugh so hard, I double over, resting my forehead on his shaking shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns me around and sits me back between his legs. His arms cinch around my waist and he buries his face into my neck. He says a muffled, “Don’t wanna let you go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart swells. I whisper back, “Then don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning into Boo’s room, I slam the door shut behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns to me, looking stunned. Panting, I whisper hiss, “How do I do sex?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shocked look on her face fades. She motions to the bed and smiles big, “Take a seat. We have much to discuss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready in bed waiting for Nox, I smooth down the sheets, wanting everything to be perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight is the night I hand in my V-card. So it’s a pretty special day. I probably should’ve done something to mark the occasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike bake a cake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr blown up balloons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreamers would’ve been nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo was damn excited about it. And, my goodness, the things she told me! I read erotica a lot, but when you have nothing to compare these things to, they become confusing. So give a girl a break!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaved legs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderarms okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniff myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeh. It’ll do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrushed teeth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck and check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just as I reach down to adjust my underwear, Nox walks in. So I snap my hand up and out of the covers. But it’s too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox’s eyes widen and he says, “Oh, please don’t let me stop you, baby. Keep going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYep. It looked like I was touching myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face flames and I bite out, “I wasn’t doing that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe creeps over to the bed, places a knee on the mattress, and leans over to me, murmuring, “It’s been a long fucking day and I need that mouth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching up as he leans down, our mouths connect. He tangles a hand in my hair and kisses me deeper, groaning. Just as the kiss gets intense, he pulls away and says, “No. I don’t wanna get carried away. I need to shower, and if we keep this up I’ll be too lazy to do it later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles down at me, “Is it okay if we pick this up in ten?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice hoarse, I reply, “Ten minutes. Any longer and I’ll come in after you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing off the bed, his eyes darken and become hooded. “Just try keeping me away.” He walks over to the bathroom and I land back on the bed with a plop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis seduction thing is harder than I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll systems go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Nox steps out of the bathroom in only a pair of white boxers, he comes straight for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting my lip, I’m suddenly nervous. The energy in the room just went from still to sizzling-hot in a mere second. And I’m turned on. Just from the sight of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he strides over to the bed, I take him in. His dark, usually buzzed hair is a little longer now. Just enough to run your fingers through. Big, muscly arms, thick and strong legs, defined abs, broad chest and shoulders is enough to make me lick my lips in anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever in my life would I have thought I could get a man that looks like this…but, here we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny how things work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bed dips and he lies down next to me. Looking completely indifferent, he avoids my eyes when he asks in an overly bored tone, “Wanna make out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching behind me, I grab hold of a pillow and bring it down on his head. His body shakes with silent laughter. Throwing the pillow off, he grabs hold of my wrist and pulls me to him. Sitting up, he sits me on his lap facing him. Eyes smiling, he says, “Hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small smile graces my lips. “Hi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers play at my back, teasing the edge of my tank, stroking the sensitive skin there. I’m already getting antsy and we’ve just started. Remembering my mission, I decide I need to make a gesture for him to get the message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing my arms across my stomach, I grip the sides of my tank and lift it off, leaving me in nothing but a pair of black panties (thanks to Boo).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox blinks at my bare chest a while before his eyes hood, and he lowers his face into the valley between my breasts, nuzzling the flesh there. Sighing, I wrap my arms around his head and whisper, “I want you, Nox.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis faces stills in my cleavage, his body tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting his head, our eyes meet. He searches my face a minute before asking, “Are you sure?” Just as I’m about to answer, he adds, “’Cause it doesn’t matter to me. We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. You don’t have to do this for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling at the flush that appears on his neck, I take his face in my hands and kiss him sweetly. “I want to do this for me. Because I want it to be you. I always want to think back and know I chose you. It’s mine to give and I want you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGripping my hips tightly, he loosens his hold and slowly runs his hands up and down my sides. Still not convinced, he whispers, “I won’t pressure you. Not ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubbing the tip of my nose lightly against his, I whisper back, “You’re not. You’re being super sweet and I love that. But I want this. Really badly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he can do anything, I reach down between us and wrap my hand around his boxer-covered erection. He hisses and leans back a little. Taking this as permission, I reach down with my other hand and rub him nice and slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes close and he mutters, “Keep doing that and I’m not gonna last, princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want it to end so soon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling my hands back, I enquire, “So if it happens, that’s it? You’re done?” I can’t keep the disappointment out of my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox chuckles and suddenly I feel stupid. My chin dips. Feeling my embarrassment, his laughter stops. Placing his fingers at my chin, he lifts my face and says through a smile, “No, baby. I could go all night with you. It takes about ten minutes for me to, uh…” He clears his throat, thinking of a word. “…recharge, but then I’m good to go again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching down again, I take his length in my hands, stroking and ask quietly, “What’s the problem then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes close once more and he mumbles, “I forget.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling a little like a child telling secrets, I lean closer to his ear and say, “Take off your shorts. I want to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m grateful he doesn’t make me beg. Reaching down, he grips the edges of his shorts and tugs. They come down only so far because of my position, so I take them down the rest of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt really is big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking a snap decision, I do something I’ve always wanted to try. I bend at the waist and swipe my tongue up the length of his shaft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body jerks as if electricity runs through it and he groans, “Baby, fuck!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think back to what Boo told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Under the head is very sensitive so be careful with it. Start slow. Use your hand in an up-down motion. And don’t use teeth. Listen to him for encouragement. If he groans and shifts around, you’re doing good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding his shaft in my hand, I hold it straight up, and place my mouth over the head, just to get a feel of it. When Nox groans again, I lower my mouth further then lift. Making a rhythm, I start bobbing my head slow and shallow on his dick. His hands move to my head and I take that as a sign to keep going. I bob deeper, making sure not to gag myself, and suck a little harder. Nox moans, “Holy-fuck-shit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecoming courageous, I stroke as I suck him, and his body bucks. I do this for a little while longer and he grinds out, “Baby, seriously not gonna last.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking my mouth off him for a second, I utter, “I want to see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanting, his hips start moving and he pushes deeper into my mouth. He thrusts faster and faster, then suddenly, he pulls free of my mouth and strokes his throbbing erection against his marred stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch closely as he finds his release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face turns pained, his balls tighten and I see the exact moment it happens. Gripping it tightly, his angry looking shaft throbs and creamy white cum spurts onto his stomach, once, twice, three and finally, a fourth time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImitating a limp noodle, he falls back onto the bed. He looks exhausted. Panting as if he ran a mile, sweating and droopy. His erection deflates and he peeks at me through one eye. He catches my small smile and asks, “How’d I do? Did I get the job?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/willing-captive/page-20.html","bookId":2800,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:06 PM"}
