Shel shot her a look and she could see by the way his eyes were watering that he was having trouble swallowing his own laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" the king asked. \"You look a little constipated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine, King Al.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hump!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, Dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A rounded mass, i.e., the structure on the back of a camel. Hump. Damn, I\u0027ve just about got this thing licked. Next time I\u0027m doing it in pen.\" He looked up at Shel. \"I\u0027m pretty fuckin\u0027 smart, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, King Al.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really. I mean, we don\u0027t all have hotshot PhDs but that doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, please.\" Alex tried to mask her exasperation. Although her father had insisted all his children get at least a four-year degree, he himself had never indulged. So his attitude toward those with degrees was mixed: admiration and envy. Good work, but don\u0027t let it go to your head. \"Everybody knows you\u0027re smart. Almost as smart as me, even.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Har, har.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a discreet rap at the door, which opened at Al\u0027s absent, \"Come!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmund, the king\u0027s right hand man, entered after a polite pause. Alex could see Shel gaping at him, which was perfectly understandable. Her sister called him Ichabod Brain. Tall as the king, but much thinner, he looked as though he\u0027d be at home in the starched suits and powdered wigs of two hundred years ago. As it was, he looked plenty starched in the severe gray suit and highly polished black shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Eds, what\u0027s a nine-letter word for creating an obstacle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"L-O-O-K-I-T-U-P.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Har fucking har.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmund bowed. \"Your Majesty. Your Highness. Dr. Rivers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, hi,\" Shel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t freak,\" Alex said. \"He knows everybody\u0027s name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true, Your Highness.\" He stepped up to the desk. \"I\u0027ve brought some correspondence, my king, but the thing you desire most has not shown up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ring of Sauron?\" Alex guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, like I couldn\u0027t have about ten of those made if I wanted. No, I\u0027m waiting for the invite. We better figure out which one of us is going to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" Alex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"William\u0027s wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"PrinceWilliam? From England?\" Shel shook his head, which Alex found understandable. Her father talked about the Wndsors like they were neighbors. In fact, he had a charming blind spot about Queen Elizabeth, the matriarch, which prevented him from—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, which one of us is going? Alex? You want to? Maybe I should, though. Head of the family and all. But Charles and Christina really hit it off at her wedding, maybe I should send her and David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, Dad, have you thought—have you considered—\" She looked up; Edmund\u0027s eyes were pleading with her. The coward! He hadn\u0027t brought up the possibility. Once again, it was up to her to save the family honor. Nuts! \"Maybe the queen won\u0027t be sending us an invitation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father looked honestly puzzled. \"What? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well… because she hates you and thinks you\u0027re a boorish clown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that.\" He waved away with one blocky hand his attempted murder of the queen\u0027s favorite corgi. \"We got that straightened out when I was in the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you tried to seduce her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, she likes me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tried to have sex with the queen of—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet, boy. You really don\u0027t think she\u0027ll invite us? How can she not invite us? I\u0027ve known her my whole life!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" Edmund suggested, \"that is part of the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think she\u0027s mad because we didn\u0027t invite her to Dara\u0027s christening, do you?\" he asked anxiously. \"Because that was just family andreally close friends. There were only about forty people there. She wouldn\u0027t take that personal, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m certain not, Your Majesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Alex agreed, \"that\u0027s definitely not it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was ather wedding,and Charles\u0027s, and you\u0027re saying she won\u0027t invite me to the kid\u0027s? Fucking Joan Rivers is going, but not me? Not that I think he should be getting married,\" he added in a mutter, \"not at his age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, he\u0027s almost as old as I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me. Kid should run around a little more; trust me, the girls will wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps the mail has been delayed,\" Edmund said. \"It has to come from England, after all, and then be routed to the States.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKing Alexander visibly perked up. \"Sure, that\u0027s what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex glared at Edmund, who was only making it worse. Getting the man\u0027s hopes up! Queen Elizabeth wouldn\u0027t invite her father if it meant getting Ireland back. \"She\u0027d probably invite you,\" Alex said, \"if she knew you wouldn\u0027t come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, somebody has to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really. Dad. I don\u0027t think she\u0027d mind if the Baranov family skipped a Windsor wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s kind of mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all I\u0027m saying.\" Then, \"Edmund,\" she asked sweetly, \"may I see you in the other room for a moment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now just a minute,\" her father said. \"It was all me, kiddo. He didn\u0027t do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lie,\" she told the monarch, \"like old people fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, of course, at Her Highness\u0027s disposal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Hallway. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re notleaving me with him?\" Shel asked, horrified, just as she stepped into the hall with Edmund and pulled the door shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you, Prin—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edmund, you suck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tone, Princess. \u0027A member of the royal family must always—\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Howcould you bring him here, how,how ? Are youtrying to ruin my life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he admitted, \"it just happens on its own, sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got me to come out here, no doubt some loser plan you and Dr. Pohl cooked up, then you showed him theMinot Daily News —\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The king likes to keep up with current events.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, bullshit! He never would have seen that if you hadn\u0027t stuck it under his nose, not with all the junk he has to wade through every day, and sure as shit not when it\u0027s fishing season. So did you send me out here to have a good time, or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I confess,\" he confessed, \"the picture startled me. I—we—were concerned you were perhaps… confused. Possibly from lack of sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s very flattering, Edmund, you—you—\" She couldn\u0027t do it. He wasstaff , he worked forthem , but she could no more insult him, fire him, smack him, then she could drench her hair with gasoline and light a match. \"I\u0027m not confused! Okay, I am. But bringing my dad—mydad !—out here is not helping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you will come to a decision about Dr. Rivers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps I\u0027ve only known him a week! We can\u0027tdate , you never heard of dating? What, I\u0027ve got to drop him or marry him? There\u0027s nothing in the middle? What is this, an episode ofBeat the Clock ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Princess, you don\u0027t date. Quite frankly, until I saw that picture, I had assumed you were still… ah… never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe buried her fists in her hair and fought the urge to pull out heavy chunks. \"God… God… I\u0027m not telling you when I lost my virginity, that\u0027s for damned sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank heavens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact, we\u0027re not having this conversation at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also good, Your Highness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stuck a finger under his nose. He raised his brows at her, but didn\u0027t flinch. She practically had to stretch toreach his nose, which made it difficult to exude authority. \"For the record, buster, I\u0027mvery disappointed in you. I could have been spared that whole scene the other night if you weren\u0027t such a fucking meddler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Language, Princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it! What I do—or don\u0027t do—or do—with Dr. Rivers is my own business. Not yours, not the king\u0027s. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re the king\u0027s man, just like Jenny\u0027s first loyalty is to me, but—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Jenny,\" Edmund mused, staring into space. \"I must speak to her. She\u0027s managed to avoid me thus far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you say a damned word to her! And you can consider that aroyal command . Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt worked! She\u0027d never given a royal command before. But the situation was dire. To put it mildly. \"All right. We\u0027re done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I take my leave, Your Highness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can take a long walk off a short pier for all I care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tone, Princess. And good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 33\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finally,\" she groaned, flopping down on the bed. \"I didn\u0027t think they\u0027d ever leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Youdidn\u0027t think?\" Sheldon was slumped in the chair in the corner. Her father had left typical chaos in his wake—papers, invitations, crossword puzzles, word finds. She had gladly shut the door on the mess, and led Shel to the bedroom. \"You should have seen me and your dad trying to pretend like we couldn\u0027t hear you ripping Ed a new one. Awkward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never Ed. Edmund.\" Then she realized what he had said. \"You could?\" She was instantly appalled. \"You heard the whole thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, just when you screamed,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"A royal command, eh? Does that actually work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll find out. Maybe I\u0027ll give you one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, sunshine. American citizen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmph.\" She studied her bare toes for a moment, then said, \"It\u0027s so hard to yell at him. It\u0027s like yelling at my dad. I mean, I can do it, but it\u0027s tricky.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-20.html","bookId":2790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM"}
