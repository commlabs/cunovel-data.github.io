but as soon as the hot weather began to drive the fainting citizens out from New York, they had always received two or three boarders—old ladies generally, and occasionally an old gentleman—persons of very steady habits, with whose pockets the widow’s moderate demands agreed better than the hotel charges. \u0026nbsp;And so the Bells lived for ten years.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That Saratoga is a gay place in July, August, and September, the world knows well enough. \u0026nbsp;To girls who go there with trunks full of muslin and crinoline, for whom a carriage and pair of horses is always waiting immediately after dinner, whose fathers’ pockets are bursting with dollars, it is a very gay place. \u0026nbsp;Dancing and flirtations come as a matter of course, and matrimony follows after with only too great rapidity. \u0026nbsp;But the place was not very gay for Hetta or Susan Bell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the first place the widow was a timid woman, and among other fears feared greatly that she should be thought guilty of setting traps for husbands. \u0026nbsp;Poor mothers! how often are they charged with this sin when their honest desires go no further than that their bairns may be “respectit like the lave.” \u0026nbsp;And then she feared flirtations; flirtations that should be that and nothing more, flirtations that are so destructive of the heart’s sweetest essence. \u0026nbsp;She feared love also, though she longed for that as well as feared it;—for her girls, I mean; all such feelings for herself were long laid under ground;—and then, like a timid creature as she was, she had other indefinite fears, and among them a great fear that those girls of hers would be left husbandless,—a phase of life which after her twelve years of bliss she regarded as anything but desirable. \u0026nbsp;But the upshot was,—the upshot of so many fears and such small means,—that Hetta and Susan Bell had but a dull life of it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Were it not that I am somewhat closely restricted in the number of my pages, I would describe at full the merits and beauties of Hetta and Susan Bell. \u0026nbsp;As it is I can but say a few words. \u0026nbsp;At our period of their lives Hetta was nearly one-and-twenty, and Susan was just nineteen. \u0026nbsp;Hetta was a short, plump, demure young woman, with the softest smoothed hair, and the brownest brightest eyes. \u0026nbsp;She was very useful in the house, good at corn cakes, and thought much, particularly in these latter months, of her religious duties. \u0026nbsp;Her sister in the privacy of their own little room would sometimes twit her with the admiring patience with which she would listen to the lengthened eloquence of Mr. Phineas Beckard, the Baptist minister. \u0026nbsp;Now Mr. Phineas Beckard was a bachelor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Susan was not so good a girl in the kitchen or about the house as was her sister; but she was bright in the parlour, and if that motherly heart could have been made to give out its inmost secret—which however, it could not have been made to give out in any way painful to dear Hetta—perhaps it might have been found that Susan was loved with the closest love. \u0026nbsp;She was taller than her sister, and lighter; her eyes were blue as were her mother’s; her hair was brighter than Hetta’s, but not always so singularly neat. \u0026nbsp;She had a dimple on her chin, whereas Hetta had none; dimples on her cheeks too, when she smiled; and, oh, such a mouth! \u0026nbsp;There; my allowance of pages permits no more.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One piercing cold winter’s day there came knocking at the widow’s door—a young man. \u0026nbsp;Winter days, when the ice of January is refrozen by the wind of February, are very cold at Saratoga Springs. \u0026nbsp;In these days there was not often much to disturb the serenity of Mrs. Bell’s house; but on the day in question there came knocking at the door—a young man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Bell kept an old domestic, who had lived with them in those happy Albany days. \u0026nbsp;Her name was Kate O’Brien, but though picturesque in name she was hardly so in person. \u0026nbsp;She was a thick-set, noisy, good-natured old Irishwoman, who had joined her lot to that of Mrs. Bell when the latter first began housekeeping, and knowing when she was well off; had remained in the same place from that day forth. \u0026nbsp;She had known Hetta as a baby, and, so to say, had seen Susan’s birth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And what might you be wanting, sir?” said Kate O’Brien, apparently not quite pleased as she opened the door and let in all the cold air.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish to see Mrs. Bell. \u0026nbsp;Is not this Mrs. Bell’s house?” said the young man, shaking the snow from out of the breast of his coat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He did see Mrs. Bell, and we will now tell who he was, and why he had come, and how it came to pass that his carpet-bag was brought down to the widow’s house and one of the front bedrooms was prepared for him, and that he drank tea that night in the widow’s parlour.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His name was Aaron Dunn, and by profession he was an engineer. \u0026nbsp;What peculiar misfortune in those days of frost and snow had befallen the line of rails which runs from Schenectady to Lake Champlain, I never quite understood. \u0026nbsp;Banks and bridges had in some way come to grief, and on Aaron Dunn’s shoulders was thrown the burden of seeing that they were duly repaired. \u0026nbsp;Saratoga Springs was the centre of these mishaps, and therefore at Saratoga Springs it was necessary that he should take up his temporary abode.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now there was at that time in New York city a Mr. Bell, great in railway matters—an uncle of the once thriving but now departed Albany lawyer. \u0026nbsp;He was a rich man, but he liked his riches himself; or at any rate had not found himself called upon to share them with the widow and daughters of his nephew. \u0026nbsp;But when it chanced to come to pass that he had a hand in despatching Aaron Dunn to Saratoga, he took the young man aside and recommended him to lodge with the widow. \u0026nbsp;“There,” said he, “show her my card.” \u0026nbsp;So much the rich uncle thought he might vouchsafe to do for the nephew’s widow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Bell and both her daughters were in the parlour when Aaron Dunn was shown in, snow and all. \u0026nbsp;He told his story in a rough, shaky voice, for his teeth chattered; and he gave the card, almost wishing that he had gone to the empty big hotel, for the widow’s welcome was not at first quite warm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The widow listened to him as he gave his message, and then she took the card and looked at it. \u0026nbsp;Hetta, who was sitting on the side of the fireplace facing the door, went on demurely with her work. \u0026nbsp;Susan gave one glance round—her back was to the stranger—and then another; and then she moved her chair a little nearer to the wall, so as to give the young man room to come to the fire, if he would. \u0026nbsp;He did not come, but his eyes glanced upon Susan Bell; and he thought that the old man in New York was right, and that the big hotel would be cold and dull. \u0026nbsp;It was a pretty face to look on that cold evening as she turned it up from the stocking she was mending.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps you don’t wish to take winter boarders, ma’am?” said Aaron Dunn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We never have done so yet, sir,” said Mrs. Bell timidly. \u0026nbsp;Could she let this young wolf in among her lamb-fold? \u0026nbsp;He might be a wolf;—who could tell?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. Bell seemed to think it would suit,” said Aaron.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Had he acquiesced in her timidity and not pressed the point, it would have been all up with him. \u0026nbsp;But the widow did not like to go against the big uncle; and so she said, “Perhaps it may, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I guess it will, finely,” said Aaron. \u0026nbsp;And then the widow seeing that the matter was so far settled, put down her work and came round into the passage. \u0026nbsp;Hetta followed her, for there would be housework to do. \u0026nbsp;Aaron gave himself another shake, settled the weekly number of dollars—with very little difficulty on his part, for he had caught another glance at Susan’s face; and then went after his bag. \u0026nbsp;’Twas thus that Aaron Dunn obtained an entrance into Mrs. Bell’s house. \u0026nbsp;“But what if he be a wolf?” she said to herself over and over again that night, though not exactly in those words. \u0026nbsp;Ay, but there is another side to that question. \u0026nbsp;What if he be a stalwart man, honest-minded, with clever eye, cunning hand, ready brain, broad back, and warm heart; in want of a wife mayhap; a man that can earn his own bread and another’s;—half a dozen others’ when the half dozen come? \u0026nbsp;Would not that be a good sort of lodger? \u0026nbsp;Such a question as that too did flit, just flit, across the widow’s sleepless mind. \u0026nbsp;But then she thought so much more of the wolf! \u0026nbsp;Wolves, she had taught herself to think, were more common than stalwart, honest-minded, wife-desirous men.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wonder mother consented to take him,” said Hetta, when they were in the little room together.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And why shouldn’t she?” said Susan. \u0026nbsp;“It will be a help.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, it will be a little help,” said Hetta. \u0026nbsp;“But we have done very well hitherto without winter lodgers.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But uncle Bell said she was to.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What is uncle Bell to us?” said Hetta, who had a spirit of her own. \u0026nbsp;And she began to surmise within herself whether Aaron Dunn would join the Baptist congregation, and whether Phineas Beckard would approve of this new move.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is a very well-behaved young man at any rate,” said Susan, “and he draws beautifully. \u0026nbsp;Did you see those things he was doing?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He draws very well, I dare say,” said Hetta, who regarded this as but a poor warranty for good behaviour. \u0026nbsp;Hetta also had some fear of wolves—not for herself perhaps; but for her sister.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Aaron Dunn’s work—the commencement of his work—lay at some distance from the Springs, and he left every morning with a lot of workmen by an early train—almost before daylight. \u0026nbsp;And every morning, cold and wintry as the mornings were, the widow got him his breakfast with her own hands. \u0026nbsp;She took his dollars and would not leave him altogether to the awkward mercies of Kate O’Brien; nor would she trust her girls to attend upon the young man. \u0026nbsp;Hetta she might have trusted; but then Susan would have asked why she was spared her share of such hardship.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the evening, leaving his work when it was dark, Aaron always returned, and then the evening was passed together. \u0026nbsp;But they were passed with the most demure propriety. \u0026nbsp;These women would make the tea, cut the bread and butter, and then sew; while Aaron Dunn, when the cups were removed, would always go to his plans and drawings.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On Sundays they were more together; but even on this day there was cause of separation, for Aaron went to the Episcopalian church, rather to the disgust of Hetta. \u0026nbsp;In the afternoon, however, they were together; and then Phineas Beckard came in to tea on Sundays, and he and Aaron got to talking on religion; and though they disagreed pretty much, and would not give an inch either one or the other, nevertheless the minister told the widow, and Hetta too probably, that the lad had good stuff in him, though he was so stiff-necked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But he should be more modest in talking on such matters with a minister,” said Hetta.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Rev.

he had drawn and coloured a beautiful little sketch of a bridge; not an engineer’s plan with sections and measurements, vexatious to a woman’s eye, but a graceful little bridge with a string of cars running under it. \u0026nbsp;You could almost hear the bell going.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well; that is a pretty bridge,” said Susan. \u0026nbsp;“Isn’t it, Hetta?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t know anything about bridges,” said Hetta, to whose clever eyes the dodge was quite apparent. \u0026nbsp;But in spite of her cleverness Mrs. Bell and Susan had soon moved their chairs round to the table, and were looking through the contents of Aaron’s portfolio. \u0026nbsp;“But yet he may be a wolf,” thought the poor widow, just as she was kneeling down to say her prayers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That evening certainly made a commencement. \u0026nbsp;Though Hetta went on pertinaciously with the body of a new dress, the other two ladies did not put in another stitch that night. \u0026nbsp;From his drawings Aaron got to his instruments, and before bedtime was teaching Susan how to draw parallel lines. \u0026nbsp;Susan found that she had quite an aptitude for parallel lines, and altogether had a good time of it that evening. \u0026nbsp;It is dull to go on week after week, and month after month, talking only to one’s mother and sister. \u0026nbsp;It is dull though one does not oneself recognise it to be so. \u0026nbsp;A little change in such matters is so very pleasant. \u0026nbsp;Susan had not the slightest idea of regarding Aaron as even a possible lover. \u0026nbsp;But young ladies do like the conversation of young gentlemen. \u0026nbsp;Oh, my exceedingly proper prim old lady, you who are so shocked at this as a general doctrine, has it never occurred to you that the Creator has so intended it?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Susan understanding little of the how and why, knew that she had had a good time, and was rather in spirits as she went to bed. \u0026nbsp;But Hetta had been frightened by the dodge.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2901/80020.html","bookId":1117,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:04:17 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:04:17 PM"}
