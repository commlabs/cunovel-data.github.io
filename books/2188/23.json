Though screams erupted all across the open market of Luskan, with guards scrambling every which way, the attacker very calmly stepped over and wiped his blade on the shirt of the bent-over man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fall down and die then, like a good fellow,\" he said to his victim. \"One less idiot walking the streets with the name of Captain Suljack on his sputtering lips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Murderer!\" a woman screamed at the knifeman as his victim fell to the street at his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah!

Fights broke out at every kiosk and wagon. Women screamed and children ran to better vantage points, so they could watch the fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom every corner, the city guards swooped in to restore order. Some shouted orders, but others countermanded those with opposing commands, and the fighting only widened. One furious guard captain ran into the midst of an opposing group, whose leader had just negated his call for a group of ruffians to stand down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who are you with, then?\" the leader of that group demanded of the guard captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With Luskan, ye fool,\" he retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah, there ain\u0027t no Luskan,\" the thug retorted. \"Luskan\u0027s dead - there\u0027s just the Five Ships.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What nonsense escapes your flapping lips?\" the guard captain demanded, but the man didn\u0027t relent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027re a Suljack man, ain\u0027t ye?\" he accused. The guard captain, who was indeed affiliated with Ship Suljack, stared at him incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man slugged him in the chest, and before he could respond, two others pulled back his arms so that the thug could continue the beating uninterrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe melee went on for a long while, until a sharp boom of thunder, a resounding and reverberating blast of explosive magic, drew everyone\u0027s attention to the eastern edge of the market. There stood Governor Deudermont, with Robillard, who had thrown the lightning signal, right beside him. All the crew of Sea Sprite and the remainder of Lord Brambleberry\u0027s men stood shoulder to shoulder behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve no time for this!\" the governor shouted. \"We stand together against the winter, or we fall!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rock flew at Deudermont\u0027s head, but Robillard caught it with a spell that gracefully and harmlessly moved it aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fighting broke out anew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a balcony at Taerl\u0027s castle, Baram and Taerl watched it all with great amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants to be the ruler, does he?\" Baram spat over the rail as he leaned on it and stared intently out at the hated Deudermont. \"A wish he\u0027s to come to regret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Note the guards,\" Taerl added. \"As soon as the fighting started, they moved to groups of their own Ship. Their loyalty\u0027s not to Deudermont or Luskan, but to a high captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s our town,\" Baram insisted. \"And I\u0027ve had enough of Governor Deudermont already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaerl nodded his agreement and watched the continuing fracas, one that he and Baram had incited with well-paid, well-fed, and well-liquored proxies. \"Chaos,\" he whispered, smiling all the wider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027s you,\" Suljack said as the tough dwarf moved through his door and into his private chambers. \"What news from Ship Rethnor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A great fight in the market,\" the dwarf replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuljack sighed and wearily rubbed a hand over his face. \"Fools,\" he said. \"They\u0027ll not give Deudermont a chance - the man will do great things for Luskan, and for our trade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf shrugged as though he hardly cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now\u0027s not the time for us to be fighting among ourselves,\" Suljack remarked, and paced the room, still rubbing at his face. He stopped and turned on the dwarf. \"It\u0027s just as Kensidan predicted. We been battered but we\u0027ll come out all the better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some will. Some won\u0027t\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuljack looked at Kensidan\u0027s bodyguard curiously at that remark. \"Why are you here?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That fight in the market weren\u0027t random,\" said the dwarf. \"Ye\u0027re to be finding more than a few o\u0027 yer boys hurtin\u0027 - might be a few dead, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My boys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slow on the upkeep, eh?\" asked the dwarf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Suljack stared at him with a thoroughly puzzled expression and asked, \"Why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To keep ye alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question set the high captain back on his heels. \"I\u0027m a high captain of Luskan!\" he protested. \"I have a guard of my - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And ye\u0027re needin\u0027 more help than meself\u0027ll bring ye if ye\u0027re still thinking the fight in the market to be a random brawl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you saying that my men were targeted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Said it twice, if ye was smart enough to hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Kensidan sent you here to protect me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf threw him an exaggerated wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Preposterous!\" Suljack yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027re welcome,\" said the dwarf, and he plopped down in a seat facing the room\u0027s only door and stared at it without blinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They found three bodies this morning,\" Robillard reported to Deudermont at the next sunrise. They sat in the front guest hall of the Red Dragon Inn, which had come to serve as the official Governor\u0027s Palace. The room boasted wide, strong windows, reinforced with intricate iron work, which looked out to the south, to the River Mirar and the main section of Luskan across it. \"Only three today, so I suppose that\u0027s a good thing. Unless, of course, the Mirar swept ten times that number out into the bay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your sarcasm knows no end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an easy thing to criticize,\" Robillard replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because what I try to do here is a difficult thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or a foolish thing, and one that will end badly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont got up from the breakfast table and walked across the room. \"I\u0027ll not argue this same point with you every morning!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And still, every morning will be just like this - or worse,\" Robillard replied. He moved to the window and looked out into the distance of Luskan\u0027s market. \"Do you think the merchants will come out today? Or will they just cancel the next tenday\u0027s work and pack up their wagons for Waterdeep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve still much to sell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or to have pilfered in the next fight, which should be in a few hours, I would guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guards will be thick about the market this day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose? Baram\u0027s? Suljack\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luskan\u0027s!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, foolish of me to think otherwise,\" said Robillard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot deny that High Captain Suljack sat on the dais,\" Deudermont reminded. \"Or that his men shouldered up to us when the market fighting died away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because his men were getting clobbered,\" Robillard replied with a chuckle. \"Which might be due to his sitting on that dais. Have you thought of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont sighed and waved his hand at the cynical wizard. \"Have Sea Sprite\u0027s crew visible in the market as well,\" he instructed. \"Order them to stay close to each other, but to be a very obvious presence. The show of force will help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Brambleberry\u0027s men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For tomorrow,\" Deudermont replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They may be gone by then,\" Robillard said. The captain looked at him with surprise. \"Oh, have you not heard?\" the wizard asked. \"Lord Brambleberry\u0027s veteran and cultured warriors have had quite enough of this uncouth City of Sails and intend to head back to their own City of Splendors before the winter closes the boat lanes. I don\u0027t know when they\u0027ll go, but have heard some remark that the next favorable tide wouldn\u0027t be soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont sighed and dropped his head in his hand. \"Offer them bonuses if they will remain through the winter,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonuses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Large ones - as much as we can afford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. You will spend all our gold on your folly before you admit you were wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont\u0027s head snapped up and around so he could glare at the wizard. \"Our gold?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yours, my captain,\" Robillard said with a deep bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was not wrong,\" said Deudermont. \"Time is our ally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will need more tangible allies than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Mirabarrans...\" Deudermont said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have closed their gates,\" Robillard replied. \"Our merchant friends from Mirabar suffered greatly when the Hosttower exploded. Many dwarves went straight to Moradin\u0027s Halls. You\u0027ll not see them on the wall with Luskan\u0027s city guard anytime soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont felt and looked old indeed at that moment of great trial. He sighed again and muttered, \"The high captains...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will need them,\" Robillard agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We already have Suljack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one least respected by the other four, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a start!\" Deudermont insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the others will surely come along to our side, since you know some of them so well already,\" Robillard said with mock enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Deudermont couldn\u0027t help but chuckle at that quip. Oh yes, he knew them. He had sunk the ships of at least two of the remaining four beneath them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My crew has never let me down,\" Deudermont said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your crew fights pirates, not cities,\" came the reminder, stealing any comfort the already beleaguered governor might have garnered from his last remark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Robillard recognized the man\u0027s despair and showed him some sympathy. \"The remnants of the Hosttower....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont looked at him curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arabeth and the others,\" Robillard explained. \"I will put them in and around the crew in the market square, in their full Hosttower regalia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is great bitterness against those insignias,\" Deudermont warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A calculated risk,\" the wizard admitted. \"Surely there are many in Luskan who would see any and all members of the Hosttower destroyed, but surely, too, there are many who recognize the role that Arabeth played in securing the victory we achieved, however great the cost. I wouldn\u0027t send her and her lessers out alone, to be sure, but among our crew, with your approval bolstering them, she and hers will serve us well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You trust her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I trust in her judgment, and now she knows that her existence here is predicated on the victory of Captain...of GovernorDeudermont.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont considered the reasoning for a moment then nodded his agreement. \"Send for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArabeth Raurym left Deudermont\u0027s palace later that same day, pulling her cloak tight against the driving rain. She padded down the puddle-filled street, sweeping up attendants from every corner and alley until the full contingent of eleven former Hosttower wizards marched as a group. It wouldn\u0027t do for any of them to be out alone, with so many of Luskan\u0027s folk nursing fresh wounds at the hands of their previous comrades. Not a person in Luskan spoke of the Hosttower of the Arcane with anything but venom, it seemed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave her orders as they walked, and as soon as they linked up with Sea Sprite\u0027s crew, just north of Illusk, Arabeth took her leave. She cast an enchantment upon herself, reducing her size, making her look like a small girl, and moved southeast into the city, heading straight for Ten Oaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her relief, she was not recognized or bothered, and soon stood before the seated Kensidan, taking note that his newest - and reputedly strongest - bodyguard, that curious and annoying dwarf, was nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robillard understands the precarious perch upon which Deudermont stands,\" she reported. \"They will not be caught unawares.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can they not understand when half the city is in conflict, or burning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blame Taerl and Baram,\" Arabeth reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blame them, or credit them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted Deudermont as a figurehead, to give credibility and bona fides to Luskan,\" the overwizard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Baram and Taerl decide to openly oppose Deudermont, all the better for those wise enough to pick up the pieces,\" Kensidan replied. \"Whichever side proves victorious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t sound like you hold any doubts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t bet against the captain of Sea Sprite. Of course, the battleground has changed quite dramatically.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t bet against whichever side Ships Kurth and Rethnor join.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Join?\" the son of Ship Rethnor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArabeth nodded, smiling as if she knew something Kensidan hadn\u0027t yet deduced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wish to remain neutral in this fight, and savor the opportunities,\" Arabeth explained. \"But one side - Deudermont\u0027s, I predict - will not grow weaker in the conflict. Nay, he will strengthen his hand, and dangerously so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have considered that possibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if you allow it, will Deudermont\u0027s reign be any different than that of Arklem Greeth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t a lich. That\u0027s a start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArabeth folded her arms over her chest at the snide comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will see how it plays out,\" Kensidan said. \"We will allow them - all three of them - their play, as long as it doesn\u0027t interfere with my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your shield guard is with Suljack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I applaud your skill at deduction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Arabeth said. \"Taerl and Baram are not in good spirits toward Suljack, not after he sat behind Deudermont on the stage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think they would be, hence....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You put him there? Surely you knew that Baram would go out of his mind with rage at the thought of Deuder - \" She paused and a smile widened across her fair face as she sorted it all out. \"Kurth could threaten you, but you don\u0027t think that likely - not, at least, until the rest of the city has sorted under the new hierarchy. With that confidence, the only threats to your gains would be Deudermont, who is now far too busy in simply trying to maintain some semblance of order, and an alliance of the lesser high captains, particularly Baram and Taerl, neither of whom have been fond of Ship Rethnor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure that Kurth is as pleased as I am that Baram and Taerl have revealed such anger at Suljack, poor Suljack,\" Kensidan remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been saying you intended to profit from the chaos,\" Arabeth replied with obvious admiration. \"I didn\u0027t know that you meant to control that chaos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I did control it, it wouldn\u0027t truly be chaos, now would it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Herd it, then, if not control it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would be a sorry high captain if I didn\u0027t work to ensure that the situation would lean in favor of my Ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArabeth assumed a pose that was as much one of seduction as of petulance, with one hand on a hip thrust forward and a wicked little grin on her face. \"But you are not a high captain,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Kensidan replied, seeming distant and unmoved. \"Let us make sure that everyone understands the truth of that statement.
