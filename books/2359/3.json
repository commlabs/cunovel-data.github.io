She could not bear to go back to the despoiled house, so she hecked into a small hotel on Magazine Street, far from the French Quarter, where the mad parades were still going on. She had no luggage, and the suspicious clerk behind the desk said, \"You\u0027ll have to pay in advance. That\u0027ll be forty dollars for the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom her room Tracy telephoned Clarence Desmond to tell him she would be unable to come to work for a few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe concealed his irritation at being inconvenienced. \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" he told Tracy. \"I\u0027ll find someone to fill in until you return.\" He hoped she would remember to tell Charles Stanhope how understanding he had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy\u0027s next call was to Charles. \"Charles, darling\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the devil are you, Tracy? Mother has been trying to reach you all morning. She wanted to have lunch with you today. You two have a lot of arrangements to go over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, darling. I\u0027m in New Orleans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re where? What are you doing in New Orleans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;died.\" The word stuck in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" The tone of his voice changed instantly. \"I\u0027m sorry, Tracy. It must have been very sudden. She was quite young, wasn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was very young, Tracy thought miserably. Aloud she said, \"Yes. Yes, she was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened? Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow Tracy could not bring herself to tell Charles that it was suicide. She wanted desperately to cry out the whole terrible story about what they had done to her mother, but she stopped herself. It\u0027s my problem, she thought. I can\u0027t throw my burden on Charles. She said, \"Don\u0027t worry I\u0027m all right, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like me to come down there, Tracy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Thank you. I can handle it. I\u0027m burying Mama tomorrow. I\u0027ll be back in Philadelphia on Monday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she hung up, she lay on the hotel bed, her thoughts unfocused. She counted the stained acoustical tiles on the ceiling. One... two... three... Romano... four... five... Joe Romano... six... seven... he was going to pay. She had no plan. She knew only that she was not going to let Joe Romano get away with what he had done, that she would find some way to avenge her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy left her hotel in the late afternoon and walked along Canal Street until she came to a pawn shop. A cadaverous-looking man wearing an old-fashioned green eyeshade sat in a cage behind a counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I want to buy a gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know... a... revolver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want a thirty-two, a forty-five, a\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy had never even held a gun. \"A\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a thirty-two will do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a nice thirty-two caliber Smith and Wesson here for two hundred twenty-nine dollars, or a Charter Arms thirty-two for a hundred fifty-nine...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had not brought much cash with her. \"Have you got something cheaper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Cheaper is a slingshot, lady. Tell you what. I\u0027ll let you have the thirty-two for a hundred fifty, and I\u0027ll throw in a box of bullets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" Tracy watched as he moved over to an arsenal on a table behind him and selected a revolver. He brought it to the counter. \"You know how to use it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;you pull the trigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted. \"Do you want me to show you how to load it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to say no, that she was not going to use it, that she just wanted to frighten someone, but she realized how foolish that would sound. \"Yes, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy watched as he inserted the bullets into the chamber. \"Thank you.\" She reached in tier purse and counted out the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll need your name and address for the police records.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had not occurred to Tracy. Threatening Joe Romano with a gun was a criminal act. But he\u0027s the criminal, not I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green eyeshade made the man\u0027s eyes a pale yellow as he watched her. \"Name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smith. Joan Smith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a note on a card. \"Address?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dowman Road. Thirty-twenty Dowman Road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout looking up he said, \"There is no Thirty-twenty Dowman Road. That would be in the middle of the river. We\u0027ll make it Fifty-twenty.\" He pushed the receipt in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe signed JOAN SMITH. \"Is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it.\" He carefully pushed the revolver through the cage. Tracy stared at it, then picked it up, put it in her purse, turned and hurried out of the shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, lady,\" he yelled after her. \"Don\u0027t forget that gun is loaded!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson Square is in the heart of the French Quarter, with the beautiful St. Louis Cathedral towering over it like a benediction. Lovely old homes and estates in the square are sheltered from the bustling street traffic by tall hedges and graceful magnolia trees. Joe Romano lived in one of those houses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy waited until dark before she set out. The parades had moved on to Chartres Street, and in the distance Tracy could hear an echo of the pandemonium she had been swept up in earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood in the shadows, studying the house, conscious of the heavy weight of the gun in her purse. The plan she had worked out was simple. She was going to reason with Joe Romano, ask him to clear her mother\u0027s name. If he refused, she would threaten him with the gun and force him to write out a confession. She would take it to Lieutenant Miller, and he would arrest Romano, and her mother\u0027s name would be protected. She wished desperately that Charles were there with her, but it was best to do it alone. Charles had to be left out of it. She would tell him about it when it was all over and Joe Romano was behind bars, where he belonged. A pedestrian was approaching. Tracy waited until he had walked past and the street was deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked up to the house and pressed the doorbell. There was no answer. He\u0027s probably at one of the private krewes balls given during Mardi Gras. But I can wait, Tracy thought. I can wait until he gets home. Suddenly, the porch light snapped on, the front door opened, and a man stood in the doorway. His appearance was a surprise to Tracy. She had envisioned a sinister-looking mobster, evil written all over his face. Instead, she found herself facing an attractive, pleasant-looking man who could easily have been mistaken for a university professor. His voice was low and friendly. \"Hello. May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you Joseph Romano?\" Her voice was shaky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. What can I do for you?\" He had an easy, engaging manner. No wonder my mother was taken in by this man, Tracy thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027d like to talk to you, Mr. Romano.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her figure for a moment. \"Certainly. Please come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy walked into a living room filled with beautiful, burnished antique furniture. Joseph Romano lived well. On my mother\u0027s money, Tracy thought bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just about to mix myself a drink. What would you like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her curiously.. \"What was it you wanted to see me about, Miss\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tracy Whitney. I\u0027m Doris Whitney\u0027s daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her blankly for an instant, and then a look of recognition flashed across his face. \"Oh, yes. I heard about your mother. Too bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo bad! He had caused the death of her mother, and his only comment was: \"Too bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Romano, the district attorney believes that my mother was guilty of fraud. You know that\u0027s not true. I want you to help me clear her name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I never talk business during Mardi Gras. It\u0027s against my religion.\" Romano walked over to the bar and began mixing two drinks. \"I think you\u0027ll feel better after you\u0027ve had a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was leaving her no choice. Tracy opened her purse and pulled out the revolver. She pointed it at him. \"I\u0027ll tell you what will make me feel better, Mr. Romano. Having you confess to exactly what you did to my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoseph Romano turned and saw the gun. \"You\u0027d better put that away, Miss Whitney. It could go off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to go off if you don\u0027t do exactly what I tell you to. You\u0027re going to write down how you stripped the company, put it into bankruptcy, and drove my mother to suicide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was watching her carefully now, his dark eyes wary. \"I see. What if I refuse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m going to kill you.\" She could feel the gun shaking in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t took like a killer, Miss Whitney.\" He was moving toward her now, a drink in his hand. His voice was soft and sincere. \"I had nothing to do with your mother\u0027s death, and believe me, I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \" He threw the drink in her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy felt the sharp sting of the alcohol in her eyes, and an instant later the gun was knocked from her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your old lady held out on me,\" Joe Romano said. \"She didn\u0027t tell me she had a horny-looking daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was holding her, pinning her arms, and Tracy was blinded and terrified. She tried to move away from him, but he backed her into a wall, pressing against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have guts, baby. I like that. It turns me on.\" His voice was hoarse. Tracy could feel his body hard against hers, and she tried to twist away, but she was helpless in his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came here for a little excitement, huh? Well, Joe\u0027s going to give it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to scream, but her voice came out in a gasp. \"Let me go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ripped her blouse away. \"Hey! Look at those tits,\" he whispered. He began pinching her nipples. \"Fight me, baby,\" he whispered. \"I love it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go of me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was squeezing harder, hurting her. She felt herself being forced down to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet you\u0027ve never been fucked by a real man,\" he said. He was astride her now, his body heavy on hers, his hands moving up her thighs. Tracy pushed out blindly, and her fingers touched the gun. She grabbed for it, and there was a sudden, loud explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jesus!\" Romano cried. His grip suddenly relaxed. Through a red mist, Tracy watched in horror as he fell off her and slumped to the floor, clutching his side. \"You shot me... you bitch. You shot me....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy was transfixed, unable to move. She felt she was going to be sick, and her eyes were blinded by stabbing pain. She pulled herself to her feet, turned, and stumbled to a door at the far end of the room. She pushed it open. It was a bathroom. She staggered over to the sink, filled the basin with cold water, and bathed her eyes until the pain began to subside and her vision cleared. She looked into the cabinet mirror. Her eyes were bloodshot and wild looking. My God, I\u0027ve just killed a man. She ran back into the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Romano lay on the floor, his blood seeping onto the white rug. Tracy stood over him, white-faced. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said inanely. \"I didn\u0027t mean to\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ambulance...\" His breathing was ragged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy hurried to the telephone on the desk and dialed the operator. When she tried to speak, her voice was choked. \"Operator, send an ambulance right away. The address is Four-twenty-one Jackson Square. A man has been shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe replaced the receiver and looked down at Joe Romano. Oh, God, she prayed, please don\u0027t let him die. You know I didn\u0027t meal: to kill him. She knelt beside the body on the floor to see if he was still alive. His eyes were closed, but he was breathing. \"An ambulance is on its way,\" Tracy promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried not to run, afraid of attracting attention. She pulled her jacket close around her to conceal her ripped blouse. Four blocks from the house Tracy tried to hail a taxi. Half a dozen sped past her, filled with happy, laughing passengers. In the distance Tracy heard the sound of an approaching siren, and seconds later an ambulance raced past her, headed in the direction of Joe Romano\u0027s house. I\u0027ve got to get away from here, Tracy thought. Ahead of her, a taxi pulled to the curb and discharged its passengers. Tracy ran toward it, afraid of losing it. \"Are you free?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That depends. Where you goin\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The airport.\" She held her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way to the airport, Tracy thought about the ambulance. What if they were too late and Joe Romano was dead? She would be a murderess. She had left the gun back at the house, and her fingerprints were on it. She could tell the police that Romano had tried to rape her and that the gun had gone off accidentally, but they would never believe her. She had purchased the gun that was lying on the floor beside Joe Romano. How much time had passed? Half an hour? An hour? She had to get out of New Orleans as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enjoy the carnival?\" the driver asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy swallowed. \"I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;yes.\" She pulled out her hand mirror and did what she could to make herself presentable. She had been stupid to try to make Joe Romano confess. Everything had gone wrong. How can I tell Charles what happened? She knew how shocked he would be, but after she explained, he would understand. Charles would know what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the taxi arrived at New Orleans International Airport, Tracy wondered, Was it only this morning that I was here? Did all this happen in just one day? Her mother\u0027s suicide... the horror of being swept up in the carnival... the man snarling, \"You shot me... you bitch....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tracy walked into the terminal, it seemed to her that everyone was staring at her accusingly. That\u0027s what a guilty conscience does, she thought. She wished there were some way she could learn about Joe Romano\u0027s condition, but she had no idea what hospital he would be taken to or whom she could call. He\u0027s going to be all right. Charles and I will come back for Mother\u0027s funeral, and Joe Romano will be fine. She tried to push from her mind the vision of the man lying on the white rug, his blood staining it red. She had to hurry home to Charles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy approached the Delta Airlines counter. \"I\u0027d like a one-way ticket on the next flight to Philadelphia, please. Tourist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe passenger representative consulted his computer. \"That will be Flight three-o-four. You\u0027re in luck. I have one seat left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time does the plane leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In twenty minutes. You just have time to board.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Tracy reached into her purse, she sensed rather than saw two uniformed police officers step up on either side of her. One of them said, \"Tracy Whitney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart stopped beating for an instant. It would be stupid to deny my identity. \"Yes...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re under arrest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Tracy felt the cold steel of handcuffs snapped on her wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was happening in slow motion to someone else. Tracy watched herself being led through the airport, manacled to one of the policemen, while passersby turned to stare. She was shoved into the back of a black-and-white squad car with steel mesh separating the front seat from the rear. The police car sped away from the curb with red lights flashing and sirens screaming. She huddled in the backseat, trying to become invisible. She was a murderess. Joseph Romano had died. But it had been an accident. She would explain how it had happened. They had to believe her. They had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police station Tracy was taken to was in the Algiers district, on the west bank of New Orleans, a grim and foreboding building with a look of hopelessness about it. The booking room was crowded with seedy-looking characters\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;prostitutes, pimps, muggers, and their victims. Tracy was marched to the desk of the sergeant-on-watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of her captors said, \"The Whitney woman, Sarge. We caught her at the airport tryin\u0027 to escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the cuffs off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handcuffs were removed. Tracy found her voice. \"It was an accident. I didn\u0027t mean to kill him. He tried to rape me and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \" She could not control the hysteria in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desk sergeant said curtly, \"Are you Tracy Whitney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lock her up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Wait a minute,\" she pleaded. \"I have to call someone. I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027m entitled to make a phone call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desk sergeant grunted, \"You know the routine, huh? How many times you been in the stammer, honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None. This is\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get one call. Three minutes. What number do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so nervous that she could not remember Charles\u0027s telephone number. She could not even recall the area code for Philadelphia. Was it two-five-one? No. That was not right. She was trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on. I haven\u0027t got all night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo-one-five. That was it! \"Two-one-five-five-five-five-nine-three-zero-one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desk sergeant dialed the number and handed the phone to Tracy. She could hear the phone ringing. And ringing. There was no answer. Charles had to be home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desk sergeant said, \"Time\u0027s up.\" He started to take the phone from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please wait!\" she cried. But she suddenly remembered that Charles shut off his phone at night so that he would not be disturbed. She listened to the hollow ringing and realized there was no way she could reach him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desk sergeant asked, \"You through?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy looked up at him and said dully, \"I\u0027m through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA policeman in shirt-sleeves took Tracy. into a room where she was booked and fingerprinted, then led down a corridor and locked in a holding cell, by herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have a hearing in the morning,\" the policeman told her. He walked away, leaving her alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this is happening, Tracy thought. This is all a terrible dream. Oh, please, God, don\u0027t let any of this be real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the stinking cot in the cell was real, and the seatless toilet in the corner was real, and the bars were real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hours of the night dragged by endlessly. If only I could have reached Charles. She needed him now more than she had ever needed anyone in her life. I should have confided in him in the first place. If I had, none of this would have happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 6:00 A.M. a bored guard brought Tracy a breakfast of tepid coffee and cold oatmeal. She could not touch it. Her stomach was in knots. At 9:00 a matron came for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time to go, sweetie.\" She unlocked the cell door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must make a call,\" Tracy said. \"It\u0027s very\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later,\" the matron told her. \"You don\u0027t want to keep the judge waiting. He\u0027s a mean son of a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe escorted Tracy down a corridor and through a door that led into a courtroom. An elderly judge was seated on the bench. His head and hands kept moving in small, quick jerks. In front of him stood the district attorney, Ed Topper, a slight man in his forties, with crinkly salt-and-pepper hair cut en brosse, and cold, black eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy was led to a seat, and a moment later the bailiff called out, \"People against Tracy Whitney,\" and Tracy found herself moving toward the bench. The judge was scanning a sheet of paper in front of him, his head bobbing up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow. Now was Tracy\u0027s moment to explain to someone in authority the truth about what had happened. She pressed her hands together to keep them from trembling. \"Your Honor, it wasn\u0027t murder. I shot him, but it was an accident. I only meant to frighten him. He tried to rape me and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district attorney interrupted. \"Your Honor, I see no point in wasting the court\u0027s time. This woman broke into Mr. Romano\u0027s home, armed with a thirty-two-caliber revolver, stole a Renoir painting worth half a million dollars, and when Mr. Romano caught her in the act, she shot him in cold blood and left him for dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy felt the color draining from her face. \"What\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this was making any sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district attorney rapped out, \"We have the gun with which she wounded Mr. Romano. Her fingerprints are on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWounded! Then Joseph Romano was alive! She had not killed anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She escaped with the painting. Your Honor. It\u0027s probably in the hands of a fence by now. For that reason, the state is requesting that Tracy Whitney be held for attempted murder and armed robbery and that bail be set at half a million dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe judge turned to Tracy, who stood there in shock. \"Are you represented by counsel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not even hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his voice. \"Do you have an attorney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy shook her head. \"No. I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what this man said isn\u0027t true. I never\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have money for an attorney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was her employees\u0027 fund at the bank. There was Charles. \"I... no, Your Honor, but I don\u0027t understand\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The court will appoint one for you. You are ordered held in jail, in lieu of five hundred thousand dollars bail. Next case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! This is all a mistake! I\u0027m not\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no recollection of being led from the courtroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name of the attorney appointed by the court was Perry Pope. He was in his late thirties, with a craggy, intelligent face and sympathetic blue eyes. Tracy liked him immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked into her cell, sat on the cot, and said, \"Well! You\u0027ve created quite a sensation for a lady who\u0027s been in town only twenty-four hours.\" He grinned. \"But you\u0027re lucky. You\u0027re a lousy shot. It\u0027s only a flesh wound. Romano\u0027s going to live.\" He took out a pipe. \"Mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe filled his pipe with tobacco, lit it, and studied Tracy. \"You don\u0027t look like the average desperate criminal. Miss Whitney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not. I swear I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Convince me,\" he said. \"Tell me what happened. From the beginning. Take your time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy told him. Everything. Perry Pope sat quietly listening to her story, not speaking until Tracy was finished. Then he leaned back against the wall of the cell, a grim expression on his face. \"That bastard,\" Pope said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand what they were talking about.\" There was confusion in Tracy\u0027s eyes. \"I don\u0027t know anything about a painting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really very simple. Joe Romano used you as a patsy, the same way he used your mother. You walked right into a setup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me lay it out for you. Romano will put in an insurance claim for half a million dollars for the Renoir he\u0027s hidden away somewhere, and he\u0027ll collect. The insurance company will be after you, not him. When things cool down, he\u0027ll sell the painting to a private patty and make another half million, thanks to your do-it-yourself approach. Didn\u0027t you realize that a confession obtained at the point of a gun is worthless?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I suppose so. I just thought that if I could get the truth out of him, someone would start an investigation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pipe had gone out. He relit it. \"How did you enter his house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I rang the front doorbell, and Mr. Romano let me in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not his story. There\u0027s a smashed window at the back of the house, where he says you broke in. He told the police he caught you sneaking out with the Renoir, and when he tried to stop you, you shot him and ran.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a lie! I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s his lie, and his house, and your gun. Do you have any idea with whom you\u0027re dealing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy shook her head mutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me tell you the facts of life, Miss Whitney. This town is sewn up tight by the Orsatti Family. Nothing goes down here without Anthony Orsatti\u0027s okay. If you want a permit to put up a building, pave a highway, run girls, numbers, or dope, you see Orsatti. Joe Romano started out as his hit man. Now he\u0027s the top man in Orsatti\u0027s organization.\" He looked at her in wonder. \"And you walked into Romano\u0027s house and pulled a gun on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy sat there, numb and exhausted. Finally she asked, \"Do you believe my story?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"You\u0027re damned right. It\u0027s so dumb it has to be true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said slowly, \"I\u0027m going to try. I\u0027d give anything to put them all behind bars. They own this town and most of the judges in it. If you go to trial, they\u0027ll bury you so deep you\u0027ll sever see daylight again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy looked at him, puzzled. \"If I go to trial?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePope stood and paced up and down in the small cell. \"I don\u0027t want to put you in front of a jury, because, believe me, it will be his jury. There\u0027s only one judge Orsatti has never been able to buy. His name is Henry Lawrence. If I can arrange for him to hear this case, I\u0027m pretty sure I can make a deal for you. It\u0027s not strictly ethical, but I\u0027m going to speak to him privately. He hates Orsatti and Romano as much as I do. Now all we\u0027ve got to do is get to Judge Lawrence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry Pope arranged for Tracy to place a telephone call to Charles. Tracy heard the familiar voice of Charles\u0027s secretary. \"Mr. Stanhope\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harriet. This is Tracy Whitney. Is\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! He\u0027s been trying to reach you, Miss Whitney, but we didn\u0027t have a telephone number for you. Mrs. Stanhope is most anxious to discuss the wedding arrangements with you. If you could call her as soon as possible\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harriet, may I speak to Mr. Stanhope, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Miss Whitney. He\u0027s on his way to Houston for a meeting. If you\u0027ll give me your number, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll telephone you as soon as he can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \" There was no way she could have him telephone her at the jail. Not until she had a chance to explain things to him first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027ll have to call Mr. Stanhope back.\" She slowly replaced the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow, Tracy thought wearily. I\u0027ll explain it all to Charles tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat afternoon Tracy was moved to a larger cell. A delicious hot dinner appeared from Galatoire\u0027s, and a short time later fresh flowers arrived with a note attached. Tracy opened the envelope and pulled out the card. CHIN UP, WE\u0027RE GOING TO BEAT THE BASTARDS. PERRY POPE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came to visit Tracy the following morning. The instant she saw the smile on his face, she knew there was good news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got lucky,\" he exclaimed. \"I\u0027ve just left Judge Lawrence and Topper, the district attorney. Topper screamed like a banshee, but we\u0027ve got a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told Judge Lawrence your whole story. He\u0027s agreed to accept a guilty plea from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy stared at him in shock. \"A guilty plea? But I\u0027m not\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised a hand. \"Hear me out. By pleading guilty, you save the state the expense of a trial. I\u0027ve persuaded the judge that you didn\u0027t steal the painting. He knows Joe Romano, and he believes me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... if I plead guilty,\" Tracy asked slowly, \"what will they do to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judge Lawrence will sentence you to three months in prison with\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prison!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute. He\u0027ll suspend the sentence, and you can do your probation out of the state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then I\u0027ll\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027ll have a record.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry Pope sighed. \"If they put you on trial for armed robbery and attempted murder during the commission of a felony, you could be sentenced to ten years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen years in jail!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry Pope was patiently watching her. \"It\u0027s your decision,\" he\u0027said. \"I can only give you my best advice. It\u0027s a miracle that I got away with this. They want an answer now. You don\u0027t have to take the deal. You can get another lawyer and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She knew that this man was honest. Under the circumstances, considering her insane behavior, he had done everything possible for her. If only she could talk to Charles. But they needed an answer now. She was probably lucky to get off with a three-month suspended sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027ll take the deal,\" Tracy said. She had to force the words out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Smart girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not permitted to make any phone calls before she was returned to the courtroom. Ed Topper stood on one side of her, and Perry Pope on the other. Seated on the bench was a distinguished-looking man in his fifties, with a smooth, unlined face and thick, styled hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Henry Lawrence said to Tracy, \"The court has been informed that the defendant wishes to change her plea from not guilty to guilty. Is that correct?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Your Honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are all parties in agreement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry Pope nodded. \"Yes, Your Honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The state agrees, Your Honor,\" the district attorney said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Lawrence sat there in silence for a long moment. Then he leaned forward and looked into Tracy\u0027s eyes. \"One of the reasons this great country of ours is in such pitiful shape is that the streets are crawling with vermin who think they can get away with anything. People who laugh at the law. Some judicial systems in this country coddle criminals. Well, in Louisiana, we don\u0027t believe in that. When, during the commission of a felony, someone tries to kill in cold blood, we believe that that person should be properly punished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy began to feel the first stirrings of panic. She turned to look at Perry Pope. His eyes were fixed on the judge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The defendant has admitted that she attempted to murder one of the outstanding citizens of this community\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a man noted for his philanthropy and good works. The defendant shot him while in the act of stealing an art object worth half a million dollars.\" His voice grew harsher. \"Well, this court is going to see to it that you don\u0027t get to enjoy that money\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not for the next fifteen years, because for the next fifteen years you\u0027re going to be incarcerated in the Southern Louisiana Penitentiary for Women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy felt the courtroom begin to spin. Some horrible joke was being played. The judge was an actor typecast for the part, but he was reading the wrong lines. He was not supposed to say any of those things. She turned to explain that to Perry Pope, but his eyes were averted. He was juggling papers in his briefcase, and for the first time, Tracy noticed that his fingernails were bitten to the quick. Judge Lawrence had risen and was gathering up his notes. Tracy stood there, numb, unable to comprehend what was happening to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bailiff stepped to Tracy\u0027s side and took her arm. \"Come along,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Tracy cried. \"No, please!\" She looked up at the judge. \"There\u0027s been a terrible mistake, Your Honor. I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as she felt the bailiff\u0027s grip tighten on her arm, Tracy realized there had been no mistake. She had been tricked. They were going to destroy her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as they had destroyed her mother. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-tomorrow-comes/page-3.html","bookId":2359,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:06 AM"}
