He had a shabby suite of offices on the West Side that reeked of poverty. The receptionist\u0027s desk was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone to lunch,\" Melvin Hutcherson explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer wondered if he had a secretary. He ushered her into his private office, which was no larger than the reception office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me over the phone you wanted to talk about Connie Garrett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"There\u0027s not that much to talk about. We sued and we lost. Believe me, I did a bang-up job for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you handle the appeal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. We lost that, too. I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re spinning your wheels.\" He regarded her a moment. \"Why do you want to waste your time on something like this? You\u0027re hot. You could be working on big money cases.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing a friend a favor. Would you mind if I looked at the transcripts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help yourself,\" Hutcherson shrugged. \"They\u0027re public property.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer spent the evening going over the transcripts of Connie Garrett\u0027s lawsuit. To Jennifer\u0027s surprise, Melvin Hutcherson had told the truth: He had done a good job. He had named both the city and the Nationwide Motors Corporation as co-defendants, and had demanded a trial by jury. The jury had exonerated both defendants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Department of Sanitation had done its best to cope with the snowstorm that had swept the city that December; all its equipment had been in use. The city had argued that the storm was an act of God, and that if there was any negligence, it was on the part of Connie Garrett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer turned to the charges against the truck company. Three eyewitnesses had testified that the driver had tried to stop the truck to avoid hitting the victim, but that he had been unable to brake in time, and the truck had gone into an unavoidable spin and had hit her. The verdict in favor of the defendant had been upheld by the Appellate Division and the case had been closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer finished reading the transcripts at three o\u0027clock in the morning. She turned off the lights, unable to sleep. On paper, justice had been done. But the image of Connie Garrett kept coming into her mind. A girl in her twenties, without arms or legs. Jennifer visualized the truck hitting the young girl, the awful agony she must have suffered, the series of terrible operations that had been performed, each one cutting away parts of her limbs. Jennifer turned on the light and sat up in bed. She dialed Melvin Hutcherson\u0027s home number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing in the transcripts about the doctors,\" Jennifer said into the telephone. \"Did you look into the possibility of malpractice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA groggy voice said, \"Who the fuck is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jennifer Parker. Did you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Christ\u0027s sake! It\u0027s - it\u0027s four o\u0027clock in the morning! Don\u0027t you have a watch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is important. The hospital wasn\u0027t named in the suit. What about those operations that were performed on Connie Garrett? Did you check into them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause while Melvin Hutcherson tried to gather his thoughts. \"I talked to the heads of neurology and orthopedics at the hospital that took care of her. The operations were necessary to save her life. They were performed by the top men there and were done properly. That\u0027s why the hospital wasn\u0027t named in the suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer felt a sharp sense of frustration. \"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I told you before, you\u0027re wasting your time on this one. Now why don\u0027t we both get some sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the receiver clicked in Jennifer\u0027s ear. She turned out the light and lay back again. But sleep was farther away than ever. After a while, Jennifer gave up the struggle, arose and made herself a pot of coffee. She sat on her sofa drinking it, watching the rising sun paint the Manhattan skyline, the faint pink gradually turning into a bright, explosive red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer was disturbed. For every injustice there was supposed to be a remedy at law. Had justice been done in Connie Garrett\u0027s case? She glanced at the clock on the wall. It was six-thirty. Jennifer picked up the telephone again and dialed Melvin Hutcherson\u0027s number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you check out the record of the truck driver?\" Jennifer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sleepy voice said, \"Jesus Christ! Are you some kind of crazy? When do you sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The driver of the utility truck. Did you check out his record?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady, you\u0027re beginning to insult me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Jennifer insisted, \"but I have to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The answer is yes. He had a perfect record. This was his first accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that avenue was closed. \"I see.\" Jennifer was thinking hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Parker,\" Melvin Hutcherson said, \"do me a big favor, will you? If you have any more questions, call me during office hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Jennifer said absently. \"Go back to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks a lot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer replaced the receiver. It was time to get dressed and go to work. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-12.html","bookId":2357,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM"}
