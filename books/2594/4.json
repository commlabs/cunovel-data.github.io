He turned over in the soft bed, not knowing where he was for the moment, but completely unafraid. He expected the ice and the loneliness. But he was someplace good, and someone was waiting for him. He had only to climb to his feet, to go up the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite suddenly it all came clear. He was with Marius, his strange and hospitable friend. They were in a new city of promise and beauty built upon the ruins of the old. And good talk awaited him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up, stretching his limbs in the easy warmth of the room, and looked about himself, realizing that the illumination came from two old oil lamps, made of glass. How safe it seemed here. How pretty the painted wood of the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a clean linen shirt for him on the chair. He put it on, having much difficulty with the tiny buttons. His pants were fine as they were. He wore woolen stockings but no shoes. The floors were smooth and polished and warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let his tread announce him as he went up the stairs. It seemed very much the proper thing to do in this house, to let Marius know that he was coming, and not to be accused of boldness or stealth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he came to the door to the chamber where Daniel made his wondrous cities and towns, he paused, and very reticently glanced inside to see the boyish blond-haired Daniel at his work as though he had never retired for the day at all. Daniel looked up, and quite unexpectedly, gave Thorne an open smile as he greeted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thorne, our guest,\" he said. It had a faint tone of mockery, but Thorne sensed it was a weaker emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daniel, my friend,\" said Thorne, glancing again over the tiny mountains and valleys, over the fast-running little trains with their lighted windows, over the thick forest of trees which seemed Daniel\u0027s present obsession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel turned his eyes back to his work as though they hadn\u0027t spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was green paint now that he dabbed onto the small tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuietly, Thorne moved to go but as he did so, Daniel spoke:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marius says it\u0027s a craft, not an art that I do.\" He held up the tiny tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne didn\u0027t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I make the mountains with my own hands,\" said Daniel. \"Marius says I should make the houses as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Thorne found himself unable to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel went on talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like the houses that come in the packages. It\u0027s difficult to assemble them, even for me. Besides, I would never think of so many different types of houses. I don\u0027t know why Marius has to say such disparaging things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne was perplexed. Finally he said simply, \"I have no answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel went quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne waited for a respectful interval and then he went into the great room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire was going on a blackened hearth within a rectangle of heavy stones, and Marius was seated beside it, slumped in his large leather chair, rather in the posture of a boy than a man, beckoning for Thorne to take his place on a big leather couch opposite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit there if you will, or here if you prefer,\" said Marius kindly. \"If you mind the fire, I\u0027ll damp it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why would I mind it, friend?\" asked Thorne, as he seated himself. The cushions were thick and soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his eyes moved over the room, he saw that almost all the wood paneling was painted in gold or blue, and there were carvings on the ceiling beams above, and on the beams over the doorways. These carvings reminded him of his own times. But it was all new \u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf; as Marius had said, it was made by a modern man, this place, but it was made well and with much thought and care to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes blood drinkers fear the fire,\" said Marius, looking at the flames, his serene white face full of light and shadow. \"One never knows. I\u0027ve always liked it, though once I suffered dreadfully on account of it, but then you know that story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I do know it,\" said Thorne. \"No, I\u0027ve never heard it. If you want to tell it, I want to hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But first there are some questions you want answered,\" said Marius. \"You want to know if the things you saw with the Mind Gift were entirely real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Thorne. He remembered the net, the points of light, the Sacred Core. He thought of the Evil Queen. What had shaped his vision of her? It had been the thoughts of the blood drinkers who had gathered around her council table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized he was looking directly into Marius\u0027s eyes, and that Marius knew his thoughts completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius looked away, and into the fire, and then he said offhandedly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put your feet up on the table. All that matters here is comfort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius did this with his own feet, and Thorne stretched his legs out, crossing his feet at his ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk as you please,\" said Marius. \"Tell me what you know, if you wish; tell me what you would know.\" There seemed a touch of anger in his voice but it wasn\u0027t anger for Thorne. \"I have no secrets,\" Marius said. He studied Thorne\u0027s face thoughtfully, and then he continued: \"There are the others\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;the ones you saw at that council table, and even more, scattered to the ends of the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a little sigh and then a shake of his head, then he went on speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m too alone now. I want to be with those I love but I cannot.\" He looked at the fire. \"I come together with them for a short while and then I go away . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... I took Daniel with me because he needed me. I took Daniel because it\u0027s unendurable to me to be utterly alone. I sought the North countries because I was tired of the beautiful South lands, even tired of Italy where I was born. I used to think no mortal nor blood drinker could ever grow tired of bountiful Italy, but now I\u0027m tired, and want to look on the pure whiteness of snow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" said Thorne. The silence invited him to continue. \"After I was made a blood drinker,\" he said, \"I was taken South and it seemed Valhalla. In Rome I lived in a palace and looked out on the seven hills each night. It was a dream of soft breezes and fruit trees. I sat in a window high above the sea and watched it strike the rocks. I went down to the sea, and the sea was warm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius smiled a truly kind and trusting smile. He nodded. \"Italy, my Italy,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne thought the expression on his face was truly wondrous, and he wanted Marius to keep the smile but very quickly it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius had become sober and was looking into the flames again as though lost in his own sadness. In the light of the fire, his hair was almost entirely white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk to me, Marius,\" said Thorne. \"My questions can wait. I want the sound of your voice. I want your words.\" He hesitated. \"I know you have much to tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius looked at him as if startled, and warmed somewhat by this. Then he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m old, my friend,\" he said. \"I\u0027m a true Child of the Millennia. It was in the years of Caesar Augustus that I became a blood drinker. It was a Druid priest who brought me to this peculiar death, a creature named Mael, mortal when he wronged me, but a blood drinker soon after, and one who still lives though he tried not long ago to sacrifice his life in a new religious fervor. What a fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time has made us companions more than once. How perfectly odd. It\u0027s a lie that I hold him high in my affections. My life is full of such lies. I don\u0027t know that I\u0027ve ever forgiven him for what he did\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf; taking me prisoner, dragging me out of my mortal life to a distant grove in Gaul, where an ancient blood drinker, badly burnt, yet still imagining himself to be a god of the Sacred Grove, gave me the Dark Blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius stopped. \"Do you follow my meaning?\" \"Yes,\" said Thorne. \"I remember those groves and the whispers among us of gods who had lived in them. You are saying that a blood drinker lived within the Sacred Oak.\" Marius nodded. He went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Go to Egypt,\u0027 he charged me, this badly burnt god, this wounded god, \u0027and find the Mother. Find the reason for the terrible fire that has come from her, burning us far and wide.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this Mother,\" said Thorne. \"She was the Evil Queen who carried within her the Sacred Core.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Marius, his steady blue eyes passing over Thorne gently. \"She was the Evil Queen, friend, no doubt of it...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;shy;But in that time, two thousand years ago, she was silent and still and seemed the most desperate of victims. Four thousand years old they were, the pair of them\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;she and her consort Enkil. And she did possess the Sacred Core, there was no doubt of it, for the terrible fire had come to all blood drinkers on the morning when an exhausted elder blood drinker had abandoned the King and Queen to the bright desert sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood drinkers all over the world\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;gods, creatures of the night, lamias, whatever they called themselves\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;had suffered agony, some obliterated by terrible flames, others merely darkened and left with a meager pain. The very oldest suffered little, the youngest were ashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for the Sacred Parents\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;that is the kind thing to call them, I suppose\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;what had they done when the sun rose? Nothing. The Elder, severely burnt for all his efforts to make them wake or speak or run for shelter, found them as he had left them, unmovable, heedless, and so, fearing more suffering for himself he had returned them to a darkened chamber, which was no more than a miserable underground prison cell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius stopped. He paused so completely it seemed that the memories were too hurtful to him. He was watching the flames as men do, and the flames did their reliable and eternal dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell me,\" said Thorne. \"You found her, this Queen, you looked upon her with your own eyes that long ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I found her,\" Marius said softly. His voice was serious but not bitter. \"I became her keeper. \u0027Take us out of Egypt, Marius,\u0027 that is what she said to me with the silent voice\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;what you call the Mind Gift, Thorne\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;never moving her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I took her and her lover Enkil, and sheltered them for two thousand years as they remained still and silent as statues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kept them hidden in a sacramental shrine. It was my life; it was my solemn commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flowers and incense I put before them. I tended to their clothes. I wiped the dust from their motionless faces. It was my sacred obligation to do these things, and all the while to keep the secret from vagrant blood drinkers who might seek to drink their powerful blood, or even take them captive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes remained on the fire, but the muscles in his throat tightened, and Thorne could see the veins for a moment against the smoothness of his temples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the while,\" Marius went on, \"I loved her, this seeming divinity whom you so rightly call our Evil Queen; that\u0027s perhaps the greatest lie I\u0027ve ever lived. I loved her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you not love such a being?\" Thorne asked. \"Even in my sleep I saw her face. I felt her mystery. The Evil Queen. I felt her hell.And she had her silence to precede her. When she came to life it must have seemed as if a curse were broken, and she was at last released.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese words seemed to have a rather strong effect on Marius. His eves moved over Thorne a bit coldly and then he looked back at the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I said something wrong I am sorry for it,\" Thorne said. \"I was only trying to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she was like a goddess,\" Marius resumed. \"So I thought and so I dreamt, though I told myself and everyone else otherwise. It was part of my elaborate lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we have to confess our loves to everyone?\" asked Thorne softly. \"Can we not keep some secrets?\" With overwhelming pain he thought of his Maker. He did nothing to disguise these thoughts. He saw her again seated in the cave with the blazing fire behind her. He saw her taking the hairs from her own head and weaving them into thread with her distaff and her spindle. He saw her eyes rimmed in blood, and then he broke from these memories. He pushed them deep down inside his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Marius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius had not answered Thorne\u0027s question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence made Thorne anxious. He felt he should fall silent and let Marius go on. Yet the question came to his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did the disaster come to pass?\" Thorne asked. \"Why did the Evil Queen rise from her throne? Was it the Vampire Lestat with his electric songs who waked her? I saw him in human guise, dancing for humans, as if he were one of them. I smiled in my sleep, as I saw the modern world enfold him, unbelieving, amused, and dancing to his rhythms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what happened, my friend,\" said Marius, \"at least with the modern world. As for her? Her rising from her throne? His songs had much to do with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor we have to remind ourselves that for thousands of years she ad existed in silence. Flowers and incense, yes, these things I gave her in abundance, but music? Never. Not until the modern world made such a thing possible, and then Lestat\u0027s music came into the very room where she sat shimmering in her raiment. And it did wake her, not once, but twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first time was as shocking to me as the later disaster, though it was mended soon enough. It was two hundred years ago\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;on an island in the Aegean Sea\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;this little surprise, and I should have taken a hard lesson from it, but this in my pride I failed to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What took place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lestat was a new blood drinker and having heard of me, he sought me out, and with an honest heart. He wanted to know what I had to reveal. All over the world he\u0027d sought me, and then there came a time when he was weak and broken by the very gift of immortality, a time of his going into the earth as you went into the ice of the Far North.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought him to me; I talked with him as I\u0027m talking to you now. But something curious happened with him which caught me quite off guard. I felt a sudden surge of pure devotion to him and this combined with an extraordinary trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was young but he wasn\u0027t innocent. And when I talked, he listened perfectly. When I played the teacher, there came no argument. I wanted to tell him my earliest secrets. I wanted to reveal the secret of our King and Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It had been a long, long time since I\u0027d revealed that secret. I\u0027d been alone for a century among mortals. And Lestat, so absolute in his devotion to me, seemed completely worthy of my trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I took him down to the underground shrine. I opened the door upon the two seated figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the first few moments, he believed the Sacred Parents were statues, but quite suddenly he became aware that both were alive. He realized in fact that they were blood drinkers, and that they were greatly advanced in age, and that in them, he could see his destiny were he to endure for so many thousands of years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a terrifying realization. Even to the young who look on me, it is a difficult realization that they might become as pale and hard as I am. With the Mother and Father, it was horrifying, and Lestat was overcome with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nevertheless, he managed to bridle his fear and approach the Queen, and even to kiss her on the lips. It was a bold thing to do, but as I watched him I realized it was quite natural to him, and as he withdrew from her, he confessed to me that he knew her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Akasha. It was as if she\u0027d spoken it. And I could not deny that she had given it to him through his mind. Out of her centuries of silence had come her voice once more with this seductive confession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understand how young he was. Given the blood at twenty, he had been a blood drinker for perhaps ten years, no more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was I to make of this kiss and this secret revelation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I denied my love and my jealousy completely. I denied my crushing disappointment. I told myself, \u0027You are too wise for such. Learn from what\u0027s happened. Maybe this young one will bring something magnificent from her. Is she not a goddess?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I took Lestat to my salon, a room as comfortable as this, though in another style, and there we talked until early morn. I told him the tale of my making, of my journey to Egypt. I played the teacher with great earnestness and generosity, and something of pure self-indulgence. Was it for Lestat or for me that I wanted him to know everything? I don\u0027t know. But those were splendid hours for me, I know that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The following night, however, while I was about tending to the mortals who lived on my island and believed me to be their lord, Lestat did a dreadful thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taking from his own luggage a violin which was most precious to him\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;a musical instrument of uncanny power\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;he went down into the shrine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now it is plain to me, as it was then, that he could not have done this without the aid of the Queen, who with the Mind Gift opened the many doors for him that lay between him and her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed as Lestat tells it, she may have even put the very idea of playing the instrument into his mind. I don\u0027t think so. I think she opened the doors and summoned him, but it was he who brought the violin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calculating that it would make a sound totally unfamiliar and quite wonderful to her, he set out to mimic those he\u0027d seen playing the instrument, because in fact he didn\u0027t know how to play it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Within moments, my beautiful Queen had risen from the throne and was moving towards him. And he in his terror had dropped the violin which she crushed with her foot. No matter. She took him in her arms. She offered her blood to him, and then there happened something so remarkable that it\u0027s painful for me to reveal it. Not only did she allow him to drink from her, she also drank from him.\"It seems a simple thing, but it is not. For in all my centuries of coming to her, of taking blood from her, I had never felt the press of her teeth against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed, I know of no supplicant whose blood she ever drank. Once there was a sacrifice, and yes, she drank from that victim, and that victim was destroyed. But from her supplicants? Never. She was the fount, the giver, the healer of blood gods, and burnt children, but she did not drink from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet she drank from Lestat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did she see in those moments? I cannot imagine, yet it must have been a glimpse into the years of that time. It must have been a glimpse into Lestat\u0027s soul. Whatever it was, it was momentary, for her consort Enkil soon rose and moved to stop it, and by this time, I had arrived, and was trying desperately and successfully to prevent Lestat from being destroyed by Enkil who seemed to have no other purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The King and Queen returned to their throne, besmirched and bloody and finally silent. But for the rest of the night Enkil was restless, destroying the vases and braziers of the shrine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a terrifying display of power. And I realized that for his safety, indeed, even for my own, I must say farewell at once to Lestat, which caused me excruciating pain, and so we parted the following night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius fell silent again, and Thorne waited patiently. Then Marius began to speak once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what caused me the worst pain\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;the loss of Lestat, or my jealousy that she had given and taken with him. I\u0027m unable to know my own mind. You understand I felt I possessed her. I felt she was my Queen.\" His voice dropped to a whisper. \"When I revealed her to him, I was displaying a possession! You see what a liar I was?\" he asked. \"And then to lose him, to lose this young one with whom I felt such utter communion. Ah, that was such rich pain. Rather like the music of the violin, I think, just as deeply colored, such terrible pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do to ease your sorrow now?\" asked Thorne. \"For you carry it, as if she were here still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius looked up, and suddenly an expression of pure surprise brightened his face. \"You\u0027re right,\" he said. \"I carry the obligation, as if she were still with me, as if even now I had to go and spend my hours in her shrine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you be glad that it\u0027s over?\" asked Thorne. \"It seemed when I lay in my cave of ice, when I saw these things in dreams that there were others who were at peace when it was finished. Even the red-haired twins whom I saw standing before everyone seemed to have a sense that it was done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius nodded. \"They do all share this,\" said Marius, \"except perhaps for Lestat.\" He looked wondering at Thorne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me now how she was wakened finally,\" said Thorne, \"how she became the slayer of her children. I felt her pass me, close and with a searching eye, yet somehow I was not found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Others as well escaped her,\" said Marius, \"though how many no one knows. She tired of her slaughter and she came to us. I think she thought that she had time to finish. But her end came swiftly enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for the second resurrection, it was Lestat again, but I am as much to blame myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is what I believe happened. I brought the inventions of the modern world to her as offerings. At first it was the machines that played music, and then came those which would show moving pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, I brought the most powerful of all, the television that would play constantly. I set it in her shrine as though it were a sacrifice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she fed upon this thing,\" said Thorne, \"as gods are wont to do when they come down to their altars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she fed upon it. She fed upon its terrible electric violence. Lurid colors flashed over her face, and images accosted her. It might have wakened her with the sheer clamor. And I wonder sometimes if the endless public talk of the great world could not have in itself inspired an imitation of a mind in her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An imitation of a mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She awoke with a simple ugly sense of purpose. She would rule this world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius shook his head. His attitude was one of profound sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She would outwit its finest human minds,\" he said sorrowfully. \"She would destroy the vast majority of this world\u0027s male children. In a female paradise, she could create and enforce peace. It was nonsense\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf; a concept drenched in violence and blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd those of us who tried to reason with her had to take great care with our words not to insult her. Where could she have gotten these notions, except from the bits and pieces of electric dreams that she watched on the giant screen I\u0027d provided for her? Fictions of all kinds, and what the world calls News, all this had inundated her. I had loosed the flood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius\u0027s gaze flashed on Thorne as he continued: \"Of course she saw the vivid video songs of The Vampire Lestat.\" Marius smiled again, but it was a sad smile, and it brightened his face as sad songs brighten a face. \"And Lestat presented in his video films the very image of her on her throne as he had seen her centuries ago. Breaking faith with me, he told the secrets I had confided to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you destroy him for this!\" said Thorne, before he could stop himself. \"I would have done so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius only shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ve chosen to destroy myself instead,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve chosen to let my heart break inside me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, explain this thing to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t, I can\u0027t explain it to myself,\" said Marius. \"Perhaps I understand Lestat only too well. He couldn\u0027t endure the vow of silence he\u0027d given me. Not in this world you see around you with all its wonders. He felt driven to reveal our history.\" The heat danced in Marius\u0027s face. His fingers gripped the arms of his chair with only a little restlessness. \"He tore loose from all bonds that connected us,\" he said, \"friend and friend, teacher and student, old and young, watcher and searching one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Outrage,\" said Thorne, \"what else could you feel but fury?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, in my heart I did. But you see, I lied to them, the other blood drinkers, our brothers, our sisters. Because once the Queen had risen, they needed me....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Thorne, \"I saw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They needed the wise one to reason with her, and deflect her from her course. There was no time for quarreling. Lestat\u0027s songs had brought her forth a monster. I told the others there was no wound. I took Lestat in my arms. And as for my Queen, ah, my Queen, how I denied that I had ever loved her. And all this for the company of a small band of immortals. And I tell the truth to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it feel good to you to say it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, it feels good,\" Marius answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was she destroyed? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thousands of years ago a curse had been put on her by one whom she had treated with cruelty and that one came to settle the score. A single blow decapitated our beautiful Queen, and then from her body the Sacred Core of the blood drinkers was promptly taken into the avenger, either from brain or heart, I know not which, for during those fatal moments I was as blind as all the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know only the one who slew the Queen now carries the Sacred Core within her and where she\u0027s gone or how I can\u0027t tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the red-haired twins,\" said Thorne. \"They stood beside her body. \u0027The Queen of the Damned,\u0027 said my Maharet. I heard those words. I saw Maharet with her arm around her sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Thorne felt himself become agitated. He felt the beginnings of pain inside. In memory, he saw his Maker coming towards him in the snow. What fear did he have then, a mortal warrior facing a lone witch whom he could destroy with sword or ax? How frail and beautiful she had seemed, a tall being in a dress of dark-purple wool, her arms out as if welcoming him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I have come here for you. It is for you that I linger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t fall under her spell. They wouldn\u0027t find his body in the snow, the eyes torn out of his face, as they had found so many others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted the memory to go away. He spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is my Maker, the red-haired one,\" he said, \"Maharet, the sister of the one who took within herself the Sacred Core.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. He could scarcely breathe he felt such pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius stared at him intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had come North to find a lover among our people,\" Thorne said. He paused, his conviction wavering. But then he continued. \"She hunted our clan and the others who lived in our valley. She stole the eyes from those whom she slew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The eyes and the blood,\" said Marius to him softly. \"And when she made you a blood drinker, you learnt why she needed the eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but not the true story\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;not the tale of the one who had taken her mortal eyes. And of her twin, I knew not an inkling. I loved her completely. I asked few questions. I could not share her company with others. It made me mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the Evil Queen who took her eyes,\" said Marius, \"when she was still human; and from her twin sister, the tongue. That was a cruel injustice, that. And one who also possessed the Blood could not endure it, and so he made them both blood drinkers before the Evil Queen divided them and sent each twin to a different side of the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne gasped as he though of it.He tried to feel love inside himself\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw his Maker again in the brightly lighted cave with her thread and her spindle. He saw her long red hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so it was finished,\" said Thorne, \"the catastrophe I beheld as I slept in the ice. The Evil Queen is gone, punished forever, and the twins took the Sacred Core, yes, but when I search the world for the visions or the voices of our kind I can\u0027t find the twins. I hear nothing of them, though I want to know where they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have retreated,\" said Marius. \"They know they must hide. They know that someone may try to take the Sacred Core from them. They know that someone, bitter and finished with this world, may seek to destroy us all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes,\" said Thorne. He felt a chill come over his limbs. He wished suddenly that he had more blood in his veins. That he could go out and hunt\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;but then he didn\u0027t want to leave this warm place and these flowing words, not just now. It was too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt guilty that he had not told the whole truth of his suffering and his purpose to Marius. He didn\u0027t know if he could, and it seemed a terrible thing now to be under this roof, yet he remained there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know your truth,\" said Marius gently. \"You\u0027ve come forth with one vow and that is to find Maharet and do harm to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne winced as though he\u0027d been struck hard in the chest. He made no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such a thing,\" said Marius, \"is impossible. You knew it when you left her centuries ago for your sleep in the ice. She is powerful beyond our imagining. And I can tell you, without doubt, that her sister never leaves her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne could find no words. At last he spoke in a tense whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do I hate her for the form of life she gave me, when I never hated my mortal mother and father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius nodded and gave a bitter smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a wise question,\" Marius said. \"Abandon your hope of harming her. Stop dreaming of those chains in which she once bound Lestat unless you truly wish for her to bind you in them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Thorne\u0027s turn to nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what were those chains?\" he asked, his voice tense and bitter as before, \"and why do I want to be her hateful prisoner? So that she can know my wrath every night as she keeps me close to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chains made of her red hair?\" Marius suggested, with a slight shrug of his shoulders, \"bound with steel and with her blood?\" he mused. \"Bound with steel and with her blood and gold, perhaps. I never saw them. I only knew of them, and that they kept Lestat helpless in all his anger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know what they were,\" said Thorne. \"I want to find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forswear that purpose, Thorne,\" said Marius. \"I can\u0027t take you to her. And what if she beckoned for you as she did so long ago, and then she destroyed you when she discovered your hatred?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knew of it when I left her,\" said Thorne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why did you go?\" Marius asked. \"Was it the simple jealousy of others which your thoughts reveal to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She took them in favor one at a time. I couldn\u0027t endure it. You speak of a Druid priest who became a blood drinker. I know of such a one Mael was his name, the very name you\u0027ve spoken. She brought him into her small circle, a welcome lover. He was old in the Blood and had tales to tell, and she longed for this more than anything. I turned away from her then. I scarce think she saw me retreat. I scarce think she felt my hatred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius was listening intently. Then he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mael\" he said, his words gentle and patient. \"Tall and gaunt always, with a high bridged nose and deep-set blue eyes and long blond hair from his servitude in the Sacred Grove. That\u0027s the Mael who lured your sweet Maharet from you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Thorne. He felt the pain in his chest slacken. \"And she was sweet, that I can\u0027t deny, and she never spurned me. It was I who wandered away, towards the North land. It was I who hated him for his flattery of her and his clever stories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t seek a quarrel with her,\" Marius said. \"Stay here with me, and by and by, she may come to know that you\u0027re here, and she may send you her welcome. Be wise then, I beg you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne nodded again. It was as if the terrible battle was over. He had confessed his wrath and it was gone, and he sat still and simple near the fire, the warrior no longer. Such was the magic of words, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen memory came again. Six centuries ago. He was in the cave, and could see the flicker of the firelight. He was bound and couldn\u0027t move. She lay beside him, peering down into his eyes and whispering to him. He couldn\u0027t remember those words, because they were part of something larger and more terrible, something as strong as the threads that bound him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could break those threads now. He could cut loose of the memories and lodge himself firmly in this room. He could look at Marius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a long slow sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But return to your tale, if you will,\" he asked. \"Why after the Queen was destroyed, and after the twins were gone, why then didn\u0027t you reveal your rage to the blood drinker Lestat, why didn\u0027t you take your vengeance? You\u0027d been betrayed! And disaster had followed upon it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I wanted to love him still,\" said Marius, as though he had long known the answer, \"and I wanted to be loved, and I could not forfeit my place as the wise and patient one, as I\u0027ve said. Anger is too painful for me. Anger is too pathetic. I cannot bear it. I cannot act upon it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait for one moment,\" said Thorne. \"Say this again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anger is too pathetic,\" Marius repeated. \"It\u0027s too much at a disadvantage always. I can\u0027t act upon it. I can\u0027t make it mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne gestured for quiet. He sat back considering, and it seemed a cold air settled on him in spite of the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anger is weak,\" Thorne whispered. It was a new idea to him. In his mind anger and rage had always been akin. And rage had seemed something akin to Wodin\u0027s fury. One summoned rage before going into battle. One welcomed rage into one\u0027s heart. And in the ice cave, he had let an old rage awaken him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anger is as weak as fear,\" said Marius. \"Can either of us endure fear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Thorne. \"But you\u0027re speaking of something inside you that\u0027s heated and strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, there is something brutal and hurt inside of me, and I wander alone, refusing the cup of anger, choosing silence rather than angry words. And I come upon you in the North land, and you\u0027re a stranger to me, and I can bare my soul to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that you can do,\" said Thorne. \"For the hospitality you have given me, you can tell me anything. I will never break your trust, that I promise. No common words or songs will ever come from me. Nothing can make such a thing happen.\" He felt his voice grow strong as he spoke. It was because he was honest in what he said. \"What has become of Lestat? Why is he silent now? I hear no more songs or sagas from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sagas, ah yes, that\u0027s what he wrote, sagas of our kind,\" said Marius and again he smiled, almost brightly. \"He suffers his own terrible wounds,\" said Marius. \"He\u0027s been with angels, or with those beings who claim to be such and they have taken him to Hell and to Heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe these things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I can tell you only he wasn\u0027t on this Earth while these creatures claim to have had him. And he brought back with him a bloody Veil with the Face of Christ quite beautifully blazoned upon it.\" \"Ah, and this you saw? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did,\" said Marius, \"as I have seen other relics. It was to see this Veil and to go into the sun and die that our Druid priest Mael was nearly taken from us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t Mael die,\" asked Thorne. He couldn\u0027t conceal his own emotion when he said this name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was too old for such a thing,\" said Marius. \"He was badly burnt and brought low, as can happen with those of us who are very old, and after one day in the sun, he hadn\u0027t the courage for more suffering. Back to his companions he went and there he remains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you? Will you tell me now with your full heart; do you truly despise him for what he did to you? Or is it your distaste for anger which makes you turn away from this thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. There are times when I can\u0027t look on Mael\u0027s face. There are times when I want to be in his company. There are times when I can\u0027t seek out any of them. I\u0027ve come here with Daniel alone. Daniel always needs someone to look after him. It suits me to be near Daniel. Daniel doesn\u0027t have to speak. That he is here is sufficient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you,\" said Thorne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understand this as well,\" said Marius. \"I want to continue. I am not one who wishes to go into the sun or seek some other form of obliteration. If you have truly come out of the ice to destroy Maharet, to anger her twin\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne lifted his right hand, gesturing for patience and silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he spoke:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have not,\" he said. \"Those were dreams. They\u0027ve died in this very place. It will take longer for memory to die\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then remember her beauty and her power,\" Marius said. \"I asked her once why she had never taken a blood drinker\u0027s eyes for her own. Why always the weak and bleeding eyes of a mortal victim? She told me she had never come upon a blood drinker whom she would destroy or even hurt, save for the Evil Queen herself and the Queen\u0027s eyes she couldn\u0027t take. Pure hatred prevented it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne thought on this for a long time without replying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always mortal eyes,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with each pair, as they endure, she sees more than you and I can see,\" said Marius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Thorne, \"I understand you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want the strength to grow older,\" Marius said. \"I want to find wonders around me as I always have. If I don\u0027t, I\u0027ll lose the strength to continue and that is what bites into me now. Death has put its hand on my shoulder. Death has come in the form of disappointment and fear of scorn\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, these things I understand, almost perfectly,\" said Thorne. \"When I went up into the snow, I wanted to flee from these things. I wanted to die and not die, as so many mortals do. I don\u0027t think I thought I would endure in the ice or snow. I thought it would devour me, freeze me solid as it would a mortal man. But no such thing ever happened. And as for the pain of the cold I grew used to it, as if it were my daily portion, as if I had no right to anything else. But it was pain that drove me there, and so I understand you. You would fight pain now rather than retreat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I would,\" said Marius. \"When the Queen rose from her underground shrine, she left me buried in ice and indifference. Others came to rescue me and bring me to the council table where we sought to reason with her. Before this happened, I could not have imagined such contempt from the Queen or such injury. I could not have imagined my own patience and seeming forgiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But at that council table, Akasha met her destruction. The insult to me was avenged with utter finality. This creature whom I had guarded for two thousand years was gone from me. My Queen, gone from me . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so I can see now the larger story of my own life, of which my beautiful Queen was only a part, even in her cruelty to me.
