You must not explain the future to the Spacers.\" He reached for a chair and, with a trembling hand, pulled it toward himself and sat down, as Mandamus crumpled and, slid down into what seemed to be a gentle sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the last,\" said Daneel in soft despair, as he looked down at the two unconscious bodies, \"I failed. When it was necessary for me to seize Dr. Mandamus to prevent harm to people who were not present before my eyes, I found myself forced to follow his order and froze. The Zeroth Law did not work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard said, \"No, friend Daneel, you did not fail. I prevented you. Dr. Mandamus had the urge to try to do what he did and was held back by the fear of what you would certainly do if he did try. I neutralized his fear and then I neutralized you. So Dr. Mandamus set the Earth\u0027s crust on fire, so to speak - on very slow fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said, \"But why, friend Giskard, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he was telling the truth. I told you so. He thought he was lying. From the nature of the triumph in his mind, I am under the firm impression he felt that the consequence of the growing radioactivity would be anarchy and confusion among Earthpeople and Settlers and that the Spacers would destroy them and seize the Galaxy. But I thought the scenario he presented us to win us over was the correct one. The removal of Earth as a large crowded world would remove a mystique I have already felt to be dangerous and would help the Settlers. They will streak outward into the Galaxy at a pace that will double and redouble and without Earth to look back to always, without Earth to set up a god of the past - they will establish a Galactic Empire. It was necessary for us to make that possible.\" He paused and, his voice weakening, he said, \"Robots and Empire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you well, friend Giskard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot stand, but I can still talk. Listen to me. It is time for you to take on my burden. I have adjusted you for mental detection and control. You have but to listen to the final pathways as they are impressed upon yourself. Listen - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke steadily - but increasingly weakly - in language and symbols that Daneel could feel internally. Even as Daneel listened, he could feel the pathways moving and ticking into place. And when Giskard was done, there was suddenly the cool purr of Mandamus\u0027s mind impinging on his own, the unsteady thumping of Amadiro\u0027s, and the thin metallic thread of Giskard\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard said, \"You must return to Madam Quintana and arrange to have these two human beings sent back to Aurora. They will not be able to harm Earth further. Then see to it that Earth\u0027s security forces seek out and inactivate the humanoid robots sent to Earth by Mandamus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful how you use your new powers, for you are new to them and they will not be under perfect control. You will improve with time - slowly - if you are careful always to undergo self-examination with each use. Use the Zeroth Law, but not to justify needless harm to individuals. The First Law is almost as important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protect Madam Gladia and Captain Baley - unobtrusively. Let them be happy together and let Madam Gladia continue with her efforts to bring peace. Help supervise, over the decades, the removal of Earthpeople from this world. And - one more thing - if I can remember - Yes if you can - find out where the Solarians, have gone. That may be important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard\u0027s voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel kneeled at the side of the seated Giskard and took the unresponsive metal hand in his own. He said, in an agonized whisper, \"Recover, friend Giskard. Recover. What you did was right by the Zeroth Law. You have preserved as much life as possible. You have done well by humanity. Why suffer, so when what you have done saves all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard said, in a voice so distorted that the words could barely be made out, \"Because I am not certain. - What if the other view - is right - after all - and the Spacers will triumph and then themselves decay so that - the Galaxy will be empty. - Good-bye, friend - Dan - \" And Giskard was silent, never to speak or move again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was alone - and with a Galaxy to care for. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/robots-and-empire-robot-4/page-19.html","bookId":1727,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:33 AM"}
