I knew who he was. I didn\u0027t care about his badge. I wanted to hear why he\u0027d stepped out of the past and into my life. I wanted to discover where the boy I\u0027d loved had gone and when this man had taken his place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven years ago Nic had been easygoing and fun. I\u0027d laughed more with him than I\u0027d ever laughed with anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been a wealth of contrasts. Quick with numbers, clever with words, fast hands, slow smile, a great kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d both been alone in the world, searching for something, or maybe someone. We\u0027d found it in each other. My life had forever been divided into before and after Dominic Franklin had come into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still don\u0027t know if I believe in love at first sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw him so many times before I loved him. But a true, deep, forever love? In that, I do believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t realize I\u0027d said the words out loud until he answered them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m the best at what I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finding missing persons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that have to do with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell me. What do you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould I put him off by telling the lies I\u0027d told a hundred times before? Wouldn\u0027t hurt to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m studying a new strain of rabies in the wolf population.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never heard of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The government doesn\u0027t want people to know the virus is becoming resistant to the vaccine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I made that up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy teeth clicked together as I snapped my mouth shut. Why couldn\u0027t I keep quiet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips twitched, almost a smile. But the expression faded as quickly as the moon did at dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always wanted to be a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Ph.D. isn\u0027t an M.D.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d given up my hopes of treating people after I\u0027d turned furry the first time. Kind of hard to build a practice when you never knew if you were going to wake up covered in blood the morning after a full moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, I\u0027d always been fascinated by viruses -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;where they came from, how they were transmitted, how in hell we could cure them. One of the few bright spots in the past seven years had been my work. I\u0027d been given carte blanche to study something no one else even knew about. What scientist wouldn\u0027t be tempted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic continued to stare at me, no doubt waiting to hear the reason I wasn\u0027t delivering babies or performing brain surgery. He\u0027d be waiting a very long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were going to be a lawyer,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen in doubt, point the finger elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. A majority of our agents have backgrounds in accounting or law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh. I guess we do learn something new every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This facility seems huge,\" he continued. \"How many researchers do you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d reached the end of my lies and my patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want more information, you\u0027ll have to talk to the boss, Edward Mandenauer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne call from Edward to Washington, D.C., and Nic would be out on his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wisconsin. That\u0027s east of here, by a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. \" Where in Wisconsin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Classified.\" I shrugged. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elise, you\u0027re starting to piss me off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only starting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile nearly broke through again, and I thought, There you are, an instant before he caught himself and frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis new Nic disturbed me. Had he become so serious and sad because of the job or because of me? I didn\u0027t like either choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning back, he laced his fingers together and rested his head against his palms. \"I\u0027ll just wait until he calls in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth, then shut it again, stumped. I couldn\u0027t have him hanging around. I was behind schedule. Besides, how was I going to explain that there wasn\u0027t anyone in the compound but me, a single guard, and the werewolves in the basement?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could throw Nic out, or have the guard do it; however, that kind of behavior would only add to the questions, and no doubt insure we enjoyed more visits from the FBI. Better to convince Nic to leave on his own if possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward won\u0027t be calling for several days,\" I said. \"He\u0027s in the field. You may as well tell me what\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic stared at me for a few seconds before leaning forward and lowering his arms to the table. \"I\u0027ve been working on a case for years. A lot of people are no longer where they\u0027re supposed to be, and they haven\u0027t shown up anywhere else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since when do missing persons come under FBI jurisdiction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since we have good reason to believe we\u0027re dealing with more than disappearances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard what he wasn\u0027t saying. The FBI thought they had a serial kidnapper, if not a serial killer, on their hands. Hell, they probably did. What they didn\u0027t know was that the culprit was most likely less than human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot more people vanish in this world than anyone knows about,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic lifted a brow. I guess I didn\u0027t have to tell him that. His business was finding the missing. Which made him dangerous to my business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo keep the populace calm, part of the J-S job description was to invent excuses, smooth over the edges, make sure that those who were murdered by evil entities were not searched for by the authorities or their families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still don\u0027t understand how we can help you. Is one of the missing people from this area?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you trace someone here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw up my hands. \"What then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were sent an anonymous tip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resisted the urge to snort and roll my eyes. The bad guys were forever trying to throw the government at us. If we were unwinding red tape we weren\u0027t hunting and searching for monsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil today, all such attempts had been quelled higher up. The word in Washington was that Edward Mandenauer stood above reproach. He was not to be bothered, and neither were any of his people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously Nic hadn\u0027t gotten the top secret memo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at him as another possibility came to mind. The J��ger-Suchers might be a clandestine organization, and the location of our compound closely guarded, but recently many of our secrets had gone on the market. We had a traitor in our midst, and we never knew when someone might die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was this tip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"E-mail. Said I\u0027d find what I was seeking here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"Not much of a tip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Imagine my surprise when I saw your name on the employee roster of the J��ger-Suchers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich explained how he knew so much about me, how he\u0027d remained so calm upon seeing me, while I\u0027d been paralyzed. He\u0027d already known I was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was precious little information in those personnel files, considering this is a government installation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince quite a few of our agents had been on the wrong side of the law at one time or another - sometimes it took a monster to catch a monster - it wouldn\u0027t do for their records to be available to anyone who cared to look. Our personnel files were carefully constructed to reveal the very least necessary - or in some cases nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were dead,\" he murmured, \"and you were right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange how one small thing was often all it took to break a mystery wide open. People don\u0027t realize how often killers are caught because of an accident, a coincidence, nothing more than a sharp eye skimming an unrelated report and finding a connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I wasn\u0027t dead, but that didn\u0027t mean I didn\u0027t want to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if realizing he\u0027d skirted too close to an emotional edge neither one of us wanted to cross, Nic withdrew a sheet of paper from his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you check with your people, with Manden-auer, see if anyone knows any of the names on this list of missing persons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was set, his eyes gone icy blue - back to business. I was alive; I was no longer missing. I could almost see him checking my name off a list in his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould he ever think of me again once he walked out of this room? Probably not, and that was a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why did I feel so bad?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic still stood with the list in his hand. I took the paper and tucked it into a pocket without a glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My number\u0027s at the top.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose and his gaze was captured by something on my desk. My breath caught as he stared at the small stuffed crow he\u0027d once won for me at a local fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually won was too lenient a term. He\u0027d spent five times what the cheesy toy was worth trying to sink a basketball into a hoop. Back then he\u0027d been more bookish than buff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes touched on the broad shoulders packed into the dark suit. He could probably make a basket now, or ram the ball into the hoop by sheer force of will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to say. That I\u0027d kept the item all these years was far too sentimental a gesture for the cool, distant woman I wanted to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like crows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice came out impressively blase, as if the toy meant nothing, but my eyes stung. I had to look away or embarrass myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked a few times, swallowed, turned to see if he\u0027d believed my lie and discovered him halfway out the door. Surprised, I scurried after, then paused in the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was leaving without pressing me for more answers about the J��ger-Suchers. I should be glad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople who annoyed Edward Mandenauer often found themselves on the wrong side of dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d left Nic once so he wouldn\u0027t learn the truth, so he wouldn\u0027t be hurt. This time I\u0027d let him leave for the same reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued to the front of the building so I could watch Nic walk out of my life forever. He might come back, but he wasn\u0027t getting in. I left explicit instructions to that effect with the guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should contact my boss, tell him about the visit from the FBI, but it was just past noon. Edward would still be sleeping after hunting all night. There was time enough to call him once I checked on my latest experiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only way into the basement laboratory was through the elevator located outside of my office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisguised as a wall panel, the door slid open at the press of my palm to the security monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon, Dr. Hanover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe computerized voice never failed to irk me; I\u0027m not sure why. Extreme security was part of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough what I was doing was important, there were nevertheless those who would stop at nothing to keep me from doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the elevator descended to subterranean level, the same mechanical voice intoned, \"Retina scan, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI positioned my face in front of the camera. Without the appropriate retinas, anyone who managed to get this far would be trapped inside. Of course, there was always the possibility someone would cut off my hand and dig out my eye in order to access the basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, or perhaps not, most of the beings capable of that level of insanity were already incarcerated on the other side of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator slid open. A bank of rooms fronted with bulletproof glass lined the walls. All of the chambers -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;hell, let\u0027s be honest, they were prison cells - were occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t been kidding about the werewolves in the basement. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3/page-2.html","bookId":2090,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM"}
