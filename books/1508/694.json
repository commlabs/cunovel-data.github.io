In the relatively long life of a Vermillion Bird, Little Flame was only a child and still somewhat naïve and innocent. Although Lin Ming had only known Little Flame for a brief period of time, he still had a very good impression of this silly and foolish Vermillion Bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eLittle Flame was Mu Qianyu’s life Vermillion Bird.

Listening to Mu Qianyu’s words, Yin Yang Profound Palace were obviously taking advantage of Divine Phoenix Island while they were suffering, demanding such an outrageous price. Not only did they want two Vermillion Birds, but they also desired the secret techniques of Divine Phoenix Island and even had thoughts of subtly annexing Divine Phoenix Island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eListening as Lin Ming spoke, a trace of sadness flashed across Mu Qianyu’s eyes. She said, “They want the Vermillion Birds in order to extract their blood essence and transplant it into the bodies of the male disciples of Yin Yang Profound Palace. After the Vermillion Birds, they will want the Blue Luan in order to transplant its blood essence into their female disciples.

The blood essence of a Vermillion Bird was extremely precious.

She said, “Yin Yang Profound Palace’s cultivation method is focused on Yin and Yang, having both elements complement each other. As such, they specialize in water and fire origin energy, which is similar to Divine Phoenix Island’s ice and fire cultivation method. In these past months, there were some disciples of Yin Yang Profound Palace who perhaps used the temptation of benefits, coercion, intimidation, or maybe even drugs… but… of my Divine Phoenix Island disciples…they had sex with them. Both parties walked past the line of no return, and so they became married…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eMu Qianyu had a very bad taste in her mouth when she spoke of this. In truth, only around half of Divine Phoenix Island’s disciples were deceived in some way. The other half were completely voluntary.

In truth, now they didn’t have many training resources, practice arrays, or medicine gardens…even the spiritual land underneath their feet, Little Swallow Island, was only equal to a third-grade sect’s spiritual land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eIn such harsh conditions, just how could they attract new disciples?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eNot to mention that Divine Phoenix Island was also facing an all-encompassing crisis from the South Sea Demon Region; even their very existence was in a precarious state. The majority of disciples from Divine Phoenix Island were mostly women. Even though they were martial artists, they were still naturally soft-hearted; they needed to feel protected by others. Drifting around in a displaced manner like destitute vagabonds in a situation where death loomed close to them made it very easy for them to be touched by the sweet talk and the honeyed words of men. From the first touches of love to going to bed, they finally became confused about what they wanted and ended up married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eThus, for these past months, many female disciples of Divine Phoenix Island repeatedly lost their virginity.

One reason was because Yin Yang Profound Palace was much stronger; another was because whether it was their practice arrays, resources, or spiritual land, everything was a higher grade, even better than when Divine Phoenix Island was at its peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eIf this continued, then Divine Phoenix Island would soon be hollowed out. And, the most exasperating problem was that the male disciples of Yin Yang Profound palace chose the most extraordinary and beautiful women to pursue. They wouldn’t consider those girls who were less fortunate, or perhaps might even sleep with them and then abandon them afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“Yu’er, you said that they used drugs?” Lin Ming’s voice became extremely cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“There were two who used drugs.

She remembered that the one responsible for dealing with this matter had been Xing Yang and then her heart filled with utter hatred. She said with loathing, “Yin Yang Profound Palace’s Little Palace Master Xing Yang has intentions to seduce my little sister. He wants to marry her. Moreover, the Palace Masters have already officially brought this matter up with Honorable Sect Master. Although they were refused, the future days are long.

This was why she considered for a moment before informing Lin Ming of this matter.

When that time came, he would inevitably need to purchase certain rare resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eIf he had a network of connections and was able to borrow the strength of a Holy Land to find resources, then Lin Ming’s road would become much easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“Brother Lin is too humble.” Duanmu Qun smiled in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eAt this moment, Mu Yuhuang, Mu Fengxian, and Mu Bingyun came walking by from not too far away. Because Lin Ming had been anxious to see Mu Qianyu yesterday, he had only hastily greeted Mu Yuhuang and the others; they didn’t even have time to exchange proper greetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eToday, Mu Yuhuang wanted to talk to Lin Ming some more, but as she saw Duanmu Qun, Feng Shen, and Lan Xin, she was startled. These three didn’t seem like humans…what race were they? Where had they come from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eMu Yuhuang hesitated for a moment before she sent Lin Ming a true essence sound transmission, “Lin Ming, are these three your friends?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eLin Ming nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eWithout a doubt, these three all had great backgrounds and stories behind them. Mu Yuhuang didn’t inquire further. What she wanted to do was ask Lin Ming what sort of adventures he had gone on these past two and a half years, and just how he was able to break through to Revolving Core so soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eBut at this moment, a spirit boat came whistling over their hands, falling into the meeting hall not too far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eAs Mu Yuhuang saw the twin water and fire symbol on the spirit boat, she suddenly grimaced.
