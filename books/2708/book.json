A Christmas Eve snowstorm transforms one small town into a romantic haven, the kind you see only in movies. Well, kinda. After all, a cold and wet hike from a stranded train through the middle of nowhere would not normally end with a delicious kiss from a charming stranger. And no one would think that a trip to the Waffle House through four feet of snow would lead to love with an old friend. Or that the way back to true love begins with a painfully early morning shift at Starbucks. Thanks to three of today’s bestselling teen authors—John Green, Maureen Johnson, and Lauren Myracle—the magic of the holidays shines on these hilarious and charming interconnected tales of love, romance, and breathtaking kisses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/let-it-snow.jpg","author":"John Green","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/let-it-snow.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:16 AM"}
