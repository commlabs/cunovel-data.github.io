Peas do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see any peas around here, so I\u0027m improvising. Work with me, Noah.\" This round-faced American-Israeli soldier would be a perfect match for Miranda. They\u0027re kind of the same person, but of the opposite sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah shrugs. \"So you don\u0027t want me to relay his message?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs. \"Well, I hope you guys work it out at some point. Seeing Gefen upset isn\u0027t fun, especially during Krav Maga training.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know a little Krav Maga--the official self defense of the Israeli military--because my dad was a commando when he was in the IDF. A few months ago he decided I was old enough to learn some of the contact combat basics. Essentially, it\u0027s to kick the person\u0027s ass (or groin, as my dad taught me) until your target is no longer a threat. If you can\u0027t get out of a bad situation, you strike hard, strike fast, and know the vulnerable places on your opponent\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad thought I would suck at it, but I actually did so well that after my first lesson he bought protective training pads. We\u0027ve made training a weekly event. Krav Maga Night is my dad giving me new techniques on how to kick his ass, which I have to say is more therapeutic than a fifty-minute session with a social worker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, what other teenager is lucky enough to say they\u0027re encouraged by their dad to punch, kick, and maim him every Wednesday? Although, given that my dad was a commando, he\u0027s specially trained to kick some ass himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I live with my dad, we\u0027ve worked out most of our issues around him not being a permanent fixture in my life growing up. But he\u0027s still uncomfortable having a teen daughter when it comes to parental discussions about dating, sex, and drugs. The drug discussions (I\u0027m using the word \"discussion\" loosely) go like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad: Amy, if you ever take illegal drugs I\u0027ll kill the person who gave them to you and then I\u0027ll kill you. Got it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Loud and clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most recent sex talk (this time I\u0027m using the word \"talk\" loosely) went along these lines:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad: Don\u0027t have sex until you\u0027re married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: What if I do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad: I\u0027ll practice Krav Maga on the guy. Without protective padding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t mention then that my boyfriend is quickly becoming a Krav Maga legend in his own right on the base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad is awful when it comes to talking about girly issues, as if he doesn\u0027t have a single ounce of estrogen in his body. But get him to talk about Krav Maga, or Israeli guy stuff like soccer or basketball, and his eyes light up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the food!\" I call out to Noah as he walks away, leaving me with my chicken bones, my folding chair, and thoughts of Avi--but not his message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer is a wave and another smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when I finish lunch, I hear Ronit\u0027s small-yarnean-small chant getting closer and closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, bring your tray to the eating area,\" Ronit says. \"Miranda, go with her. Vic, you\u0027re in charge of guarding the bittan now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up the tray and start walking to the kitchen. Miranda walks with me... although she\u0027s actually a few paces behind. I have the feeling she\u0027s doing that on purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" I ask, glancing back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re acting like something\u0027s wrong. Want to talk about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be that the Israeli army has broken Mirandas sweet-tempered spirit? I\u0027m always crabby, but I thought I could count on Miranda to smile no matter what sucky situation she\u0027s in. I glance back again. The girl is definitely not smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she\u0027s constipated. Seriously, talk to a group of teen girls in private and I guarantee they\u0027ve all got pooping issues. Considering the lack of a decent toilet in this place, I wouldn\u0027t blame her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if Miranda isn\u0027t constipated? What if she\u0027s upset with me? While I couldn\u0027t care less if Tori hates me, I do care if somehow I\u0027ve caused this alienation between me and Miranda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish Jess was ordered to accompany me, too. She\u0027d know what to say to Miranda to make everything okay again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walk into the cafeteria and I scrape the leftover food off my plate and into the big garbage bins, I realize Miranda isn\u0027t behind me anymore. She\u0027s waiting by the doorway with a pissy look on her face. I place the tray on the moving belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why aren\u0027t you smiling?\" I ask her as we head back into the scorching Israeli death-heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t feel like it. Why do you care, anyway? You hardly ever smile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, because I count on you doing it for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda stops and puts her hands on her hips. \"Amy, that doesn\u0027t even make sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither does your pissy attitude. It reminds me of me and, to be honest, I wouldn\u0027t be able to stand a friend like me for very long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you saying I shouldn\u0027t be friends with you anymore?\" She starts walking away, so I jog to catch up with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you smile, the world smiles with you, you know,\" I tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think she\u0027s about to laugh, but she doesn\u0027t. She starts walking faster. \"You got that off of a greeting card or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if I was back home I\u0027d run to Walgreens and get you a real card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you write in it?\" she asks, challenging me to come up with something on the fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d write... I\u0027d write... Don\u0027t be upset, Miranda. If I did anything to upset you, please forgive me. 1 know I\u0027m not always a good friend to you. But if you share with me, I can try and fix it. Your friendship is really important to me, which says a lot about you because I cant stand most people. Being friends with you makes me a better person. So please don\u0027t give up on me. Love, Amy. P.S. When Nathan buys me another white chocolate KitKat, I\u0027ll give the entire thing to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to give myself kudos. That was a damn good speech if I do say so myself. Any moment now sweet, shy-at-times/bubbly-at-times Miranda will turn back to her old self again. I stop and give her a look that says I know she\u0027s about to cave and envelop me in one of her big, embarrassing bear hugs. This time, I\u0027m actually looking forward to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll think about it,\" she says, then tosses her hair to the side and leaves me standing alone as she walks inside the barracks. No smile. No forgiveness. No bear hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoa. I just got a dose of Miranda the Diva dissing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a point in time when even the strongest person cracks underpressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning our unit marches across the large courtyard and doesn\u0027t stop until we get to what\u0027s obviously an obstacle course. There\u0027s no doubt in my mind that this will be a challenge for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be testing your strength and stamina,\" Sergeant B-S says to us. \"This course should be completed in less than three minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tell myself not to look over at Avi, but as usual I have a serious lack of self-control. My gaze wanders to him and I find him looking straight at me. So now our eyes are locked. My insides are melting, but I\u0027m still angry and hurt. Even though it\u0027s scorching hot outside and I can feel the sweat running down my back and in between my boobs, a chill runs down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant B-S orders Nimrod and Avi to stand at the start of the obstacle course. Both get ready to race. \"When the sergeant blows his whistle, they take off faster than Mutt when he spots a new dog at the dog park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch Avi whiz through the course as if he\u0027s been doing this his entire life. I can\u0027t help but admire the muscles that bulge from his arms as he jumps to the monkey bars and grabs the first bar, then skips two bars at a time until he\u0027s done. Then he crosses the balance beam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he gets to the high rope, he uses his thigh muscles and arms to pull himself to the top, rings the bell, then grabs a handle that brings him down to the ground. Nimrod is right behind him. At the half wall they\u0027re neck and neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m holding my breath, wondering who will win. They reach the part of the course where you duck low under a set of entwined ropes. Avi gains a little ground as he slithers on the ground, not hesitating one iota.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, Avi is the one who crosses the line first. Nimrod is close behind him. Both are breathing heavily as Sergeant B-S tells us that Avi clocked in at thirty-eight seconds and Nimrod at forty-one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiron and Ronit line up next. When Sergeant B-S signals them to go, Liron blows Ronit away as she effortlessly does each obstacle. Ugh, no wonder Avi is attracted to her; not only is she pretty, but she can scale walls and shimmy up ropes. It\u0027s probably more impressive than being double-jointed. Liron clocks in at one minute one second while Ronit lags behind, finishing at one minute thirty seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in the same groups you were in yesterday,\" Sergeant B-S calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to act cool as I walk over to Avi. Unfortunately, I\u0027m not paying attention and trip over something or someone. Oops, it\u0027s Tori... I\u0027ve stepped on the back of her foot again and her shoe came off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch!\" Tori yells out. \"That\u0027s the second time you\u0027ve done that, you spaz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well maybe if you walked faster I wouldn\u0027t step on you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan grabs my shoulders. \"Stop getting in fights with Tori,\" he says as he steers me away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s rude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I,\" I say as I wipe away another sweat drop that\u0027s falling down my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean hot as in sweaty. I mean hot as in--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you meant,\" I say, cutting him off. Seriously, ever since Nathan finally stopped being obsessed with Bicky, he\u0027s been acting like a Bachelor reality show contestant. Since our third kiss and his breakup, he\u0027s gone out with more girls than I can count on two hands. And it doesn\u0027t help that he\u0027s been lead singer for Lickity Split, because lately he\u0027s been taking his groupies backstage and making out with them. He hasn\u0027t gone out with anyone twice yet. It\u0027s like he wants to make sure he doesn\u0027t get involved so there\u0027s no repeat of what he went through with Bicky. I wonder why the change in tactic since he met Tori.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab Nathan\u0027s hand while we wait for our other team members to assemble. Nathan pulls his hand loose, but I know Avis watching so I grab his hand again and squeeze my nails into his skin as a warning not to snatch it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi growls, \"Wait here\" and walks away to talk to Liron and some of the other Israeli team leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re getting me in trouble with Avi,\" Nathan says through gritted teeth and a fake smile which makes him look like a marionette on Prozac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember when you had me fake-kiss you in front of your ex-bimbo Bicky, to let her know it was over between you guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I seem to remember you biting me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan, that was because your tongue crept into my mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was making it authentic. Besides, don\u0027t deny you were getting into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I was fantasizing you were my boyfriend.\" It\u0027s the honest truth: When I started kissing Nathan that last time, in front of Bicky, I was totally imagining he was Avi when we were last together--which was seriously the best night of my life. After fooling around in the car didn\u0027t work, Avi and I moved onto the deserted beach. His touches and kisses and caresses were more than OMG!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s looking at me like he wants to kill me,\" Nathan complains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Now that he\u0027s watching us, kiss me,\" I whisper softly, moving my lips closer to his for a repeat performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan pries his fingers loose and steps away, although we\u0027re far enough from our other team members that nobody can hear us. \"Are you kidding? First of all, didn\u0027t you sign the Sababa rule sheet attached to the brochure? It said, specifically, no fornicating. We\u0027re in Israel. For all I know fornicating might include kissing.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-12.html","bookId":2766,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM"}
