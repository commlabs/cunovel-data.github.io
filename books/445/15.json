It is bad to live in cities: there, there are too many of the lustful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer, than into the dreams of a lustful woman?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And just look at these men: their eye saith it—they know nothing better on earth than to lie with a woman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Filth is at the bottom of their souls; and alas! if their filth hath still spirit in it!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Would that ye were perfect—at least as animals! But to animals belongeth innocence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do I counsel you to slay your instincts? I counsel you to innocence in your instincts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do I counsel you to chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, but with many almost a vice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These are continent, to be sure: but doggish lust looketh enviously out of all that they do.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Even into the heights of their virtue and into their cold spirit doth this creature follow them, with its discord.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And how nicely can doggish lust beg for a piece of spirit, when a piece of flesh is denied it!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ye love tragedies and all that breaketh the heart? But I am distrustful of your doggish lust.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ye have too cruel eyes, and ye look wantonly towards the sufferers. Hath not your lust just disguised itself and taken the name of fellow-suffering?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And also this parable give I unto you: Not a few who meant to cast out their devil, went thereby into the swine themselves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To whom chastity is difficult, it is to be dissuaded: lest it become the road to hell—to filth and lust of soul.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do I speak of filthy things? That is not the worst thing for me to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not when the truth is filthy, but when it is shallow, doth the discerning one go unwillingly into its waters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, there are chaste ones from their very nature; they are gentler of heart, and laugh better and oftener than you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They laugh also at chastity, and ask: “What is chastity?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Is chastity not folly? But the folly came unto us, and not we unto it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We offered that guest harbour and heart: now it dwelleth with us—let it stay as long as it will!”—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2158/61027.html","bookId":445,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM"}
