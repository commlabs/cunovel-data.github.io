CHAPTER I","content":"\u0026nbsp;I had been dining with Erskine in his pretty little house in Birdcage Walk, and we were sitting in the library over our coffee and cigarettes, when the question of literary forgeries happened to turn up in conversation. \u0026nbsp;I cannot at present remember how it was that we struck upon this somewhat curious topic, as it was at that time, but I know that we had a long discussion about Macpherson, Ireland, and Chatterton, and that with regard to the last I insisted that his so-called forgeries were merely the result of an artistic desire for perfect representation; that we had no right to quarrel with an artist for the conditions under which he chooses to present his work; and that all Art being to a certain degree a mode of acting, an attempt to realise one’s own personality on some imaginative plane out of reach of the trammelling accidents and limitations of real life, to censure an artist for a forgery was to confuse an ethical with an ?sthetical problem. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Erskine, who was a good deal older than I was, and had been listening to me with the amused deference of a man of forty, suddenly put his hand upon my shoulder and said to me, ‘What would you say about a young man who had a strange theory about a certain work of art, believed in his theory, and committed a forgery in order to prove it?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Ah! that is quite a different matter,’ I answered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Erskine remained silent for a few moments, looking at the thin grey threads of smoke that were rising from his cigarette. \u0026nbsp;‘Yes,’ he said, after a pause, ‘quite different.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was something in the tone of his voice, a slight touch of bitterness perhaps, that excited my curiosity. \u0026nbsp;‘Did you ever know anybody who did that?’ I cried.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Yes,’ he answered, throwing his cigarette into the fire,—‘a great friend of mine, Cyril Graham. \u0026nbsp;He was very fascinating, and very foolish, and very heartless. \u0026nbsp;However, he left me the only legacy I ever received in my life.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘What was that?’ I exclaimed. \u0026nbsp;Erskine rose from his seat, and going over to a tall inlaid cabinet that stood between the two windows, unlocked it, and came back to where I was sitting, holding in his hand a small panel picture set in an old and somewhat tarnished Elizabethan frame.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was a full-length portrait of a young man in late sixteenth-century costume, standing by a table, with his right hand resting on an open book. \u0026nbsp;He seemed about seventeen years of age, and was of quite extraordinary personal beauty, though evidently somewhat effeminate. \u0026nbsp;Indeed, had it not been for the dress and the closely cropped hair, one would have said that the face with its dreamy wistful eyes, and its delicate scarlet lips, was the face of a girl. \u0026nbsp;In manner, and especially in the treatment of the hands, the picture reminded one of Fran?ois Clouet’s later work. \u0026nbsp;The black velvet doublet with its fantastically gilded points, and the peacock-blue background against which it showed up so pleasantly, and from which it gained such luminous value of colour, were quite in Clouet’s style; and the two masks of Tragedy and Comedy that hung somewhat formally from the marble pedestal had that hard severity of touch—so different from the facile grace of the Italians—which even at the Court of France the great Flemish master never completely lost, and which in itself has always been a characteristic of the northern temper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘It is a charming thing,’ I cried, ‘but who is this wonderful young man, whose beauty Art has so happily preserved for us?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘This is the portrait of Mr. W.

I suppose because we were so different in some things. \u0026nbsp;I was a rather awkward, weakly lad, with huge feet, and horribly freckled. \u0026nbsp;Freckles run in Scotch families just as gout does in English families. \u0026nbsp;Cyril used to say that of the two he preferred the gout; but he always set an absurdly high value on personal appearance, and once read a paper before our debating society to prove that it was better to be good-looking than to be good. \u0026nbsp;He certainly was wonderfully handsome. \u0026nbsp;People who did not like him, Philistines and college tutors, and young men reading for the Church, used to say that he was merely pretty; but there was a great deal more in his face than mere prettiness. \u0026nbsp;I think he was the most splendid creature I ever saw, and nothing could exceed the grace of his movements, the charm of his manner. \u0026nbsp;He fascinated everybody who was worth fascinating, and a great many people who were not. \u0026nbsp;He was often wilful and petulant, and I used to think him dreadfully insincere. \u0026nbsp;It was due, I think, chiefly to his inordinate desire to please. \u0026nbsp;Poor Cyril! \u0026nbsp;I told him once that he was contented with very cheap triumphs, but he only laughed. \u0026nbsp;He was horribly spoiled. \u0026nbsp;All charming people, I fancy, are spoiled. \u0026nbsp;It is the secret of their attraction.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘However, I must tell you about Cyril’s acting. \u0026nbsp;You know that no actresses are allowed to play at the A.D.C. \u0026nbsp;At least they were not in my time. \u0026nbsp;I don’t know how it is now. \u0026nbsp;Well, of course, Cyril was always cast for the girls’ parts, and when As You Like It was produced he played Rosalind. \u0026nbsp;It was a marvellous performance. \u0026nbsp;In fact, Cyril Graham was the only perfect Rosalind I have ever seen. \u0026nbsp;It would be impossible to describe to you the beauty, the delicacy, the refinement of the whole thing. \u0026nbsp;It made an immense sensation, and the horrid little theatre, as it was then, was crowded every night. \u0026nbsp;Even when I read the play now I can’t help thinking of Cyril. \u0026nbsp;It might have been written for him. \u0026nbsp;The next term he took his degree, and came to London to read for the diplomatic. \u0026nbsp;But he never did any work. \u0026nbsp;He spent his days in reading Shakespeare’s Sonnets, and his evenings at the theatre. \u0026nbsp;He was, of course, wild to go on the stage. \u0026nbsp;It was all that I and Lord Crediton could do to prevent him. \u0026nbsp;Perhaps if he had gone on the stage he would be alive now. \u0026nbsp;It is always a silly thing to give advice, but to give good advice is absolutely fatal. \u0026nbsp;I hope you will never fall into that error. \u0026nbsp;If you do, you will be sorry for it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Well, to come to the real point of the story, one day I got a letter from Cyril asking me to come round to his rooms that evening. \u0026nbsp;He had charming chambers in Piccadilly overlooking the Green Park, and as I used to go to see him every day, I was rather surprised at his taking the trouble to write. \u0026nbsp;Of course I went, and when I arrived I found him in a state of great excitement. \u0026nbsp;He told me that he had at last discovered the true secret of Shakespeare’s Sonnets; that all the scholars and critics had been entirely on the wrong tack; and that he was the first who, working purely by internal evidence, had found out who Mr. W. H. really was. \u0026nbsp;He was perfectly wild with delight, and for a long time would not tell me his theory. \u0026nbsp;Finally, he produced a bundle of notes, took his copy of the Sonnets off the mantelpiece, and sat down and gave me a long lecture on the whole subject.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘He began by pointing out that the young man to whom Shakespeare addressed these strangely passionate poems must have been somebody who was a really vital factor in the development of his dramatic art, and that this could not be said either of Lord Pembroke or Lord Southampton. \u0026nbsp;Indeed, whoever he was, he could not have been anybody of high birth, as was shown very clearly by the 25th Sonnet, in which Shakespeare contrasting himself with those who are “great princes’ favourites,” says quite frankly—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Let those who are in favour with their stars\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Of public honour and proud titles boast,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Unlook’d for joy in that I honour most.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And ends the sonnet by congratulating himself on the mean state of him he so adored.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Then happy I, that love and am beloved\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Where I may not remove nor be removed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This sonnet Cyril declared would be quite unintelligible if we fancied that it was addressed to either the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of Southampton, both of whom were men of the highest position in England and fully entitled to be called “great princes”; and he in corroboration of his view read me Sonnets CXXIV. and CXXV., in which Shakespeare tells us that his love is not “the child of state,” that it “suffers not in smiling pomp,” but is “builded far from accident.” \u0026nbsp;I listened with a good deal of interest, for I don’t think the point had ever been made before; but what followed was still more curious, and seemed to me at the time to dispose entirely of Pembroke’s claim. \u0026nbsp;We know from Meres that the Sonnets had been written before 1598, and Sonnet CIV. informs us that Shakespeare’s friendship for Mr. W. H. had been already in existence for three years. \u0026nbsp;Now Lord Pembroke, who was born in 1580, did not come to London till he was eighteen years of age, that is to say till 1598, and Shakespeare’s acquaintance with Mr. W. H. must have begun in 1594, or at the latest in 1595. \u0026nbsp;Shakespeare, accordingly, could not have known Lord Pembroke till after the Sonnets had been written.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Cyril pointed out also that Pembroke’s father did not die till 1601; whereas it was evident from the line,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; You had a father; let your son say so,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n that the father of Mr. W.

H.; the case of Lord Buckhurst being spoken of as Mr. Sackville being not really a parallel instance, as Lord Buckhurst was not a peer, but merely the younger son of a peer, with a courtesy title, and the passage in England’s Parnassus, where he is so spoken of, is not a formal and stately dedication, but simply a casual allusion. \u0026nbsp;So far for Lord Pembroke, whose supposed claims Cyril easily demolished while I sat by in wonder. \u0026nbsp;With Lord Southampton Cyril had even less difficulty. \u0026nbsp;Southampton became at a very early age the lover of Elizabeth Vernon, so he needed no entreaties to marry; he was not beautiful; he did not resemble his mother, as Mr. W.

H. the writer and not the subject of the dedication,—Cyril got rid of them in a very short time; and it is not worth while to mention his reasons, though I remember he sent me off into a fit of laughter by reading to me, I am glad to say not in the original, some extracts from a German commentator called Barnstorff, who insisted that Mr. W. H. was no less a person than “Mr. William Himself.” \u0026nbsp;Nor would he allow for a moment that the Sonnets are mere satires on the work of Drayton and John Davies of Hereford. \u0026nbsp;To him, as indeed to me, they were poems of serious and tragic import, wrung out of the bitterness of Shakespeare’s heart, and made sweet by the honey of his lips. \u0026nbsp;Still less would he admit that they were merely a philosophical allegory, and that in them Shakespeare is addressing his Ideal Self, or Ideal Manhood, or the Spirit of Beauty, or the Reason, or the Divine Logos, or the Catholic Church. \u0026nbsp;He felt, as indeed I think we all must feel, that the Sonnets are addressed to an individual,—to a particular young man whose personality for some reason seems to have filled the soul of Shakespeare with terrible joy and no less terrible despair.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Having in this manner cleared the way as it were, Cyril asked me to dismiss from my mind any preconceived ideas I might have formed on the subject, and to give a fair and unbiassed hearing to his own theory. \u0026nbsp;The problem he pointed out was this: Who was that young man of Shakespeare’s day who, without being of noble birth or even of noble nature, was addressed by him in terms of such passionate adoration that we can but wonder at the strange worship, and are almost afraid to turn the key that unlocks the mystery of the poet’s heart?

H. of the Sonnets. \u0026nbsp;He would not tell me anything more at the time; but after dinner he solemnly produced the picture I showed you, and told me that he had discovered it by the merest chance nailed to the side of an old chest that he had bought at a farmhouse in Warwickshire. \u0026nbsp;The chest itself, which was a very fine example of Elizabethan work, he had, of course, brought with him, and in the centre of the front panel the initials W.
