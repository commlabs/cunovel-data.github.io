I carried them back to my own office and signed them all with my name on the CO lines and respectable forgeries of Leon Garber\u0027s signature on the Authorized by lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re breaking the law,\" Summer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the Battle of Kursk,\" I said. \"We can\u0027t stop now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your choice,\" I said. \"In or out, no pressure from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These vouchers won\u0027t come back for a month or two,\" I said. \"By then either Willard will be gone, or we will. We\u0027ve got nothing to lose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go pack,\" I said. \"Three days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left and I asked my sergeant to figure out who was next in line for acting CO. She came back with a name I recognized as the female captain I had seen in the O Club dining room. The one with the busted arm. I wrote her a note explaining I would be out for three days. I told her she was in charge. Then I picked up the phone and called Joe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to Germany,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" he said. \"Enjoy. Have a safe trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t go to Germany without stopping by Paris on the way back. You know, under the circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"I guess you can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t be right not to,\" I said. \"But she shouldn\u0027t think I care more than you do. That wouldn\u0027t be right either. So you should come over too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the overnight flight two days from now. I\u0027ll meet you at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle. Then we\u0027ll go see her together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer met me on the sidewalk outside my quarters and we carried our bags to the Chevy. We were both in BDUs because we figured our best shot was a night transport out of Andrews Air Force Base. We were too late for a civilian red-eye and we didn\u0027t want to wait all night for the breakfast flights. We got in the car and logged out at the gate. Summer was driving, of course. She accelerated hard and then dropped into a smooth rhythm that was about ten miles an hour faster than the other cars heading our way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back and watched the road. Watched the shoulders, and the strip malls, and the traffic. We drove north thirty miles and passed by Kramer\u0027s motel. Hit the cloverleaf and jogged east to I-95. Headed north. We passed the rest area. Passed the spot a mile later where the briefcase had been found. I closed my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slept all the way to Andrews. We got there well after midnight. We parked in a restricted lot and swapped two of our travel vouchers for two places on a Transportation Corps C-130 that was leaving for Frankfurt at three in the morning. We waited in a lounge that had fluorescent lighting and vinyl benches and was filled with the usual ragtag bunch of transients. The military is always on the move. There are always people going somewhere, any time of the night or day. Nobody talked. Nobody ever did. We all just sat there, stiff and tired and uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loadmaster came to get us thirty minutes before takeoff. We filed out onto the tarmac and walked up the ramp into the belly of the plane. There was a long line of cargo pallets in the center bay. We sat on webbing jump seats with our backs to the fuselage wall. On the whole I figured I preferred the first-class section on Air France. The Transportation Corps doesn\u0027t have stewardesses and it doesn\u0027t brew in-flight coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took off a little late, heading west into the wind. Then we turned a slow one-eighty over D.C. and struck out east. I felt the movement. There were no windows, but I knew we were above the city. Joe was down there somewhere, sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fuselage wall was very cold at altitude so we all leaned forward with our elbows on our knees. It was too noisy to talk. I stared at a pallet of tank ammunition until my vision blurred and I fell back to sleep. It wasn\u0027t comfortable, but one thing you learn in the army is how to sleep anywhere. I woke up maybe ten times and spent most of the trip in a state of suspended animation. The roar of the engines and the rush of the slipstream helped induce it. It was relatively restful. It was about sixty percent as good as being in bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were in the air nearly eight hours before we started our initial descent. There was no intercom. No cheery message from the pilot. Just a change in the engine note and a downward lurching movement and a sharp sensation in the ears. All around me people were standing up and stretching. Summer had her back flat against an ammunition crate, rubbing like a cat. She looked pretty good. Her hair was too short to get messy and her eyes were bright. She looked determined, like she knew she was heading for doom or glory and was resigned to not knowing which.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all sat down again and held tight to the webbing for the landing. The wheels touched down and the reverse thrust howled and the brakes jammed on tight. The pallets jerked forward against their straps. Then the engines cut back and we taxied a long way and stopped. The ramp came down and a dim dusk sky showed through the hole. It was five o\u0027clock in the afternoon in Germany, six hours ahead of the East Coast, one hour ahead of Zulu time. I was starving. I had eaten nothing since the burger in Sperryville the previous day. Summer and I stood up and grabbed our bags and got in line. Shuffled down the ramp with the others and out onto the tarmac. The weather was cold. It felt pretty much the same as North Carolina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were way out in the restricted military corner of the Frankfurt airport. We took a personnel bus to the public terminal. After that we were on our own. Some of the other guys had transport waiting, but we didn\u0027t. We joined a bunch of civilians in the taxi line. Shuffled up, one by one. When our turn came we gave the driver a travel voucher and told him to drive us east to XII Corps. He was happy enough to comply. He could swap the voucher for hard currency at any U.S. post and I was certain he would pick up a couple of XII Corps guys going out into Frankfurt for a night on the town. No deadheading. No empty running. He was making a living off of the U.S. Army, just like plenty of Germans had for four and a half decades. He was driving a Mercedes-Benz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trip took thirty minutes. We drove east through suburbs. They looked like a lot of West German places. There were vast tracts of pale honey buildings built back in the fifties. The new neighborhoods ran west to east in random curving shapes, following the routes the bombers had followed. No nation ever lost a war the way Germany lost. Like everyone, I had seen the pictures taken in 1945. Defeat was not a big enough word. Armageddon would be better. The whole country had been smashed to powdered rubble by a juggernaut. The evidence would be there for all time, written in the architecture. And under the architecture. Every time the phone company dug a trench for a cable, they found skulls and bones and teacups and shells and rusted-out Panzerfausts. Every time ground was broken for a new foundation, a priest was standing by before the steam shovels took their first bite. I was born in Berlin, surrounded by Americans, surrounded by whole square miles of patched-up devastation. They started it, we used to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe suburban streets were neat and clean. There were discreet stores with apartments above them. The store windows were full of shiny items. Street signs were black-on-white, written in an archaic script that made them hard to read. There were small U.S. Army road signs here and there too. You couldn\u0027t go very far without seeing one. We followed the XII Corps arrows, getting closer all the time. We left the built-up area and drove through a couple of kilometers of farmland. It felt like a moat. Like insulation. The eastern sky ahead of us was dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXII Corps was based in a typical glory-days installation. Some Nazi industrialist had built a thousand-acre factory site out in the fields, back in the 1930s. It had featured an impressive home office building and ranks of low metal sheds stretching hundreds of meters behind it. The sheds had been bombed to twisted shards, over and over again. The home office building had been only partially damaged. Some weary U.S. Army armored division had set up camp in it in 1945. Thin Frankfurt women in headscarves and faded print dresses had been brought in to pile the rubble, in exchange for food. They worked with wheelbarrows and shovels. Then the Army Corps of Engineers had fixed up the office building and bulldozed the piles of rubble away. Successive huge waves of Pentagon spending had rolled in. By 1953 the place was a flagship installation. There was cleaned brick and shining white paint and a strong perimeter fence. There were flagpoles and sentry boxes and guard shacks. There were mess halls and a medical clinic and a PX. There were barracks and workshops and warehouses. Above all there were a thousand acres of flat land and by 1953 it was covered with American tanks. They were all lined up, facing east, ready to roll out and fight for the Fulda Gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got there thirty-seven years later it was too dark to see much. But I knew that nothing fundamental would have changed. The tanks would be different, but that would be all. The M4 Shermans that had won World War Two were long gone, except for two fine examples standing preserved outside the main gate, one on each side, like symbols. They were placed halfway up landscaped concrete ramps, noses high, tails low, like they were still in motion, breasting a rise. They were lit up theatrically. They were beautifully painted, glossy green, with bright white stars on their sides. They looked much better than they had originally. Behind them was a long driveway with white-painted curbs and the floodlit front of the office building, which was now the post headquarters. Behind that would be the tank lagers, with M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks lined up shoulder to shoulder, hundreds of them, at nearly four million bucks apiece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got out of the taxi and crossed the sidewalk and headed for the main gate guard shack. My special unit badge got us past it. It would get us past any U.S. Army checkpoint anywhere except the inner ring of the Pentagon. We carried our bags down the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been here before?\" Summer asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head as I walked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been in Heidelberg with the infantry,\" I said. \"Many times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that near?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not far,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were broad stone steps leading up to the doors. The whole place looked like a capitol building in some small state back home. It was immaculately maintained. We went up the steps and inside. There was a soldier at a desk just behind the doors. Not an MP. Just a XII Corps office grunt. We showed him our IDs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your VOQ got space for us?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, no problem,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two rooms,\" I said. \"One night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call ahead,\" he said. \"Just follow the signs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to the back of the hallway. There were more doors there that would lead out into the complex. I checked my watch. It said noon exactly. It was still set to East Coast time. Six in the evening, in West Germany. Already dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see your MP XO,\" I said. \"Is he still in his office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy used his phone and got an answer. Pointed us up a broad staircase to the second floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On your right,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went up the stairs and turned right. There was a long corridor with offices on both sides. They had hardwood doors with reeded glass windows. We found the one we wanted and went in. It was an outer chamber with a sergeant in it. It was pretty much identical to the one back at Bird. Same paint, same floor, same furniture, same temperature, same smell. Same coffee, in the same standard-issue machine. The sergeant was like plenty I had seen before too. Calm, efficient, stoic, ready to believe he ran the place all by himself, which he probably did. He was behind his desk and he looked up at us as we came in. Spent half a second deciding who we were and what we wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you need the major,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. He picked up his phone and buzzed through to the inner office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go straight through,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went in through the inner door and I saw a desk with a guy called Swan behind it. I knew Swan pretty well. Last time I had seen him was in the Philippines, three months earlier, when he was starting a tour of duty that was scheduled to last a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me,\" I said. \"You got here December twenty-ninth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Froze my ass off,\" he said. \"All I had was Pacific gear. Took XII Corps three days to find me a winter uniform.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t surprised. Swan was short, and wide. Almost cubic. He probably owned a percentile all his own, on the quartermasters\u0027 charts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Provost Marshal here?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Temporarily reassigned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Garber signed your orders?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allegedly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figured it out yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me either,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, like he was saying, Hey, the army, what can you do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Lieutenant Summer,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Special unit?\" Swan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she\u0027s cool,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwan stretched a short arm over his desk and they shook hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see a guy called Marshall,\" I said. \"A major. Some kind of a XII Corps staffer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he in trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone is. I\u0027m hoping Marshall will help me figure out who. You know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never heard of him,\" Swan said. \"I only just got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said. \"December twenty-ninth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and gave me the What can you do? shrug again and picked up his phone. I heard him ask his sergeant to find Marshall and tell him I wanted to see him at his convenience. I looked around while we waited for the response. Swan\u0027s office looked borrowed and temporary, just like mine did back in North Carolina. It had the same kind of clock on the wall. Electric, no second hand. No tick. It said ten minutes past six.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything happening here?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much,\" Swan said. \"Some helicopter guy went shopping in Heidelberg and got run over. And Kramer died, of course. That\u0027s shaken things up some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s next in line?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vassell, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met him,\" I said. \"Wasn\u0027t impressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a poisoned chalice. Things are changing. You should hear these guys talk. They\u0027re real gloomy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The status quo is not an option,\" I said. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m hearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis phone rang. He listened for a minute and put it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marshall\u0027s not on-post,\" he said. \"He\u0027s out on a night exercise in the countryside. Back in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer glanced at me. I shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have dinner with me,\" Swan said. \"I\u0027m lonely here with all these cavalry types. The O Club in an hour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe carried our bags over to the Visiting Officers\u0027 Quarters and found our rooms. Mine looked pretty much the same as the one Kramer had died in, except it was cleaner. It was a standard American motel layout. Presumably some hotel chain had bid for the government contract, way back when. Then they had airfreighted all the fixtures and fittings, right down to the sinks and the towel rails and the toilet bowls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shaved and took a shower and dressed in clean BDUs. Knocked on Summer\u0027s door fifty-five minutes into Swan\u0027s hour. She opened up. She looked clean and fresh. Behind her the room looked the same as mine, except it already smelled like a woman\u0027s. There was some kind of nice eau de toilette in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe O Club occupied half of one of the ground floor wings of the main building. It was a grand space, with high ceilings and intricate plaster moldings. There was a lounge, and a bar, and a dining room. We found Swan in the bar. He was with a lieutenant colonel who was wearing Class As with a combat infantryman\u0027s badge on the coat. It was an odd thing to see, on an Armored post. His nameplate said: Simon. He introduced himself to us. I got the feeling he was going to join us for dinner. He told us he was a liaison officer, working on behalf of the infantry. He told us there was an Armored guy down in Heidelberg, doing the same job in reverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been here long?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two years,\" he said, which I was glad about. I needed some background, and Swan didn\u0027t have it, any more than I knew anything about Fort Bird. Then I realized it was no accident that Simon was joining the party. Swan must have figured out what I wanted and set about providing it without being asked. Swan was that kind of guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pleased to meet you, Colonel,\" I said, and then I nodded to Swan, like I was saying thanks. We drank cold American beers from tall frosted glasses and then we went through to the dining room. Swan had made a reservation. The steward put us at a table in the corner. I sat where I could watch the whole room at once. I didn\u0027t see anyone I knew. Vassell wasn\u0027t around. Nor was Coomer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe menu was absolutely standard. We could have been in any O Club in the world. O Clubs aren\u0027t there to introduce you to local cuisine. They\u0027re there to make you feel at home, somewhere deep inside the army\u0027s own interpretation of America. There was a choice of fish or steak. The fish was probably European, but the steak would have been flown in across the Atlantic. Some politician in one of the ranch states would have leveraged a sweet deal with the Pentagon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe small-talked for a spell. We bitched about pay and benefits. Talked about people we knew. We mentioned Just Cause in Panama. Lieutenant Colonel Simon told us he had been to Berlin two days previously and had gotten himself a chip of concrete from the Wall. Told us he planned to have it encased in a plastic cube. Planned to hand it on down the generations, like an heirloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know Major Marshall?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fairly well,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is he exactly?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this official?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a planner. A strategist, basically. Long-term kind of guy. General Kramer seemed to like him. Always kept him close by, made him his intelligence officer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he have an intelligence background?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not formally. But he\u0027ll have done rotations, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So is he a part of the inner team? I heard Kramer and Vassell and Coomer mentioned all in the same breath, but not Marshall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s on the team,\" Simon said. \"That\u0027s for sure. But you know what flag officers are like. They need a guy, but they aren\u0027t about to admit it. So they abuse him a little. He fetches and carries and drives them around, but when push comes to shove they ask his opinion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he going to move up now Kramer\u0027s gone? Maybe into Coomer\u0027s slot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon made a face. \"He should. He\u0027s an Armor fanatic to the core, like the rest of them. But nobody really knows what the hell is going to happen. Kramer dying couldn\u0027t have come at a worse time for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The world is changing,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what a world it was,\" Simon said. \"Kramer\u0027s world, basically, beginning to end. He graduated the Point in Fifty-two, and places like this one were all buttoned up by Fifty-three, and they\u0027ve been the center of the universe for almost forty years. These places are so dug in, you wouldn\u0027t believe it. You know who has done the most in this country?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Armored. Not the infantry. This theater is all about the Army Corps of Engineers. Sherman tanks way back weighed thirty-eight tons and were nine feet wide. Now we\u0027re all the way up to the M1A1 Abrams, which weighs seventy tons and is eleven feet wide. Every step of the way for forty years the Corps of Engineers has had work to do. They\u0027ve widened roads, hundreds of miles of them, all over West Germany. They\u0027ve strengthened bridges. Hell, they\u0027ve built roads and bridges. Dozens of them. You want a stream of seventy-ton tanks rolling east to battle, you better make damn sure the roads and bridges can take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billions of dollars,\" Simon said. \"And of course, they knew which roads and bridges to look at. They knew where we were starting, and they knew where we were going. They talked to the war-gamers, they looked at the maps, and they got busy with the concrete and the rebar. Then they built way stations everywhere we needed them. Permanent hardened fuel stores, ammunition dumps, repair shops, hundreds of them, all along strictly predetermined routes. So we\u0027re embedded here, literally. We\u0027re dug in, literally. The Cold War battlefields are literally set in stone, Reacher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People are going to say we invested and we won.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon nodded. \"And they\u0027d be correct. But what comes next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More investment,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" he said. \"Like in the Navy, when the big battleships were superseded by aircraft carriers. The end of one era, the beginning of the next. The Abrams tanks are like battleships. They\u0027re magnificent, but they\u0027re out-of-date. About the only way we can use them is down custom-built roads in directions we\u0027ve already planned to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re mobile,\" Summer said. \"Like any tank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not very mobile,\" Simon said. \"Where is the next fight going to be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. I wished Joe was there. He was good at all the geopolitical stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Middle East?\" I said. \"Iran or Iraq, maybe. They\u0027ve both gotten their breath back, they\u0027ll be looking for the next thing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or the Balkans,\" Swan said. \"When the Soviets finally collapse, there\u0027s a forty-five-year-old pressure cooker waiting for the lid to come off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Simon said. \"Look at the Balkans, for instance. Yugoslavia, maybe. That\u0027ll be the first place anything happens, for sure. Right now they\u0027re just waiting for the starting gun. What do we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send in the Airborne,\" Swan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Simon said again. \"We send in the 82nd and the 101st. Lightly armed, we might get three battalions there inside a week. But what do we do after we get there? We\u0027re speed bumps, that\u0027s all, nothing more. We have to wait for the heavy units. And that\u0027s the first problem. An Abrams tank weighs seventy tons. Can\u0027t airlift it. Got to put it on a train, and then put it on a ship. And that\u0027s the good news. Because you don\u0027t just ship the tank. For every ton of tank, you have to ship four tons of fuel and other equipment. These suckers get a half-mile to the gallon. And you need spare engines, ammunition, huge maintenance crews. The logistics tail is a mile long. Like moving an iron mountain. To ship enough tank brigades to make a worthwhile difference, you\u0027re looking at a six-month buildup, minimum, and that\u0027s working right around the clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"During which time the Airborne troops are deep in the shit,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about it,\" Simon said. \"And those are my boys, and I worry about them. Lightly armed paratroops against any kind of foreign armor, we\u0027d get slaughtered. It would be a very, very anxious six months. And it gets worse. Because what happens when the heavy brigades eventually get there? What happens is, they roll off the ships and they get bogged down two blocks later. Roads aren\u0027t wide enough, bridges aren\u0027t strong enough, they never make it out of the port area. They sit there stuck in the mud and watch the infantry getting killed far away in the distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or take the Middle East,\" Simon said. \"We all know Iraq wants Kuwait back. Suppose they go there? Long term, it\u0027s an easy win for us, because the open desert is pretty much the same for tanks as the steppes in Europe, except it\u0027s a little hotter and dustier. But the war plans we\u0027ve got will work out just fine. But do we even get that far? We\u0027ve got the infantry sitting there like tiny little speed bumps for six whole months. Who says the Iraqis won\u0027t roll right over them in the first two weeks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Air power,\" Summer said. \"Attack helicopters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish,\" Simon said. \"Planes and whirlybirds are sexy as hell, but they don\u0027t win anything on their own. Never have, never will. Boots on the ground is what wins things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. Part of that was a combat infantryman\u0027s standard-issue pride. But part of it was true too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s going to happen?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same thing as happened with the Navy in 1941,\" Simon said. \"Overnight, battleships were history and carriers were the new thing. So for us, now, we need to integrate. We need to understand that our light units are too vulnerable and our heavy units are too slow. We need to ditch the whole light-heavy split. We need integrated rapid-response brigades with armored vehicles lighter than twenty tons and small enough to fit in the belly of a C-130. We need to get places faster and fight smarter. No more planning for set-piece battles between herds of dinosaurs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Basically we\u0027ll have to put the infantry in charge,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ever talk to people like Marshall about this kind of stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their planners? No way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do they think about the future?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea. And I don\u0027t care. The future belongs to the infantry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDessert was apple pie, and then we had coffee. It was the usual excellent brew. We slid back from the future into present-day small talk. The stewards moved around, silently. Just another evening, in an Officers\u0027 Club four thousand miles from the last one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marshall will be back at dawn,\" Swan told me. \"Look for a scout car at the rear of the first incoming column.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Figured dawn in January in Frankfurt would be about 0700 hours. I set my mental alarm for six. Lieutenant Colonel Simon said good night and wandered off. Summer pushed her chair back and sprawled in it, as much as a tiny person can sprawl. Swan sat forward with his elbows on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think they get much dope on this post?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want some?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brown heroin,\" I said. \"Not for my personal use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwan nodded. \"Guys here say there are Turkish guest workers in Germany who could get you some. One of the speed dealers could supply it, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ever met a guy called Willard?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The new boss?\" he said. \"I got the memo. Never met him. But some of the guys here know him. He was an intelligence wonk, something to do with Armor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wrote algorithms,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soviet T-80 fuel consumption, I think. Told us what kind of training they were doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now he\u0027s running the 110th?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said. \"Bizarre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did he do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously someone liked him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should find out who. Start sending hate mail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again. Nearly a million men in the army, hundreds of billions of dollars, and it all came down to who liked who. Hey, what can you do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to bed,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy VOQ room was so generic I lost track of where I was within a minute of closing my door. I hung my uniform in the closet and washed up and crawled between the sheets. They smelled of the same detergent the army uses everywhere. I thought of my mother in Paris and Joe in D.C. My mother was already in bed, probably. Joe would still be working, at whatever it was he did. I said six A.M. to myself and closed my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn broke at 0650, by which time I was standing next to Summer at XII Corps\u0027 east road gate. We had mugs of coffee in our hands. The ground was frozen and there was mist in the air. The sky was gray and the landscape was a shade of pastel green. It was low and undulating and unexciting, like a lot of Europe. There were stands of small neat trees here and there. Dormant winter earth, giving off cold organic smells. It was very quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road ran through the gate and then turned and headed east and a little north, into the fog, toward Russia. It was wide and straight, made from reinforced concrete. The curbstones were nicked here and there by tank tracks. Big wedge-shaped chunks had been knocked out of them. A tank is a difficult thing to steer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe waited. Still quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we heard them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is the twentieth century\u0027s signature sound? You could have a debate about it. Some might say the slow drone of an aero engine. Maybe from a lone fighter crawling across an azure 1940s sky. Or the scream of a fast jet passing low overhead, shaking the ground. Or the whup whup whup of a helicopter. Or the roar of a laden 747 lifting off. Or the crump of bombs falling on a city. All of those would qualify. They\u0027re all uniquely twentieth-century noises. They were never heard before. Never, in all of history. Some crazy optimists might lobby for a Beatles song. A yeah, yeah, yeah chorus fading under the screams of their audience. I would have sympathy for that choice. But a song and screaming could never qualify. Music and desire have been around since the dawn of time. They weren\u0027t invented after 1900.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, the twentieth century\u0027s signature sound is the squeal and clatter of tank tracks on a paved street. That sound was heard in Warsaw, and Rotterdam, and Stalingrad, and Berlin. Then it was heard again in Budapest and Prague, and Seoul and Saigon. It\u0027s a brutal sound. It\u0027s the sound of fear. It speaks of a massive overwhelming advantage in power. And it speaks of remote, impersonal indifference. Tank treads squeal and clatter and the very noise they make tells you they can\u0027t be stopped. It tells you you\u0027re weak and powerless against the machine. Then one track stops and the other keeps on going and the tank wheels around and lurches straight toward you, roaring and squealing. That\u0027s the real twentieth-century sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe heard the XII Corps\u0027 Abrams column a long time before we saw it. The noise came at us through the fog. We heard the tracks, and the whine of the turbines. We heard the grind of the drive gear and felt fastpattering bass shudders through the soles of our feet as each new tread plate came off the cogs and thumped down into position. We heard grit and stone crushed under their weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we saw them. The lead tank loomed at us through the mist. It was moving fast, pitching a little, staying flat, its engine roaring. Behind it was another, and another. They were all in line, single file, like an armada from hell. It was a magnificent sight. The M1A1 Abrams is like a shark, evolved to a point of absolute perfection. It is the undisputed king of the jungle. No other tank on earth can even begin to damage it. It is wrapped in armor made out of a depleted uranium core sandwiched between rolled steel plate. The armor is dense and impregnable. Battlefield shells and rockets and kinetic devices bounce right off it. But its main trick is to stand off so far that no battlefield shell or rocket or kinetic device can even reach it. It sits there and watches enemy rounds fall short in the dirt. Then it traverses its mighty gun and fires and a second later and a mile and a half in the distance its assailant blows up and burns. It is the ultimate unfair advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lead tank rolled past us. Eleven feet wide, twenty-six feet long, nine and a half feet tall. Seventy tons. Its engine bellowed and its weight shook the ground. Its tracks squealed and clattered and slid on the concrete. Then the second tank rolled by. And the third, and the fourth, and the fifth. The noise was deafening. The huge bulk of exotic metal buffeted the air. The gun barrels dipped and swayed and bounced. Exhaust fumes swirled all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were altogether twenty tanks in the formation. They drove in through the gate and their noise and vibration faded behind us and then there was a short gap and a scout car came out of the mist straight toward us. It was a shoot-and-scoot Humvee armed with a TOW-2 antitank missile launcher. Two guys in it. I stepped into its path and raised my hand. Paused. I didn\u0027t know Marshall and I had only ever seen him once, in the dark interior of the Grand Marquis outside Fort Bird\u0027s post headquarters. But even so, I was pretty sure that neither of the guys in the Humvee was him. I remembered Marshall as large and dark and these guys were small, which is much more usual for Armored people. One thing there isn\u0027t a lot of inside an Abrams is room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Humvee came to a stop right in front of me and I tracked around to the driver\u0027s window. Summer took up station on the passenger side, standing easy. The driver rolled his glass down. Stared out at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for Major Marshall,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver was a captain and his passenger was a captain too. They were both dressed in Nomex tank suits, with balaclavas and Kevlar helmets with built-in headphones. The passenger had sleeve pockets full of pens. He had clipboards strapped to both thighs. They were all covered with notes. Some kind of score sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marshall\u0027s not here,\" the driver said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s asking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can read,\" I said. I was wearing last night\u0027s BDUs. They had oak leaves on the collar and Reacher on the stencil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unit?\" the guy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marshall went to California,\" he said. \"Emergency deployment to Fort Irwin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not very specific.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m honestly not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of an emergency have they got at Irwin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure about that either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drive on,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir Humvee moved out from the space between us, and Summer joined me in the middle of the road. The air smelled of diesel and gas turbine exhaust and the concrete was scored fresh white by the passage of the tank tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasted trip,\" Summer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not,\" I said. \"Depends exactly when Marshall left. If it was after Swan\u0027s phone call, that tells us something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were shunted between three different offices, trying to find out exactly what time Marshall left XII Corps. We ended up in a second-story suite that housed General Vassell\u0027s operation. Vassell himself wasn\u0027t there. We spoke to yet another captain. He seemed to be in charge of an administrative company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Major Marshall took a civilian flight at 2300,\" he said. \"Frankfurt to Dulles.

Took a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see part of it,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The agenda,\" she said. \"It was the other side of the coin from what Colonel Simon was talking about last night. Simon was salivating about the infantry taking Armored down a peg or two. Kramer must have seen all of that coming. Two-star generals aren\u0027t stupid. So the Irwin conference on New Year\u0027s Day was about fighting the opposite corner. It was about resistance, I guess. They don\u0027t want to give up what they\u0027ve got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell of a thing to give up,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe it,\" she said. \"Like battleship captains, way back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what was in the agenda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Part defense, part offense,\" she said. \"That\u0027s the obvious way to do it. Arguments against integrated units, ridicule of lightweight armored vehicles, advocacy for their own specialized expertise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree,\" I said. \"But it\u0027s not enough. The Pentagon is going to be neck-deep in position papers full of shit like that, starting any day now. For, against, if, but and however, we\u0027re going to be bored to death with it. But there was something else in that agenda that made them totally desperate to get Kramer\u0027s copy back. What was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me either,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why did they run last night?\" Summer asked. \"By now they must have destroyed Kramer\u0027s copy and every other copy. So they could have lied through their teeth about what was in it, to put your mind at rest. They could even have given you a phony document. They could have said, Here you go, this was it, check it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They ran because of Mrs. Kramer,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I still think Vassell and Coomer killed her. Kramer croaks, the ball is in their court, in the circumstances they know it\u0027s their responsibility to go out and round up all the loose paperwork. Mrs. Kramer goes down as collateral damage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would make perfect sense,\" I said. \"Except that neither one of them looked particularly tall and strong to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re both a lot taller and stronger than Mrs. Kramer was. Plus, you know, heat of the moment, pumped up with panic, we could be seeing ambiguous forensic results. And we don\u0027t know how good the Green Valley people are anyway. Could be some family doctor doing a two-year term as coroner, and what the hell would he know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I said. \"But I still don\u0027t see how it could have happened. Take out the drive time from D.C., take out ten minutes to find that store and steal the crowbar, they had ten minutes to react. And they didn\u0027t have a car, and they didn\u0027t call for one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They could have taken a taxi. Or a town car. Direct from the hotel lobby. And we\u0027d never trace it. New Year\u0027s Eve, it was the busiest night of the year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would have been a long ride,\" I said. \"Big fare. It might stand out in some driver\u0027s memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New Year\u0027s Eve,\" she said again. \"D.C. taxis and town cars are all over three states. All kinds of weird destinations. It\u0027s a possibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" I said. \"You don\u0027t take a taxi on a trip where you break into a hardware store and a house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No reason for the driver to have seen anything. Vassell or Coomer or both could have walked into that alley in Sperryville on foot. Come back five minutes later with the crowbar under their coat. Same thing with Mrs. Kramer\u0027s house. The cab could have stopped on the driveway. All the action was around the back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too big of a risk. A D.C. cabdriver reads the papers same as anyone else. Maybe more than anyone else, with all that traffic. He sees the story from Green Valley, he remembers his two passengers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn\u0027t see it as a risk. They weren\u0027t anticipating a story. Because they thought Mrs. Kramer wasn\u0027t going to be home. They thought she would be at the hospital. And they figured no way would a couple of trivial burglaries in Sperryville and Green Valley make it into the D.C. papers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Thought back to something Detective Clark had said, days ago. I had people up and down the street, canvassing. There were some cars around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I said. \"Maybe we should check taxis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worst night of the year,\" Summer said. \"Like for alibis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be a hell of a thing,\" I said. \"Wouldn\u0027t it? Taking a cab to do a thing like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nerves of steel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they\u0027ve got nerves of steel, why did they run away last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was quiet for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That really doesn\u0027t make any sense,\" she said. \"Because they can\u0027t run forever. They must know that. They must know that sooner or later they\u0027re going to have to turn around and bite back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree. And they should have done it right here. Right now. This is their turf. I don\u0027t understand why they didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be a hell of a bite. Their whole professional lives are on the line. You should be very careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You too,\" I said. \"Not just me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Offense is the best defense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are we going after them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marshall,\" I said. \"He\u0027s the one I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rule of thumb,\" I said. \"Chase the one they sent farthest away, because they see him as the weakest link.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to Paris next,\" I said. \"I have to see my mom.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8/page-18.html","bookId":2346,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:33 AM"}
