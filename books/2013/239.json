He saw, in that moment, the grim fate of his destiny, a descent into the madness of inconsolable grief. The god would take the last child, but it was most certainly the last. The blood.of the others was on Sidilack’s hands, a curse, a haunting that only death could relieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he was Gral. Forbidden from taking his own life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother legend followed, that one recounting the long journey to Snaketongue’s final end, his pursuit of questions that could not be answered, the pathos of his staggering walk into the Dead Man’s Desert-realm of the fallen Gral-where even the noble spirits refused him, his soul, the hollow defence of his own crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed did not want to think of these things. Echoes of the child, that hissing, less-than-human creature who had been drawn into the shadows by a god-to what end? A mystery within the legend that would never be solved. But he did not believe there had been mercy in that god’s heart. He did not want to think of young females with small hands and feet, with sloped chins and large canines, with luminous eyes the hue of savanna grasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not want to think of Sidilack and the endless night of his doom. The warrior with slaughter’s blood staining his hands and his soul. That tragic fool was nothing like Taralack Veed, he told himself again and again. Truths did not hide in vague similarities, after all; only in the specific details, and he shared none of those with old Snaketongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You speak rarely these days, Taralack Veed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gral glanced up at Icarium. ‘1 am frightened for you,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘1 see nothing of the hardness in your eyes, friend, the hardness that perhaps none but a longtime companion would be able to detect. The hardness that bespeaks your rage. It seems to sleep, and I do not know if even Rhulad can awaken it. If he cannot, then you will die. Quickly.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If all you say of me is true,’ the Jhag replied, ‘then my death would be welcome. And justified in every sense of the word.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No other can defeat the Emperor-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why are you so certain 1 can? I do not wield a magical sword. I do not return to life should 1 fall. These are the rumours regarding the Tiste Edur named Rhulad, yes?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When your anger is unleashed, Icarium, you cannot be stopped.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, but it seems I can.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed’s eyes narrowed. ‘Is this the change that has come to you, Icarium? Have your memories returned to you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I believe if they had, I would not now be here,’ the Jhag replied, pausing before one stall offering cord-wrapped pottery. ‘Look upon these items here, Taralack Veed, and tell me what you see. Empty vessels? Or endless possibilities?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They are naught but pots.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, the Gral decided, a far too easy smile. ‘Do you mock me, Icarium?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Something awaits me. I do not mean this mad Emperor. Something else. Answer me this. How does one measure time?’,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘By the course of the sun, the phases of the moon, the wheel of the stars. And, of course, in cities such as this one, the sounding of a bell at fixed intervals-a wholly absurd conceit and, indeed, one that is spiritually debilitating.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Gral speaks.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now you truly mock me. This is unlike you, Icarium.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The sounding of bells, their increments established by the passing of sand or water through a narrowed vessel. As you say, a conceit. An arbitrary assertion of constancy. Can we truly say, however, that time is constant?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As any Gral would tell you, it is not. Else our senses lie.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps they do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then we are lost.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I appreciate your intellectual belligerence today, Taralack Veed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved on, wandering slowly alongside the canal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I understand your obsession with time,’ the Gral said. ‘You, who have passed through age after age, unchanging, unknowing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Unknowing, yes. That is the problem, isn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I do not agree. It is our salvation.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were silent for a few more strides. Many were the curious-at times pitying-glances cast their way. The champions were also the condemned, after all. Yet was there hope, buried deep behind those shying eyes? There must be. For an end to the nightmare that was Rhulad Sengar, the Edur Emperor of Lether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Without an understanding of time, history means nothing. Do you follow, Taralack Veed?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yet you do not understand time, do you?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-239.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
