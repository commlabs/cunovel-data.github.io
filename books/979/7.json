The language was Terran. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kirk whirled and peered through the dusk, which was gathering rapidly. He saw a slightly amused pair of brown eyes, brunette hair, and a trim body dressed in chic good taste in expensive Terran clothes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cortland stood up. \"Mrs. Sherrin ... our new Planetary Administrator, Cyril Kirk.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She lowered herself to the ground, spreading out a small mat under her as she did so. \"Jeannette, if you don\u0027t mind.\" She folded her legs under her carefully. \"I don\u0027t mean to be disrespectful. But there\u0027s such a small number of us here, we need to be friends and stick together.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cortland, who had been looking away for a moment turned to them. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, someone wants to talk to me.\" Kirk nodded.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did I meet your husband this afternoon?\" he inquired politely, as Cortland strode off.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; I\u0027m a widow.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry,\" he murmured.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t be. Not for me, I mean. We\u0027d been coming to a parting of the ways for a long time. But let\u0027s not talk about that. How do you like the dancing?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He looked at the firelit figures, whirling in the growing dusk. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m sort of overwhelmed by everything. It\u0027s all so new. I\u0027ve heard so many confusing thingsâ€”\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She nodded. \"If you manage to make sense out of the Nemarians, you\u0027ll make history. It\u0027s better not to worry about it too much. Immerse yourself in their gay, happy life.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you mean?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She gave him a sharp look. \"You\u0027ll find out what I mean.

Form your own conclusions as you go along. No use giving you prejudices before you start. Maybe you\u0027re the man who\u0027ll cut the Gordian knot.
