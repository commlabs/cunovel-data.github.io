Reading it all just reminded me how much we felt, how much we feel, and how much a part of us it is. It doesn’t belong to anyone else and I guess I don’t want it to. It’s ours. Our history. Our story. And in a way our future too. As much as I love her, you’re right. I can’t give that to Joss. I can’t give these to her. ” I gestured to the diaries and then got up on all fours over the scattered mess in a move to put them away. I was abruptly stopped by the pressure of Adam’s hands on either side of my hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back over my shoulder, my eyes widening slightly at the sight of him on his knees behind me with the most carnal and possessive look on his face. My lips parted as he pulled my arse into him and I felt his erection rub against me. “What are you doing?” I asked on a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response he slipped his hand around to the zipper on my shorts and tugged it down as his other hand tugged the zipper down on his jeans. “In a little while we’ll go upstairs to make love, but right now I’m going to fuck my future wife on top of our history.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow Adam managed to get the “f-word” into the most romantic sentence ever, and I didn’t care. Instead I gasped as he rocked against me and hoarsely replied, “What about the floor? We might scratch it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked his hands up my spine and brought them back down to grip my hips and he hauled me harder against him. “Do you really think I give a shit about the floor right now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, already flushing with anticipation. “I’m guessing not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam grinned wickedly. “Let’s start the next chapter, baby.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-fountain-bridge-on-dublin-street-2/page-18.html","bookId":1892,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:20 PM"}
