I told you to tell your Mafia friends to leave me alone. They tried to grab me again. Why are your Mafia buddies trying to kill me?\" \"I-I have no idea. They wouldn\u0027t-maybe they saw us together and thought we were friends and-\" \"Well we\u0027re not friends, Mrs. Stevens. Get me out of this.\" \"What are you talking about? How can I-?\" \"The same way you got me into it. I want you to tell your buddy, Altieri, that you and I just met, and you don\u0027t know me. I\u0027m not going to let someone murder me because of some stupid thing you did.\" Diane said, \"I can\u0027t-\" \"Oh, yes, you can. You\u0027re going to talk to Altieri and you\u0027re going to talk to him now. I\u0027m not leaving here until you do.\" Diane said, \"What you\u0027re asking is impossible. I\u0027m sorry if I got you involved in this, but? She was thoughtful for a long moment, then turned to Greenburg. \"Do you think if I talked to Altieri he might leave us both alone?\" Greenburg said, \"That\u0027s an interesting question. He might-especially if he thinks we\u0027re watching him. Would you like to talk to him personally?\" Diane said, \"No, I-\" Kelly interrupted. \"She means yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eANTHONY ALTIERI\u0027S HOME was a classic stone and frame colonial-style house, in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. The enormous house was at the end of a cul-de-sac, on fifteen acres of land, surrounded by a huge, high, iron fence. On the grounds were tall shade trees, ponds, and a colorful garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guard sat in a booth inside the front gate. As the car with Greenburg, Kelly, and Diane drove up, the guard walked out to meet it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized Greenburg. \"Afternoon, Lieutenant.\" \"Hello, Caesar. We want to see Mr. Altieri.\" \"Do you have a warrant?\" \"It\u0027s not that kind of visit. This is a social call.\" The guard glanced at the two women. \"Wait here.\" He walked inside, to the booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later he came out and opened the gate. \"You can go in.\" \"Thanks.\" Greenburg drove up to the front of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the three of them got out of the car, a second guard appeared. \"Follow me.\" He led them inside. The large living room was an eclectic combination of antiques and modern and French furniture. In spite of the fact that the day was warm, there was a roaring fire in the huge stone fireplace. The trio followed the guard through the living room into a large darkened bedroom. Anthony Altieri was in bed, attached to a respirator. He was pale and gaunt and seemed to have aged greatly since the short time he had appeared in court. A priest and a nurse were at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAltieri looked at Diane, Kelly, and Greenburg, then turned back to Diane. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse and raspy. \"What the hell do you want?\" Diane said, \"Mr. Altieri, I want you to leave Mrs. Harris and me alone. Call off your men. It\u0027s enough that you killed my husband and-\" Altieri cut in. \"What are you talking about? I never even heard of your husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read about that bullshit note found on his body.\" He sneered. \"\u0027He\u0027ll swim with the fishes\u0027 Somebody\u0027s seen The Sopranos too many times. I\u0027ll tell you something for free, lady. No Italian wrote that. I\u0027m not after you. I don\u0027t give a damn whether you live or die. I\u0027m not after anybody. I-\" He winced in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m busy making my peace with God. I-\" He began to choke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest turned to Diane. \"I think it would be better if you left now.\" Detective Greenburg asked, \"What is it?\" The priest said, \"Cancer.\" Diane looked at the man on the bed. I\u0027m not after you. I don\u0027t give a damn whether you live or die?I\u0027m busy making my peace with God. He was telling the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Diane was filled with a sudden, blinding panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eON THE DRIVE back from Altieri\u0027s, Detective Greenburg looked worried. \"I have to tell you, I think Altieri meant what he said.\" Kelly reluctantly nodded. \"So do I. The man is dying.\" \"Do you know of any reason why someone would try to kill the two of you?\" \"No,\" Diane said. \"If it isn\u0027t Altieri-\" She shook her head. \"I have no idea.\" Kelly swallowed. \"Neither have I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDETECTIVE GREENBURG ESCORTED Diane and Kelly back into Diane\u0027s apartment. \"I\u0027m going to get to work on this now,\" he said, \"but you\u0027ll be safe here. In fifteen minutes there will be a police cruiser outside your apartment building for the next twenty-four hours, and we\u0027ll see what we can find out by then. If you need me, call.\" And he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDlANE AND KELLY stared at each other. There was an awkward silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like some tea?\" Diane asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly said perversely, \"Coffee.\" Diane looked at her a moment, irritated, and sighed. \"Right.\" Diane walked into the kitchen to start the coffee. Kelly wandered around the living room, looking at the paintings on the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Diane came out of the kitchen, Kelly was studying one of Diane\u0027s paintings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stevens.\" She turned to Diane. \"Did you paint this?\" Diane nodded. \"Yes.\" Kelly said in a dismissive tone of voice, \"Pretty.\" Diane\u0027s lips tightened. \"Oh? Do you know a lot about art?\" \"Not much, Mrs. Stevens.\" \"Who do you like? Grandma Moses, I suppose.\" one\u0027s interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what other primitive painters touch your heart?\" Kelly turned to face Diane. \"To be honest, I prefer the curvilinear, nonrepresentational form. There are exceptions, of course. For instance, in Titian\u0027s Venus of Robin, the diagonal sweep of her form is breathtaking, and-\" From the kitchen, they could hear the coffee percolating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane said curtly, \"The coffee is ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY WERE SEATED across from each other in the dining room, taciturn, letting their coffee get cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane broke the silence. \"Can you think of any reason why someone would try to kill us?\" \"No.\" Kelly was silent for a moment. \"The only connection you and I have is that both our husbands worked at KIG. Maybe they were involved in some top secret project. And whoever killed them thinks they might have told us about it.\" Diane paled. \"Yes? They looked at each other in dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN HIS OFFICE, Tanner was watching the scene taking place in Diane\u0027s apartment, on one of the wall television sets. His chief security guard stood next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The only connection you and I have is that both our husbands worked at KIG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe they were involved in some top secret project. And whoever killed them thinks they might have told us about it.\" \"Yes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE STEVENS APARTMENT had been wired with state-of-the-art television and sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Tanner had told his partner, the house was filled with cutting-edge technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were concealed video systems in every room of the apartment, with a Web-based camera the size of a button resting among the books, bent fiber-optic wires under the doors, and a wireless picture frame camera. In the attic, a video server the size of a laptop computer had been installed to service six cameras. Attached to the server was a wireless modem that allowed the equipment to function through cellular technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAS TANNER LEANED forward, watching the screen intently, Diane said, \"We have to find out what our husbands were working on.\" \"Right. But we\u0027re going to need help. How do we do that?\" \"We\u0027ll call Tanner Kingsley. He\u0027s the only one who can help us, and he\u0027s trying to find out who\u0027s behind all this.\" \"Let\u0027s do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDIANE SAID, \"YOU can spend the night here. Well be safe. There\u0027s a police car stationed outside.\" She walked over to the window and pulled the curtain back. There was no car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared for a long moment and felt a sudden chill. \"That\u0027s strange,\" Diane said. \"There was supposed to be a patrol car here. Let me make a phone call.\" Diane took Detective Greenberg\u0027s card from her purse, went to the telephone, and called a number. \"Detective Greenburg, please.\" She listened a moment. \"Are you sure??I see. Then could I speak to Detective Praegitzer?\" There was another moment of silence. \"Yes, thank you.\" Diane slowly replaced the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly looked at Diane. \"What is it?\" Diane said, \"Detectives Greenburg and Praegitzer have been transferred to another precinct.\" Kelly swallowed. \"That\u0027s a real coincidence, isn\u0027t it?\" Diane said, \"And I just remembered something.\" \"What?\" \"Detective Greenburg asked me if Richard had done or said anything out of his usual routine lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one thing I forgot to mention. Richard was going to Washington to see somebody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I travel with him, but this time he insisted it would be better if he went alone.\" Kelly was watching her with a surprised expression. \"That\u0027s strange. Mark told me he had to go to Washington, and had to go alone.\" \"We have to find out why.\" Kelly walked over to the window and pulled back the drapes. \"There\u0027s still no car.\" She turned to Diane. \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\" \"Right,\" Diane said. \"I know a little out-of-the-way hotel in Chinatown called the Mandarin. No one will ever think of looking for us there. We\u0027ll call Mr. Kingsley from the room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I KNOW A little out-of-the-way hotel in Chinatown called the Mandarin. No one will ever think of looking for us there. We\u0027ll call Mr. Kingsley from the room.\" Tanner turned to his chief security officer, Harry Flint, with the perpetual half smile. \"Kill them.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-23.html","bookId":2370,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM"}
