Not bothering to knock, I open the door and step in. Nox stands with his back to me, looking out the window, talking on the cell phone. I hear one side of the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sir. It’s not that complicated.” Pause. “I understand. I assure you when the time comes, I can let her go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart skips a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously not having heard me enter, he continues, “She’s just a girl. She’ll get over it. We knew it wouldn’t last anyway. We were stupid to start it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart shrinks. Then shrivels. Then dies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat thickens. I try to swallow the lump but can’t. My eyes blur with unshed tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir. I can’t tell you how sorry I am. It was a moment of weakness and it won’t happen again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch’s voice sounds into the cell, “Listen, Nox. I know it can be lonely in this life, but you’re better off finding one of your own. I’m not sure if I want you working this anymore. You’re in too deep. I think it might be clouding your judgment. Hell, you took her off site! That isn’t like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should’ve known he would find out about me and Lily at the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to my office opens. I know it’s her. But I need to steer Mitch the other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes shut tight and my chest aches as I say, “No, sir. It’s not that complicated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch utters, “I hope not. This could cause trouble. I think it already has.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force out, “I understand. I assure you when the time comes, I can let her go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost hear Lily’s heart break when I say, “She’s just a girl. She’ll get over it. We knew it wouldn’t last anyway. We were stupid to start it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch pauses a moment, then, “I’m sure you did the best you could, son. I know I can count on you, Nox. You’re one of my best men.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choke the urge to roar in anger and mutter, “Yes, sir. I can’t tell you how sorry I am. It was a moment of weakness and it won’t happen again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rage builds inside of me. I feel it trail up my chest as it claws its way into my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch finishes with, “I suspect it won’t. Keep me updated.” Then he’s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHead pounding, I clutch the phone tight. Breathing deep, I dip my chin and say, “Come here, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice hitches, “No.” She chokes out, “You made me believe…I’m so stupid…I believed…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, I throw down the cell and walk over to her. She holds her hands out, palms up and utters through gritted teeth, “Don’t you touch me. Don’t you fucking touch me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plead, “Baby, listen to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking back with her palms up, tears fall down her cheeks. She hisses, “I believed you! Don’t come near me, Nox. You’ve made it clear where we stand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning on her heel, she tries to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a chance of that happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning up behind her, I wrap my arms around her arms, holding her tight. She kicks out. “Let go of me! You’re a liar!” A sob bursts out of her, “You’re a goddamn liar and I hate you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body shakes with silent sobs and I rock her side to side, allowing her a moment to get it out. She weakens in my hold and stops fighting. I take this chance to explain, “Knew you were there the whole time, baby. And I never lied to you. I lied to Mitch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily mutters, “I don’t believe you. You were always going to leave me. You were never going to come back for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s so much I want to tell her right now, but I can’t. Swallowing hard, I tell her, “Lily, I swear, I never lied to you. There are things I want to tell you, but I can’t right now. Just please believe me when I say I never lied to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill hurt by what she heard, she tries to pull free. “No. I don’t have to believe shit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding her tighter, I lean my head forward, closer to her ear and whisper, “What’s my name, princess?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stills in my arms. “Adam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI urge, “My full name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispers, “Adam Christian Taylor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And where was I born?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer breath hitches. “White Deer, Texas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlanting a kiss to her neck, I ask, “When’s my birthday?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chokes on a sob. “March eighteenth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurying my face into her neck, I say, “Know how many people know that information?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer answer if a sniffle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI state, “You. Just you, Lily. You’re the only one I trust with that. Because you’re everything to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollapsing in my arms, she cries softly. I turn her around and pull her into a hug. I’m immediately relieved when her arms come around me and she squeezes me tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just heard- I mean, I walked in and--then you said--and I didn’t know--and it hurt so much!” She cries into my chest and I kiss the top of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. And I’m sorry you thought what you thought. But it was Mitch who needed to think what you thought. I heard you come in, baby. I knew you were there the whole time. I still had to do it,” I say as I rub her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling protective of my girl, I decide to let her in on one little secret. “Doesn’t matter where you are, baby. I’ll come for you.” She lifts her watery eyes to mine and I state confidently, “I’ll come for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting her face, I lower mine. We meet in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kiss is sweet. So much conveyed in that small gesture. I release her lips to whisper, “You gotta trust me like I trust you, ‘kay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and sniffles. So I kiss her sweet lips again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hang out with Nox in his office for the rest of the afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts me to work filing, and although it’s a crappy job, I used to do it at Flynn Logistics all the damn time, so I’m good at it. Within an hour, I have him up to speed and he sets me to work looking through boxes to see if there’s anything else I can do without getting bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox types away at his laptop, clearly busy, so when I open the first book and gasp quietly, he doesn’t react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, on top of the files, is my cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicking it up, I hold it for a while before placing it back in the box and shutting the lid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing my eyes, I breathe deeply. Temptation will not win out. I am stronger than this. I do not need to turn it on. I’ve been fine without it for months. I don’t need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. I don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening the box again, I pick up my cell and hold down the power button. It starts without a problem. There are a ton of text messages and missed calls, but before I can check anything, the phone rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring at the display, I still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie’s twin brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to take this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so tangled in the phone ringing that I don’t hear Nox move until he’s behind me. “Lily, baby, don’t answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill kneeling in front of the open box, my fingers twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baby, that phone isn’t secure. Don’t answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, I hold the cell phone by my side and turn to Nox. He looks worried. I whisper, “I have to take this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox shakes his head. His lips thin. “It’s not a secure line, Lily. Anyone can track it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back down at the still ringing phone, I whisper again, “I need to take this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox reaches out to take the phone, but I hold it out of reach. His eyes meet mine, confusion written all over them. Breathing heavily, I say, “I’m sorry.” Then run out the door, down the hall and into my old room. Taking the chair from inside the room, I drag it into the bathroom with me and lodge it under the door knob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a second after I place it there, the door handle jiggles. Nox yells, “Babe! Stop! Do not answer!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing my eyes, I press the call button. I hold the cell to my ear and whisper, “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox bangs on the door and booms, “Hang up, Lily! Fuck!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lily! Lily, darlin’! Please don’t hang up! It’s urgent!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my effing God!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heavy Irish accent but the wrong brother. A clearly distressed Jamie Harrison begs for me to stay on the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe person who I thought was my friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe person who organized a hit on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to have me killed for money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I trusted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy finger dances on the end call button. I accuse, “I thought you were my friend, Jamie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yells, “I am, Lily! I feckin’ love ye! Yer my family, girlie. I’m more a feckin’ Flynn than I am a Harrison! Please listen ta me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s something about the desperation in his voice I don’t like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know Jamie. I know him well enough to know that he isn’t a shaking-in-your-boots type of guy. The boots are shaking now. I can almost hear them through the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteeling my voice, I tell him, “You’ve got thirty seconds to make me listen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice shakes as he whispers, “Never meant for this ta happen. It wasn’t meant ta happen like this. I swear, Lily.” Voice breaking, he mutters, “Swear on my own life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest squeezes. This is so unlike Jamie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSniffling, he states, “Jett’s trying ta kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? No way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJett and Jamie are closer than close. I don’t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovering my mouth with my hand, I listen wide-eyed as he starts, “Jett came up with an idea ta get money. We needed ta do something ta look after mam. Do ye ken? It was all for Mam, Lil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moans low, as if in pain. Panting, he goes on, “Da knew about what happened when ye were a bairn. He told us all about it. We were desperate enough to use it against ye.” Panting harder, his voice shakes. “Said it’d be perfect. No one would get hurt. We get the money. Then we disappear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie breaks into a coughing fit and my heart races.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore banging, then Nox yells, “Open the fucking door, Lily! Don’t make me break it down!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t hang up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEye prickling, I ask, “What then, Jamie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing deeply, he steadies his voice. “Then it changed. Jett started ta hide shit from me. He changed the password on our laptop, Lily. I couldn’t get in. Took the work phone away from me. Started listening on yer father’s conversations and asking about ye. A lot, girlie. I knew something wasn’t right, but I didn’t ken how much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie makes a choked noise, he whispers through tears. “He framed me, Lily. I swear it.” My entire body jolts as he roars, “The feckin’ twat framed me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears fall onto my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe isn’t lying. No way, no how. I whisper, “What does he want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice shakes, “Never about you, Lily. Never. He wants two things.” I wait patiently as he utters, “Money. And Terah. He’s on his way ta get her now. He knows where ye are, Lily. Don’t be fooled. He’s smarter than he shows. Ye need to get out of there. Get somewhere safe. He’s lost his mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy blood runs cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling, I screech, “Nox!” before breaking into sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, I kick away the chair that holds the door locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie starts to cough again, wheezing as he mutters, “He feckin’ killed me, Lil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice quakes as I ask, “What do you mean, Jamie? Where are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice weakens. “In my apartment, love. And it won’t be long now. I’ll be back with Da.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears fall freely down my cheeks and I shout, “You’re not going to die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie chuckles, “Oh, sweets, the two bullets in my chest tell me different.” Doubling over, I clutch my stomach, bawling as I listen to my dying friend. “Ye were the best thing about America, Lily. Never wanted ta live here, but I had to come. Yer da is a good man. And I loved him like he was my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore banging in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArms come around my waist, but I clutch the phone to my ear and whisper, “You’re going to be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Lil. I won’t. But I’m good with that. Get ta see Da.” His voice turns reverent. “Never had a sister before, Lil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body shakes violently with my tears. A second more and I hear the call disconnect. Panicked, I wail, “No!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m crumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox rocks me, but not before taking my cell and throwing it hard against the bathroom wall. It shatters into a hundred pieces and I sob while Nox holds me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween choked breaths, I tell him, “Jamie’s dying. They got it wrong. It’s Jett, not Jamie. He shot him, and now he’s going after Terah.” Closing my eyes, I whisper, “Don’t let him get her. Please, God. Don’t let him get her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening my eyes, I look at Nox through the mirror and say quietly, “He knows where I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox’s arms tighten around me. Offering false security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nineteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving on a Jett plane\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePandemonium. That’s the only word I could use to describe the hours after that call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRock yells on one cell while Nox barks orders through another, and Boo packs a bag full of my things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re leaving tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know where we’re going, but as long as I’m with Nox, I’ll be okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body trembles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not showing my true fear. Nox is stressed enough without having to deal with my BS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo stops what she’s doing at the sight of me. And I thought I was hiding it so well. She comes over and wraps her arms around me, and I let her. She whispers encouraging words that I don’t actually hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRock finishes up his call looking more than worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to Nox, he waits patiently for him to finish his call. Once off the phone, Nox barks, “Tell me something good, Rock. I couldn’t handle bad right now.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/willing-captive/page-22.html","bookId":2800,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:06 PM"}
