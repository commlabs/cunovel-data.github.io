He\u0027d made it to Reno with hours to spare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed a taxi. \"488 Center Lane Drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drove in silence. When they pulled up to the address, Matt stared out the window at the Eager Beaver. He paid the driver, got out, and headed inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFitting, he thought to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he had not expected 488 Center Lane Drive to be a strip joint, he was not all that surprised either. Olivia was missing something in all of this. He understood that. He even understood why. She wanted to find her child. It had blinded her a bit. She couldn\u0027t see what was so obvious to him: This was about more than an adoption or even a scam to extort money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all came back to the pictures on his camera phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027re the family with a sick daughter, you are not interested in making a husband jealous. If you\u0027re a lowlife crook after a big payday, you don\u0027t care about breaking up a marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this had to be about more than that. Matt wasn\u0027t sure what exactly, but he knew that it was something bad- something that made whoever was behind this want to drag them back to a place like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed inside and found a table in the corner. He looked around, hoping to see Olivia. He didn\u0027t. Three girls slowly undulated onstage. He tried to imagine his beautiful wife, the one who made everyone lucky enough to encounter her feel somehow blessed, up there like that. Oddly enough it wasn\u0027t that hard to picture. Rather than confusing him, something about Olivia\u0027s shocking confessions made it all click. It was why she had such a zest for things most found too ordinary, why she so badly wanted a family, a home, the life in the suburbs. She yearned for what we consider both our normalcy and our dream. He understood that better now. It made more sense to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat life. The life they were trying to make together. She was right: It was worth fighting for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA waitress came by and Matt asked for coffee. He needed the caffeine fix. She brought it over. It was surprisingly good. He sipped it and watched the girls and tried to put some of the facts together. Nothing was really coming to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and asked if there was a pay phone. The bouncer, a fat man with a pockmarked face, pointed with his thumb. Matt had a prepaid phone card. He always carried it- another holdover from what he\u0027d learned in the pen, he guessed. The truth was, you could trace a phone card. You could find out where it came from and even who bought it. Eventually. Best example was when prosecutors traced a call made with a phone card in the Oklahoma bombing case. But it took time. It could be used to prosecute, but Matt wasn\u0027t worried about that anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cell phone was off. If you keep it on, there are ways to figure out where you are. Cell-phone tracking, even without making a call, is a reality. He pressed in the digits for the 800 number, then his code, then Midlife\u0027s private line at the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ike Kier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say anything you don\u0027t want someone else to hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you do the talking, Ike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Olivia is okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they hold her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She\u0027s, uh, gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was good to hear. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on.\" He passed the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Cingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I talked to that investigator friend of yours. I hope you don\u0027t mind, but they had my ass over a barrel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing I said will hurt you anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt was looking off in the direction of the club\u0027s entrance. Cingle was telling him something else, something about Darrow and Talley, but there was a sudden rush in his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt almost dropped the phone when he saw who\u0027d just walked into the Eager Beaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Loren Muse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren Muse flashed her badge at the fat guy at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for one of your dancers. Her name is Kimmy Dale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat man just stared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So your ID says New Jersey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m still a law enforcement officer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat man shook his head. \"You\u0027re out of your jurisdiction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you, a lawyer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat man pointed at her. \"Good one. Bye, bye now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I\u0027m looking for Kimmy Dale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I said you have no jurisdiction here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to bring someone more local?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"If that gets you off, honey, do whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can make trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This.\" The fat man smiled and pointed at his own face. \"This is me scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren\u0027s cell phone rang. She took a step to the right. The music blared. She put the phone to her right ear and stuck a finger in her left. Her eyes squinted, as if that\u0027d make the connection better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to make a deal with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Matt Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m listening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I surrender to you and only you. We go somewhere and wait until at least one in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why one in the morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think I killed Darrow or Talley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re certainly wanted for questioning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t ask you that. I asked you if you think I killed them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. \"No, Matt. I don\u0027t think you have anything to do with it. But I think your wife does. I know her real name. I know she\u0027s been hiding and running for a long time. I think that Max Darrow somehow figured out that she was still alive. I think they went after her and that somehow you got caught in the middle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Olivia is innocent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That,\" Loren said, \"I\u0027m not sure about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My deal still stands. I surrender to you. We go somewhere else and talk this out until one in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somewhere else? You don\u0027t even know where I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Matt said. \"I know exactly where you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a click. Damn, he hung up. She was about to dial in for an immediate trace when she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned and he was standing right there, as if he\u0027d just materialized out of thin air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Matt said. \"Was I smart to trust you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-54.html","bookId":1557,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM"}
