You know that\u0027s kinda weird, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before I could defend myself, DeeDee said, \"I think that\u0027s really nice.\" Making it infinitely more difficult to hate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what do you say?\" Dillon asked, turning back to Josh. He sounded almost giddy, and can I just say, giddy is not an expression that most boys wear well. \"Wanna TP the grounds or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Josh didn\u0027t answer. Instead, he was pushing DeeDee out of the booth and pulling money out of his wallet. He dropped the bills on the table, then reached for my hand. \"You wanna leave, too. Right?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! I wanted to cry. I read his face. I knew what he was feeling, and I was feeling it, too. I took his hand, and it was as if he were helping me into another world instead of out of a red-vinyl booth. The two hamburgers lay, barely touched, on the table behind us, but I didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon got up and let me out, but Josh didn\u0027t drop my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWE WERE HOLDING HANDS!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started pulling me toward the door, but a girl doesn\u0027t forget three years of culture training just like that, so I turned to Dillon and DeeDee and muttered, \"Bye. It was nice meeting you.\" Total lie, but one even non-spies tell in polite society, so it probably doesn\u0027t count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon yelled, \"Whoa,\" in the manner of someone who\u0027s seen way too many Keanu Reeves movies. \"You\u0027re missing out, bro. We\u0027re gonna mess with some rich chicks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, D\u0027Man, I thought, as Josh opened the door. Why don\u0027t you go ahead and try it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, normally, I\u0027m not a huge fan of hand-holding, but that\u0027s really just in movies when the hero and the heroine have to run from the bad guys, and they do it while holding hands, which is just crazy. No one can run as fast when they\u0027re holding someone else\u0027s hand. (A fact I once verified in a P\u0026amp;E experiment.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Josh and I weren\u0027t running. Oh, no. We were strolling. Our joined hands kind of swayed back and forth as if we were about to ask Red Rover to send someone on over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long time, he looked down at the street and said, \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" I honestly couldn\u0027t think of one thing he\u0027d done wrong. Not one thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jerked his head back toward the diner. \"Dillon. He\u0027s really not that bad,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve been having that same conversation since kindergarten. He\u0027s big on the talk—not so much on the action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we don\u0027t need to go warn the Gallagher Academy, then?\" I teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said, smiling. \"I think they\u0027re safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said, \"they probably are.\" I thought about our walls—our world. \"And DeeDee?\" I asked and felt my breath catch. \"She seems sweet.\" Sadly, not a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is, but\"—his hand tightened around mine—\"I don\u0027t want to talk about DeeDee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was the twinkle lights of the gazebo or the way Josh\u0027s hand felt in mine, or perhaps it was the exposure to Dr. Fibs\u0027s purple sneezing gas I\u0027d had earlier in the day, but when we stopped walking, everything got really, really whirly, like the whole world was a merry-go-round and Josh and I were standing in the center. There must have been all kinds of centripetal force, because we were getting closer and closer together, and before I knew it, something I\u0027d been dreaming about my whole life was happening. But I\u0027m not going to write about it here, because—seriously— my mother is going to read this! Plus, all kinds of VIPs are probably going to commission this report, and they seriously don\u0027t need to hear about my first kiss. (Oh, jeez! I didn\u0027t mean to say that….) So, okay, Josh kissed me. I know some of you might want details—like how soft his lips were, and how, as I breathed out, he breathed in and vice versa so that it seemed we were permanently joined at the soul or something…. But I\u0027m not going to tell you those parts. No way. They\u0027re private.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I will say that it was everything it was supposed to be—warm and sweet and very much the beginning of … well…just the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eighteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePros and cons of being a girl-genius-slash-spy-in-training-slash-girlfriend of cutest-slash-nicest-slash-sweetest boy in the world:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: ability to tell the boy how you feel in any of fourteen different languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: boy cannot understand any of the languages (well, except English, of course, but even then he speaks with the highly specialized and often untranslatable \"boy\" dialect).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: when boy is having trouble with his chemistry project, you can meet him at the library and help him study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: you can\u0027t help him too much because it\u0027s kind of hard to explain how you\u0027re doing PhD-level chemistry in the tenth grade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: the look on your boyfriend\u0027s face when he surprises you with an assortment of cat toys and asks, \"Do you think Suzie will like them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: knowing there is no Suzie, and you can never tell him that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree weeks later I was sitting in the Grand Hall, listening to my classmates talk about how they were going to use their Saturday night to catch up on movies (or homework … but mostly movies), when Liz came in and dropped about a dozen textbooks on the table so hard my fork jumped off my plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready for this?\" she said, her voice reverberating with glee. \"We\u0027ve got a little Chang, a little Mulvaney, a lot of Strendesky, some—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liz,\" I said, really hating what had to come next. \"Oh, gee, Liz, I thought you knew…I\u0027ve got plans with—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh,\" she finished for me. She picked up a copy of A Mayan\u0027s Guide to Molecular Regeneration that had fallen to the floor and added it to the top of the stack. \"This project\u0027s due on Wednesday, Cam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s thirty percent of our midterm grade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027m gonna work on it…\" But I didn\u0027t know when. I hadn\u0027t thought about it once since Dr. Fibs assigned it three weeks ago—the Monday after my first date with Josh. I was taking life one day, one outfit, one date at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grand Hall was starting to empty as some girls went to grab dessert and others headed upstairs or outside. I glanced at my watch and got up. \"Look, Josh has got something planned, okay? It\u0027s this whole surprise thing he\u0027s been talking about and … I think it\u0027s a big deal. It\u0027ll be okay. I\u0027ll do the project tomorrow.\" That was what I\u0027d said yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Liz didn\u0027t remind me of that. She just nodded and told me to be careful as I dashed out of the Grand Hall and toward the library, where, if you push against the D-F shelf while pulling on a copy of Downing\u0027s Modem Uses for Ancient Weapons, you can slip into my second favorite passageway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is, unless Mr. Solomon is in the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Ms. Morgan,\" Mr. Solomon said, stopping me in my tracks. I\u0027m pretty sure he doesn\u0027t know about any of the secret passageways—especially that one, since it took me two full years to find it—but still it totally freaked me out to turn around and see him standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what are you up to this fine evening?\" He shoved both hands into his pockets, then leaned forward. \"Hot date?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m pretty sure that was Joe Solomon\u0027s attempt at male-role-model humor, but it still didn\u0027t stop me from making a noise that sounded like hahahahahaha. Yeah. I know. How covert am I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I was just… Um …\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, kiddo,\" I heard from behind me. \"Were you looking for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe library is probably my favorite room in the mansion. It has a huge stone fireplace in the middle of a two-story circular space that\u0027s filled with study tables and big comfy armchairs. Overhead, a second-story balcony overlooks everything, and that\u0027s where I saw my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started down the stairs, a book of poetry in her hands, and I thought she looked like the most beautiful thing I\u0027d ever seen. She reached the main floor and slipped her arm around me. \"I was just coming to find you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, you were?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I remembered Joe Solomon who was standing there, looking on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then,\" he said, taking a step toward the door. \"I\u0027ll leave you two girls alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I\u0027m not sure, but I think my mom could totally take Joe Solomon, and as soon as he called her a \"girl\" I thought for sure I\u0027d see the proof. But Mom didn\u0027t say anything. She didn\u0027t pin his arm behind his back or jump into the air and slash him across the face with one of her high-heeled black boots (a move I totally want to perfect someday—just as soon as I can borrow those boots). Oh, no, she just smiled at him. Like a Thanks, I can take it from here smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sick. She pulled me into the hall and walked with me toward the chapel. Behind me, I heard the scrape of forks on plates and dinner chatter (in Farsi) as we passed the Great Hall. She looped her arm through mine and said, \"I was wondering if you wanted to do something tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so I know I have lots of different languages at my disposal and everything, but I honestly didn\u0027t understand what my mother was asking. It was weird— not like Nazi-submarine-in-the-lake weird, but someone\u0027s-been-watching-too-many-made-for-TV-movies weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or not,\" she jumped to say when she read my bewildered expression. \"I just thought you might want to go into town or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, actually, I did want to go to town—just not with her. In fact, I was already wearing lipstick, and an outfit was stashed in the tunnel. Josh had sounded so excited when he\u0027d said, \"Now, you\u0027re coming Saturday night, right? You don\u0027t have to do something with your parents, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d said no, but now my mother was asking me to do just that. I looked into her eyes—her beautiful eyes that have seen horrors and miracles and all things in between, and then I said, \"I\u0027m pretty tired.\" Technically not a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something low-key, then,\" she said with all her super-spy persistence. \"Maybe a movie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I…\" I am a terrible person. \"I… See, I\u0027ve got to …\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I heard a voice behind me. \"Cammie promised to help me with my organic chemistry paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to see Macey McHenry strolling my way. Her face was blank, her tone perfectly normal. Macey might have been behind the curve academically, but when it came to the lyin\u0027 side of spyin\u0027, the girl was a natural. (And the fact that Tina Walters swears she hijacked a sheik\u0027s yacht in the Mediterranean probably played into that a little bit.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom looked at Macey and then back at me. \"Oh,\" she said, but her smile seemed a little forced and her tone a little sad as she lowered her voice and rubbed my arms. \"Okay. I just didn\u0027t want you to be alone tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone? When am I ever alone? I live in a mansion with about a hundred girls, and except for when I\u0027m in my secret room or one of the window seats or by myself in the loft of the P\u0026amp;E barn or … Okay, so sometimes I\u0027m alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey slipped away, and Mom watched her go. \"I know it hasn\u0027t been easy … with her. But I\u0027m proud of you, kiddo.\" She hugged me again. It was a hug that lingered, like there might not be another one for a long, long time, and I wished for a second that I didn\u0027t have to pull away so soon. Or ever. But I did anyway. Josh was waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Supper?\" I asked. \"Tomorrow night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure thing, kiddo,\" Mom said as she tucked a stray strand of hair behind my ear. I turned and headed down the corridor, my footsteps thankfully louder than my thoughts. That is, until I turned the corner in the long stone corridor and ran right into Macey. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-22.html","bookId":2746,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:34 PM"}
