But the theory is easy to understand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt runs: the sea is, after all, in many respects only a wetter form of air. And it is known that air is denser the lower you go and lighter the higher you fly. As a storm-tossed ship founders and sinks, therefore, it must reach a depth where the water below it is just viscous enough to stop its fall.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn short, it stops sinking and ends up floating on an underwater surface, beyond the reach of the storms but far above the ocean floor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eItâ€™s calm there. Dead calm.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSome stricken ships have rigging; some even have sails. Many still have crew, tangled in the rigging or lashed to the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut the voyages still continue, aimlessly, with no harbour in sight, because there are currents under the ocean and so the dead ships with their skeleton crews sail on around the world, over sunken cities and between drowned mountains, until rot and shipworms eat them away and they disintegrate.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSometimes an anchor drops, all the way to the dark, cold calmness of the abyssal plain, and disturbs the stillness of centuries by throwing up a cloud of silt.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne nearly hit Anghammarad, where he sat watching the ships drift by, far overhead.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered it, because it was the only really interesting thing to happen for nine thousand years.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/339/621.html","bookId":331,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:37:53 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:37:53 AM"}
