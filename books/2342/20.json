You guys are in a big hurry, and we think we\u0027re dealing with a consistent MO, so all I did was look at the questions that the first three left behind. I mean, we all know what it isn\u0027t, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t everything, far as we know,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. No blunt trauma, no gunshots, no stab wounds, no poison, no strangulation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely moved a complete circle around the table and sat down at an empty chair, on his own, three seats from Poulton and two from Reacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she drown?\" Poulton asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely shook his head. \"No, just like the first three didn\u0027t. I took a look at her lungs, and they were completely clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what is it?\" Blake asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I told you,\" Stavely said. \"You stop the heart, or you deny oxygen to the brain. So first, I looked at her heart. And her heart was perfect. Completely undamaged. Same as the other three. And these were fit women. Great hearts. It\u0027s easier to spot the damage on a good heart. An older person might have a bad heart, with preexisting damage, you know, furring or scarring from previous cardiac trouble, and that can hide new damage. But these were perfect hearts, like athletes. Any trauma, it would have stuck out a mile. But there wasn\u0027t any. So he didn\u0027t stop their hearts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he denied them oxygen,\" Stavely said. \"It\u0027s the only remaining possibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s the big question, isn\u0027t it? Theoretically he could have sealed off the bathroom and pumped the oxygen out and replaced it with some inert gas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake shook his head. \"That\u0027s absurd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it is,\" Stavely said. \"He\u0027d have needed equipment, pumps, tanks of gas. And we\u0027d have found residue in the tissues. Certainly in the lungs. There aren\u0027t any gases we wouldn\u0027t have detected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he choked off their airways. It\u0027s the only possibility. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said there are no signs of strangulation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely nodded. \"There aren\u0027t. That\u0027s what got me interested. Strangulation normally leaves massive trauma to the neck. All kinds of bruising, internal bleeding. It sticks out a mile. Same for garroting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something called gentle strangulation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gentle?\" Harper said. \"Awful phrase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Poulton asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A guy with a big arm,\" Stavely said. \"Or a padded coat sleeve. Gentle consistent pressure, that will do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So is that it?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely shook his head. \"No, it isn\u0027t. No external marks, but to get far enough to kill them, you leave internal damage. The hyoid bone would be broken, for instance. Certainly cracked, at least. Other ligament damage too. It\u0027s a very fragile area. The voice box is there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re going to tell me there was no damage, I guess,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing gross,\" Stavely said. \"Did she have a cold, when you met with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Harper, but Reacher answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sore throat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Husky voice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seemed pretty healthy to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely nodded. Looked pleased. \"There was some very, very slight swelling inside the throat. It\u0027s what you\u0027d get recovering from a head cold. Mucus drip might do it, or a very mild strep virus. Ninety-nine times in a hundred, I\u0027d ignore it completely. But the other three had it too. That\u0027s a little coincidental for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what does it mean?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means he pushed something down their throats,\" Stavely said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down their throats?\" Blake repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely nodded. \"That was my guess. Something soft, something which would slip down and then expand a little. Maybe a sponge. Were there sponges in the bathrooms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see one in Spokane,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoulton was back in the piles of paper. \"Nothing on the inventories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he removed them,\" Harper said. \"He took their clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bathrooms without sponges,\" Blake said slowly. \"Like the dog that didn\u0027t bark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Reacher said. \"There wasn\u0027t a sponge before, is what I meant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"Totally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he brings one with him,\" Harper said. \"The type he prefers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake looked away, back to Stavely. \"So that\u0027s how he\u0027s doing it? Sponges down their throats?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely stared at his big red hands, resting on the tabletop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has to be,\" he said. \"Sponges, or something similar. Like Sherlock Holmes, right? First you eliminate the impossible, and whatever you\u0027re left with, however improbable, has got to be the answer. So the guy is choking them to death by pushing something soft down their throats. Something soft enough not to cause blunt trauma internally, but something dense enough to block the air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded, slowly. \"OK, so now we know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely shook his head. \"Well, no, we don\u0027t. Because it\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely just shrugged miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here, Harper,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him, surprised. Then she smiled briefly and stood up and scraped her chair back and walked toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show, don\u0027t tell, right?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lie on the table, OK?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled again and sat on the edge of the table and swiveled into position. Reacher pulled Poulton\u0027s pile of paper over and pushed it under her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Comfortable?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and fanned her hair and lay back like she was at the dentist. Pulled her jacket closed over her shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Reacher said. \"She\u0027s Alison Lamarr in the tub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the top sheet of paper out from under her head and glanced at it. It was the inventory from Caroline Cooke\u0027s bathroom. He crumpled it into a ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a sponge,\" he said. Then he glanced at Blake. \"Not that there was one in the room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He brought it with him,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waste of time if he did,\" Reacher said. \"Because watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the crumpled paper to Harper\u0027s lips. She clamped them tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I get her to open her mouth?\" he asked. \"In the full and certain knowledge that what I\u0027m doing is going to kill her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned close and used his left hand under her chin, his fingers and thumb up on her cheeks. \"I could squeeze, I guess. Or I could clamp her nose until she had to breathe. But what would she do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This,\" Harper said, and threw a playful roundhouse right which caught Reacher high on the temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" he said. \"Two seconds from now, we\u0027re fighting, and there\u0027s a gallon of paint on the floor. Another gallon all over me. To get anywhere with this, I\u0027d have to get right in the tub with her, behind her or on top of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right,\" Stavely said. \"It\u0027s just impossible. They\u0027d be fighting for their lives. No way to force something into somebody\u0027s mouth against their will, without leaving bruises on their cheeks, their jaws, all over them. Flesh would tear against their teeth, their lips would be bruised and cut, maybe the teeth themselves would loosen. And they\u0027d be biting and scratching and kicking. Traces under their nails. Bruised knuckles. Defensive injuries. It would be a fight to the death, right? And there\u0027s no evidence of fighting. None at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he drugged them,\" Blake said. \"Made them passive, you know, like that date-rape thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody was drugged,\" he said. \"Toxicology is absolutely clear, all four cases.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room went silent again and Reacher pulled Harper upright by the hands. She slid off the table and dusted herself down. Walked back to her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ve got no conclusions?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely shrugged. \"Like I said, I\u0027ve got a great conclusion. But it\u0027s an impossible conclusion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, this is a very smart guy,\" Reacher said. \"Too smart for you. Way too smart. Four homicides, and you still don\u0027t know how he\u0027s doing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s the answer, smart guy?\" Blake said. \"You going to tell us something four of the nation\u0027s best pathologists can\u0027t tell us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the answer?\" Blake asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. You don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027ll find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, like how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy. I\u0027ll go find the guy, and I\u0027ll ask him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORTY-ONE MILES AWAY, slightly east of north, the colonel was two miles from his office, after a ten-mile journey. He had taken the shuttle bus from the Pentagon\u0027s parking lot and gotten off near the Capitol. Then he had hailed a cab and headed back over the river to the National Airport\u0027s main terminal. His uniform was in a leather one-suiter slung on his shoulder, and he was cruising the ticket counters at the busiest time of day, completely anonymous in a teeming crush of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want Portland, Oregon,\" he said. \"Open roundtrip, coach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA clerk entered the code for Portland and his computer told him he had plenty of availability on the next nonstop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leaves in two hours,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" the colonel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"YOU THINK YOU\u0027LL find the guy?\" Blake repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"I\u0027ll have to, won\u0027t I? It\u0027s the only way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence in the conference room for a moment. Then Stavely stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, good luck to you, sir,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked out of the room and closed the door softly behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t find the guy,\" Poulton said. \"Because you\u0027re wrong about Caroline Cooke. She never served in ordnance warehousing or weapons testing. She proves your theory is shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher smiled. \"Do I know all about FBI procedures? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So don\u0027t talk to me about the Army. Cooke was an officer candidate. Fast-track type. Had to be, to finish up in War Plans. People like that, they send them all over the place first, getting an overview. That summary you\u0027ve got in your file is incomplete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"Has to be. If they listed everywhere she was posted, you\u0027d have ten pages before she made first lieutenant. You check back with Defense, get the details, you\u0027ll find she was someplace that could tie her in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence came back. There was a faint rush from the forced-air heating and a buzz from a failing fluorescent tube. A high-pitched whistle from the silent television. That was all. Nothing else. Poulton stared at Blake. Harper stared at Reacher. Blake looked down at his fingers, which were tapping on the table with silent fleshy impacts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you find him?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody\u0027s got to,\" Reacher said. \"You guys aren\u0027t getting anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll need resources.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"A little help would be nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027m gambling here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better than putting all your chips behind a loser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m gambling big-time. With a lot at stake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like your career?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven women, not my career.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven women and your career.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded, vaguely. \"What are the odds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shrugged. \"With three weeks to do it in? It\u0027s a certainty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re an arrogant bastard, you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m realistic, is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you need?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remuneration,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to get paid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I do.
