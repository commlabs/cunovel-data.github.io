He didn’t want me, Daisy. You seem to be forgetting that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course he wants you. For Tony it’s a matter of pride to keep two women in love with him. Don’t kid yourself. His ego eats it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s married.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy snorted. “When has that ever stopped a man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure you’re wrong.” Here she was defending him again although she didn’t even know what he wanted from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, sweetie, you might have a college degree, but when it comes to men, you’re as naive as those kids you teach. Why do you think Tony didn’t want you transferring to another school? He wants to keep his eye on you. Trust me, the minute you show any interest in another man, he’ll be there like stink on—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I get the picture, Daisy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, but do you get the message?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley gnawed at her lip. “I think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy lowered the aluminum shield. She turned her head to look at Lesley. “You’re afraid, aren’t you? Afraid of what’ll happen if you call Tony back.” Lesley nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you still in love with that jerk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more she nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Lesley, you idiot. You don’t need him, not when you’ve got someone like Chase. He’s crazy about you, but he isn’t stupid. He’s not going to ram his head against a brick wall, and who could blame him? Not me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hardly know Chase.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What more do you need to know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daisy, he’s looking for a wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what?” Her neighbor asked impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not in love with Chase.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you like him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I do. Otherwise I wouldn’t continue to see him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you expecting, sweetie? This guy is manna from heaven. If you want to spend the rest of your life mooning over Tony, feel free. As far as I’m concerned, that guy’s going to do his best to make you miserable for as long as he can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chase is from Alaska,” Lesley argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So? You don’t have any family here. There’s nothing holding you back other than Tony, is there? Is a married man worth all that grief, Lesley?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” How small her voice sounded, how uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to lose Chase?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know? Sometimes I want to clobber you, Lesley. Where do you think you’d ever find another man as good as Chase? But if that doesn’t concern you, then far be it from me to point out the obvious.” She swung her legs from the chaise longue. “If you want my advice, I’d say go for it and marry the guy. I doubt that you’ll be sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley wished she could be as sure of that, but she wasn’t. She wasn’t even sure how she was going to get through another night without calling Tony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase forced himself to relax. He wasn’t being fair to the women he’d interviewed. He tried, heaven knew he’d tried, to concentrate on what they’d said, but it hadn’t worked, not in a single case. And this had been going on for several days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d ask a question, listen intently for the first minute or two, and then his mind would drift. What irritated him most was the subject that dominated his thoughts so completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in love with Tony, although she was struggling to hide it. Not from him, but from herself. All the signs were there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he had more time, he might have a chance with Lesley. But he didn’t. Even if he could afford a couple of months to court her, it might not be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best thing, the only thing, he could do was accept that whatever they’d so briefly had was over, cut his losses and do what he could to make up for wasted time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the last of them for this evening,” Sandra said, letting herself into the room. The door clicked softly behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” He was exhausted to the bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got appointments starting first thing tomorrow morning. Are you sure you’re up to this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, although he wasn’t sure of anything. He could hardly keep the faces and the stories straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra hesitated. “Has anyone caught your fancy yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase chuckled, not because he found her question amusing, but because he was susceptible to one of the most basic human flaws—wanting what he couldn’t have. He wanted Lesley. “The woman I’d like to marry is in love with someone else and won’t marry me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t that the way it generally works?” Sandra offered sympathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It must,” he said, stretching out his legs and crossing them at the ankles. He wasn’t accustomed to so much sitting and was getting restless. The city was beginning to wear on him, too, and the thought of his cabin on the tundra became more appealing by the minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there one woman who’s stuck out in your mind?” He motioned for Sandra to sit down and she did, taking the chair across from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A couple,” she said. “Do you remember Anna Lincoln and LaDonna Ransom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase didn’t, not immediately. “Describe them to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“LaDonna’s that petite blonde you saw yesterday evening, the one who’s working in the King County Assessor’s office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTry as he might, Chase couldn’t recall the woman, not when there’d been so many. There’d been several blondes, and countless faces and little that made one stand out over another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I hesitate to recommend her. She’s a fragile little thing, and I don’t know how well she’d adjust to winters that far north. Seattle’s climate is temperate and nothing like what you experience. But…she was sweet, and I think you’d grow to love her, given the opportunity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Anna Lincoln?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We chatted for a bit before the interview and she seemed to be a nice girl. Ambitious, too. Of course there was the one drawback.” Sandra shrugged. “She’s not very pretty, at least not when you compare her to a lot of the other women who’ve applied.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beauty doesn’t count for much as far as I’m concerned. I’m not exactly a movie star myself, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra must have felt obliged to argue with him because she made something of a fuss, contradicting him. By the time she’d finished, she had him sounding like he should consider running for Mr. Universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At any rate, I liked Anna and I think she’d suit you. If you want I’ll get her file.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra left and returned a couple of minutes later with the file. Chase was reading it over when she said good-night. He waved absently as he scanned the application and his few notes. There wasn’t a picture enclosed, which might have jogged his memory. The details she’d written down about herself described at least twenty other women he’d interviewed in the past few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set the file aside and relaxed, leaning back in his chair, wondering if Anna’s lips were as soft and pliable as Lesley’s, or if she fit in his arms as though she’d been made for him. Probably not. No use trying to fool himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reread the information and, exhaling sharply with defeat, set aside the file. At the rate things were going, he’d return to Twin Creeks without the bride he’d come to find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lori?” Lesley was so excited to find her friend at home that her voice rose unnaturally high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lesley? Hi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, yourself. I’ve been waiting to hear from you. We were going to get together this week, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were? Oh, right, I did say I’d call you, didn’t I? I’m sorry, I haven’t had a chance. Oh, Les, you’ll never guess what happened. Larry asked me to marry him!” She let out a scream that sounded as though she were being strangled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lori!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, I’ve got to stop doing that, but every time I think of Larry and me together, I get so excited I can hardly stand it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You haven’t been dating him that long, have you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Long enough. I’m crazy about this guy, Lesley, and for once in my life I’ve found a man who feels the same way about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Congratulations!” Lesley put as much punch into the word as she could. She was thrilled for Lori, and wished her fellow teacher and Larry every happiness. But in the same breath, in the same heartbeat, she was so jealous she wanted to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruth demanded a price and being honest with herself had taken its toll on Lesley all week. First, she’d been forced to admit she still loved Tony, despite all her efforts to put him out of her life. It was hopeless, useless and masochistic. She didn’t need Daisy to tell her she was setting herself up for heartache. Not when she could see it herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the temptation, she hadn’t returned Tony’s calls. However, it wasn’t her sense of honor that had prompted her forbearance, nor had it been her sense of right and wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood old-fashioned fear was what kept her away from the phone. Fear of what she might do if Tony admitted he’d made a mistake and wanted her back in his life. Fear of what she might become if he came to her, claiming he loved her, needed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the heels of this painful insight came the news of Lori’s engagement. Now she and Jo Ann were the only two single women left at the school. And Jo Ann didn’t count, not technically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJo Ann had separated from her husband a year earlier and she’d taken back her maiden name. But recently they’d been talking. It wouldn’t surprise Lesley if the two of them decided to make another go of their marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Lori was engaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Larry wants a short engagement, which is fine with me,” she was saying. “I’d like it if we could have the wedding before school starts this fall, and he’s agreed. You’ll be one of my bridesmaids, won’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d be honored.” That would make six times now that Lesley had stood up for friends. What was that old saying? Always a bridesmaid, never a bride. It certainly applied in her case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the fall she’d be returning to the same school, the same classroom, the one directly down from Tony’s. April’s class was on the other side of the building. They’d all return, enthusiastic about the new school year, eager to get started after the long break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony would glance at her with that special look in his eyes and she wouldn’t be able to glance away. He’d know in a heartbeat that she still loved him, and worse, so would April and everyone else on staff. That humiliation far outweighed the likelihood of being the only unmarried faculty member.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley knew she never should’ve let Tony talk her out of transferring to another school. Perhaps she’d asked for another assignment just so he’d beg her to stay; she didn’t know anymore, didn’t trust herself or her motives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Larry talked to my dad and formally asked for my hand in marriage,” Lori was saying when Lesley pulled her thoughts back to her friend. “He’s so traditional and sweet. It’s funny, Les, but when it’s right, it’s right, and you know it in your gut. It wouldn’t have mattered if we’d dated three months or three years.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-42.html","bookId":1964,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM"}
