I said, with a smile, “Can it be that the American people are not so dead to art after all?” But then I observed that the crowd seemed to be swaying this way and that; also there seemed to be a great many men in army uniforms. “Hello!” I exclaimed. “A row?” \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a clamor of shouting; the army men seemed to be pulling and pushing the civilians. When we got nearer, I asked of a bystander, “What\u0027s up?” The answer was: “They don\u0027t want \u0027em to go in to see the picture.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why not?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s German. Hun propaganda!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now you must understand, I had helped to win a war, and no man gets over such an experience at once. I had a flash of suspicion, and glanced at my companion, the cultured literary critic from Berlin. Could it possibly be that this smooth-spoken gentleman was playing a trick upon me—trying, possibly, to get something into my crude American mind without my realizing what was happening? But I remembered his detailed account of the production, the very essence of “art for art\u0027s sake.” I decided that the war was three years over, and I was competent to do my own thinking.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dr. Henner spoke first. “I think,” he said, “it might be wiser if I did not try to go in there.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Absurd!” I cried. “I\u0027m not going to be dictated to by a bunch of imbeciles!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No,” said the other, “you are an American, and don\u0027t have to be. But I am a German, and I must learn.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I noted the flash of bitterness, but did not resent it. “That\u0027s all nonsense, Dr. Henner!” I argued. “You are my guest, and I won\u0027t—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Listen, my friend,” said the other. “You can doubtless get by without trouble; but I would surely rouse their anger, and I have no mind to be beaten for nothing. I have seen the picture several times, and can talk about it with you just as well.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You make me ashamed of myself,” I cried—“and of my country!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, no! It is what you should expect. It is what I had in mind when I spoke of the surgeon contracting the disease. We German intellectuals know what war means; we are used to things like this.” Suddenly he put out his hand. “Good-bye.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will go with you!” I exclaimed. But he protested—that would embarrass him greatly. I would please to stay, and see the picture; he would be interested later on to hear my opinion of it. And abruptly he turned, and walked off, leaving me hesitating and angry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At last I started towards the entrance of the theatre. One of the men in uniform barred my way. “No admittance here!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But why not?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s a German show, and we aint a-goin\u0027 to allow it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now see here, buddy,” I countered, none too good-naturedly, “I haven\u0027t got my uniform on, but I\u0027ve as good a right to it as you; I was all through the Argonne.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, what do you want to see Hun propaganda for?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Maybe I want to see what it\u0027s like.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, you can\u0027t go in; we\u0027re here to shut up this show!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I had stepped to one side as I spoke, and he caught me by the arm. I thought there had been talk enough, and gave a sudden lurch, and tore my arm free. “Hold on here!” he shouted, and tried to stop me again; but I sprang through the crowd towards the box-office. There were more than a hundred civilians in or about the lobby, and not more than twenty or thirty ex-service men maintaining the blockade; so a few got by, and I was one of the lucky ones. I bought my ticket, and entered the theatre. To the man at the door I said: “Who started this?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t know, sir. It\u0027s just landed on us, and we haven\u0027t had time to find out.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is the picture German propaganda?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nothing like that at all, sir. They say they won\u0027t let us show German pictures, because they\u0027re so much cheaper; they\u0027ll put American-made pictures out of business, and it\u0027s unfair competition.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh!” I exclaimed, and light began to dawn. I recalled Dr. Henner\u0027s remark about producing a great many ideas out of a very little food; assuredly, the American picture industry had cause to fear competition of that sort! I thought of old “T-S,” as the screen people call him for short—the king of the movie world, with his roll of fat hanging over his collar, and his two or three extra chins! I though of Mary Magna, million dollar queen of the pictures, contriving diets and exercises for herself, and weighing with fear and trembling every day!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3227/88107.html","bookId":699,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 8:57:59 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 8:57:59 AM"}
