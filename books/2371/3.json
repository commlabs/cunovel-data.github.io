Bread lines had increased and unemployment was pandemic. There were riots in the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had graduated from Marshall Field grammar school in Chicago, and had a job at Afremow\u0027s drugstore. Natalie was working as a cashier at a roller derby, a new craze that took place in large roller dome arenas with huge circular wooden rinks where intrepid men on roller skates raced around the rink, knocking down their rivals and committing as much mayhem as they could while the audience cheered them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtto, meanwhile, was traveling around the country putting together his hypothetical mega-deals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntermittently, he would come home from the road filled with enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a good feeling about this. I just made a deal that\u0027s going to put us on easy street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we would pack up and move to Hammond, or Dallas, or Kirkland Junction, in Arizona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kirkland Junction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll love it there,\" Otto promised. \"I bought a silver mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirkland turned out to be a small town, 104 miles from Phoenix, but that was not our destination. Kirkland Junction was a dilapidated gas station, and we ended up living in the back of it for three miserable months while Otto tried to corner the silver market. It turned out that there was no silver in the mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were saved by a phone call from Uncle Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s the silver mine?\" Harry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not good,\" Otto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it. I\u0027m in Denver. I have a great stock brokerage company going. I want you to join me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re on our way,\" Otto told him. He hung up and turned to Natalie, Richard, and me. \"We\u0027re moving to Denver. I have a good feeling about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenver turned out to be a delight. It was pristine and beautiful, with cool breezes sweeping down from the snowcapped mountains through the city. I loved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry and Pauline had found a luxurious, two-story mansion in an elegant section of Denver. The back of their home looked out on an enormous, verdant piece of land called Cheeseman Park. My cousins, Seymour, Howard, Eddie, and Steve, were glad to see us, and we were delighted to see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour was driving a bright red Pierce Arrow and dating girls older than himself. Eddie had been given a saddle horse for his birthday. Howard was winning junior tennis matches. The moneyed atmosphere in their lives was a far cry from our dreary existence in Chicago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going to live with Harry and Pauline?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" They had a surprise for me. \"We\u0027re going to buy a home here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I saw the house they were going to buy, I could hardly believe it. It was large, with a lovely garden, in a quiet suburb on Marion Street. The rooms were large, beautiful, and welcoming. The furniture was fresh and lovely, far different from the musty furniture in the apartments I had lived in all my life. This was more than a house. This was a home. The moment I walked in the front door, I felt that my life had changed, that I finally had roots. There would be no more moving around the country every few months, changing apartments and schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtto is going to buy this house. I\u0027m going to get married here and my children will grow up here . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in my memory, money was plentiful. Harry\u0027s business was doing so well that he now owned three brokerage firms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the fall of 1930, at the age of thirteen, I enrolled at East High School and it turned out to be a very pleasant experience. The teachers in Denver were friendly and helpful. There was no throwing of inkwells at students. I was starting to make friends at school, and I enjoyed the thought of going home to the beautiful house that was soon to be ours. Natalie and Otto seemed to have settled most of their personal problems, which made life even sweeter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, during a gym class, I slipped, hurt my spine, and tore something loose. The pain was excruciating. I lay on the floor, unable to move. They carried me to the school doctor\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was through examining me, I asked, \"Am I going to be crippled?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he assured me. \"One of your discs has torn loose and it\u0027s pressing against your spinal cord. That\u0027s what\u0027s causing the pain. The treatment is very simple. All you have to do is lie still in bed for two or three days with hot packs to relax the muscles, and the disc will slip back into place. You\u0027ll be as good as new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ambulance took me home and the paramedics put me to bed. I lay there in pain, but just as the doctor had said, in three days the pain was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea how deeply this incident was going to affect the rest of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day I had an out-of-this-world experience. There was an advertisement for a county fair in Denver, where one of the attractions was a ride in an airplane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to go up,\" I told Otto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about it. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane was a beautiful Lincoln Commander and it was a thrill just to get in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot looked at me and said, \"First time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fasten your seatbelt,\" he said. \"You\u0027re in for a thrill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. Flying was a surreal experience. I watched the earth swoop up and down and disappear, and I had never felt anything so exhilarating in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we landed, I said to Otto, \"I want to go up again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I did. I was determined that someday I was going to be a pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly one morning in the spring of 1933, Otto came into my bedroom. His face was grim. \"Pack your things. We\u0027re leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was puzzled. \"Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going back to Chicago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not believe it. \"We\u0027re leaving Denver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got dressed and went to see Natalie. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father and Harry had a - a misunderstanding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around at the home that I thought I was going to live in for the rest of my life. \"What about this house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not buying it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur return to Chicago was joyless. Neither Otto nor Natalie wanted to talk about what had happened. After Denver, Chicago seemed even more unfriendly and uncaring. We moved into a small apartment and I was back to reality, a grim reminder that we had no money, and that a decent job was impossible to get. Otto was on the road again and Natalie was working as a salesclerk at a department store. My dream of going to college died. There was no money for my tuition. The apartment walls were closing in on me. Everything smelled gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t spend the rest of my life living this way, I thought. The poverty we lived in now seemed even worse after the brief, heady taste of affluence in Denver, and we were desperately short of money. Working as a delivery boy for a pharmacy was not my future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when I had decided I would commit suicide, and Otto had talked me out of it by telling me I had to keep turning the pages. But the pages were not turning and I had nothing to look forward to. Otto\u0027s promise had been empty words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen September came around, I enrolled at Senn High School. Otto was on the road again, trying to make mega-deals. Natalie was working full-time at a dress shop, but not enough money was coming in. I had to find a way to help . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Natalie\u0027s older brother, Sam, and the checkroom concessions he owned at several hotels in the Loop. The checkrooms were staffed with attractive, scantily-dressed young women, and hang boys. The customers were generous with their tips to the women. They had no idea that the money went to the management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the elevated train downtown to the Loop to see my Uncle Sam. He was in his office at the Sherman Hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe greeted me warmly. \"Well, this is a nice surprise. What can I do for you, Sidney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping that maybe I could work in the checkroom at one of your hotels as a hang boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam knew our financial situation. He looked at me thoughtfully. Finally he said, \"Why not? You look older than seventeen. I think the Bismarck Hotel can use you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he put me to work that week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a hang boy was simple. The customers would give their coats and hats to the female attendant, who handed them a numbered check. She would then turn their coats and hats over to me, and I would hang them up on corresponding numbered racks. When the customer returned, the process would be reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI now had a new schedule. I went to school until three, and immediately after school, I would take the El south to the Loop, get off at the station near the Bismarck Hotel, and go to work. My hours were from five P.M. to closing, which was sometimes midnight or later, depending on whether there was a special party. My salary was three dollars a night. I turned the money over to Natalie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeekends were the busiest time for parties at the hotels, so I found myself working seven evenings a week. Holidays were emotionally difficult for me. Families came to the hotel for Christmas and New Year\u0027s Eve celebrations and I watched the children celebrating with their mothers and fathers, and I envied them. Natalie was busy working and Otto was gone, so Richard and I were alone, and had no one to celebrate with. At eight o\u0027clock, while everyone else enjoyed their holiday dinners, I would hurry out to a coffee shop or a diner, have a quick bite to eat, and return to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bright spot in my nightly routine was when my Aunt Frances, Natalie\u0027s effervescent younger sister, came to work at the Bismarck checkroom for a night or two. She was a small and vivacious brunette, with a quick sense of humor, and the customers adored her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new checkroom attendant, Joan Vitucci, came to work at the Bismarck. She was only a year older than I, and she was very pretty. I was attracted to her, and I began to fantasize about her. I would start by taking her out on dates. Even though I had no money, she would see the positive things about me. We would fall in love and get married, and we would have wonderful children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne evening she said, \"My aunt and uncle have a family lunch every Sunday. I think you would like them. If you\u0027re free this Sunday, why don\u0027t you join us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fantasy was coming true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Sunday turned out to be a lovely experience. It was a warm, Italian family gathering of about a dozen adults and children sitting around a large dining room table, filling up on bruschetta, pasta fagioli, chicken cacciatore, and baked lasagna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan\u0027s uncle was an affable, gregarious man named Louie Alterie, the head of the Chicago janitors union. When it was time to leave, I thanked everyone and told Joan what a great time I had had. This was the real beginning of our relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, Louie Alterie was machine-gunned to death as he was leaving his building where we had had lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan disappeared from my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the end of the fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween school during the day, the checkroom nights, and the drugstore Saturdays, I had little time for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething strange seemed to be happening at home. There was tension, but it was a different kind of tension. Natalie and Otto were whispering things to each other, and looking grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning, Otto came in to me and said, \"Son, I\u0027m going to the farm. I\u0027m leaving today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised. I had never been on a farm and I thought it would be fun. \"I\u0027d like to go with you, Otto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t take you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Sidney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. When will you be back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In three years.\" He walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree years? I couldn\u0027t believe it. How could he desert us for three years to live on a farm?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie came into the room. I turned to her. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I have bad news for you, Sidney. Your father got mixed up with some evil people,\" she said. \"He was selling vending machines to stores. What your father didn\u0027t know was that there were no vending machines. The men he worked for took the money and ran. But they were caught, and your father was found guilty, along with them. He\u0027s going to prison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was shocked. So, that\u0027s the farm. \"For three years?\" I did not know what to say. What are we going to do without him for three years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turned out, I need not have worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve months after Otto reported to Lafayette State Prison, he was on his way back home, a hero. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-other-side-of-me/page-3.html","bookId":2371,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM"}
