After searching for the links I simply fall back into the habit of looking at all the pics Rain sent me and remember the promises I made that didn\u0027t involve The Listeners but were about agents and about movies with titles like Boogeyman 2 and Bait and I remind her of them in texts I send - Hey I talked to Don and Braxton and Nate wants to rep you and Come back and we\u0027ll go over your part and I\u0027m talking you up to EVERYONE - that are only answered in the middle of the night: Hey Crazy that all sounds super! and I\u0027ll be back soon!! dotted with emoticons. Unlike everyone else it\u0027s not Kelly Montrose that causes my fear to return. It\u0027s officially back and because of Rain\u0027s absence no longer a faint distraction. And then it\u0027s the blue Jeep that passed me on Santa Monica materializing nightly on the corner of Elevado and one night while I watch it dully from my office window it finally pulls away from the curb. And that\u0027s when I notice for the first time another car, a black Mercedes, slowly pulling away from a spot farther down the street and following the Jeep onto Doheny and then up to Sunset. From the apartment below Union Square, Laurie has stopped contacting me completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did you do over the holidays?\" Rip Millar asks me when a number I don\u0027t recognize shows up on my phone and I answer it impulsively, thinking it might be Rain. After I mention a few family appearances and that basically I just hung around and worked, Rip offers, \"My wife wanted to go to Cabo. She\u0027s still there.\" A long silence plays itself out. I\u0027m forced to fill the silence with, \"What have you been doing?\" Rip describes a couple of parties he seemed to have fun at and then the minor hassles of opening a club in Hollywood and a futile meeting with a city councilman. Rip tells me he\u0027s lying in bed watching CNN on his laptop, images of a mosque in flames, ravens flying against the scarlet sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to see you,\" he says. \"Have a drink, grab some lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t we just talk over the phone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he says. \"We need to see each other in person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Need?\" I ask. \"There\u0027s something you need to see me about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he says. \"There\u0027s something we need to talk about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going back to New York soon,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you going back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" I pause. \"I have some things I need to finish up here first and ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he murmurs. \"I guess you have your reasons to stay.\" Rip lets it hang there before adding, \"But I think you\u0027ll be pretty interested in what I have to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll check my schedule and let you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Schedule?\" he asks. \"That\u0027s funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that funny?\" I ask back. \"I\u0027m really busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a writer. What do you mean, busy?\" His voice had been slack but now it isn\u0027t. \"Who have you been hanging out with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ... at the casting sessions pretty much all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause before \"Really.\" It\u0027s not a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Rip, I\u0027ll be in touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRip follows this with, \"Well, how is The Listeners coming along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s coming along.\" I\u0027m straining. \"It\u0027s very ... busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you\u0027re very busy. You already said that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMove it out of this realm, make it impersonal, concentrate on gossip, anything to elicit sympathy so we can get off the phone. I try another tactic: \"And I\u0027m really stressed about what happened to Kelly. It really stressed me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRip pauses. \"Yeah? I heard about that.\" He pauses again. \"I didn\u0027t know you two were close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. We were pretty close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound Rip makes after I say this is like a muffled giggle, a private riddle whose answer amused him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess he found himself in a slightly improbable situation. Who knows what kind of people he got involved with?\" He gives both sentences a syncopated rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull the phone away from my ear and stare at it until I\u0027m calm enough to bring it back. There\u0027s nothing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what happens when you get involved with the wrong element\" is all Rip offers, his voice crawling toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the wrong element?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause and then Rip\u0027s voice becomes, for the first time I can remember, vaguely annoyed. \"Do you really have to ask me that, Clay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Rip, I\u0027ll get in touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, do that. I think the sooner you hear this, the better.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-19.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
