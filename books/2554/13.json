Weezy was leaning toward Glaeken where he sat at the head of the table, shaking his head as he stared at the Compendium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen anything like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy looked shocked. \"But-but-but you must have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken shrugged. \"I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I interrupt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack didn\u0027t know what was going on, but whatever it was, the contents of the blanket-wrapped bundle under his arm took precedence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy looked annoyed as she tapped the open page in the Compendium before Glaeken. \"This could be important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack unrolled the blanket, revealing the katana and the rectangle of skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as important as these.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve all seen them before,\" Weezy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up the sliced piece of skin and wiggled the cut flap. \"Not like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out his Endura and held it up. \"Of this Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a quick cut, showing everyone how the skin healed itself. Then he unsheathed the katana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not of this Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a cut - again the blue glow along the edges, again no healing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy\u0027s face had gone white, Glaeken looked concerned, but the Lady seemed unperturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That skin is not me,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it used to be yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe used to be able to appear in many guises. Jack had known her as Anya when she\u0027d been stripped of this piece of skin - or rather, stripped of everything but this skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been her first death ... caused by creatures not of this Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen her second death, caused by the Fhinntmanchca, also not of this Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now the Gaijin Masamune ... would that cause her third and final death?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still, it is not me.\" She held out her hand. \"I know this sword. You showed it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Last year.\" He handed it to her. \"Remember what you said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" She held the katana by the handle and studied the pierced, pitted blade. \"I said I sensed something significant, something of great import about it ... that it would be a means to a momentous end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack raised his eyebrows. \"Your end?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I don\u0027t believe so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout warning, she held out her left arm and slashed at it. Blue light flared and her cry of pain mixed with Weezy\u0027s cry of alarm as the blade sliced through her wrist and embedded itself in the tabletop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the hand remained attached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez,\" Jack whispered. \"What the hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blade can cause me pain,\" the Lady said. \"But it cannot damage me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack leaned in for a closer look - not even a line to mark the blade\u0027s passing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swell. But how about a little warning before you pull something like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Th-that was your wrist,\" Weezy said, still visibly shaken. \"What if it pierces a vital organ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady rose. \"Like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Jack could stop her, she turned, placed the butt of the handle against the wall, and impaled herself on the blade. She yelped in pain as pale blue light flashed and the point emerged from her upper back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and faced them, her expression pained as she looked down at the sword protruding from her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could someone help, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack was already halfway there. He stepped up to her, gripped the handle and, after a heartbeat\u0027s hesitation, yanked it free. No blood, not even moisture on the blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack couldn\u0027t help but be angry. \"Are you crazy? That could have killed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Lady was looking at Weezy. \"No fear of piercing my vital organs, dear. I have none. I am all of a piece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy opened her mouth but couldn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack could. He held up the sword. \"Remember what else you told me about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe I said it might be used for good or ill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean what you told me to do with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I said to throw it into the sea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You went further than that. I believe you suggested getting on a boat and dropping it into the Hudson Canyon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Yes, I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m going to do.\" He glanced at Glaeken. \"Unless you object.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man frowned. \"Why would I object?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s sort of yours. You supplied Masamune with the original \u0027metal from the sky.\u0027 I figure you should have some say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken shook his head. \"I lay no claim to that blade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it goes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God,\" Weezy said. \"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ASAP.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good or ill,\" the Lady said. \"You never know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the ill it can do. That\u0027s enough.\" He turned to Weezy. \"How deep is the Hudson Canyon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Depends on how far out you go. It\u0027s four hundred miles long. Go out about a hundred and the canyon floor is probably a mile from the surface.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mile sounds good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hire a tuna boat captain to take care of it for you on his next trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head as he sheathed the sword in its curved scabbard. The Gaijin Masamune was a collector\u0027s item. Couldn\u0027t risk somebody finding out and getting greedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This needs the personal touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d hire a boat, have it take him out over the canyon, and when they reached a point where the depth finder read a mile, he\u0027d discard the scabbard, unwind the handle, and drop the blade over the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even Rasalom would be able to find it in the muck a mile down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Need some company?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if you get seasick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking of Eddie. We\u0027re having lunch later. Wants to talk to me. He hasn\u0027t got much else going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack thought about it a sec. \"Sure. Why not? I\u0027ll see if I can set it up for early tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Great. We done with the sword?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I\u0027ll - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady held up a finger. \"One minor thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish the return of my skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe request startled him. Since it didn\u0027t seem to want to leave him, he\u0027d come to think of it as his skin, his memento of Anya - a grisly one, but a memento nonetheless. Then again, Anya had been simply another manifestation of the Lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" He held it out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe touched it - immediately the two slices Jack had made with the sword sealed up - but she did not take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish it returned to my person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that she turned and her housedress split, revealing an identical map on her back. Jack would never get used to her clothes not being clothes, but part of her. As she said, I am all of a piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe split also revealed the two tunnels running back to front through her flesh, scars of her first two deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lay it against my back but please align it properly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack handed it to Weezy, who was closer, but she backed away, shaking her head. But finally she took it. Gingerly, she aligned the pattern on the Lady\u0027s back with that on the flap, and pressed it against the Lady. It blurred, then melted into her. The Lady\u0027s back was unchanged, but the flap was gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-13.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
