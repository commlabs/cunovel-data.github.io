You have to try to not act like a psycho.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI block him out, trying to formulate a plan. I need a plan. He can yell at me later, I need something. I sit on the bed, covering my face with my hands and rock slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? Do you need some time in the bunker hole too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI block him out and get up from the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"EMMA!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn back to him, \"You wait here. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tries to yell at me again, but he starts coughing. I leave him there. \"Nan, he\u0027s sick. Lungs are infected, I think. Make him soup and get a ton of fluid into him. I\u0027m sending the doctor there now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at me, startled, \"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"He\u0027s burning up and cantankerous, so be careful. I don’t know if it\u0027s contagious. The house should empty. We need Anna out of here, in case though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave the house. Star is in the barn door, talking to Mitch up in the loft. They stop talking to look at me. I walk across the dusty grass to the platform. I shout up into the dark, \"Nick, can I ask you a favor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got some balls, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, \"Shut up, Jake. Nick, I need your help.\" I remember his legs and sigh, \"Jake, help him down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear Jake chuckle, \"She\u0027s always this pleasant; it\u0027s not you. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fourteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar passes me a piece of dried meat. I take it without taking my eyes off of the village. There are far more than twenty men, but they are mostly not men. They\u0027re teenagers; I would imagine Michael\u0027s little army of doom is made up of Gen babies. Irrational little bastards like me and Star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nick said Will has three or four days before we know if he\u0027s going to make it without medicine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar nods, \"I bet Michael has some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at the gate, where Sully\u0027s head is mounted on a stake, and wonder how angry she is. I didn’t even trust him and I\u0027m pissed. Staking someone\u0027s head on a gate is sick and twisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can go in tonight, pretend to be one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point at the grounds, \"How many women do you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glances around the whole village and scowls, \"Misogynistic piece of shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and chew the meat. Leo whines from the ground. I glance behind us to see a scout. I pull an arrow and take a breath as I sight it in. I release it, dropping him instantly. Star is out of the tree instantly. She takes his weapons and drags his body under a log before she climbs back up into the tree, without really making it sway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin at her. She winks, swinging the gun over her shoulder. She pulls out a couple grenades with a grin like she found a candy bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take one and leave her the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chew the meat and tap my fingers against the tree, \"We sneak in on the west side where the bombs are in the woods; they\u0027ll be more scared to go over there. That side door we went in last time, we go in there, and silently kill our way to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"Okay. Soon as it\u0027s really dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go tell Jake and Mitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smirks, \"Make sure Jake stays far away from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\" I climb down the tree and make my way through the forest with Leo. Jake is sitting on the far side of the woods with the four horses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles when he sees me. He doesn’t look behind me to make sure I wasn’t followed, or even look around himself. He has a gun to keep him safe from the infected, more though, he has Mitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going in when it gets quiet and everyone goes to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch nods, \"I\u0027ll come with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No. You need to keep him safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake rolls his eyes, \"I\u0027m not tits on a bull, Em. I can help. That’s a lot of dudes, let us help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give Mitch a look. He nods. I turn and walk back into the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe wait until the dark of night has settled in, and the camp has completely died down, and then make our way into the woods. I have double blades, handguns, my bow and quiver, and a rifle. She has the same, minus the bow. It\u0027s almost the last of the weapons from our camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow her perfectly through the bomb path. I\u0027m sure Bernie made her run it many times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stop at the weapons hold to see if even a few things have been left there. She finds a couple protein bars, some ammo, and a bigger knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eat the protein bar too fast and burp it the whole way along the woods. I hear the guard in the trees shifting as we get closer, and I pull an arrow silently. The only sound that we hear is the release of the arrow as it whips through the wind, and then slices into his head. It took a second for my eyes to adjust, but as he falls from the tree without making much noise, I know I hit the right spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar takes his weapon, staying low. No one comes, even with the little bit of rustling that occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sneak along the new log house, hearing the people sleeping inside. The door at the side of the house opens without a sound. Star sneaks in and moves to the side, so Leo can get ahead of us. He waits in the hallway as I make my way into the first room on the right. I can hear the sleeping people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe made an arrangement when we arrived, no one would be spared, regardless of what we found in those rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t think as I slide my blade against the first throat I find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s just like the breeder farms; these are the ones who are against us. It\u0027s us and them. It always was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar takes the left and I take the right. We meet at the end of the hall, both looking haunted and hollow at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe slip into the kitchen and the shelter but no one is sleeping down there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo takes the stairs. I hear a noise and a crunch, and see his yellow eyes glistening in the dark. We creep upstairs into the first room, the one I always slept in. I know the door has a creak. I open it quickly, the creak is there, but only for a second. Star hurries into the room, making the slicing sound, and the wet noise fills the darkness. Leo makes his crunching sound once. He\u0027s not eating them, just tearing the throat out in one fast bite. It isn’t his first time killing without sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat coats my face. I wipe it with my shirt and continue to the next room. Star opens it slowly. I creep past her, almost tripping on the person on the ground, sleeping on the floor. I take a knee and feel for their breath. I reach my hand for their throat, wishing everything were different. I\u0027m loosing my edge. Star is done both people on the bed and someone on the floor, and I still haven’t killed the person breathing on my hand. Leo senses my hesitation and finishes the job for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next two rooms are the same. I don’t have the fury and vengeance Star has. The man I love is dying, but his head is not mounted on the gate of this village. She kills without thought or feeling. She has become numb to the pain of others. I almost envy her that; I miss that feeling a little. I miss turning my back on them and being responsible for me and Leo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know how to get that back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tiptoe to the back room that used to be Bernie\u0027s. It is the place that mine and Star\u0027s niece or nephew was created. It is the place where my best friend lost her virginity the right way, to the man she loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can only assume Michael is in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar looks at me in the dark; I see her eyes glisten with hatred and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods once and creeps into the room. I follow her in, letting Leo take the lead though. We sneak to either side of the bed, moving perfectly, even without speaking. Who knew we would be the perfect assassination team. I suspect Michael did. I suspect he made us to be what we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon shines in the window slightly, making it easy to see the two women in his bed. He is in the middle of them, sleeping like a baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimace and glance at Star. She has the same face as me. Star slices the throat of the first girl. I can\u0027t. I know that. She doesn\u0027t look older than we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar comes to my side and ends the girl for me, giving me a dirty look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and walk to the far side of the wall. I slide down it, Leo comes and sits next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar sits in the chair against the wall next to me, and we wait for him to wake and realize he\u0027s being bathed in the blood of the two girls he, no doubt, just took advantage of. I know what women will do for protection. It makes me sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night is silent. No one in the house stirs or realizes that the whole main house has been murdered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael moans and stirs, sliding his arm across the wetness of the body on the right, He lifts his hand and his face, sitting up abruptly. Star switches on the light next to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw drops and then his lips curl into a tight smile. He shakes his head, \"The first ones were the best ones. There is no doubt. We used the best DNA from the top scientists and athletes in the world, making a cocktail of excellence. Of course, when they found out why we were doing it, they all backed out. Such a waste of talent that was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar lifts a gun from her lap, \"We don’t need your \u0027why I\u0027m so evil and genius\u0027 speech. We just wanted you to know it was us who murdered you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, as if either buying time or not believing us capable. \"All the greatest have died for their beliefs or because they made their creations too amazing. You girls are prime examples of that. Think of the world you can create from the ashes of this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar steadies her hand, \"We aren’t you. We don’t want to make anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts his hands up, \"I can give you anything and everything. It\u0027ll only be a matter of months before we are rebuilding the next city.\" His eyes sparkle, \"Did you meet your brother, Nicholas? He is my prodigy, in every way. I sent him to see how you were doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy insides tighten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile widens, \"You have met him. You weren’t foolish enough to let him in, were you?\" He shakes his head, \"Tsk, tsk, tsk, Emma. I expected more from you. Star here had a privileged life, what with Bernie being my right-hand man and all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo bares his teeth. I almost bare mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar fires the gun, \"Not too privileged. I still learned how to shoot a gun, Dad.\" Michael jerks back from the bullet. I stand up, terrified and angry in a whole new way. If Anna, Jake, or Sarah are hurt because of Nick, I will never find my way back to the good place in my mind. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-32.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
