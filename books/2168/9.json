{"id":98352,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"So it is true!\" the portly man cried, seeing Elbryan and Pony as they walked into the encampment beside the returning archers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belster, my old friend,\" the ranger replied. \"How good it is to see you faring well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well indeed!\" Belster declared. \"Though we\u0027ve been a bit short of rations of late.\" He patted his ample belly as he spoke. \"You will see to that, I am sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Pony and Elbryan chuckled at that remark - ever did Bel-ster O\u0027Comely have his priorities in order!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where is my other friend?\" Belster asked. \"The one whose appetite rivals my own?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cloud passed over Elbryan\u0027s face. He turned to Pony, who was even more distressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the reports from the forest spoke of great stone magic,\" Belster protested. \"Magic such as only the Mad Friar used to hurl. Do not tell me that he died this very night! Oh, what tragedy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avelyn has passed from this life,\" Elbryan replied somberly. \"But not this night. He died in Aida, when he destroyed the demon dactyl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the reports from the forest...\" Belster stuttered, as though trying to use logic against the ranger\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reports of the fighting were correct, but spoke of Pony,\" Elbryan explained, putting his arm across the woman\u0027s shoulders. \"It was she who put the stones to their powerful use.\" He turned to his love and lifted his other hand to stroke her thick golden mane. \"Avelyn taught her well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it would seem,\" Belster remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger pulled himself away from the woman and struck a determined pose, staring back at Belster. \"And Pony is ready to carry on the work where Avelyn finished,\" he declared. \"In the bowels of smoky Aida, Avelyn destroyed the demon dactyl and turned the tide of this war, stealing the binding force from our ene-mies. Now it lies before us to finish the task, to rid our lands of these wicked creatures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo all those around, the ranger seemed to grow a bit taller as he spoke, and Belster O\u0027Comely smiled knowingly. This was the charm of Elbryan, the mystique of Nightbird. Belster knew that the ranger would inspire them all to new heights of battle, would guide them as one pointed and focused force, striking hard at every weakness among their enemy\u0027s ranks. Despite the news about Avelyn, de-spite his mounting fears about the missing Roger Lockless, it seemed to Belster that the world got a bit brighter that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tallies of the victory proved impressive. The forest was lit-tered with the bodies of dead goblins and powries, and several gi-ants. Six men had been wounded, one gravely, and three others were missing and presumed dead. Those who had carried in the worst of the wounded did not expect the man to live through the night - indeed, they had only carried him back that he might say his farewells to his family and be properly buried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony went to him with the hematite, working tirelessly hour after hour, willingly sacrificing every ounce of her own energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She will save him,\" Belster announced to Elbryan a short time later, when he and Tomas Gingerwart found the ranger as he tended to Symphony, wiping the horse down and cleaning the hooves. \"She will,\" the former innkeeper repeated over and over, obviously trying to convince himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shamus Tucker is a good man,\" Tomas added. \"He does not de-serve such a fate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the while he was speaking, Elbryan noted, Tomas looked di-rectly at him, almost accusingly. It seemed to Elbryan that Tomas considered Pony\u0027s work with the wounded man to be some kind of a test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pony will do all that is possible,\" the ranger answered simply. \"She is strong with the stones, nearly as strong as was Avelyn, but she used most of her energy in the battle, I fear, and has not much left to give to Shamus Tucker. When I am done with Symphony, I will go to her to see if I can be of any assistance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tend to the horse first?\" There was no mistaking the open accusations in Tomas Gingerwart\u0027s tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do as Pony instructed me,\" the ranger replied calmly. \"She wished to start the healing process alone, for in that solitude she might find deeper levels of concentration, and thus a more intimate bond with the wounded man. I trust in her judgment, and so should you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomas cocked his head, regarding the man, and gave a slight and unconvincing nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nervous Belster cleared his throat and nudged his stubborn companion. \"Do not think us ungrateful - \" he started to apologize to Elbryan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger\u0027s laugh cut him short and he blustered with surprise. He looked to Tomas, who was obviously angry, thinking he was being mocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have we lived like this?\" Elbryan asked Belster. \"How many months have we spent in the forest, fighting and running?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many,\" Belster replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed,\" said the ranger. \"And in that time, I have come to understand much. I know why you are mistrusting, Master Gingerwart,\" he said bluntly, turning from Symphony to stand directly be-fore the man. \"Before Pony and I arrived, you were one of the unquestioned leaders of this band.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you imply that I cannot see the greater good?\" Tomas asked. \"Do you believe that I would place my own desire for power above - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I speak the truth,\" Elbryan interrupted. \"That is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomas nearly choked on that proclamation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are fearful now, and so you should be,\" the ranger went on, turning back to his horse. \"Anytime one in your position of great responsibility senses a change, even a change that appears to be for the good, he must be wary. The stakes are too high.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelster hid his smile as he studied the change that came over Tomas. The ranger\u0027s simple reasoning, honesty, and straightforward manner were truly disarming. Tomas\u0027 agitation had passed its peak now, with the man visibly relaxing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But understand,\" Elbryan went on, \"that I, and Pony, are not your enemies, nor even your rivals. We will help out where we may. Our goals, as are your own, are to rid the land of the dactyl\u0027s evil minions, even as we helped rid the world of the demon itself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomas nodded, seeming somewhat placated, if a bit confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will the man live?\" Belster asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pony was hopeful,\" the ranger replied. \"Her work with the hematite is nothing short of miraculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us hope,\" Tomas added sincerely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger finished tending to Symphony soon after, then sought out Pony and the wounded man. He found them under the shelter of a lean-to, the man sleeping comfortably, his breathing steady and strong. Pony was asleep, too, lying right across the man, one hand still holding tight to the soul stone. Elbryan thought to take the hematite and try to do some healing of his own on Shamus Tucker, but changed his mind, reasoning that sleep might be the best cure of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger moved Pony slightly, trying to make her more com-fortable, and then he left them. He went back to Symphony, thinking to make his bed there, and to his relief found Belli\u0027mar Ju-raviel waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I led the small group back to Caer Tinella,\" the elf explained, his voice grim. \"And there found a hundred powries, a like number of goblins, and several more giants waiting to join in the chase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More giants?\" the ranger echoed incredulously, for it was not common for the behemoths to gather in numbers above a handful. The sheer potential for devastation of such a force stole Elbryan\u0027s breath. \"Do you think they mean to march on Palmaris?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuraviel shook his head. \"More likely they are using the towns as staging areas for smaller excursions,\" he reasoned. \"But we should keep careful watch on Caer Tinella. The leader there is a powrie of apparently great renown; even the giants bow before him, and in all the time I spent hiding in the shadows in the town, I did not hear a single word of dissent against him, even when reports began coming in of the disaster in the forest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t stung them so hard, then,\" the ranger remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have stung them,\" Juraviel replied, \"and that may serve to only make them more angry. We should watch the south and watch it well. The next force coming to find your friends will be over-whelming, I am sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan instinctively glanced to the south, as though expecting a horde of monsters to be tearing through the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is another matter,\" Juraviel went on, \"concerning a par-ticular prisoner the powries have taken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is my understanding that the powries have many prisoners in many towns,\" Elbryan replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one may be different,\" Juraviel explained. \"This one knows of your friends in the forest; indeed, he is highly regarded among them, much as you were among the people of Dundalis and the other towns of the Timberlands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the edge of the clearing, sheltered by the thick boughs of a pine, Belster O\u0027Comely watched the ranger curiously. Beside him, Tomas was more animated, and only the portly innkeeper\u0027s constant prodding prevented the man from getting them both discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan was talking, to himself, it appeared, though Belster sus-pected he might know the reason. The ranger was looking up into a tree, to an apparently empty branch, and holding a conversation, though they could not come close to making out the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your friend\u0027s a bit of a loon?\" Tomas whispered in Belster\u0027s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelster shook his head resolutely. \"All the world should be so crazy,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan turned and cocked his head, and Belster, knowing the game was up, led Tomas from behind the pine. \"Ah, Elbryan,\" the portly man said. \"There you are. We have been searching all about for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so hard to find,\" the ranger replied evenly, suspiciously. \"I went to Pony - your friend is resting well and appears as though he will survive - and then back here to Symphony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Symphony and ...\" Belster prompted, nodding toward the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger stood calm and did not answer. He wasn\u0027t sure how Tomas might react to Juraviel, though Belster had seen the elf and several other Touel\u0027alfar during the time he fought with Elbryan in the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come now,\" Belster went on, \"I know Elbryan well, and would not expect him to be standing alone and talking to himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should sit with me at Oracle, the ranger thought, and gave a slight chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve brought a friend, unless I miss my guess,\" said Bel-ster. \"A friend whose special talents bode well for me and my companions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan motioned for the two men to join him by the tree, and Belli\u0027mar Juraviel, picking up the cue, hopped from the branch, using his nearly translucent wings to flutter down to a soft landing beside his ranger friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomas Gingerwart nearly jumped out of his boots. \"What in all the dark holes in all the strange world is that?\" he bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is an elf,\" Belster calmly explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touel\u0027alfar,\" Elbryan added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belli\u0027mar Juraviel, at your service,\" the elf said, bowing low to Tomas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big man only nodded stupidly, wagging his head, wagging his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come now,\" Belster said to him. \"I told you of the elves that fought with us at Dundalis. I told you of the catapult caravan, where Brother Avelyn nearly blew himself up, and of the elves who stung our enemies from the trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I... I did not expect...\" Tomas stuttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan looked to Juraviel, who seemed almost bored by the typical reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a loud sigh, Tomas managed to steady himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Juraviel has been to Caer Tinella - \" Elbryan began to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have asked him to do so if he had not,\" Belster interrupted anxiously. \"We fear for one of our own, Roger Lockless by name. He went into town this very evening, shortly before the monsters came out after us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either their march toward our position began as a search for him, or they have him, it would seem,\" Tomas added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The latter,\" Elbryan informed them. \"Juraviel has seen your Roger Lockless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alive?\" both men asked together, their tone showing true concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very much so,\" the elf replied. \"Wounded, but not too badly. I could not get close; the powries have him under tight and watchful guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger has been a thorn to them since they arrived,\" Tomas explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelster then recounted the many tales of Roger\u0027s adventures, the thievery, the mocking jokes left behind, his common practice of having goblins take the blame for his nighttime raids, and the freeing of Mrs. Kelso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will need to fill large shoes, Nightbird,\" Tomas Gingerwart said gravely, \"if you are to replace Roger Lockless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Replace him?\" the ranger balked. \"You speak as if he is already dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the clutches of Kos-kosio Begulne, he may as well be,\" Tomas replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan glanced to Juraviel, the two exchanging wry smiles. \"We shall see,\" the ranger said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelster nearly hopped for joy, his hopes soaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan was surprised to find Pony up and waiting for him when he arose the next morning, the eastern sky just beginning to brighten with the hint of dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have expected you to sleep the day away after your ef-forts with the stones,\" the ranger said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would, were this not so important a day,\" Pony replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan wore a puzzled expression, but only for a moment as he considered Pony\u0027s stance, her sword belted at her hip. \"You wish to learn the sword-dance,\" he reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you agreed,\" said Pony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger\u0027s lack of enthusiasm showed clearly. \"There are so many matters to attend to,\" he explained. \"Roger Lockless, an im-portant figure to these folk, is held prisoner in Caer Tinella, and we have to take a reckoning of the band, to see who can fight and who cannot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you do not intend to do your own sword-dance this morning?\" Pony asked, and the ranger knew he was caught by her logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is Juraviel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was gone when I awoke,\" Pony replied. \"But is he not gone every morning, after all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To his own sword-dance, likely,\" said the ranger. \"And to scout the area. Many of the Touel\u0027alfar prefer this time of day, just before the dawn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As do I,\" said Pony. \"A fine time forbi\u0027nelle dasada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan could not hold out against her persistence. \"Come along,\" he said. \"Let us find a place where we might begin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led her through the dark forest and down into a small shallow where the ground was flat and clear of any large brush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have seen you fight,\" he explained, \"but I have never really found the chance or the cause to examine your style. A few simple attack and defense routines should suffice.\" He motioned for her to step out into the clearing to give the demonstration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony eyed him curiously. \"Should we remove our clothes?\" she asked coyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan blew a frustrated sigh. \"You intend to keep teasing me?\" he asked helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Teasing?\" Pony replied too innocently. \"I have seen you at the sword- dance, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we here to learn or to play?\" the ranger said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was not teasing,\" Pony retorted in a voice just as determined. \"I only mean to keep you interested as the weeks of this war drag on.\" She stepped into the clearing then and drew out her sword, set-ting herself in a low crouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then she was grabbed by the shoulder and turned about, to find Elbryan, his expression perfectly serious, staring into her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was not my choice to abstain,\" he said quietly, seriously. \"Nor yours. It was a decision made necessary by circumstance, and one I tolerate, but do not enjoy. Not at all. You need not worry about keeping me interested, my love. All my heart is yours, and yours alone.\" He bent to her and kissed her softly, but didn\u0027t allow that to melt into something deeper and more passionate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will find our time,\" Pony promised him as they broke the embrace. \"A time and place for me and for you, when we do not need to act for the betterment of the whole world. A time when you can be Elbryan Wyndon, and not Nightbird, and when our love can safely bring us children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey held the pose for a long while, staring at each other, both taking such great pleasure and comfort in the other\u0027s mere pres-ence. Finally the tip of the sun came above the eastern rim and broke the trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show me,\" the ranger bade her, stepping back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony fell back into her crouch, spent a long moment steadying herself, mentally preparing herself, then went into a routine of at-tack and defense, her sword whipping expertly through the air. She had spent years in the King\u0027s army perfecting these maneuvers, and her swordplay now was nothing short of spectacular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was typical, Elbryan knew, so indicative of the fighting style common throughout the land, a style mimicked by goblins and powries. Pony\u0027s hips turned repeatedly as she brought her weight behind each slashing cut, wading forward and then scam-pering back in defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finished, she turned, her face red from the effort, her smile wide with pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan walked up beside her, drawing out Tempest. \"Strike that branch,\" he bade her, indicating a low limb three feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony settled, then stepped ahead, one, two, sword going high and back, then rushing forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped in mid-swing as Tempest stabbed past her, sticking deep into the branch. She had taken a full step before Elbryan had even started the movement, and yet he had beaten her to the mark easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The lunge,\" he explained, holding the pose, his body fully ex-tended, right arm out straight, left arm turned down behind his trailing shoulder. He retreated suddenly, settling back into a defen-sive posture in a mere second. \"Your weaving and slashing maneuvers are excellent, but you must add the hinge, that sudden, swift stab that no powrie, no opponent, can expect or deflect;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response, Pony assumed the ranger\u0027s stance, balancing her-self perfectly, knees out over her feet, legs angled perpendicular to each other. She stepped out suddenly with her right leg, left arm dropping, right arm extending, mimicking Elbryan\u0027s move almost perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger didn\u0027t even try to hide his surprise, or his approval. \"You have been studying me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forever,\" Pony answered, falling back to defensive posture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you almost got it right,\" Elbryan remarked, deflating her obvious pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your body led the way,\" the ranger explained. \"And yet it is your sword which should pull you forward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony looked down at her blade skeptically. \"I do not understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will,\" Elbryan said with a grin. \"Now come along. Let us find a better area where we might properly executebi\u0027nelle dasada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found a proper clearing soon after, Elbryan going off to the side to prepare himself, affording Pony some measure of mod-esty as she undressed. Then they met on the field with their weapons, the ranger leading the dance, Pony attuning herself to his every move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long while Elbryan watched her, gauging her fluidity and grace, marveling at how easily she picked up the dance. Then he let himself fall into his own meditative trance, his own routine, let the song ofbi\u0027nelle dasada flow through his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a short while Pony tried to keep up, but soon she was only watching, awestruck by the beauty, the interplay of muscle, the continually shifting but always perfect balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he finished, he was covered in sweat, as was Pony, the gentle wind tickling their skin. They stood regarding each other for a long while, and it seemed to each of them as if they had just achieved a level of intimacy no less than lovemaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan reached up and tenderly stroked Pony\u0027s cheek. \"Every morning,\" he said. \"But take care that Belli\u0027mar Juraviel does not learn of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fear his reaction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not know if he would approve,\" the ranger admitted. \"This is among the highest rituals of the Touel\u0027alfar, and only they have the right to share it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Juraviel admitted that you were notn\u0027Touel\u0027alfar,\" Pony re-minded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I feel no guilt,\" the ranger replied, somewhat convinc-ingly. \"I will teach you - I only wish the decision to be kept mine alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To protect Juraviel,\" Pony reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go and dress,\" Elbryan said with a smile. \"The day will be long and arduous, I fear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony walked back to the brush at the side of the field, satisfied with her morning\u0027s work, though truly exhausted. For all these weeks she had desired to begin the sword-dance, and now that she had completed her first experience with it, she was surely not disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, the sword-dance felt to her like the training she had received with the magical stones, a gift, a growth, moving her to her potential, moving her closer to God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePART TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE PECKING ORDER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, Uncle Mather, I am amazed by the resilience of people pushed into a desperate situation. As it was in Dundalis, I have found here a group willing to fight and to die - men and women, young children even, and older folks who should be spending their days telling stories of their long-past adventures. I have seen some terrible suffering, and yet have heard little in the way of complaint - other than the sounds of stomachs rumbling for lack of food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with the common suffering comes an altruism that is truly heartwarming and inspiring. As it was with Paulson, Cric, and Chipmunk, who gave their lives for a battle that really wasn\u0027t for them to fight, as it was with gallant Bradwarden, who certainly could have chosen a different path, it is now with Belster and Tomas, Roger Lockless and all the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have my fears, though, mostly for an unintentional rivalry that may spring up between myself and the leaders of this band. When I led the fighters in the forest back to the refugee encampment after our great victory, I sensed true tension with Tomas Gingerwart, who, until my arrival, acted as one of the leaders of the forest band, perhaps the strongest voice of all. A calm conversation quickly cured that potential ill, for Tomas has been seasoned by years and experience. As soon as he was assured that he and I both fought for the same goal - the benefit of the people under his care - the rivalry was no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not so, I fear, with another of the band whom I have not yet even met, an impetuous young fellow named Roger. By Belster\u0027s words, Roger is young and proud, and has ever been insecure in his position among the refugees, even to the point that he considered Belster and the folk from the northland as potential rivals. What will he think when he meets Pony and me? How will he react when he sees the respect afforded us, particularly from those who knew us in the north, or from those who followed us in the battle in the forest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, Uncle Mather, I think it ironic that these displaced folk think of me as a hero. For when I see their faces, every one, the expressions of men and women put to the test for perhaps the first time, I see the truest heroism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause that is something that cannot be judged by the quality of training and the quality of weapons, Uncle Mather. Simply because I was trained by the Touel\u0027alfar and carry with me weapons of great power, am I any more heroic than the woman who throws herself between danger and her children, or the farmer who trades plowshare for sword to defend his community? Am I more heroic because my chances of winning the battle are greater?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think not, for heroism is measured in strength of heart, not strength of arm. It is a marker of the conscious decisions, the selflessness, the willingness, to sacrifice everything, in the knowledge that those who follow you will be better off for your efforts. Heroism is the ultimate act of community, I think, the sense of belonging to something bigger than one\u0027s own mortal coil. It is rooted in faith: in God, or even in the mere belief that the whole of the goodly folk is stronger when each individual part cares for the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is an incredible thing to me, this resilience, this inner strength, this human spirit. And in admiring it, I realize that we cannot lose this war, that in the end, even if that end be a thousand years hence, we will triumph. Because they cannot kill us, Uncle Mather. They cannot kill the resilience. They cannot kill the inner strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey cannot kill the human spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look into the faces of the men and women, the children, too young for such trials, the aged, too old for such battle, and I know this to be true. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-demon-spirit-the-demonwars-saga-2/page-9.html","bookId":2168,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:42 PM"}
