In black letters it read: RAVEN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, a red note with black typed letters read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMEET ME AT OAKLEY PARK, Love, Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow sweet, I thought. A spontaneous romantic interlude in the park. Alexander Sterling was king of planning the most mysterious, meaningful, marvelous dates--a picnic at the Dullsville cemetery; a goth rock dance at Dullsville\u0027s Country Club golf course; picking out my kitty, Nightmare, at an abandoned barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined arriving at the park, votives surrounding the Oakley Park fountain, bubbles floating from the steaming water, Alexander and I wading in our bare feet, our lips tenderly touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I wondered, was this note truly from my vampire mate? Unfortunately, since I\u0027d encountered Jagger at the Coffin Club, I had grown suspicious. After all, Jagger had met me in an alley in Hipsterville, appeared in my backyard, and hid in the Mansion\u0027s gazebo. Then again, if it was Jagger, he could just show up at my house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hopped on my bike in my lacy black knee-length dress and pedaled my heart out to Oakley Park. I raced over the bumpy grass toward the swings. When I reached the fountain, my dream guy wasn\u0027t there. I walked my bike over to the picnic benches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander?\" I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I saw were the flashing lights of lightning bugs. Then I heard the music of the Wicked Wiccas being piped in from the outdoor amphitheater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked my bike over to the domed stage where my parents dragged Billy Boy and me to see Dullsville\u0027s symphony orchestra play on Sunday nights during the summer. I had preferred sitting alone on the wet grass, listening to the screeching violins in a rainstorm while my parents sought shelter underneath a tree, to watching them canoodle and dance to \"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI coasted down the aisle of the theater. A lit candelabra and a picnic basket were sitting on a black lace blanket, spread out center stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned my bike against a cement bench. I raced around the orchestra pit and climbed onstage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI searched the wings. I found only chairs and music stands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to center stage and sat on the blanket. I opened the picnic basket. Maybe there was another note telling me to go to a different romantic location. But the basket was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething felt strange. The crickets turned silent. I stood up and looked around. Still no Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, right in front of me, stood Luna, in a tight black dress with mesh sleeves and pink fingerless gloves, a pastel pink amulet hanging from her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped and stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" I asked her. \"I\u0027m supposed to meet Alexander.\" \"He got a note, too,\" she said with a wicked grin. \"\u0027Meet me at the cemetery. Raven.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around, peering into the wings of the stage, squinting out at the empty seats. Jagger could have been anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here alone,\" she assured me as if she were reading my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to go--,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna stepped in front of me, her chunky black boot almost hitting my own. \"I think Alexander can wait. After all, he\u0027s made me wait for him since I was born.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t have anything to do with that,\" I said, referring to the covenant ceremony in Romania where Alexander was supposed to turn her into a vampire. \"And Alexander didn\u0027t either. He never made that promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t defend him,\" she argued. \"Besides, that\u0027s not why I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to stop seeing Trevor,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t play dumb with me. I know you visit him at night. And I overheard you at the diner. You told him to beware of me, like I\u0027m some freak!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has the right to know who you really are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was a freak before I turned. Now I am normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t even know the real Trevor. Believe me, he\u0027s the freak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember asking you for your opinion.\" \"Jagger is not looking out for you. He\u0027s not concerned with finding you a soul mate. He\u0027s still looking to get back at Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk about my brother like that. You don\u0027t know anything about him--or me. You don\u0027t even know me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do know Trevor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna\u0027s eyes widened. She stuck her hands in their pink fingerless gloves on her almost nonexistent hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trevor\u0027s right. You are jealous!\" she accused. \"He thinks you are in love with him. And I do, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you are as loony as he is! You deserve each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won Alexander. I have a right to find my own fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a contest. These are people, not prizes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer blue eyes turned red. She stepped so close to me, I could smell her Cotton Candy lip gloss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to back off!\" she said in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to back off!\" I said in her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she was going to push, I was going to push back harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not afraid of you,\" Luna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not afraid of anyone,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought at any minute we were going to have a cat fight--or in our case, a bat fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you tell Trevor about me,\" she threatened, \"then I\u0027m going to tell him about you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about me?\" \"That you are a vampire. That we are vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped back and folded her arms, as if triumphant. I didn\u0027t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then tell him,\" I said finally. \"He\u0027ll never believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna stepped back and gazed at the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are probably right,\" she relented. \"I thought I saw you reflected in the Hall of Mirrors. Jagger convinced me it was part of the illusion. I guess I didn\u0027t want to accept that Alexander had turned you. It\u0027s odd really, not being like everyone else, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never met a girl, or anyone besides Alexander, who acknowledged feeling the same way I did, vampire or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna\u0027s dark mood changed. Her stiff shoulders relaxed. Her angry blue eyes softened, looking almost lost, and lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s funny,\" she continued, \"how much we have in common. We\u0027re not all that different, you and me. I\u0027ve always been surrounded by real vampires. Ones that were born to the Underworld. I\u0027m the only one I know who was turned. Until I met you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see in Luna\u0027s soulful eyes that she was hungering for a connection. She reminded me of someone who was alone, living on the outside of life instead of thriving on the inside. She reminded me of myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not fun being an outcast,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna smiled a pale pink smile, like a warm hug was melting her darkened spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed my hand as she sat down by the basket. \"Sit for a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really should go--,\" I said, resisting her. \"Just for a minute,\" she pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reluctantly sat down on the blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, how did you feel when you turned?\" She scooted closer and eagerly leaned in to me, like we were gossiping at a slumber party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did I feel?\" I asked, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Alexander bit you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused. If I answered wrong, I could blow my whole vampire cover. I was alone, onstage with a vampiress, without my garlic, a stake, or sunlight to hide behind, and Alexander was waiting for me miles away at the Dullsville cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please...tell me, how did it make you feel?\" she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like magic,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she nodded eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a life force I\u0027d never known coursed through my veins and pulsed straight to my heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I felt my heart stop, as if it had exploded with love, then beat again like it never had before,\" I said, getting caught up in my own imagination, almost believing it myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too...But you were in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027ve loved Alexander since the first moment I saw him,\" I said truthfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is gorgeous.\" Then she whispered, as if she were sharing a secret, \"I had a fling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was he?\" \"An acquaintance of Jagger\u0027s. I barely knew him. But he had a chiseled chin and a ripped chest. Deep blue eyes and spiky red hair like fire. He took me to a warehouse. We made out for a while, his lips were like velvet. And before I knew it, he had bitten me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" I said, hanging on her every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were on unsacred ground, so we were not bonded for eternity. I never saw him again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s so sad,\" I lamented, honestly feeling sorry for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were lucky; you found Alexander. So you see how important Trevor is to me. When Jagger introduced us and I stared into his heavenly green eyes, I immediately felt a connection. Not only is he handsome and athletic, but as I got to know him, I sensed that he had everything he could ever want but true love. This is what drew me to him. I\u0027m looking for someone to quench my thirst--for all eternity.\" She fingered the pink amulet. \"Jagger has different needs than I do. He hungers for the hunt, lusts for new prey. Finds ecstasy in the transformation of an innocent mortal into a bloodthirsty vampire. But for me, these bottles are growing quite tiresome. The hunt isn\u0027t sustaining me. It\u0027s flowing blood that I really crave. The sweet taste of red succulent liquid mixing with the salt of my beloved as it drips and dances on his flesh. To know that someone will ache for me as much as I hunger for him and eternally satiate each other. I want someone to satisfy my hunger forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Trevor\u0027s not good enough. You deserve better,\" I said earnestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need someone who is intelligent. Sensitive. Mature. Courageous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is those things. You don\u0027t know him the way I know him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I should go, that Alexander must be waiting at the cemetery wondering why I hadn\u0027t shown. At the same time, there was so much I wanted to know about Luna, about being turned, about becoming a modern-day vampiress. There was so much I wanted to know for myself. And I didn\u0027t know when I\u0027d get another chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like being a vampire?\" I asked, now the one riveted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve waited for it all my life. Everyone in my immediate family is a vampire. When my younger brother, Valentine, was born, I dreamed that he would be mortal, like me. But when he wasn\u0027t, I cursed the day he was born. The last mortal in my family tree was my great-great grandmother, and I never even knew her. I spent my whole life living in the daylight while the rest of my family slept. I was never part of their world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you cope all alone?\" I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to mask it by being a bubbly straight-A student, becoming popular with the kids at school. It put a strain on Jagger\u0027s and my relationship. I was jealous of Jagger and he was of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? I can\u0027t imagine Jagger being jealous of anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could see it in his face every time he awoke from his coffin. We had only a few hours together before I had to get to sleep. We\u0027d sit in my bright pink room and I\u0027d share every detail of my events that day at school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who would want to go to school?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jagger was especially interested in sports. In Europe, soccer is huge. He dreamed of being what he couldn\u0027t be--a soccer star. He would show up at night games, hungry to be a player instead of a spectator. But to the students he was odd--a kid who never went to school, was pale and skinny, and dressed like a freak. He was never included. Now he watches Trevor play soccer, wishing he had that life. I think that\u0027s why he wants Trevor for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Jagger and Luna weren\u0027t vampires but just teens like me who were tired of being outsiders. \"How do you like being a vampire?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...I love it,\" I fibbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now you\u0027re different from your entire family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027d ever seen my family, you\u0027d know I always was,\" I said with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna laughed, too. It was like we\u0027d known each other for years instead of only a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My little brother is a total nerdo,\" I said, desperate to share my life with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eleven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So is Valentine! It\u0027s so refreshing to meet someone like you. You understand what it means to live in both worlds but beg for the darker one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna pulled out a Pinky Paranoid clutch purse from behind the basket. \"Want some candy?\" she asked, handing me a Dynamite Mint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and unwrapped the candy as she took out a hair brush. \"Tell me about Alexander,\" she said, inching next to me. She began to brush my hair, as if we\u0027d been soul sisters for years. I felt uncomfortable, as this girly behavior seemed straight out of a Gidget movie. Teens around Dullsville were never seen brushing one another\u0027s hair. Luna, however, was much more fairylike than any girl I\u0027d ever met. I felt almost hypnotized and relaxed as she smoothed out my hair, opposite of the way I felt when I was a child and my mom ran a fine-toothed comb through my tangles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander\u0027s so dreamy. His eyes are like milk chocolates. His attic room is filled with portraits he\u0027s painted of me and his family,\" I rattled on like a drippy girl, then changed my tone. \"But it\u0027s hard sometimes,\" I confessed. \"I want to share our reflections. I want to have a photo of us on my night stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it does have its drawbacks. But it\u0027s a small price to pay for an eternity together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna pulled my hair off my shoulder and began to braid it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the wound from Alexander\u0027s bite?\" she asked curiously...I quickly covered my neck with my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe released my hair and raised her white, luxurious locks, exposing two round purple marks on her skinny pale neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They say it takes a year to go away,\" she said. \"I hope it stays there forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...it\u0027s not on my neck,\" I teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are wicked!\" she said with a smile, but then turned serious. \"I could have sworn Jagger said he saw Alexander bite you on your neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really have to go,\" I said, getting up. \"Alexander will be worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed offstage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanna hang out again tomorrow?\" she asked, following me. \"We can meet at sunset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have plans with Alexander,\" I said, walking up the aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then the next night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see,\" I said, grabbing my bike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you need to ride here when you could fly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to keep up appearances.\" \"Good thinking,\" she said with a wink. \"I\u0027ll see you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hopped on my bike. \"Later!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pedaled off.
