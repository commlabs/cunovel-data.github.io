The girl who saved my sister from a fate worse than any. The girl whose sadness matched my own. The girl whose face has haunted me my entire life. You saw Emalyn\u0027s eyes, well I saw yours. You are the bravest girl I have ever known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m trembling and scared as he draws closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have thought of no one but you for fourteen years. I can\u0027t have a regular relationship. It isn’t you I\u0027m punishing, it\u0027s me. I don’t deserve the kindness of love. I failed her and you. I should have fought harder and saved you both. I never should have left you. I\u0027m so sorry. I never should have left you. You ended up there because of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a sobbing mess. The kaleidoscopes have taken my eyes. The angles and shapes that make my world harsh and sharp have taken over my eyes. I step forward, grabbing his hands. \"You saved me. You saved me from the dirty house and you saved me from being a waitress in a café the rest of my life.\" I reach up and run my hands across his cheeks, taking his tears. \"I see you.\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wraps around me, we become one. Our skin is so close, that in the crease between us, I feel a spark that could light up the entire world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold him and caress him and for the first time, I see him. His hatred for himself is stronger than any feeling he could possibly ever have. He will always be the broken mess he is. I get the feelings of self-preservation Sebastian had when he left me. I get it. I could walk now and choose survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don’t. I hold him closer and choose him. The hard work and constant frustration is worth the moments like this one, where I get to see inside. Even if it\u0027s just for a moment. I hate that we are both so damaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold him and know that without him there never was survival. But that doesn’t mean I need to self-destruct. I know what I have to do, for us both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes and sobs into me and I have a bad feeling it\u0027s the first time he has truly let himself cry. My back hurts from the pressure and weight of him, but I hold him tight until he\u0027s ready to stand up on his own again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hold on to each other, like we did when we were little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me and shakes his head, \"I\u0027m sorry. I just panicked. I don’t know what to do without you. I don’t know what I am without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t be two broken things and have a relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rise in my toes and kiss his lips softly, \"I don’t want anyone but you. But at the same time, I don’t want to be the china doll you glued back together. I don’t want to look whole from a distance, but when you get close enough you can see all the cracks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe runs a gloved hand down my cheeks, \"The cracks make us who we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"We can be better than this. But it feels like we need to be better for ourselves. I need to be better for me and you need to be better for you. If you can\u0027t love you and I can\u0027t love me, then we will never truly love each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks stressed and confused. \"You don’t want to be with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss his frozen lips again, \"I do. But not like this. I don’t want to need you to make me whole. My whole life I\u0027ve wanted normal. I don’t care about that anymore. Shell is right, there is no normal. But with us there is a danger that we will let this consume us. We won\u0027t ever get better if we don\u0027t let go of each other and find ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses me back after a minute of my gentle pecks brushing his lips, \"You\u0027re so much stronger than I am. I can\u0027t do this without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin, \"You need like a year with some hard-ass nuns and you\u0027ll feel better. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs and shakes his head, \"I need you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you too. When we don’t need each other anymore and just want each other, we can try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grips me. I can feel his hands trembling, \"I can\u0027t be without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nestle my face into his hard chest and nod, \"Yes, you can. You just have to trust me. If you trust me to take care of myself, you\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I lose you again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and listen to his rapid heartbeat, \"You found me once, you\u0027ll find me again.\" My own heart is breaking. I don’t want to be strong. I want him to drag me back into the change room and punish me for such thoughts. I want to be weak and succumb to his every whim. But I don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn’t feel like it right now, but this is me choosing you.\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe holds me tighter. \"You\u0027re right it doesn’t feel like it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and feel the right path before me, \"It will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls back, \"Are we going to box then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"I need all the help I can get and we both already look beat up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tremble as she wraps the tape. She looks at me and smiles, \"You got this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"I\u0027ve got an ass whooping coming. That’s what I\u0027ve got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smirks, \"Yup. But you look sexy in your t-shirt.\" I glance down and laugh. The Tinkerbell tee is exactly what I needed. When Lance gave it to me I almost killed him. But then watching him hand out the t-shirts to the boys made me feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hop back and forth and try to loosen up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, if you panic, kick him in the balls and run. We both know Eli won\u0027t let anything happen to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or Lyle and Jake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod again. She sanitizes her hands and slides the guard into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs and drags me out to the rings. My brothers smile at me, but I can see they\u0027re scared. I grin my mouth guard at them. Jake laughs and shakes his head. Lyle doesn’t laugh. He watches me and then the door, where Angelo walks out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins at me and points his glove, \"My turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. I have a secret weapon he doesn’t know about. I look around for the only face I really need to see. His icy-blue eyes meet mine from a doorway. He\u0027s leaning with his arms crossed. He looks deadly sexy. I have to focus the blood in my body. I force my eyes away from his. We\u0027ve been hanging out like regular people but it\u0027s been painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb into the ring and start to hop around. I move my neck around and roll my shoulders. Angelo is doing the same. I smirk at the boys all wearing their Lost Boys t-shirts that Lance made for them. They\u0027re cheering, even Brandon, the little shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance steps in, \"Clean fighting. No cheating. No biting. No kicking. No kissing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngelo holds a mitt up, \"If you gotta kish me, I get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrow my eyes and hold my mitts up. He knocks them with his. We step back and get ready. Lance throws his arms down, \"FIGHT!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngelo comes hard and fast. Thankfully I can tell he\u0027s holding back, but if he hits me it\u0027s gonna hurt. His right connects with my arm, but grazes off. He frowns. I grin. He hits with the left, but I move and it grazes off again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s confused and underestimating me. I take advantage of it and hit him in the jaw. His head barely moves. He laughs and comes at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turtle as his shots connect. They still hurt, even though they glance off my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tink, you got shomeshing you want to tell me about? Like a magical forshfield thatsh prtotecting you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit him with my pathetic swipes. He laughs. I attack harder, making his laugh get louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swings at me, connecting with my face. I fall back. Luckily, it too glances off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"TINK!\" He jumps and grabs me. I\u0027m laughing now instead of him. I rub my glove against my face. His gloves drop. He looks scared, \"Can we be done now? I didn’t even hit that hard and my shots aren’t connecting, but this is stressing me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and nod. The cocky bastard is gone and replaced by this pussycat. He looks at my face and frowns. He looks at his glove and shakes his head, \"Cheater, cheater.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. I\u0027m sure I have a very glittery face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at Shell, who waves at him holding the bottle of glitter body oil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe holds up his sparkly gloves, \"How did I mish thish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyle and Jake are there beside me, lifting me up. Protective isn’t the right way to describe them. They moved to Boston the week after my birthday and we had planned family outings every second day until they finally got us to agree to move in with them. They even joined my boxing club. They\u0027re out of control. But I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" Lyle asks and glares at Angelo. Jake pulls off my gloves. I drop the guard into my hand and grimace. Lyle makes the same face. He has a thing with germs. It warms my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around the gym for Eli, but he isn’t there. He\u0027s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to leave for Easter. You ready?\" Lyle asks. I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Eli coming?\" Jake looks around the gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not sure.\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake looks worried, \"You guys are cool still right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blush, \"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance comes up smirking, \"You went down like a sack of potatoes Tink. We gotta work on your ducking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon scoffs, \"She lasted ten times longer than I thought she would and she hit him.\" I glance at Angelo and wink. He laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Race when I get back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"Then we start working on that plan of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"Thanks Angelo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods at me, \"Get that girl to call me again. She\u0027s not returning any of my texts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Shell, talking to the Lost Boys and shake my head, \"She\u0027s off the market dude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bummer. Have a good Easter Tink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get cleaned up, staring at my phone the entire time. I miss him, even if I asked for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe leave the gym. Stuart is standing at the SUV looking at his watch, \"Come on!\" He\u0027s waving his arms, motioning for us to get in. He drives like a madman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re gonna miss him if we don’t hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean over the seat between him and Jake, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart glances at me, \"Seatbelt.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-42.html","bookId":1888,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM"}
