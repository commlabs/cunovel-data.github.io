Normally, there isn\u0027t anything that piques their interest in the external passageways, but the Lv2 item that you have created ended up stimulating one of the Treasure Eaters\u0027 senses. It\u0027s much stronger than a normal Skeleton Soldier to the point that it\u0027s incomparable, but if you defeat it, you may be able to gain the treasure it has eaten.]\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Quest Reward: The Treasure Eater\u0027s treasure?]\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Guoooooooooh!]\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The moment that quest notification appeared, he heard a shriek from far beyond the passageways.

A human... no, a skeleton... had just adapted to the situation, yet a new trial appeared as if to interfere with that adaptation. Perhaps that Treasure Eater didn\u0027t appear naturally, and had been sent by God herself to torment him?\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All sorts of doubts momentarily rushed through his mind, but the most important thing right now was deciding his course of action. Lee Shin Woo double checked the location of the hideout and quickly moved. First, he planned to check the Treasure Eater with his own two (nonexistent) eyes, and fight if it seemed doable.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Treasure Eater - Lv2]\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Kuwoooooh!]\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nope, I gotta run.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But when he saw the bug that had broken through the passageway floor, Lee Shin Woo decided to run without hesitation.
