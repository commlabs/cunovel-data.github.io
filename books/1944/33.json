She could have accepted that, would have without a qualm, but then he had to go and ruin everything by kissing her. Damn, he was one good kisser. As far as Rachel was concerned, he should be arrested for possessing a lethal weapon—his lips. The way he\u0027d kissed her had been so spectacular he\u0027d left her in agony. That single kiss had made her ache even more for a romantic relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that she was desperate. Not like some of the women who came into the shop. Only that morning she\u0027d had a client, a working wife and mother, and listened to a litany of woes. The husband drank, was unemployed, hung around the house and was seeing another woman. The really crazy thing was that Rachel\u0027s client was mad at this jerk\u0027s girlfriend! In Rachel\u0027s opinion, this client was so worried about the trees, she didn\u0027t see the forest. Yeah, it was a cliche, but cliches were useful sometimes. Anyway, if her client did toss the bum out on the street where he belonged, he\u0027d soon find some other woman to support him. Rachel had seen it happen again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so involved in her thoughts that she almost didn\u0027t hear someone call her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rachel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned around and discovered Bruce Peyton walking rapidly toward her. \"Oh, hi,\" she said, her hands tightening around her car keys. Jolene had spent the previous Sunday at her place. She\u0027d picked up the little girl and dropped her off four hours later, with only a minimal exchange of words with Bruce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi.\" He grinned. \"Jolene had a really good time last Sunday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did, too.\" They\u0027d shopped, eaten pizza, watched videos, painted their toenails and chatted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She hasn\u0027t stopped talking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give her a call soon and we\u0027ll bake those chocolate chip cookies I mentioned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said something about that. I hope you\u0027ll send a few of them home with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Rachel moved toward her car. It\u0027d been a long week, and although she didn\u0027t have any special plans, she was eager to get home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you doing anything tonight?\" Bruce asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. Did you want to drop Jolene off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" he said hurriedly and shook his head. \"She\u0027s spending the night with a friend. It\u0027s a slumber party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about this Sunday afternoon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, she\u0027d like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rachel.\" He stopped her again, looking decidedly uncomfortable. \"Listen. Are you doing anything right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now?\" she repeated in a puzzled voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, do you have a dinner date or something like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to have dinner with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce was asking her out for dinner? \"You and me? Like a date?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Not an actual date, just dinner with a friend. If you want to. If you\u0027ve got other plans, that\u0027s fine. No big deal. I was thinking of the Taco Shack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got plans.\" A defensive edge sharpened his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s just that I\u0027m not sure this is a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a few questions of her own. \"Why are you asking me? Why now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head reared back as if her questions were unexpected. \"Why not now? Jolene\u0027s with her friends for the night, and the truth is I\u0027m not all that interested in my own company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt certainly wasn\u0027t any fun to sit in a restaurant alone. Rachel knew that because she\u0027d done it herself. And really, what would she do tonight other than watch TV and eat a microwave dinner? \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile smoothed out the frown lines on his face. \"That\u0027s great. Do you want to go with me or just meet there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel looked at her car and decided to meet Bruce at the restaurant. With anyone else, she would\u0027ve suggested she go home, shower and change clothes. But Bruce seemed to be in a rush. It was already nearly seven. Rachel had done a perm late in the afternoon, which had taken longer than she\u0027d expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she arrived at the Taco Shack, Bruce had found a place at one of the picnic tables. The menu was posted on the wall above the counter. Rachel knew everything listed on it, since she stopped in at least once a week for takeout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you like?\" Bruce asked when she joined him. He gazed up at the menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like the enchilada platter,\" she said. \"One chicken and one cheese with extra salsa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce smiled, nodding. \"That\u0027s my favorite, too, but I prefer two beef enchiladas.\" He removed his wallet from his back pocket as he approached the counter. The line wasn\u0027t too long for a Friday night, although Rachel suspected that in another ten or fifteen minutes, there\u0027d be a wait for a table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce placed their order and carried a tray with sodas to their table. He unloaded their drinks and pulled out the chair across from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel suddenly realized that Bruce had come to the mall just to see her, since he\u0027d been walking in as she was walking out. Still, she found it hard to fathom that after all this time, after their numerous conversations, he actually wanted to take her to dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jolene told me you went out on your date with the bachelor,\" he commented, then sipped his cola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d it go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged and reached for her diet drink. \"All right, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to see him again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was mighty curious about her time with Nate Olsen. \"Probably not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her, frowning slightly. \"You sound disappointed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. I like Nate. He\u0027s a little young for me, but—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s younger than you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel burst out laughing, attracting the attention of those sitting close by. \"You sound like my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\" He lowered his head as though embarrassed. \"Forget I said anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce seemed jealous, which shocked her. \"Bruce?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s all this about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel narrowed her eyes. \"You know what I mean. Let\u0027s not play games, all right? When you came to the mall this evening, it wasn\u0027t because you had some errand. It was to seek me out, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything wrong with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis defenses were up again, but so were hers. \"Well, no, but why pretend otherwise? Just be honest, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his hands, palms up. \"I am being honest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To yourself, I mean,\" she elaborated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress, a high-school kid judging by her appearance, brought their enchilada platters. Rachel glanced down at hers and Bruce looked at his and in a perfectly synchronized movement, they switched plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mind if we eat before we continue this inquisition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a quick grin. Sliding her fork over the cheese enchilada, Rachel cut off her first bite. \"I didn\u0027t intend to give you the third degree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing is,\" Bruce admitted between bites, \"I\u0027m not exactly sure why I asked you to dinner. I dropped Jolene off at her friend\u0027s house and here it was Friday night, and I didn\u0027t I feel like spending the evening alone. I got a hankering for enchiladas, but I didn\u0027t want to take up an entire table just for myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I usually order mine to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to think of someone who might be interested in coming with me, and you were the first person who popped into my head. So I figured I\u0027d see if you were available.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel wasn\u0027t sure she should be flattered. At the moment she was too perplexed to figure it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jolene likes you a lot,\" Bruce said halfway through their meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel was fond of the little girl, too, but her feelings about the child\u0027s father weren\u0027t quite as straightforward. Might as well find out what was going on here. \"Do you like me, Bruce?\" she asked bluntly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously. I didn\u0027t stop to analyze it. I thought you\" might be available and I was right. I\u0027m glad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, too,\" she said. \"I was headed home for reruns of NYPD Blue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t go bar-hopping with your friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I learned a long time ago that a bar isn\u0027t a good place to meet men.\" Not decent men, anyway, she amended to herself. Problem was, she didn\u0027t know where to meet men. She was wary of the Internet and not a club-joiner. She enjoyed crafts but she had yet to meet a single guy hanging out at a quilting bee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you had many serious relationships?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"A few.\" She\u0027d dated a guy back in her early twenties, discovered he was already married and dropped him instantly. That kind of grief she could live without. Ever since then, she\u0027d been careful. Perhaps too careful... \"What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze fell to the table. \"There\u0027s never been anyone but Stephanie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he said his dead wife\u0027s name led Rachel to believe there never would be anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to give this a shot,\" he said unexpectedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes wide. \"Are you saying you\u0027d like to go out with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so surprising?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel needed a sip of her soda to ease the sudden dry-ness in her throat. \"Frankly, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you be willing to see me now and again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To what purpose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce\u0027s mouth narrowed. \"You\u0027re the kind of person who reads the last page of the book before you buy it, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was precisely what she did. She laughed. \"As a matter of fact, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought so. I don\u0027t know to what end. We can agree to play this by ear. Is that okay with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess.\" She considered it for a moment. \"Tell me something first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asking me out tonight—did it have anything to do with Nate Olsen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question seemed to trouble him, because he didn\u0027t answer immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably,\" he said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least he was honest about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he asks you out again, would you go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was her turn to think matters over. \"He won\u0027t. He\u0027s involved with someone else.\" She was gathering up her purse as she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sidestepping the question,\" he said. He held the restaurant door for her and they walked into the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either you don\u0027t want to answer it or you\u0027re afraid to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather not discuss Nate, okay? You know,\" she said confidentially, leaning toward him, \"it would\u0027ve been a perfectly wonderful night if he hadn\u0027t kissed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\" She waved her hand dismissively. \"It\u0027s too hard to explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I shouldn\u0027t try to kiss you, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be too hasty,\" Rachel said with a mischievous smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t kiss her. Standing in the well-lit parking area outside the restaurant, it would have been awkward to do anything more than exchange pleasantries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you still want Jolene to come over on Sunday?\" Rachel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Can I see you then, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel nodded. Bruce opened her car door and she slid into the driver\u0027s seat. \"Thank you for dinner.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-33.html","bookId":1944,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM"}
