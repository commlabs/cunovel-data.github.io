Very fortunate, you having that, by the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearning that Gideon did indeed own the building Anne Lucas worked in hadn’t surprised me too much. My husband needed control, and having that sort of hold over the businesses of both the Lucases was just like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It shouldn’t have to be said,” Arash went on, “but when confronted by crazy, Do Not Engage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon arched his brow at me. It chafed, but he was right. He’d told me so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attorney shot warning glances at both of us. “I’ll work on getting her erroneous assault complaint dismissed and see if I can leverage it to our advantage by filing a counterclaim of harassment. I’ll also try for protection orders for both of you and Cary Taylor, but regardless, you all need to stay far, far away from her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely,” I assured him, taking the opportunity to palm my husband’s fine, taut ass as I passed behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shot me a wry glance over his shoulder. I blew him a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt tickled me that he would feel even the slightest bit of jealousy. The most impressive thing about Arash was that he held his own next to Gideon; he certainly couldn’t surpass him. While I’d seen that Arash could be every bit as threatening as my husband, it wasn’t his default setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon was always dangerous. No one ever mistook him for anything else. I was intensely attracted to that about him, understood that I would never tame him. And God, was he gorgeous. He knew it, too. Knew how dazzled I was by him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the green-eyed monster could still get the better of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll stay for dinner?” I asked Arash. “No idea what I’m making yet, but we ruined your plans and I feel bad about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s still early.” Gideon took a deep swallow of his wine. “He can make other plans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d love to stay for dinner,” Arash said, grinning wickedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t resist copping another feel, so I reached around my husband to get my wine and caressed his thigh while I was at it. I brushed my breasts across his back as I withdrew my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning quick, Gideon’s hand caught my wrist. He squeezed and a shiver of arousal slid through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose blue eyes turned on me. “You want to misbehave?” he asked silkily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was instantly desperate for him. Because he looked so cool and savagely civilized, completely contained while he basically asked if I wanted to fuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea how much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a faint buzz. Still holding me captive by the wrist, Gideon looked across the island at Arash. “Pass my phone over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArash looked at me and shook his head, even as he turned to dig Gideon’s phone out of the suit jacket on the bar stool. “How you put up with him, I will never know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s great in bed,” I quipped, “and he’s not surly there, so …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon yanked me into his side and bit my earlobe. My nipples tightened into hard points. He growled almost inaudibly against my neck, though I doubted he cared if Arash heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathless, I pulled away and tried to focus on cooking. I hadn’t taken over Gideon’s kitchen before, hadn’t a clue where anything was or what he had stocked, aside from what I’d glimpsed while getting coffee ready for the police. I found an onion, and located a knife and cutting board. Grateful as I was for the distraction, I had to do something else besides getting us both revved up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” Gideon said into the phone with a sigh. “I’m coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up. “Do you have to go somewhere?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Angus is bringing Lucky up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s Lucky?” Arash asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gideon’s dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawyer looked suitably shocked. “You have a dog?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do now,” Gideon said ruefully, leaving the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he returned a moment later with a squirming Lucky happily licking his jaw, I melted. There he stood, in his vest and shirtsleeves, a titan of industry, a global powerhouse, and he was being overwhelmed by the cutest puppy ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicking up his phone, I unlocked it and snapped a picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was going into a frame, ASAP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I was at it, I texted Cary. Hey, it’s Eva. Want to come over to the penthouse for dinner?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited a beat for him to reply, then set Gideon’s phone down and went back to chopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should’ve listened to you about Anne,” I told Gideon as we returned to the living room after saying good-bye to Arash. “I’m sorry.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-60.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
