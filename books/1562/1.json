Pine Cove, sleepy California coastal village\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; a toy town, really, with more art galleries than gas stations, more wine-tasting rooms than hardware stores\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; lay there, as inviting as a drunken prom queen, as Christmas loomed, only five days away. Christmas was coming, and with Christmas this year, would come the Child. Both were vast and irresistible, and miraculous. Pine Cove was expecting only one of the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is not to say that the locals didn\u0027t get into the Christmas spirit. The two weeks before and after Christmas provided a welcome wave of cash into the town\u0027s coffers, tourist-starved since summer. Every waitress dusted off her Santa hat and clip-on reindeer antlers and checked to make sure that there were four good pens in her apron. Hotel clerks steeled themselves for the rage of last-minute overbookings, while housekeepers switched from their normal putrid baby-powder air fresheners to a more festive putrid pine and cinnamon. Down at the Pine Cove Boutique they put a \"Holiday Special\" sign on the hideous reindeer sweater and marked it up for the tenth consecutive year. The Elks, Moose, Masons, and VFWs, who were basically the same bunch of drunk old guys, planned furiously for their annual Christmas parade down Cypress Street, the theme of which this year would be Patriotism in the Bed of a Pickup (mainly because that had been the theme of their Fourth of July parade and everyone still had the decorations). Many Pine Covers even volunteered to man the Salvation Army kettles down in front of the post office and the Thrifty-Mart in two-hour shifts, sixteen hours a day. Dressed in their red suits and fake beards, they rang their bells like they were going for dog-spit gold at the Pavlov Olympics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give up the cash, you cheap son of a bitch,\" said Lena Marquez, who was working the kettle that Monday, five days before Christmas. Lena was following Dale Pearson, Pine Cove\u0027s evil developer, through the parking lot, ringing the bejeezus out of him as he headed for his truck. On his way into the Thrifty-Mart, he\u0027d nodded to her and said, \"Catch you on the way out,\" but when he emerged eight minutes later, carrying a sack of groceries and a bag of ice, he blew by her kettle like she was using it to render tallow from building inspectors\u0027 butts and he needed to escape the stench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like you can\u0027t afford a couple of bucks for the less fortunate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rang her bell especially hard right by his ear and he spun around, swinging the bag of ice at her about hip level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena jumped back. She was thirty-eight, lean, dark-skinned, with the delicate neck and finely set jawline of a flamenco dancer; her long black hair was coiled into two Princess Leia cinnabuns on either side of her Santa hat. \"You can\u0027t take a swing at Santa! That\u0027s wrong in so many ways that I don\u0027t have time to enumerate them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean to count them,\" Dale said, the soft winter sunlight glinting off a new set of veneers he\u0027d just had installed on his front teeth. He was fifty-two, almost completely bald, and had strong carpenter\u0027s shoulders that were still wide and square, despite the beer gut hanging below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it\u0027s wrong\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; you\u0027re wrong\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; and you\u0027re cheap,\" and with that Lena put the bell next to his ear again and shook it like a red-suited terrier shaking the life out of a screaming brass rat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDale cringed at the sound and swung the ten-pound bag of ice in a great underhanded arc that caught Lena in the solar plexus and sent her backpedaling across the parking lot, gasping for breath. That\u0027s when the ladies at BULGES called the cops\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; well, cop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBULGES was a women\u0027s fitness center located just above the parking lot of the Thrifty-Mart, and from their treadmills and stair-climbing machines, the BULGES members could watch the ins and outs of the local market without feeling as if they were actively spying. So what had started as a moment of sheer glee and a mild adrenaline surge for the six of them who were watching as Lena chased Dale through the parking lot, turned quickly to shock as the evil developer thwacked the Latin Santa-ette in the breadbasket with a satchel of minicubes. Five of the six merely missed a step or gasped, but Georgia Bauman\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; who had her treadmill cranked up to eight miles per hour at that very moment, because she was trying to lose fifteen pounds by Christmas and fit into a red-sequined sheath cocktail dress her husband had bought for her in a fit of sexual idealism\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; bowled backward off her treadmill and landed in a colorful spandex tangle of yoga students who had been practicing on the mats behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow, my ass chakra!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s you\u0027re root chakra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feels like my ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see that?

Yes, well, I just glanced out the window here and I noticed that there might be a problem over at the Thrifty-Mart. Well, I don\u0027t want to meddle, but let\u0027s just say that a certain contractor just hit one of the Salvation Army Santas with a bag of ice. Well, I\u0027ll look for your car, then.\" She flipped the phone shut. \"He\u0027s on his way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheophilus Crowe\u0027s mobile phone played eight bars of \"Tangled Up in Blue\" in an irritating electronic voice that sounded like a choir of suffering houseflies, or Jiminy Cricket huffing helium, or, well, you know, Bob Dylan\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; anyway, by the time he got the device open, five people in the produce section of the Thrifty-Mart were giving him the hairy eyeball hard enough to wilt the arugula right there in his cart. He grinned as if to say, Sorry, I hate these things, too, but what aw you gonna do? then he answered, \"Constable Crowe,\" just to remind everyone that he wasn\u0027t dickmg around here, he was THE LAW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the parking lot of the Thrifty-Mart? Okay, I\u0027ll be right there\u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, this was convenient. One thing about being the resident lawman in a town of only five thousand people\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; you were never far from the trouble. Theo parked his cart on the end of the aisle and loped by the registers and out the automatic doors to the parking lot (He was a denim- and flannel-clad praying mantis of a man, six-six, one-eighty, and he only had three speeds, amble, lope, and still). Outside he found Lena Marquez doubled over and gasping for breath. Her ex-husband, Dale Pearson, was stepping into his four-wheel-drive pickup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right there, Dale. Wait,\" Theo said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo ascertained that Lena had only had the wind knocked out of her and was going to be okay, then addressed the stocky contractor, who had paused with one boot on the running board, as if he\u0027d be on his way as soon as the hot air cleared out of the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The crazy bitch hit me with that bell of hers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did not,\" gasped Lena\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a report you hit her with a bag of ice, Dale. That\u0027s assault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDale Pearson looked around quickly and spotted the crowd of women gathered by the window over at the gym. They all looked away, heading for the various machines they had been on when the debacle unfolded. \"Ask them. They\u0027ll tell you she had that bell right upside my head. I just reacted out of self-defense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he\u0027d donate when he came out of the store, then he didn\u0027t,\" Lena said, her breath coming back. \"There\u0027s an implied contract there. He violated it. And I didn\u0027t hit him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a fucking nutcase.\" Dale said it like he was declaring water wet\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; like it was just understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo looked from one of them to the other. He\u0027d dealt with these two before, but thought it had all come to rest when they\u0027d divorced five years ago. (He\u0027d been constable of Pine Cove for fourteen years\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; he\u0027d seen the wrong side of a lot of couples.) First rule in a domestic situation was separate the parties, but that appeared to have already been accomplished. You weren\u0027t supposed to take sides, but since Theo had a soft spot for nutcases\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; he\u0027d married one himself\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; he decided to make a judgment call and focus his attention on Dale. Besides, the guy was an asshole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo patted Lena\u0027s back and loped over to Dale\u0027s truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t waste your time, hippie,\" Dale said. \"I\u0027m done.\" He climbed into his truck and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHippie? Theo thought. Hippie? He\u0027d cut his ponytail years ago. He\u0027d stopped wearing Birkenstocks. He\u0027d even stopped smoking pot. Where did this guy get off calling him a hippie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHippie? he said to himself, then: \"Hey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDale started his truck and put it into gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo stepped up on the running board, leaned over the windshield, and started tapping on it with a quarter he\u0027d fished from his jeans pocket. \"Don\u0027t leave, Dale.\" Tap, tap, tap. \"You leave now, I\u0027ll put a warrant out for your arrest.\" Tap, tap, tap. Theo was pissed now\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; he was sure of it. Yes, this was definitely anger now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDale threw the truck into park and hit the electric window button. \"What? What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lena wants to press charges for assault\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; maybe assault with a deadly weapon. I think you\u0027d better rethink leaving right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deadly weapon? It was a bag of ice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo shook his head, affected a whimsical storyteller\u0027s tone: \"A ten-pound bag of ice. Listen, Dale, as I drop a ten-pound block of ice on the courtroom floor in front of the jury. Can you hear it? Can\u0027t you just see the jury cringe as I smash a honeydew melon on the defense attorney\u0027s table with a ten-pound block of ice? Not a deadly weapon? \u0027Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this man, this reprobate, this redneck, this\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; if I may\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; clump-filled-cat-box-of-a-man, struck a defenseless woman\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; a woman who out of the kindness of her heart was collecting for the poor, a woman who was only\u0026nbsp; - \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s not a block of ice, it\u0027s\u0026nbsp; - \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo raised a finger in the air. \"Not another word, Dale, not until I read you your rights.\" Theo could tell he was getting to Dale\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; veins were starting to pulse in the contractor\u0027s temples and his bald head was turning bright pink. Hippie, huh? \"Lena is definitely pressing charges, aren\u0027t you, Lena?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena had made her way to the side of the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Lena said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bitch!\" Theo said\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; it slipped out before he could stop himself.

He pulled his badge wallet out of his back pocket but decided that was a little late for ID, since he\u0027d known Dale for nearly twenty years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and I\u0027m a Caribou,\" Dale said, with more pride than he really should have had about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll forget all about it if he puts a hundred bucks in the kettle,\" Lena said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re nuts, woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Christmas, Dale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck Christmas and fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, there\u0027s no need for that kind of talk, Dale,\" Theo said, going for the peace in peace officer. \"You can just step out of the truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifty bucks in the kettle and he can go,\" Lena said. \"It\u0027s for the needy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo whipped around and looked at her. \"You can\u0027t plea-bargain in the parking lot of the Thrifty-Mart.

They can get a job like the rest of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo was sure he had handcuffs in the Volvo\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; or were they still on the bedpost at home? \"That is not the way we\u0026nbsp; - \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forty!\" Lena shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done!\" Dale said. He pulled two twenties from his wallet, wadded them up, and threw them out the window so they bounced off of Theo Crowe\u0027s chest.

As the big red pickup passed Theo\u0027s Volvo station wagon, parked twenty yards up the lot, a bag of ice came flying out the window and exploded against the Volvo\u0027s tailgate, showering the parking lot with cubes but otherwise doing no damage whatsoever. \"Merry Christmas, you psycho bitch!\" Dale shouted out the window as he turned onto the street. \"And to all a good night! Hippie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena had tucked the wadded bills into her Santa suit and was squeezing Theo\u0027s shoulder as the red truck roared out of sight. \"Thanks for coming to my rescue, Theo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much of a rescue.
