A basin to relieve yourself in on your right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lainey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine. I\u0027ll be back in ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah sat up. Sometime during the night, Red Hair had freed his right hand. He explored the mask that covered his face. Thick leather straps criss-crossed from back to front, holding it in place. A small padlock prevented him from removing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefeated, he reached for the glass of water and drained it in a single swallow, then reached for the basin, need outweighing his pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs promised, Red Hair was back in ten minutes. \"Hold still now,\" he said curtly, \"I\u0027m gonna draw some blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have saved yourself the trouble and taken it last night,\" Micah muttered. \"It was flowing freely then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his surprise, Red Hair laughed. \"I never realized aliens had a sense of humor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never realized earthlings were so barbaric,\" Micah replied contemptuously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, hardly breathing, until he felt Red Hair\u0027s hand on his arm, and then he grabbed the man\u0027s wrist and gave it a cruel twist reminiscent of the hold that was commonly used by security officers on the prison planet of Enguath to subdue inmates. \"Release me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way.\" Red Hair groaned as Micah applied pressure on his arm. \"Go ahead, break my arm. Break my neck. It won\u0027t do you any good. I don\u0027t have my keys with me, and this place is soundproof. You\u0027ll both starve to death before anyone finds you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah\u0027s grip tightened on Red Hair\u0027s wrist. Everything the man said was true and yet it was tempting, so tempting...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering an oath, Micah released his hold on Red Hair, then fell back against the wall of the cage, his whole body tense as he waited for the earthling to retaliate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut other than shackling his right hand to the wall again, Red Hair didn\u0027t seem inclined toward vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah felt the prick of a syringe as the man drew some blood. He heard Red Hair\u0027s footsteps as he left the cage, the sound of the key turning in the lock, and then there was only silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey? Fear clawed at his insides when she didn\u0027t reply.Lainey, can you hear me? Please , cominza, answer me if you can .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you all right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Micah heard the revulsion in her voice.He\u0027s examining me .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah clenched his fists as he imagined Red Hair\u0027s hands on Lainey, touching her intimately. He felt the rage well within him, the urge to kill surprising him in its intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his shame, Micah remembered the exhilaration he had experienced when he destroyed Red Hair\u0027s two companions. Killing went against everything he had ever been taught, and yet he had not know a moment\u0027s regret at taking the lives of those two men. They had threatened Lainey, and he knew he would gladly do it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the power rise within him, felt its heat build. Immediately, he forced himself to relax. The mask was made of metal. Should he unleash his power, the heat would incinerate his face before it burned through the mask. He wondered how Red Hair knew such a thing, and then, in a flash of intuition, he realized that the alien whose skeleton stood in the corner had incinerated himself rather than submit to Red Hair\u0027s experiments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah, no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey\u0027s fear burst into his mind. Too late, he realized she had been reading his thoughts, that she was afraid he was thinking of doing the same thing rather than allow Red Hair to examine him further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey, don\u0027t be afraid. I won\u0027t leave you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePromise me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI promise, Micah said, but he knew in the depths of his soul that if it wasn\u0027t for Lainey and the child, he would destroy himself rather than submit to more of the earthling\u0027s crude experiments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next few days were like a nightmare that wouldn\u0027t end. Red Hair\u0027s constant cheerfulness made Lainey want to scream. He spent hours at her bedside, trying to convince her of how important his work was, of what he hoped to gain. Chief among his goals was the need to prove to a doubting world that aliens existed. There were other extraterrestrials prowling the earth, he said, he was sure of it. And he would find them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was her child that was Red\u0027s primary interest, and it was that topic that made up the bulk of his conversation as he wondered, over and over again, whether she carried a boy or a girl, if it would look completely human, or if it would have some of Micah\u0027s alien characteristics. Or if, in blending two races, she would deliver a monster. He speculated often on that, too. Would it be inhuman, fit only for a sideshow, or be born mercifully dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes Red took her into the lab and made her watch while he examined Micah, wondering aloud how it was possible for their two races to be so alike, and yet so different. Red constantly pestered Micah for information about Xanthia, its inhabitants and their lifestyle, even though Micah refused to answer him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed took copious notes, recording everything he did, jotting down Micah\u0027s reactions to various drugs, to pain, to drastic changes in heat and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took numerous blood samples in an effort to learn why Micah\u0027s blood was brown; he took skin samples to try to determine what caused the blue glow to darken when Micah was agitated and faded when he was at rest or asleep. He took X-rays and countless photographs. And made more notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah communicated telepathically with Lainey whenever he had the chance, but Red Hair kept him heavily sedated most of the time, and she realized that Red kept Micah that way as much as possible because he was afraid of Micah\u0027s strength and power, even though Micah\u0027s hands were chained to the wall and he was locked in a cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been Red\u0027s prisoners for five days when Lainey went into labor. It began with a small twinge in her back, a slight pain that gradually grew stronger and more intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed was ecstatic when her water broke a few hours later. He practically danced around the bed as he freed her hands and helped her into a chair, warning her to stay put while he gathered up the soiled sheets and replaced them with clean ones, then removed her clothes and dropped a pale green hospital gown over her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was clean and dry and settled into bed once again, he went into the lab and gathered his instruments together. Returning to the bedroom, he pulled a baby blanket out of the dresser drawer, along with diapers, baby powder, and a soft flannel gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey writhed on the bed, wracked by pain and fear. What would Red do with her once the baby was born? Would she be dispensable then, a witness to be disposed of? Helpless and afraid, she cried out as the time between contractions grew shorter and the pains grew stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath seemed to hover around her as the pains went on and on. Fleeting thoughts of dying in childbirth began to cross her mind, and she wondered if she would die in labor and save Red the trouble of disposing of her. Near exhaustion, she prayed that it would be over soon, that Red would allow her to hold her child, Micah\u0027s child, before she died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey, don\u0027t be afraid. Try to relax. Don\u0027t fight the pain. Relax... relax... everything will be all right...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice filled her mind, sure and strong, giving her hope, a lifeline to cling to, as her body sought to expel the child it had sheltered for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs from far away, she heard Red urging her to bear down, to push just once more. There was a blinding flash, and she realized he was taking more of his infernal pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed as the head crowned. A moment later, she heard an infant\u0027s cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a boy!\" Red said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see him. Is he all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect,\" Red said jubilantly. \"Just perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was. Tears filled Lainey\u0027s eyes as she gazed down at her son. He was small and beautiful, with pale golden brown skin, curly black hair, and his father\u0027s silver-blue eyes. An extra bit of webbing stretched between his thumb and forefinger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched through half-closed eyes as Red clamped the cord, then cut it. Taking the baby, he washed and diapered the infant as though he had been doing it all his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped the nightgown over the baby\u0027s head, wrapped it in a blue flannel blanket, then placed the boy in the top drawer of the dresser while he took care of the afterbirth, washed Lainey, and helped her into a clean gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen that was done, he laid the boy in Lainey\u0027s arms, then stood by, looking as proud as if he were the father, while she nursed the baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no words to describe the incredible joy that filled Lainey\u0027s heart as her son nuzzled her breast. For a moment, she forgot the hours of pain, the fear, the uncertainty of the future as she cuddled the tiny miracle in her arms. For once, she didn\u0027t mind when Red snapped another picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until Red leaned over the bed and reached for the baby that reality returned, and with it a fiercely protective surge of mother love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a wordless cry, Lainey grabbed the water pitcher beside the bed and smashed it over the man\u0027s head, satisfaction zinging through her when, with a muffled grunt, Red toppled to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the dull ache that accompanied her every move, she clasped her son to her breast and slid out of bed. Dropping onto one knee, she began going through Red\u0027s pockets, looking for the keys that would free Micah, but all she found was a set of car keys, and the key to the handcuffs Red had used on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClutching his car keys, she climbed to her feet and hurried into the laboratory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Micah!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lainey?\" He turned toward the sound of her voice. \"What\u0027s happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knocked Red out. Do you know where he keeps the keys to that cage and the shackles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the baby pressed to her shoulder, Lainey searched the lab, her frustration growing by the moment. Damn, where had Red put those keys?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cry of mingled triumph and revulsion escaped her lips when she finally spied what she was looking for dangling from one of the skeleton\u0027s bony fingers. With a shudder, she plucked the keys from the skeleton\u0027s hand and crossed the floor to the cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took several tries before she found the key that unlocked the door. Placing the baby on the floor beside her, she knelt down beside Micah and removed the mask from his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared up at her, blinking against the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah nodded, his gaze moving to the blanket-wrapped bundle on the floor beside Lainey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took another few precious moments to free Micah\u0027s hands. \"Come on,\" Lainey urged, \"we\u0027ve got to get out of here before he wakes up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Micah was reaching for the baby, drawing the blanket away from the infant\u0027s face.My son , he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey\u0027s heart swelled with love as she looked at the two men in her life, but there was no time for father and son to get acquainted now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Micah, we\u0027ve got to go.\" Rising, her legs still weak and wobbly from the birth, she took the baby from Micah so he could stand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the wall for support, Micah climbed to his feet. He could feel the physical effects of the drug that limited his power wearing off and he took several deep breaths, hoping it would help clear his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready?\" Lainey asked anxiously. \"We\u0027ll have to take his car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah moved away from the wall and took another deep breath. Caught up in the excitement of the birth, Red had forgotten about the sedative he usually administered in the afternoon. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey whirled around, felt the color drain from her face when she saw Red standing in the doorway, one hand pressed over the gash in his forehead, his other hand fisted around a snub-nosed revolver whose barrel looked as large and deadly as that of a cannon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attempted murder and grand theft auto,\" Red mused. \"Not a very nice way to repay the man who helped bring your baby into the world.\" He wagged the gun back and forth. \"Step away from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be a shame if I missed the alien and hit the child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t!\" Lainey exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed\u0027s eyes were as cold as winter frost. \"Are you willing to take that chance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey glanced at Micah. At his nod, she moved away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed was going to kill Micah. The knowledge of what was going to happen, and her inability to stop it, filled her with such excruciating pain she was certain her soul was being torn to shreds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slow smile of satisfaction was spreading over Red\u0027s face as his finger curled around the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey stared at Micah, imprinting his face on her heart as she waited for the gunshot that would end Micah\u0027s life and destroy all her hopes for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the gunshot never came. Instead, a high-pitched whine filled the room, ringing in her ears, sending icy shivers down her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby began to cry and she cradled him against her breast, wishing she could shut out the awful sound of Red\u0027s anguished scream, a heart-wrenching shriek that seemed to have no beginning and no end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, abruptly, there was only silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to turn around when Micah\u0027s voice stopped her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Lainey,\" he said, his voice flat. \"Don\u0027t look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Micah stood there with his head down, feeling the hatred, the power, recede.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew a deep, calming breath, and then he crossed the room and placed his arm around Lainey\u0027s waist. He could feel her whole body trembling as he pried Red\u0027s car keys from her fist. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Micah unlocked Red\u0027s car, helped Lainey inside, and closed the door. Going around to the driver\u0027s side, he slid behind the wheel, took a deep breath, and turned the key in the ignition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey looked at him dubiously. \"Are you sure you know what you\u0027re doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve watched you often enough,\" he replied with a shrug, and put the car in gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ditched the car two blocks away from home. Lainey stood in the shadows, unable to stop shivering, while Micah took a rag and went over the car inside and out, wiping away their fingerprints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, ignoring her protests, he swung her into his arms and carried her and the baby home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was asleep by the time they reached the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah sat beside Lainey\u0027s bed, his son cradled in his arms. His son. He couldn\u0027t get over it - the miracle of life, the wonder of holding a child,his child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at Lainey. She was sleeping peacefully, one hand pillowing her cheek. He thought of the physical pain she had gone through to bring his son into the world, the fear she\u0027d experienced when Red abducted her, her courage in simply accepting him for who and what he was, for being willing to love him in spite of everything. She was a brave woman, with the heart of a warrior and the soul of an angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed down at his son, lightly stroking the boy\u0027s downy cheek, fingering the thatch of curly black hair. Never in his life had he known such a sense of awe, such a feeling of protectiveness, as he felt now. He tried to imagine what the child\u0027s life would be like, but he couldn\u0027t imagine how it would be to grow up in a house instead of in a controlled environment, couldn\u0027t begin to fathom experiencing a mother\u0027s love and tenderness, a father\u0027s concern. How would his son feel when he learned that he was different from other children, that his father came from a faraway star?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould his son be able to accept the fact that he was different, or would he resent it? And what of his physical differences? The size of his ears, the webbing on his hands, the slight slant of his eyes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah stared out the window. And what of the power? Had his son inherited the inner power that Xanthians were blessed with? If he had, would Micah be able to teach him to use it with restraint? Would his son consider his innate power a curse, or a blessing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many questions, so many unknown factors to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing down, Micah saw the baby looking up at him, his expression strangely wise for one so young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in good time, his son seemed to be saying, and Micah smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All in good time,\" he repeated, determined to enjoy every moment he was allowed to spend with Lainey and their son, afraid, deep inside, that the day would come when he\u0027d have to tell them both good-bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey called her parents first thing the next morning. Dolores and Ralph were at the house less than thirty minutes later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores blinked back tears of joy and relief as she hugged her daughter. \"Lainey, thank God, we were so worried. We called the police, but we had no idea where to tell them to look for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right Mom, I\u0027m fine, honest. I\u0027m just so glad it\u0027s all over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores nodded. \"Oh! Ralph, did you remember to call the police and tell them she was home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph nodded. \"They thought I was nuts when I said she\u0027d spent a couple nights at a friend\u0027s and we\u0027d forgotten about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Daddy,\" Lainey said, laughing. \"Was that the best you could think of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot, I was lucky to think at all, what with being a new grandfather and all. Where\u0027s that grandson of mine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah went to make coffee while the new grandparents took turns holding their new grandson, counting his tiny fingers and toes, marveling over how perfect he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t look much different from other new babies,\" Dolores remarked. \"I don\u0027t think anyone will be able to tell he\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced toward the kitchen, glad that Micah was out of the room. \"It\u0027s still so hard to believe that he\u0027s an alien. I mean...\" She made a dismissive gesture with her hand. \"The baby looks perfectly normal except for that bit of webbing on his hands. His ears are only a tiny bit smaller than ordinary. And lots of people have eyes that slant a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t help but worry, though,\" Ralph said. \"What happens when he gets sick?\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph looked up as Micah entered the room carrying a tray with four cups and the coffee pot. \"We don\u0027t know how he\u0027ll react to normal childhood diseases like measles and chicken pox. I mean, they might be fatal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll just have to wait and see,\" Lainey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My people have done numerous studies on such things,\" Micah remarked as he poured the coffee. \"Our scientists have determined that a child born of an earthling and a Xanthian would be immune to whatever diseases the mother and father are immune to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph looked skeptical. \"But they don\u0027t know that for sure, do they? I mean, it\u0027s just conjecture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah nodded. \"Of course. To my knowledge, no Xanthian has ever joined with a member of another race.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, after the baby had fallen asleep at Lainey\u0027s breast, Dolores and Ralph insisted that Lainey tell them everything that had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah sat back, the coffee in his cup growing cold, his gaze fixed on Lainey\u0027s face as she told her story. She made light of her fears, glossed over the pain of childbirth, but Ralph and Dolores weren\u0027t fooled, and in the end she told them all of it, how scared she\u0027d been, not only for herself, but for Micah and the baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe related how Red had kept her handcuffed to the bed, how he had kept Micah locked in a cage. She spoke of the innumerable photos the man had taken, the tests he had performed on Micah, the copious notes he had taken, recording everything from Micah\u0027s height and weight to the amount of food and water he consumed each day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told of being in labor, how frightened she had been, not only of the pain, which was worse than she had ever imagined, but for her child\u0027s life. Her words came faster as she told how she had hit Red over the head with a pitcher, how she had taken his keys and freed Micah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that man?\" Ralph asked, sitting forward. \"Where is he now?\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead.\" Micah said, taking part in the story for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph glanced at Lainey, then back at Micah. \"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah met Ralph\u0027s gaze squarely. \"There is none.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey\u0027s mother stared at Micah, a wordless sound of horror rising in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph St. John held Micah\u0027s gaze a moment and then looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores took Lainey\u0027s hand in hers, but it was Micah to whom she directed her question. \"What are you going to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s up to Lainey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll stay here,\" Lainey replied. \"The three men who knew about Micah are dead. We should be safe now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Ralph said dubiously. \"What about Red\u0027s notes? The pictures?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we\u0027re to stay here, I\u0027ll have to go back and destroy them,\" Micah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go with you,\" Ralph said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it would be better if I went alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Micah\u0027s right, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go tonight, if you\u0027ll stay with Lainey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spent the rest of the day trying to decide on a name for the baby. Dolores wanted to name the baby Ralph, after his grandfather; Ralph wanted to name the baby Monroe, after his own father; Micah said it was up to Lainey. In the end, they named the baby Micah Ralph Monroe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s quite a handle for such a little tyke,\" Ralph remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll grow into it,\" Lainey said, smiling up at Micah. \"In the meantime, we\u0027ll call him Mike, for short.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike,\" Dolores said, grinning as the baby\u0027s tiny fist closed around her finger. \"I like that. What do you think, Micah?\" she asked, glancing up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Micah had eyes only for Lainey, and the infant cradled in her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m the luckiest creature in the universe.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sunlight-moonlight/page-24.html","bookId":2306,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:52 PM"}
