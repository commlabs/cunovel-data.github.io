{"id":110188,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\u003cp\u003eDavid\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few hours later, a pile of scrap metal stood in one corner of the clearing. Each segment of rail took an hour to get free, and required all six of them to carry. The railroad ties sat in another pile; at least all the Smokies\u0027 wood didn\u0027t come from live trees. Tally couldn\u0027t believe how much they had salvaged, literally tearing the track from the forest\u0027s grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe also couldn\u0027t believe her hands. They were red and raw, screaming with pain and covered with blisters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks pretty bad,\" David said, glancing over Tally\u0027s shoulder as she stared at them in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feelspretty bad,\" she said. \"But I didn\u0027t notice until just now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid laughed. \"Hard work\u0027s a good distraction. But maybe you should take a break. I was just about to scout up the line for another spot to salvage. Want to come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" she said gratefully. The thought of picking up the powerjack again made her hands throb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving the others at the clearing, they hoverboarded up and over the gnarled trees, following the barely visible track below into dense forest. David rode low in the canopy, gracefully avoiding branches and vines as if this were a familiar slalom course. Tally noticed that, like his shoes, his clothes wereall handmade. City clothing only used seams and stitching for decoration, but David\u0027s jacket seemed to be cut together from a dozen patches of leather, all different shades and shapes. Its patchwork appearance reminded her of Frankenstein\u0027s monster, which led to a terrible thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if it were made ofreal leather, like in the olden days? Skins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered. He couldn\u0027t be wearing a bunch of dead animals. They weren\u0027t savages here. And she had to admit that the coat fit him well, the leather following the line of his shoulders like an old friend. And it fended off the whips of branches better than her microfiber dorm jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid slowed as they came into a clearing, and Tally saw that they had reached a wall of solid rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s weird,\" she said. The railroad track seemed to plunge straight into the mountain, disappearing into a pile of boulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Rusties were serious about straight lines,\" David said. \"When they built rails, they didn\u0027t like to go around stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they just wentthrough ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid nodded. \"Yeah. This used to be a tunnel, cut right into the mountain. It must have collapsed sometime after the Rusty panic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think there was anyone...inside? When it happened, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not. But you never know. There could be a whole trainload of Rusty skeletons in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally swallowed, trying to imagine whatever was in there, flattened and buried for centuries in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The forest\u0027s a lot clearer around here,\" David said. \"Easier to work through. I\u0027m just worried about these boulders collapsing if we start prying rails up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They look pretty solid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah? Check this out,\" David said. He stepped off his board onto a boulder, and deftly climbed to a spot that lay shadowed in the setting sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally angled her board closer and jumped onto a large rock next to David. When her eyes adjusted to the darkness, she saw that a long space extended back between the boulders. David crawled inside, his feet disappearing into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" his voice called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, there isn\u0027t really a trainload of dead Rusties in there, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that I\u0027ve found. But today might be our lucky day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally rolled her eyes and lowered herself onto her belly. She crawled inside, the cool weight of the rocks settling over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA light flicked on ahead. She could see David sitting up in a small space, a flashlight glowing in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled herself in and took a seat next to him on a flat bit of rock. Giant shapes were stacked above them. \"So the tunnel didn\u0027t collapse completely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. The rock cracked into pieces, some big and some small.\" David pointed the flashlight down through a chink between where they sat. Tally squinted into the darkness and saw a much bigger open space below. A glint of metal revealed a segment of track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just think. If we could get down there,\" David said, \"we wouldn\u0027t have to pull up all those vines. All that track just waiting for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a hundred tons of rock in the way, is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Yeah, but it would be worth it.\" He pointed the flashlight upward at his face, making himself hideous. \"No one\u0027s been down there for hundreds of years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" Tally\u0027s skin tingled, her eyes picking out the dark fissures all around them. Maybe no human beings had been there for a long time, but lots of things liked to live in cool, dark caves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I keep thinking,\" David said, \"the whole thing might tumble open if we could just move the exact right boulder....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And not the exact wrong one, the one that makes the whole thing crush us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid laughed and pointed the flashlight so that it lit her face rather than his. \"I thought you might say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally peered through the darkness, trying to make out his expression. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see that you\u0027re struggling with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Struggling? With what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Being here in the Smoke. You\u0027re not sure about it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally\u0027s skin tingled again, but not from the thought of snakes or bats or long-dead Rusties. She wondered if David had somehow already figured out she was a spy. \"No, I guess I\u0027m not sure,\" she said evenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught a glimmer of reflected light from David\u0027s eyes as he nodded. \"That\u0027s good. You take this seriously. A lot of kids come out here and think it\u0027s all fun and games.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that for a minute,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can tell. It\u0027s not just a trick to you, like it is to most runaways. Even Shay, who really believes the operation is wrong, doesn\u0027t get how deadly serious the Smoke is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment of silence in the dark, David continued. \"It\u0027s dangerous out here. The cities are like these boulders. They may seem solid, but if you start messing with them, the whole pile could crumble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I know what you mean,\" Tally said. Since the day she\u0027d gone to get her operation, she\u0027d felt the massive weight of the city looming over her, and had learned firsthand how much places like the Smoke threatened people like Dr. Cable. \"But I don\u0027t really understand why they care so much about you guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story. But part of it is...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for a moment before saying, \"Is what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this is a secret. I don\u0027t usually tell people until they\u0027ve been here for a while. Years. But you seem...serious enough to handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can trust me,\" Tally said, then immediately wondered why. She was a spy, an infiltrator. She was the last person David should trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope I can, Tally,\" he said, reaching out to her. \"Feel the palm of my hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took it, running her fingers over the flesh. It was as rough as the wood grain of the table in the dining hall, the skin along his thumb as hard and dry as leather cracking with age. No wonder he could work all day and not complain. \"Wow. How long does it take to get calluses like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About eighteen years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About...?\" She stopped in disbelief, then compared the horn of his palm with her own tender, blistered flesh. Tally could feel it there, the grueling afternoon of real work she\u0027d put in today, but stretched across a lifetime. \"But how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a runaway, Tally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My parents were runaways, not me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" She felt stupid now, but it had never once occurred to her. If you could live in the Smoke, you could raise children here too. But she hadn\u0027t seen any littlies. And the whole place seemed so tenuous, so temporary. It would be like having a child on a camping trip. \"How did they manage? Without any doctors, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are doctors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh. But...hang on. Doctors? How old were they when they ran away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old enough. They weren\u0027t uglies anymore. I think it\u0027s called being a middle pretty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, at least.\" New pretties worked or studied, if they wanted to, but few people got serious about a profession until their middle years. \"Wait. What do you mean theyweren\u0027t uglies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They weren\u0027t. But they are now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally tried to get her mind to process his words. \"You mean, they never did the third operation? They still look middle, even though they\u0027re crumblies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Tally. I told you: They\u0027re doctors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shock ran through her. This was more stunning than the felled trees or the cruel pretties; as overwhelming as anything she\u0027d felt since Peris had gone away.\"They reversed the operation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They cut each other? Out here in the wild? To make themselves...\" Her throat closed on the word, as if she was going to gag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They didn\u0027t use surgery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the dark cave seemed to be crushing her, squeezing the air from her chest. Tally forced herself to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid pulled his hand away, and with a corner of her panicked mind Tally realized she\u0027d held on to it all that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shouldn\u0027t have told you all this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, David, I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to get all hyperventilated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my fault. You just got here, and I dumped all this on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I do want you to...\" - she fought saying it, but lost - \"to trust me. To tell me this stuff. I do take it seriously.\" That much was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Tally. But maybe that\u0027s enough for now. We should get back.\" He turned and crawled toward the sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she followed, Tally thought of what David had said about the boulders. However massive, they were ready to topple if you pushed them the wrong way. Ready to crush you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the pendant swinging from her neck, a tiny but insistent pull. Dr. Cable would be impatient by now, waiting for the signal. But David\u0027s revelation had suddenly made everything much more complicated. The Smoke wasn\u0027t just a hideout for assorted runaways, she realized now. It was a real town, a city in its own right. If Tally activated the tracker, it wouldn\u0027t just mean the end of Shay\u0027s big adventure. It would be David\u0027s home taken from him, his wholelife stripped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTally felt the weight of the mountain pressing down upon her, and found that she was still struggling to breathe as she pulled herself out into the sunlight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uglies-uglies-1/page-26.html","bookId":1573,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:29 PM"}
