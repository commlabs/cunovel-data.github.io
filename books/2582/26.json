Pale hands grabbed his ankles and held him as Tom took one unsteady step toward him, and then another. And another. Benny screamed again and kicked his way free just as Tom’s dry fingers brushed his face. Benny ran as ash drifted down from the burning trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“NIX!” he cried, but still his voice had no volume. No power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was movement and color off to his left, a flash of red, and Benny cut that way. He saw Morgie Mitchell sitting cross-legged on the hood of a burned-out car, his face screwed up with concentration as he tried to repair the broken pieces of his father’s fishing rod. Lying slumped against the side of the car was a slender figure covered with bright red blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny hurried to him and knelt down, trying to figure out where his friend was hurt. “Chong! Chong … can you hear me? C’mon, talk to me, you skinny monkey-banger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong’s eyelids fluttered and slowly opened. There was still life in his eyes, a wet glimmer deep in the brown irises. Chong tried to smile. He began speaking very slowly and softly, and Benny had to bend close to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everything out here wants to kill you, Benny,” Chong said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chong! Where are you hurt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong lifted a hand, and with one bloody finger he tapped his temple. “It hurts in here, Benny. Nothing in here works anymore.” Then the hand fell limply away, and Chong slumped over sideways, his last breath rattling from his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny fell backward, kicking himself away from Chong. More hands burst through the dirt and clamped around his wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Benny bellowed, and he twisted and kicked and bit the fingers until they broke apart and became hot ash. He spat out the ashes and scrambled to his feet. Tom was still coming toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should have stayed home,” Morgie said without looking up from what he was doing. “’Cause you know that you’re all gonna die out here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Nix?” Benny demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgie looked up. Instead of eyes he had two empty black holes in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s gonna die too, Benny … and it’s your fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger and revulsion warred in Benny’s heart, but he backed away. Suddenly hands grabbed him. Not the cold hands of the buried dead, but two small, warm hands. They touched his back, then his shoulders, and finally the sides of his face. Benny turned slowly, gratitude and relief flooding his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nix … God! Where were you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice trailed away. Nix Riley was a withered thing. Her red hair hung like limp red strings from a scalp that was patchy and blotched. Her skin was leached of color and there were clear signs of bites on her cheeks and shoulders and arms. Worst of all, her eyes … her beautiful green eyes … were wrong. They were a diseased confusion of green and gold and black. The effect was dreadful, the eyes of a thing rather than a girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Benny,” she said, and then she smiled. Rotting lips peeled back from jagged teeth. “Kiss me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny screamed himself awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up, gasping, heart pounding, his body drenched in sweat. Cold starlight filtered through the leaves, casting the world into a blue-white strangeness, as alien as the dreams-cape from which he’d just escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny turned to Nix, surprised that his scream hadn’t startled her awake. Or had the scream been part of the dream too? He touched her arm to gently shake her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her skin was as cold as ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“W-what … ?” Benny’s voice was hollow and brittle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned her over and she moved stiffly, her limbs already freezing into the rigidity of rigor mortis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” He fumbled at her throat, trying to find her pulse, needing to find at least the thread of it. All he found was slack skin beneath which nothing moved. “NO!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny grabbed her and pulled her to him, a new scream rising like volcanic lava in his chest. How could this be? How was it possible? Was it the cut on her face? No … that was just a cut. Had she been bitten? Where? When?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that fast he knew the answer. On the field. In the dark. As the fire raged and the smoke obscured everything, one of the shambling monsters had bitten her. In their panic and flight, maybe Nix hadn’t known. Or maybe she had and didn’t dare tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was like a block of ice in his arms, and Benny cried out her name over and over again. It was impossible. The world could not allow this. It could not be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix stayed cold and dead in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil she moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny recoiled from her, staring at her, his splintering mind scrabbling for that last bit of hope. Please … let her be okay! Maybe she’s just sick. Please … please … please!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix Riley opened her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were the green and gold diseased eyes of a zom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a snarl of impossible hunger, she lunged at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e44\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAND HE WOKE UP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forest was as black as death. The crickets pulsed and the night owls hooted. The girl in his arms was a soft, warm reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny Imura held her. His heart hammered and hammered. Sweat poured down his face, mingling with his tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nix,” he said gently. She moaned softly in her sleep, lost in her own dreams, and snuggled against him. He held her as tightly as he could without waking her. Benny did not sleep again the rest of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not dare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e45\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTOM IMURA WAS UP LONG BEFORE DAWN. HE FIXED A QUICK MEAL FOR himself and Sally, refilled their canteens from a small stream, and was ready to go by the time there was enough light to be able to distinguish shadows from substance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Sally Two-Knives a little longer to climb out of the well of sleep, but after she’d eaten something and had her fill of water, she looked and sounded much better than she had the night before. “You’ll live,” Tom said with gentle humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve actually had worse,” she said, carefully probing the knife wound beneath the bandage. “So have you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “Fact of life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSally reached out a hand. “Help me up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did. They were both very careful about it, and Sally micromanaged the process with a lot of curses and complaints until she was on her feet and leaning against one of the rocks that formed their shelter. “Well,” she said, “that was interesting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shouldn’t be up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t stay here. Besides, my horse is out there somewhere. I find her, I’ll be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Riding a horse with a stab wound is—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—going to hurt, no kidding. Better than walking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should try and rest for most of the—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t even try, Tom. It’s kind of you to be nice to a lady—if we can suspend disbelief long enough to use that word for me—but you need to go find that boy, and I need to go find your brother and the girls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom had no argument for that. “Thanks, Sally. Can I do anything for—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get your ass in gear, boy. You’re burning daylight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. It was only barely bright enough to see the path. Tom nodded and was about to step back when Sally grabbed him by the front of the shirt with her good hand and pulled him in for a whopper of a kiss. When she finally pushed him back, he gasped and blinked like a trout on a riverbank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In case I don’t ever see you again, Tom,” she said, giving him a wicked little smile. “I don’t want you to forget me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um … not a chance. Wow.” He gave her a last smile, turned, and vanished into the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSally watched him go. In the brief moment between his smile and his departure, as he turned away, she saw the smile fall away from his handsome face to be replaced by the face of the hunter. She repeated what she’d said the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God help anyone who gets in your way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFROM NIX’S JOURNAL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZom 101\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZom: What just about everyone calls the living dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZom: Nomadic zoms. Ones that walk around but aren’t actually following prey. (Most zoms don’t move unless they are following something.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalker: Another name for a Nom, though some people call all zoms walkers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliver: A thin piece of metal with a sharpened tip used to “quiet” a zom. It’s inserted at the base of the skill in order to sever the spinal cord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuieting: What people call it when a zom is “killed” permanently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e46\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBENNY LET NIX SLEEP UNTIL THE WHOLE FOREST WAS INFUSED WITH A pink light. He studied the woods, looking for any signs of zoms. Or of Lilah. Or Tom. No sign of the Greenman, either. For the moment it appeared as if they had the forest all to themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny touched Nix’s face with his thumb, caressing her cheek very gently. He lifted the edge of the bandage and studied the long cut and the delicate stitchery. The wound was a little red and puffy, but it wasn’t bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix made a soft sound and opened her eyes. Green eyes. Not green and gold and black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” she said almost shyly, smiling up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What time is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Half hour past dawn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix stretched against him and then sat up and yawned so hard her jaws creaked. Then she held her palm up and breathed against it. “Gak! I have monkey breath.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mine’s closer to one of the great apes,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir backpacks and gear were back at the way station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr in the ashes of it. All they had was what they’d carried in their vests and jeans pockets. Matches, first aid kit, sewing kit, knives, cadaverine. No toothbrushes. Nothing to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny handed her his canteen and she rinsed and spat. Then she told him to take off his vest and open his shirt. He was shy about it—not from modesty but because he didn’t really want to know how bad the burn was. It hurt less this morning, but his mind conjured images of charred ends of bone sticking out of gangrenous flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe actual wound was almost disappointing. Three lines of blistered skin, each no wider than a pencil and each less than an inch long. The skin around the burns was puffy, but there was no sign of infection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll live,” Nix declared as she finished cleaning the burns with a piece of bandage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doesn’t even hurt,” he said, but he was sure she didn’t believe him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis stomach suddenly growled as loud as a hungry zom. “We need to find some food.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey removed the bokkens from Benny’s carpet coat and climbed carefully down from the tree. It was a slow and painful process; they were both stiff and sore. As they dropped to the grass they both froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something at the base of the tree. Someone had placed several fist-size stones in a tight circle to act as a base on which was placed a large hand-carved wooden tray. Large, clean leaves covered the tray, and a wonderful aroma drifted out from beneath them. Nix lifted the leaves and gasped. Benny’s mouth fell open. The wooden plate was piled high with fat yellow mounds of scrambled eggs, thick fried potatoes, and a mound of fresh strawberries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Benny asked, looking around. “Who—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who cares?” Nix said as she scooped a handful of eggs off the plate. “God … there’s enough here for ten people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are awake, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix laughed and shoved eggs into his mouth. He chewed. It was cold but delicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does this make any sense?” he asked as scooped up more eggs with his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix shook her head, then shrugged. “Maybe. Possible sense, anyway. Think about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took two mouthfuls of eggs and three potatoes before he caught up with her. “Man, I’m slow!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gee, that’s a news flash,” she said, her cheeks filled like a squirrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Greenman!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Question is,” Nix said, swallowing, “why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a friend of Tom’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “Wonder why he didn’t hang around to say hi?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No idea. Wish I knew where he lived. Tom said it’s around here somewhere. Probably pretty well hidden, though. Guy’s not supposed to be very social.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate for a while, then Nix said, “God … there are so many questions. What’s happening with Tom and Chong? Where’s Lilah? Who took the cans down last night? Why did all those zoms attack us? And what’s with that freak Preacher Jack?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny smiled. “Since when did you think I knew what the heck was going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Always a first time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,” he said, “but today isn’t that day.” He rubbed his hands briskly over his face. “Okay … so, what’s the plan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Plan?” she replied. “Don’t you have one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um … what makes you think the ‘no answer’ guy is the ‘I have a plan’ guy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“’Cause I don’t have a plan either,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah.” They looked around, watching the woods as if answers would magically appear. “We could wait here and see if the Greenman comes back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny shook his head. “I don’t think he will. He didn’t wait for us last night, and he didn’t stick around to have breakfast with us this morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix sighed. “Maybe we should go back and take a look at the field and the way station. From a distance, I mean. See what’s what.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” he said, brightening. “That’s very plan-like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shared the last of the eggs and potatoes and stuffed their pockets with the strawberries. They wiped the plate clean with leaves and left it at the base of the tree. Benny wrote “Thanks!” in big letters in the dirt. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dust-and-decay-benny-imura-2/page-26.html","bookId":2582,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:44 PM"}
