Her voicemail message was the generic electronic one. I didn\u0027t even get the benefit of hearing her little voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even checked once or twice to make sure I was calling the right number. Crazy, I know. It said \"Tammy\" right here in the \"Contacts\" list, the same Tammy I had called countless times since she had first gotten her cell last Christmas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the phone in my lap, confirmed it was on, and realized that my brain was spinning, looping over the same things again and again. As soon as I set the phone in my lap, I wanted to pick it up again, and try her cell phone. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep breaths, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I could have used Kingsley\u0027s help. Hell, I could use Fang\u0027s help, too. And Knighthorse\u0027s and Aaron King\u0027s and anyone else I\u0027d ever come across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep breaths, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s not far. Ten-year-old girls eventually get picked up by the police -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr picked up by other people. Scumbags. Dirt bags. Killers. Child molesters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I was panicking all over again and stomping the gas and whipping through suburban Fullerton as if it was my own private race course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up at home, which was about three miles from my sister\u0027s home. I parked the van at an angle in front of the house, dashed out, hurdled the chain-link fence that surrounded the property, and plunged inside my house, calling her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly scoured every room. My hope had been that she simply returned to her own home, her own room, her own bed. Still, I called her name repeatedly, searching everywhere and anywhere, even out in the garage. I moved quickly through the house. I sped around supernaturally quickly. The rooms and walls and carpet were a blur. Pictures were a blur. My head was spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught myself on a wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped, chest heaving. Having a full-blown panic attack wouldn\u0027t help anyone, least of all, my daughter. I knew this. I had cautioned parents of this very thing many times in the past, when searching for their own runaways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep breaths, Sam. Calm down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck calming down. I want my daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking, I stood straight, hands on hips, thinking hard. Or trying to think hard. Truth was, my brain still hadn\u0027t entirely kicked into gear. Night was coming, but was not here yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated what I was sometimes. Hated it. Here I needed to find my daughter, and I needed to think clearly, but I couldn\u0027t push past the fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paced and checked the time on my cell. One more hour until sundown. Then I would think clearly. Perhaps even get a psychic hit or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept one hour might be too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone rang. I gasped, and nearly dropped it. Kingsley. Again. The asshole. The fucker. How dare he call me when he knew I was waiting to hear news about my daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored it. He tried one more time. I ignored that, too, hating him more and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had tried her closest friends. Sherbet was cruising the streets with his patrol officers. Spinoza was hitting any and all shops within a reasonable radius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow much money did she have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought hard, forcing my mind to go back a few days, before my trip to Vegas. Yes, I had given her and Anthony $20 each. A twenty wasn\u0027t much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gripped my keys and turned for the door, nodding to myself. Twenty bucks was just enough for -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Spinoza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused and clicked on, pressing the touch screen so hard I nearly cracked it. \"Any news?\" I asked. Or tried to ask. My voice cracked and sounded funny, even to my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good news, Sam,\" he said gently. \"I\u0027ve got someone here you might be interested in seeing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" I said and sank to my knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s with me, Sam. Safe and sound. We\u0027re at the bus station in Buena Park. Do you know the one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI buried my face in my hands, pressing the phone against my ear. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be here waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clicked off and let the tears flow, sitting there on my knees, my face in my hands. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-16.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
