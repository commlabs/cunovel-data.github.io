Water gushed out onto the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crossfire ambush then caught the half-dozen charging Edur unawares-quarrels sleeting out from the narrow alley mouths on both sides. Moments later all were down, dead or dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Pull back!’ Fiddler shouted, turning to exchange his unloaded crossbow for the loaded one Bottle now set into his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarr covering the three of them, they retreated back through the smithy, across the dusty compound with its piled tailings and slag, through the kicked-down fence, and back towards the tavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere, from the sounds, Stormy and his heavies were in a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMotion on their flanks-the rest of the ambush converging. Cuttle, Corabb, Maybe, Gesler, Balgrid and Brethless. Reloading on the run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gesler! Stormy’s-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I can hear it, Fid! Corabb-hand that damned crossbow over to Brethless-you’re useless with it. Join up with Tarr there and you two in first!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I got my target!’ Corabb protested even as he gave one of Hellian’s corporals the heavy weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘By bouncing your quarrel off the cobbles and don’t tell me that was a planned shot!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorabb was already readying the Edur spear he had picked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler waved Tarr forward as soon as Corabb arrived. ‘Go, you two! Fast in and hard!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly by leaving his feet and throwing his entire weight on the shaft was the Edur able to drive the spear entirely through Stormy’s left shoulder. An act of extraordinary courage that was rewarded with a thumb in his left eye-that dug yet deeper, then deeper still. Shrieking, the warrior tried to jerk his head away, but the huge red-bearded corporal now clutched a handful of hair and was holding him tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a still louder shriek and even greater courage, the Edur tore his head back, leaving Stormy with a handful of scalp and a thumb smeared in gel and blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not so fast,’ the corporal said in a strangely matter-of-fact tone, as he lunged forward to grapple the Edur. Both went down onto the smeared floorboards of the tavern-and the impact pushed the spear in Stormy’s shoulder almost entirely through. Drawing his gutting knife, Stormy drove the blade into the warrior’s side, just beneath the ribcage, under the heart, then cut outward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood gushed in a flood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaggering, slipping, Stormy managed to regain his feet-the spear falling from his back-and tottered until he came up against the table with its pile of severed Edur heads. He reached for one and threw it across the room, into the crowd of Edur pushing in through the doorway where Flashwit and Bowl had been holding position until a spear skewered Bowl through the man’s neck and someone knocked off Flashwit’s helm and laid open her head. She was lying on her back, not moving as the moccasin-clad feet of the Edur stamped all over her in the inward rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head struck the lead warrior in the face, and he howled in shock and pain, reeling to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMayfly stumbled up to take position beside Stormy. Stabbed four times already, it was a wonder the heavy was still standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t you die, woman,’ Stormy rumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set his sword into his hands. ‘Found this, Sergeant, and thought you might want it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time to answer as the first three Edur reached them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerging from the kitchen entrance-a kitchen now emptied of serving staff-Corabb saw that charge, and he leapt forward to take it from the flank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd tripped headlong qver the body of the Edur that Stormy had just stabbed. His hands went forward, still holding the spear. The point drove through the right thigh of the nearest warrior, missing the bone, and plunged out the other side to stab into the next Edur’s left knee, the triangular head sliding under the patella and neatly separating the joint on its way through. Angling downward, the point sticking fast between two floorboards, until the far one sprang loose, in time to foul the steps of the third Edur, and that warrior seemed to simply throw himself onto Stormy’s out-thrust sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Corabb landed amidst falling enemy, Tarr arrived, his shortsword hacking down here and there as he worked forward to plant himself in the path of the rest of the Edur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlashwit then stood up in their midst and she had a kethra knife in each hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler led the charge through the kitchen doorway, crossbow ready, to find Tarr cutting down the last standing Edur. The room was piled with bodies, only a few still moving, and crawling out from beneath two Edur corpses was Corabb Bhilan Thenu’alas, coughing in all the blood that had spilled over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrethless moved past to the window. ‘Sergeant! Another mob of’em!’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-363.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
