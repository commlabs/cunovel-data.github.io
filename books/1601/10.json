They owned her. She would be a da covale to this Amyrlin, and would ride this storm like a ship whose sail had been shredded by the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps, with what remained of her honor, she could earn this woman’s trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s part of an old Borderlander relief for the pain\", Melten said, removing the bandage at Talmanes’ side. \"The blisterleaf slows the taint left by the cursed metal\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelten was a lean, mop-haired man. He dressed like an Andoran woodsman, with a simple shirt and cloak, but spoke like a Borderlander. In his pouch he carried a set of colored balls that he’d sometimes juggle for the other members of the Band. In another life, he must have been a gleeman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was an unlikely man to be in the Band, but they all were, in one way or another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t know how it dampens the poison\", Melten said. \"But it does. It’s no natural poison, mind you. You can’t suck it free\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes pressed his hand to the side. The burning pain felt like thorny vines crawling in under his skin, creeping forward and tearing at his flesh with every movement. He could feel the poison moving through his body. Light, but it hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, the men of the Band fought through Caemlyn up toward the Palace. They’d come in through the southern gate, leaving the mercenary bands—under Sandip’s command—holding the western gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there was human resistance anywhere in the city, it would be at the Palace. Unfortunately, fists of Trollocs roved the area between Talmanes’ position and the Palace. They kept running across the monsters and getting drawn into fights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes couldn’t find out if, indeed, there was resistance above without getting there. That meant leading his men up toward the Palace, fighting all the way, and leaving himself open to being cut off from behind if one of those roving groups worked around behind him. There was nothing for it, though. He needed to find out what—if anything—remained of the Palace defenses. From there, he could strike further into the city and try to get the dragons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air smelled of smoke and blood; during a brief pause in the fighting, they’d piled dead Trollocs against the right side of the street to make room for passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were refugees in this quarter of the city, too, though not a flood of them. A stream, maybe, seeping in from the darkness as Talmanes and the Band seized sections of the thoroughfare leading up toward the Palace. These refugees never demanded that the Band protect their goods or rescue their homes; they sobbed with joy at finding human resistance. Madwin was in charge of sending them toward freedom along the corridor of safety the Band had carved free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes started up toward the Palace, atop the hill but only barely visible in the night. Though most of the city burned, the Palace was not aflame; its white walls hung in the smoky night like phantoms. No fire. That had to indicate resistance, didn’t it? Wouldn’t the Trollocs have attacked it as one of their first actions in the city?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d sent scouts along the street up ahead as he gave his men—and himself—a short breather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelten finished tying Talmanes’ poultice tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Melten\", Talmanes said, nodding to the man. \"I can feel the poultice working already. You said this is part of the cure for the pain. What is the other part?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelten unhooked a metal flask from his belt and handed it over. \"Shienaran brandy, full strength\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s not a good idea to drink in combat, man\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it\", Melten said softly. \"Keep the flask and drink it deep, my Lord. Or come the next bell, you won’t be standing\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes hesitated, then took the flask and took a long swallow. It burned like the wound. He coughed, then tucked the brandy away. \"I believe you mistook your bottles, Melten. That was something you found in a tanning vat\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelten snorted. \"And it’s said you have no sense of humor, Lord Talmanes\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven’t one\", Talmanes said. \"Stay close with that sword of yours\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelten nodded, eyes solemn. \"Dreadbane\", he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What’s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Borderlander title. You slew a Fade. Dreadbane\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It had about seventeen bolts in it at the time\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn’t matter\". Melten clasped him on the shoulder. \"Dreadbane. When you can’t take the pain any longer, make two fists and raise them toward me. I will see the deed done\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes stood up, unable to suppress a groan. They both understood. The several Borderlanders in the Band agreed; wounds made by a Thakan’dar blade were unpredictable. Some festered quickly, others made men sick. When one went black like Talmanes’, though . . . that was the worst. Nothing short of finding an Aes Sedai in the next few hours could save him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See\", Talmanes muttered, \"it is a good thing I have no sense of humor, otherwise I should think the Pattern was playing a joke on me. Dennel! You have a map handy?\" Light, but he missed Vanin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lord\", Dennel said, hurrying across the dark street carrying a torch and a hastily drawn map. He was one of the Band’s dragon captains. \"I think I’ve found a faster way through the streets to where Aludra had the dragons stored\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We’re fighting to the Palace first\", Talmanes said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lord\". Dennel’s words came more softly from his wide lips. He was picking at his uniform, as if it didn’t fit right. \"If the Shadow reaches those dragons . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m well aware of the dangers, Dennel, thank you. How fast could you move the things, assuming we reach them? I’m worried about extending ourselves too far, and this city is going up faster than oil-soaked love letters to a High Lords mistress. I want to get the weapons and leave the city as quickly as possible\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can level an enemy bulwark in a shot or two, my Lord, but the dragons do not move quickly. They are attached to carts, so that will help, but they aren’t going to be any faster than . . . say, a line of supply wagons. And they would take time to set up properly and fire\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we continue to the Palace\", Talmanes said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the Palace\", he said sternly, \"we might find women who can channel us a gateway straight to Aludra’s warehouse. Besides, if we find the Palace Guard still fighting, we know we have a friend at our backs. We will retrieve those dragons, but we\u0026amp;rsqu \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-10.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
