I studied vigorously, and paid attention even to the government of the city, which I thought basically as tiresome as any government, and read voraciously the great Christian scholars, completing my time with Abelard, Duns Scotus and other thinkers whom Marius prized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius also found for me a heap of Russian literature so that for the first time I could study in writing what I had only known from the songs of my uncles and my Father in the past. At first I deemed this too painful for a serious inquiry, but Marius laid down the law and wisely. The inherent value of the subject matter soon absorbed my painful recollections and a greater knowledge and understanding was the result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these documents were in Church Slavonic, the written language of my childhood, and I soon fell into reading this with extraordinary ease. The Lay of lgor\u0027s Campaigns delighted me, but I also loved the writings, translated from the Greek, of St. John Chrysostom. I also reveled in the fantastical tales of King Solomon and of the Descent of the Virgin into Hell, works which were not part of the approved New Testament but which were very evocative of the Russian soul. I read also our great chronicle, The Tale of-Bygone Years. I read also Orison on the Downfall of Russia and the Tale of the Destruction of Riasan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis exercise, the reading of my native stories, helped me to put them in perspective alongside the other learning which I acquired. In sum, it lifted them from the realm of personal dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually, I saw the wisdom of this. I made my reports to Marius with more enthusiasm. I asked for more of the manuscripts in Church Slavonic, and I soon had for reading the Narrative of the Pious Prince Dovmont and His Courage and The Heroic Deeds of Mercurius of Smolensk. Finally, I came to regard the works in Church Slavonic to be a pure pleasure, and I kept them for the hours after official study when I might pour over the old tales and even make up from them my own mournful songs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sang these sometimes to the other apprentices when they went to sleep. They thought the language very exotic, and sometimes the pure music and my sad inflection could make them cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiccardo and I, meantime, became close friends again. He never asked why I was now a creature of night like the Master. I never sounded the depths of his mind. Of course I would do it if I had to for my safety and for Marius\u0027s safety, but I used my vampiric wits to gloss him in another way, and I always found him devoted, unquestioning and loyal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I asked Marius what Riccardo thought of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Riccardo owes me too great a debt to question anything I do,\" Marius answered, but without any haughtiness or pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he is far better bred than I am, isn\u0027t he? For I owe you the same debt and I question everything you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a smart, devil-tongued little imp, yes,\" Marius conceded with a small smile. \"Riccardo was won in a card game from his drunken Father by a beastly merchant who worked him night and day. Riccardo detested his Father, which you never have. Riccardo was eight years old when I bought him for the price of a gold necklace. He\u0027d seen the worst of men whom children don\u0027t move to natural pity. You saw what men will do with the flesh of children for pleasure. It\u0027s not as bad. Riccardo, unable to believe that a tender little one could move anyone to compassion, believed in nothing until I wrapped him in safety and filled him with learning, and told him in terms on which he could count that he was my prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But to answer you more in the way you ask the question, Riccardo thinks that I am a magician, and that with you I\u0027ve chosen to share my spells. He knows that you were on death\u0027s door when I bestowed on you my secrets, and that I do not tease him or the others with this honor, but regard it rather as something of dire consequence. He doesn\u0027t seek after our knowledge. And will defend us with his life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI accepted this. I didn\u0027t have the need in me to confide in Riccardo as I had with Bianca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel the need to protect him,\" I said to my Master. \"Pray he should never have to protect me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I feel also,\" said Marius. \"I feel this for them all. God granted your Englishman a great mercy that he was not alive when I came home to find my little ones slain by him. I don\u0027t know what I would have done. That he had injured you was bad enough. That he had laid out two child sacrifices at my door to his pride and bitterness, this was even more despicable. You had made love to him, and you could fight him. But they were innocents who stood in his path.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"What did happen to his remains?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such a simple thing,\" he said with a shrug. \"Why do you want to know? I can be superstitious too. I broke him into fragments and scattered those fragments to the wind. If the old tales are true that his shade will pine for the restoration of his body, then his soul wanders the winds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master, what will become of our shades if our bodies are destroyed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God only knows, Amadeo. I despair of knowing. I have lived too long to think of destroying myself. My fate is perhaps the same fate of the whole physical world. That we could have come from nothing and return to nothing, this is entirely possible. But let us enjoy our illusions of immortality, as mortals enjoy theirs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Master was absent from the palazzo twice, when he went on those mysterious journeys which he wouldn\u0027t explain to me any more now than he had before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated these absences, but I knew that they were tests of my new powers. I had to rule within the house gently and unobtrusively, and I had to hunt on my own and make some account, upon Marius\u0027s return, of what I had done with my leisure time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the second journey, he came home weary and uncommonly sad. He said, as he had said once before, that \"Those Who Must Be Kept\" seemed to be at peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate it what these creatures are!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, never say such a thing to me, Amadeo!\" he burst out. In a flash I\u0027d seen him more angry and uncomposed than ever in our lives. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d ever seen him really angry in our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe approached me and I shrank back, actually afraid. But by the time he struck me, hard across the face, he\u0027d recovered himself, and it was just the usual brain-jarring blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI accepted it, and then threw him one exasperated searing glance. \"You act like a child,\" I said, \"a child playing Master, and so I must master my feelings and put up with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it took all my reserves to say this, especially when my head was swimming, and I made my face such an obdurate mask of contempt that suddenly he burst out laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to laugh too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But really, Marius,\" I said, feeling very cheeky, \"what are these creatures you speak of?\" I made my wisdom nice and reverent. My question was, after all, sincere. \"You come home miserable, Sir. You know you do. So what are they, and why must they be kept?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amadeo, don\u0027t ask me anymore. Sometimes just before morning, when my fears are at their worst, I imagine that we have enemies among the blood drinkers, and they\u0027re close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Others? As strong as you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, those who have come in past years are never as strong as me, and that is why they\u0027re gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was enthralled. He had hinted at this before, that he kept our territory clean of others, but he wouldn\u0027t elaborate, and now he seemed softened up with unhappiness and willing to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I imagine that there are others, and that they\u0027ll come to disturb our peace. They won\u0027t have a good reason. They never do. They\u0027ll want to hunt the Veneto, or they will have formed some willful little battalion, and they\u0027ll try to destroy us out of sheer sport. I imagine ... but the point is, my child-and you are my child, smart one!-I don\u0027t tell you any more about the ancient mysteries than you need to know. That way, no one can pick your apprentice mind for its deepest secrets, either with your cooperation or without your knowledge, or against your will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we have a history worth knowing, Sir, then you should tell me. What ancient mysteries? You wall me up with books on human history. You\u0027ve made me learn Greek, and even this miserable Egyptian script which no one else knows, and you question me all the time on the fate of ancient Rome and ancient Athens, and the battles of every Crusade ever sent from our shores to the Holy Land. But what of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always here,\" he said, \"I told you. Ancient as mankind itself. Always here, and always a few, and always warring and best when alone and needing the love only of one other or two at most. That\u0027s the history, plain and simple. I will expect you to write it out for me in all five languages you now know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down on the bed, disgruntled, letting his muddy boot dig into the satin. He fell back on the pillows. He was really raw and strange and seemingly young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marius, come on now,\" I coaxed. I was at the desk. \"What ancient mysteries? What are Those Who Must Be Kept?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go dig into our dungeons, child,\" he said, lacing his voice with sarcasm. \"Find the statues there I have from so-called pagan days. You\u0027ll find things as useful as Those Who Must Be Kept. Leave me alone. I\u0027ll tell you some night, but for now, I give you what counts. In my absence you were supposed to study. Tell me now what you learnt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had in fact demanded that I learn all of Aristotle, not from the manuscripts which were common currency in the piazza, but from an old text of his own which he said was purer Greek. I\u0027d read it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aristotle,\" I said. \"And St. Thomas Aquinas. Ah, well, great systems give comfort, and when we feel ourselves slipping into despair, we should devise great schemes of the nothing around us, and then we will not slip but hang on a scaffold of our making, as meaningless as nothing, but too detailed to be so easily dismissed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well done,\" he said with an eloquent sigh. \"Maybe some night in the far distant future, you\u0027ll take a more hopeful approach, but as you seem as animated and fall of happiness as you can be, why should I complain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must come from somewhere,\" I said, pushing the other point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was too crestfallen to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he rallied, climbing up off the pillows and coming towards me. \"Let\u0027s go out. Let\u0027s find Bianca, and dress her up as a man for a while. Bring your finest. She needs to be freed of those rooms for a spell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, this may come as a rude shock to you, but Bianca, like many women, already has that habit. In the guise of a boy, she slips out all the time to make the rounds of the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but not in our company,\" he said. \"We shall show her the worst places!\" He made a dramatic comical face. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as we told the little plan to her, she was excited too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe came bursting in with an armful of fine clothes, and she immediately slipped away with us to get dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you brought me? Oh, I\u0027m to be Amadeo tonight, splendid,\" she said. She shut the doors on her company, who as usual carried on without her, several men singing around the Virginal and others arguing heatedly over their dice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stripped off her clothes and stepped out of them, naked as Venus from the sea. We both dressed her in blue leggings and tunic and doublet. I pulled her belt tight, and Marius caught her hair up in a soft velvet hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the prettiest boy in the Veneto,\" he said stepping back. \"Something tells me I\u0027ll have to protect you with our life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really going to take me to the worst haunts? I want to see dangerous places!\" She threw up her arms. \"Give me my stiletto. You don\u0027t expect me to go unarmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have all the proper weapons for you,\" Marius said. He had brought a sword with a beautiful diamond-studded diagonal belt which he clasped at her hip. \"Try to draw this. It\u0027s no dancing rapier. It\u0027s a war sword. Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the handle with both hands and brought it forth in a wide sure sweep. \"I wish I had an enemy,\" she cried out, \"who was ready to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Marius. He looked at me. No, she couldn\u0027t be one of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be too selfish,\" he whispered in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help but wonder, if I had not been dying after my fight with the Englishman, if the sweating sickness had not taken me over, would he have ever made me a vampire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us hurried down the stone steps to the quay. There was our canopied gondola waiting. Marius gave the address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you want to go there, Master?\" asked the gondolier, shocked because he knew the district where the worst of the foreign seamen congregated and drank and fought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most sure of it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we moved off in the black waters, I put my arm around tender Bianca. Leaning back on the cushions, I felt invulnerable, immortal, certain that nothing would ever defeat me or Marius, and in our care Bianca would always be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow very wrong I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine months perhaps we had together after our trip to Kiev. Nine or maybe ten, I cannot mark the climax by any exterior event. Let me say only, before I proceed to bloody disaster, that Bianca was always with us in those last months. When we were not spying upon the carousers, we were in our house, where Marius painted her portraits, devising her as this or that goddess, as the Biblical Judith with the head of the Florentine for her Holofernes, or as the Virgin Mary staring rapt at a tiny Christ child, as perfectly rendered by Marius as any image he ever made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose pictures-perhaps some of them endure to this very day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night, when all slept except for the three of us, Bianca, about to give up on a couch as Marius painted, sighed and said, \"I like your company too much. I don\u0027t ever want to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould that she had loved us less. Would that she had not been there on the fatal evening in 1499, just before the turn of the century, when the High Renaissance was in its glory, ever to be celebrated by artists and historians, would that she had been safe when our world went up in flames. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-armand-the-vampire-chronicles-6/page-13.html","bookId":2214,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:56 PM"}
