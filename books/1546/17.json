Of course I\u0027m not okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy breathed a sigh of relief. If he was being annoying, he must be fine. She got up unsteadily, dirt and stones shifting beneath her feet. Looking up, she could see the mouth of the ragged pit they\u0027d fallen into. They were in some kind of a sinkhole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ground was hollowed out,\" she muttered. \"The earth here is limestone. Lots of caves and tunnels under Paris. I guess we fell into one accidentally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accidentally?\" Dan said. \"Irina lured us here on purpose!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy knew he was probably right, but she didn\u0027t want to think about it... or what might happen next. They had to get out. She swept her arms around the edges of their pit, but it was just that -- a pit. No side tunnels, no exits except for straight up, and they\u0027d fallen over ten feet. It was a miracle they hadn\u0027t broken any bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a light blinded her from above. \"Well, well,\" said a man\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arf! \" a dog yapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Amy\u0027s eyes adjusted, she saw five figures in purple warm-up suits smiling down at them, and one very excited pit bull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Holts!\" Dan said. \"It figures. You helped Irina set us up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, get over it, runt,\" Madison called down. \"We didn\u0027t set up anybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Reagan said. \"You fell in all by yourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Madison gave each other high fives and started laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy\u0027s hands started to tremble. This was just like her nightmares ... stuck in a pit, a crowd of people laughing at her. But this was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So.\" Eisenhower Holt called down. \"Is this what you brats were looking for? Is this the Maze of Bones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart fluttered. \"What -- what do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on, missy! We know all about the Maze of Bones. We read the Almanack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the book? But, Irina -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stole it from us,\" Eisenhower growled. \"After we stole it from the Korean dude. So we staked out her headquarters, but you got inside before we could launch an assault. Now you\u0027ve got the book, and you came here, which means you know something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we don\u0027t have the book!\" Amy said. \"We didn\u0027t even get a chance to -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on,\" Hamilton said. His greased blond hair gleamed in the night. \"It was right there on page fifty-two --\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBF: Maze of Bones, coordinates in the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was your mom\u0027s handwriting. Dad recognized it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy\u0027s whole body was trembling. She hated it, but she couldn\u0027t stop. The Holts had read farther in the book than she had. They\u0027d found another message from her mother:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaze of Bones, coordinates in the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe understood the Maze of Bones part, at least she feared that she did ... but coordinates in a box?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I -- I don\u0027t know what it means,\" she said. \"We don\u0027t have the book. But if you let us out of here, maybe I could -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right!\" Madison sneered. \"Like we\u0027d help you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started laughing again -- the entire Holt clan, making fun of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, stop,\" she whispered. \"Don\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, she\u0027s gonna cry.\" Hamilton grinned. \"Man, you two are pathetic. I can\u0027t believe you got past the fire and the bomb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You burned Grace\u0027s mansion? You set off that bomb in the museum?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To slow you down,\" Eisenhower admitted. \"We should\u0027ve beaten you up in person. Sorry about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan threw a rock, but it sailed harmlessly between Reagan\u0027s legs. \"You morons! Get us OUT of here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReagan frowned, but Madison and Hamilton started yelling back at Dan. Arnold barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy knew this was getting them nowhere. They had to convince the Holts to let them out, but she couldn\u0027t make her voice work. She wanted to curl into a ball and hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the ground shook. There was a rumbling sound like a large engine. The Holts turned toward the street and looked astonished by whatever they saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You -- little -- tricksters!\" Eisenhower glared down at them. \"This was an ambush, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Dan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A truck is blocking the gates!\" Mary-Todd said. \"A cement truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, look,\" Reagan said nervously. \"They\u0027ve got shovels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy\u0027s danger sense started tingling. Dan turned toward her, and she could tell he was thinking the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going to fill the hole,\" Dan said. \"Aren\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Holt!\" Dan started jumping like Arnold the dog, but he couldn\u0027t reach the top of the pit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, you\u0027ve got to get us out! We\u0027ll help you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Holt snorted. \"You led us into this! Besides, you runts can\u0027t fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" Reagan said. \"Maybe we should -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, sis,\" Hamilton growled. \"We can handle this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reagan!\" Dan yelled. \"Come on! Tel them to let us out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReagan just knit her eyebrows and stared at the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan looked at Amy desperately. \"You gotta do something. Tell them you can figure out the book!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the words wouldn\u0027t come. Amy felt like she was already being covered in cement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother needed her. She had to say something. But she just stood there, frozen and helpless and hating herself for being so scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"HEEEY!\" Dan yelled up. \"Amy knows what the clue means! She\u0027ll tell you if you let us out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Holt scowled. Amy knew he wouldn\u0027t go for it. They\u0027d be stuck down here forever, cemented in. Then Mr. Holt stripped off his warm-up jacket and lowered it into the pit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grab the sleeve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds, Amy and Dan were out of the pit. Sure enough, a cement truck had blocked the gates of the cemetery. Six thugs in coveralls and hard hats were lined up at the fence, hefting shovels like they were ready to fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, team,\" Mr. Holt said with relish. \"Let\u0027s show \u0027em how it\u0027s done -- Holt style!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole family rushed forward. Mr. Holt grabbed the first thug\u0027s shovel and swung it, with the guy still attached, into the side of the cement truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCLANG!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls, Madison and Reagan, plowed into one thug so hard he flew across the street and crashed through the window of a flower shop. Arnold bit the third thug in the leg and held on with jaws of iron. Mary-Todd and Hamilton tackled a fourth thug against the chute on the back of the truck. His head hit a lever and cement started spilling all over the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, two thugs remained, and they ran straight for Amy and Dan. Fear closed around Amy\u0027s throat. She recognized their faces -- they were the security guards from the Lucian stronghold. Before she could even think of a plan, Dan unzipped his backpack and took out his blinking silver sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dan, no!\" Amy said. \"You can\u0027t -- \" But he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as he loved baseball, Dan was the world\u0027s worst pitcher. The sphere sailed right past the two guys who were charging them and exploded under Mr. Holt\u0027s feet with a blinding yellow flash. The noise was like the world\u0027s largest snare drum being smashed with a sledgehammer. Amy went cross-eyed. When she regained her senses, she saw the entire Holt family and the guys they\u0027d been battling flat on the ground, knocked unconscious -- except for the two thugs Dan meant to hit. They were only dazed, stumbling around and shaking their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy turned to Dan in horror. \"What did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan looked surprised. \"Um, concussive grenade, I think. Like the one in the museum! I knocked them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two thugs who were still on their feet blinked a few times, then refocused on Dan and Amy. They didn\u0027t look happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run!\" Dan pulled Amy behind the mausoleum, but there was nowhere to go -- just another iron fence, and a few yards behind that, the back of a building -- brick walls, thirty feet high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperately, they climbed the fence anyway. Amy\u0027s shirt got stuck on the top, but Dan pulled her free. Together they pressed against the back wall. There was no alley. No exit. They were trapped. If only they had a weapon ... and then Amy realized her brain wasn\u0027t paralyzed by fear anymore. The explosion had snapped her back to her senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew what they needed. \"Dan, the Franklin battery!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What good will that do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ripped open his backpack and took out the battery. The two thugs advanced warily -- probably wondering whether Dan had any more grenades. Amy uncoiled the battery\u0027s copper wires and made sure the ends were stripped. \"I hope it has a charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Dan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Franklin used to do this for fun,\" she said. \"To startle his friends. Maybe if it\u0027s got enough juice ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men were at the fence. One of them snarled something in French. It sounded like an order to surrender. Amy shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men began to climb, and Amy leaped forward. She touched the wires against the fence and the men yelped in surprise. Blue sparks flew off the metal bars. Smoke curled from the men\u0027s hands and they fell backwards, stunned. Amy threw down the battery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" she yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a heartbeat, they were over the fence. They raced out of the graveyard, past the unconscious Holts, the thugs, and the overturned cement truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy felt a twinge of guilt leaving the Holts behind unconscious, but they had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t stop running until they were halfway across the Pont Louis-Philippe. Amy doubled over, gasping for breath. At last they were safe. They\u0027d survived the trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she looked back, she saw something that scared her worse than the graveyard. Standing in the shadows at the foot of the bridge, a hundred yards back the way they\u0027d come, was a tall gray-haired man in a black overcoat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Amy was sure he was watching them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan thought Nellie was going to kill them. He\u0027d never seen her face that shade of red before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paced their tiny hotel room. \"Two hours, you said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was standing outside the hotel for, like, ever, and you didn\u0027t come. You didn\u0027t call. I thought you were dead!\" She shook her iPod for emphasis and the loose earbuds danced around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our phone didn\u0027t work,\" Amy said sheepishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got sidetracked,\" Dan added. \"There was this concussive grenade, and a cement truck, and a battery. And a loaf of bread.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan was pretty sure that covered all the important details, but Nellie looked like she didn\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Start from the beginning,\" she said. \"And no lies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was just because he was too tired to lie, but Dan told her the whole story -- even about the thirty-nine clues -- with Amy filling in the stuff he forgot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you almost died,\" Nellie said in a small voice. \"Those jerks were going to pour cement on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe a little cement,\" Dan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did the inscription say?\" Nellie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan didn\u0027t know any French, but he\u0027d automatically memorized the words on the marble slab. He repeated them to Nellie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Here lie Amy and Dan Cahill,\u0027\" she translated, \u0027\"who stuck their noses into the wrong people\u0027s business.\u0027\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-maze-of-bones-the-39-clues-1/page-17.html","bookId":1546,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:27 PM"}
