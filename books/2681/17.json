on the grounds of one of England\u0027s grandest stately homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeaulieu, pronounced Bewly, was a sprawling estate in the New Forest near the south coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main residence, Palace House, was the home of Lord Montagu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHidden away in the surrounding woods were numerous large country houses in extensive grounds of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of these had been vacated early in the war: younger owners had gone on active service, and older ones generally had the means to flee to safer locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve of the houses had been requisitioned by SOE and were used for training agents in security, wireless operation, map reading, and dirtier skills such as burglary, sabotage, forgery, and silent killing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the place at three o\u0027clock in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick drove down a rough track and crossed a cattle grid before pulling up in front of a large house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing here always felt like entering a fantasy world, one where deception and violence were talked of as commonplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house had an appropriate air of unreality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it had about twenty bedrooms, it was built in the style of a cottage-an architectural affectation that had been popular in the years before the First World War.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked quaint in the moonlight, with its chimneys and dormer windows, hipped roofs and tile-hung bays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like an illustration in a children\u0027s novel, a big rambling house where you could play hide-and-seek all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the team was here, Flick knew, but they would be asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was familiar with the house and found two vacant rooms on the attic floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Greta went gratefully to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick lay awake for a while, wondering how she would ever weld this bunch of misfits into a fighting unit, but she soon fell asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up again at six.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom her window she could see the estuary of the Solent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water looked like mercury in the gray morning light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe boiled a kettle for shaving and took it to Greta\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she roused the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy and Paul were first to arrive in the big kitchen at the back of the house, Percy demanding tea and Paul coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick told them to make it themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had not joined SOE to wait on men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I make tea for you sometimes,\" Percy said indignantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do it with an air of noblesse oblige,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a duke holding a door for a housemaid.\" Paul laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You crack me up.\" An army cook arrived at half past six, and before long they were sitting around the big table eating fried eggs and thick rashers of bacon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFood was not rationed for secret agents: they needed to build up their reserves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce they went into action, they might have to go for days without proper nourishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls came down one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick was startled by her first sight of Maude Valentine: neither Percy nor Paul had said how pretty she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe appeared immaculately dressed and scented, her rosebud mouth accentuated by bright lipstick, looking as if she were off to lunch at the Savoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat next to Paul and said with a suggestive air, \"Sleep well, Major?\" Flick was relieved to see the dark pirate face of Ruby Romain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would not have been surprised to learn that Ruby had run off in the night, never to be seen again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Ruby could then be rearrested for the murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had not been pardoned: rather, the charges had been dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could always be picked up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat ought to keep Ruby from disappearing, but she was as tough as a boot, and she might have decided to take the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJelly Knight looked her age, this early in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat beside Percy and gave him a fond smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose you slept like a top,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clear conscience,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t got a bloody conscience.\" The cook offered her a plate of bacon and eggs, but she made a face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you, dear,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to watch my figure.\" Her breakfast was a cup of tea and several cigarettes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Greta came through the door, Flick held her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore a pretty cotton dress with a small false bosom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pink cardigan softened her shoulder line and a chiffon scarf concealed her masculine throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore the short dark wig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was heavily powdered, but she had used only a little lipstick and eye makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy contrast with her sassy on-stage personality, today she was playing the part of a rather plain young woman who was perhaps a little embarrassed about being so tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick introduced her and watched the reactions of the other women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first test of Greta\u0027s impersonation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all smiled pleasantly, showing no sign that they saw anything wrong, and Flick breathed easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with Maude, the other woman Flick had not met before was Lady Denise Bowyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy had interviewed her at Hendon and had recruited her despite signs that she was indiscreet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned out to be a plain girl with a lot of dark hair and a defiant air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she was the daughter of a marquess, she lacked the easy self-confidence typical of upper-class girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick felt a little sorry for her, but Denise was too charmless to be likable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is my team, Flick thought: one flirt, one murderess, one safebreaker, one female impersonator, and one awkward aristocrat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was someone missing, she realized: the other aristocrat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana had not appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was now half past seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick said to Percy, \"You did tell Diana that reveille was at six?\" \"I told everyone.\" \"And I banged on her door at a quarter past.\" Flick stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d better check on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBedroom Ten, right?\" She went upstairs and knocked at Diana\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no response, so she went in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room looked as if a bomb had hit it-a suitcase open on the rumpled bed, pillows on the floor, knickers on the dressing table-but Flick knew this was normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana had always been surrounded by people whose job it was to tidy up after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick\u0027s mother had been one of those people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Diana had simply gone off somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to have to realize that her time was no longer her own, flick thought with irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s disappeared,\" she told the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll start without her.\" She stood at the head of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have two days\u0027 training in front of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, on Friday night, we parachute into France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re an all-female team because it is much easier for women to move around occupied France-the Gestapo are less suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur mission is to blow up a railway tunnel near the village of Marles, not far from Reims, on the main railway line between Frankfurt and Paris.\" Flick glanced at Greta, who knew the story was false.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat quietly buttering toast and did not meet Flick\u0027s eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The agent\u0027s course is normally three months,\" Flick went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this tunnel has to be destroyed by Monday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn two days, we hope to give you some basic security rules, teach you how to parachute, do some weapons training, and show you how to kill people without making a noise.\" Maude looked pale despite her makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill people?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely you don\u0027t expect girls to do that?\" Jelly gave a grunt of disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a bloody war on, you know.\" Diana came in from the garden with bits of vegetation clinging to her corduroy trousers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been for a tramp in the woods,\" she said enthusiastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marvelous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd look what the greenhouse man gave me.\" She took a handful of ripe tomatoes from her pocket and rolled them onto the kitchen table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick said, \"Sit down, Diana, you\u0027re late for the briefing.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, darling, have I missed your lovely talk?\" \"You\u0027re in the military now,\" Flick said with exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you\u0027re told to be in the kitchen by seven, it\u0027s not a suggestion.\" \"You\u0027re not going to get all headmistressy with me, are you?\" \"Sit down and shut up.\" \"Frightfully sorry, darling.\" Flick raised her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diana, when I say shut up, you don\u0027t say \u0027Frightfully sorry\u0027 to me, and you don\u0027t call me darling, ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust shut up.\" Diana sat down in silence, but she looked mutinous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, hell, Flick thought, I didn\u0027t handle that very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen door opened with a bang and a small, muscular man of about forty came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had sergeant\u0027s chevrons on his uniform shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, girls!\" he said heartily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick said, \"This is Sergeant Bill Griffiths, one of the instructors.\" She did not like Bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn army PT instructor, he showed an unpleasant relish in physical combat and never seemed sorry enough when he hurt someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had noticed that he was worse with women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re just about ready for you, Sergeant, so why don\u0027t you begin?\" She moved aside and leaned against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wish is my command,\" he said unnecessarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her place at the head of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Landing with a parachute,\" he began, \"is like jumping off a wall fourteen feet high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ceiling of this kitchen is a bit less than that, so it\u0027s like leaping into the garden from upstairs.\" Flick heard Jelly say quietly, \"Oh, my gordon.\" \"You cannot come down on your feet and stay upright,\" Bill continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you try to land in a standing position, you will break your legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only safe way is to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the first thing we\u0027re going to teach you is how to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anyone

women were changing, Paul took his leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need a parachute training flight tomorrow, and they\u0027re going to tell me there are no planes available,\" he said to Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to London to kick ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be back tonight.\" Flick wondered if he was going to see his girl as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the garden were an old pine table, an ugly mahogany wardrobe from the Victorian era, and a stepladder fourteen feet high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJelly was dismayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to make us jump off the top of that bloody wardrobe, are you?\" she said to Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not before we show you how,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be surprised how easy it is.\" Jelly looked at Percy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bugger,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you let me in for?\" When they were all ready, Bill said, \"First we\u0027re going to learn to fall from zero height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three ways: forwards, backwards, and sideways.\" He demonstrated each method, dropping to the ground effortlessly and springing up again with a gymnast\u0027s agility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must keep your legs together.\" He looked arch and added, \"As all young ladies should.\" No one laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not throw out your arms to break your fall, but keep them at your sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo not worry about hurting yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you break an arm it will hurt a hell of a lot worse.\" As Flick expected, the younger girls had no difficulty: Diana, Maude, Ruby, and Denise were all able to fall like athletes as soon as they were shown how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby, having done it once from the standing position, lost patience with the exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe climbed to the top of the stepladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet!\" Bill shouted at her, but he was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumped off the top and landed perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she walked off, sat under a tree, and lit a cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think she\u0027s going to give me trouble, Flick thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick was more worried about Jelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a key member of the team, the only one who knew about explosives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she had lost her girlish suppleness some years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParachuting was going to be difficult for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, she was game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalling from the standing position, she hit the ground with a grunt and cursed as she got up, but she was ready to try again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Flick\u0027s surprise, the worst student was Greta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t do this,\" she said to Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you I\u0027m no good at rough stuff.\" It was the first time Greta had spoken more than a couple of words, and Jelly frowned and muttered, \"Funny accent.\" \"Let me help you,\" Bill said to Greta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust relax.\" He took her by the shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, with a sudden strong motion, he threw her to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe landed heavily and gave a gasp of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggled to her feet and, to Flick\u0027s dismay, she began to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake,\" Bill said disgustedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of people are they sending us?\" Flick glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not want to lose her telephone engineer through Bill\u0027s brutishness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just go easy,\" she snapped at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was unrepentant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Gestapo are a lot worse than me!\" Flick would have to mend the damage herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took Greta by the hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll do a little special training on our own.\" They went around the house to another part of the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Greta said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just hate that little man.\" \"I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, let\u0027s do this together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKneel down.\" They knelt facing one another and held hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just do what I do.\" Flick leaned slowly sideways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta mirrored her action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, they fell to the ground, still holding hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" Flick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was all right, wasn\u0027t it?\" Greta smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t he be like you?\" Flick shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Men,\" she said with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, are you ready to try faffing from a standing position? We\u0027ll do it the same way, holding hands.\" She took Greta through all the exercises Bill was doing with the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta quickly gained confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey returned to the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others were jumping off the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta joined in and landed perfectly, and they gave her a round of applause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey progressed to jumping from the top of the wardrobe, then finally the stepladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jelly jumped off the ladder, rolled perfectly, and stood upright, Flick hugged her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m proud of you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill looked disgusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Percy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell kind of army is it when you get a hug for doing what you\u0027re bloody well told?\" \"Get used to it, Bill,\" said Percy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws/page-17.html","bookId":2681,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM"}
