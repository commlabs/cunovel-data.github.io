It\u0027s not like this is predictable or anything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Y.T. must get under way now,\" she announces.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo reaction for a sec. Then the hacker guy sits back in his chair, stares out through his goggles, ignoring the 3-D compu-display, taking in a nice view of the wall. \"Okay,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eQuick as a mongoose, the man with the glass eye darts in, yanks the aluminum case out of the cryogenic cylinder, tosses it to Y.T. Meantime, one of the lounging-around Mafia guys is opening the back door of the truck, giving them all a nice view of a traffic jam on the boulevard.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"One other thing,\" the man with the glass eye says, and shoves an envelope into one of Y.T.\u0027s multitudinous pockets.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" Y.T. says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe holds up his hands self-protectively. \"Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s just a little something.

It lands at an odd angle on the floor between them. But the spokes have long ago seen the floor coming, calculated all the angles, extended and flexed themselves like the legs and feet of a basketball player coming back to earth from a monster dunk. The plank lands on its feet, banks this way, then that, as it regains its balance, then steers itself right up to Y.T. and stops beside her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe stands on it, kicks a few times, flies out the back door of the semi, and onto the hood of a Pontiac that was following them much too closely. Its windshield makes a nice surface to bank off of, and she gets her direction neatly reversed by the time she hits the pavement. The owner of the Pontiac is honking self-righteously, but there\u0027s no way he can chase her down because traffic is totally stopped, Y.T. is the only thing for miles around that is actually capable of movement. Which is the whole point of Kouriers in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/711.html","bookId":314,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM"}
