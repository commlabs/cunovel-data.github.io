I’ll send her a text when Tina leaves. It was fun but it is what it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Tina and say, “I’m sorry, Tina. If I knew she was causing you trouble I would have cut her loose sooner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina looks up at me with wide eyes and responds, “I don’t want you to break up with your girlfriend because of me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes and mutter, “She wasn’t my girlfriend, just a casual acquaintance. She was becoming a huge pain in my ass anyways. Time for her to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” Tina frowns and purses her lips, “what do I do if she turns up at the store? I don’t want her making a scene again. Its puts customers off from coming back.” She looks uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get up, walk over to the fridge and take out two sodas. I sit back down and place one in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout even a thank you she opens it and sips like she’s been playing Uno with us for years. I respond, “Leave that to me. She comes back to the store, you call me. Straight away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, she plays with the ring of her soda can and turns to check the time on the clock on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumps up and yells, “Crudsickles! I’ve been here for an hour; I’ve got to get back.” She looks around the table, smiles and says, “Nice to meet you all. Hope I see you again soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrudsickles?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns to me, puts her small hand on my shoulder and speaks again, “Thanks Nik. I appreciate it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys watch her leave. Well, they watch her ass sway as she leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnuckleheads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrick smiles big, still looking to the door. He declares, “I like her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah…Me too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was just in the neighborhood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wake up with a start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat pours down my face, my stomach knots, and my chest expands with every heavy breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting up, I place my back against the headboard of my awesome sleigh bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven’t woken like this in at least three months. I used to wake like this every night, sometimes multiple times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s still dark out. I squint over at the digital alarm clock on my bedside table. 4:57 am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFan-freakin-tastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t have to start getting ready for work for an hour and a half but I’m up now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter losing my daughter and Mom, I had trouble sleeping for a long time. I kept hearing Mia cry in the middle of the night and would find myself in her very empty bedroom sobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really need you right now, Mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing I miss most about my Mom is her hugs. Coming from a Croatian background, I was raised very affectionate. I would never leave the house without giving both my parents a kiss on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could be having the worst day ever, but a warm, comforting hug from Mom would make everything seem okay. Every time I was in a bad mood she would ask, “What’s the matter, Dušo?” and always made sure I would vent to her about whatever was bothering me. And vent I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaking is my release. I love to bake; my specialty is cupcakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know my cupcakes are good. Actually, good is an understatement. My cupcakes are the bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re up now. Get your butt out of bed. Let’s get baking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach over and fling my covers back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang Bump Meow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI apologize to my sweetheart. “Sorry Bear. Come here, honey.” He stretches and walks over me. I pick him up and scratch him all over. When I reach under his chin he purrs loudly and drools. I chastise him softly, “Ewww Bear, control yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mia was a year old she spoke her first word which was cat. As a reward for my super smart daughter, I got her Bear. I got him from a shelter, he was really fat, but after months of diet cat food he was back in shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear is a super sweet and very affectionate (my kind of cat). He has a white body with three big black blotches on his back, a completely black tail and looks like he’s wearing a black Zorro mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at my feline friend and say, “C’mon honey, let’s get you some breakfast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear walks beside me as I exit my room and make my way to the bathroom to brush my teeth and wash my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach the kitchen, cover my mouth, and yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear is already on the kitchen counter doing something which can only be described as the Give Me Food dance. He struts back and forth, purring loudly, bumping his head on random things. Every now and then he looks back at me in a way that says the dance is working, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach under the counter for one of his many bowls, put some wet food in it, and place it on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe purrs while he eats. I scratch his head and say in a cutesy voice, “A fancy feast for my fancy beast.” I love Bear, he is the ideal cat. I tell him, “You have five minutes to eat, buddy. I’ve got to get baking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear finishes his meal and jumps off the counter. I wipe down the counter with disinfectant spray and go about getting my ingredients organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI place them all on the counter, whip up a chocolate mud batter, and divide it evenly between the patty pans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pop them into the oven to bake and make my way to the bathroom to shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sing ‘Working 9 to 5’ in the shower, loudly. When I’m done, I step into the hall and the delicious smell of chocolate mud cake attacks my nostrils. My mouth waters and I know one of those babies has my name on it for breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I walk into the kitchen, the oven bell dings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect timing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take them out of the oven, cover them with a tea towel and put them on the counter to cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter, I heat cream on the stove top, not too hot. I pour the warm cream over some semi-sweet chocolate and slowly stir. I put it aside and wait for it to cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYum!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach rumbles and I pat it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, my pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go back into my room to change for work. I decide on a linen pants and blouse combo. Add some heeled sandals and voila!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scan my bathroom counter for my small bounty of makeup. I don’t really wear a lot of makeup. On the rare occasion I go out with the girls, I’ll apply it a bit darker. I never wear lipstick, only clear or lightly colored gloss. I like the natural color of my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at my limited selection, I decide on mascara and pale pink lip gloss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glance at my watch tells me I can start icing the cupcakes so I make my way over to the kitchen counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is something about icing cakes that is almost therapeutic. Using a piping bag, I carefully ice all 12 of them in a swirly snail pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so hungry at this point I take the wrapper off one of the cakes and shove the whole thing in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChewing loudly, I hear the doorbell ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat on earth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m still chewing when I answer the door. There stand two men in blue overalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Crudsickles! I forgot about the moving truck!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men speaks, “Good morning, ma’am. I believe you’re expecting a truck of furniture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod but am still chewing. I hold up my hand with my index finger pointed up. The universal signal for one minute, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I’m finally able to speak I smile big at them both, “Yes! I’m so sorry.” Checking my watch I say, “I actually forgot and have to be at work soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other man looks at my mouth, clears his throat and speaks up, “I’m sorry ma’am but someone needs to be here for us to unload.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarn it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brain goes Ping!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get an idea. I walk past the movers to the apartment next door and knock quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens and I’m greeted with a large smile, “My, oh, my, is that you Tina?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling back at her, I say, “Hi Molly! I need a really huge favor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly looks down at my mouth. Her lips twitch as she tells me, “Girl, you got chocolate all up in yo’ teeth!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widen, I can feel the warm blush rise on my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly is a really cool neighbor. She is in her fifties, African American and small but full of fire. Every time I see her I’m mesmerized by her outfits. They’re always traditional African garments and wraps with fantastic patterns and are usually beaded. Her husband died ten years ago and they never had children so she decided to downsize by selling her house and buying an apartment instead. When I met Molly, I felt like I had won the neighbor lottery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly was wary of me at first. Until I invited to her eat dinner with me one night and she tried my cupcakes. It’s safe to say that Molly and I are good friends now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbarrassment seeps through my pores. I squeak, “Can I use your mirror?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe places a hand on her hip and taps her toes. She asks, “You holdin’ out on me, baby girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUm, what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper, “Um, what?” My face must show my confusion because she keeps talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sternly asks, “You eatin’ those cupcakes behind my back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a bubble of laughter rise in throat. I chuckle and say, “If you do me this favor, I’ll save you a couple.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles and responds, “Deal. You know where the mirror is, sugar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly fix myself then explain to Molly about the movers. Luckily, she didn’t have plans for the morning. Molly has one of my spare keys; she normally feeds and watches Bear for me when I’m out of town hunting new suppliers for Safira.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pack six of the cupcakes into a container, give Molly a big hug and make my way to my car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love my car. It’s a convertible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA 1975 VW Yellow Super Beetle. The girls call it my Dung Beetle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s slightly rusted and the leather top has holes in it so when it rains I have to cover it with a tarp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has character. It’s my baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI approach the driver’s side door and jiggle the handle. I depress the button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jiggle harder. Try the button again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jiggle hard and knee the door. I hear it. Click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBingo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the door, sit down and place my cupcakes on the passenger side floor. I feel a headache coming on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMental note: take some aspirin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the key in the ignition and turn. Nothing happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy forehead falls forward between my hands onto the steering wheel with a thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLe Sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many emails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to hire a secretary or assistant to help me out. The White Rabbit has gotten so popular; people want to hire it during the week for birthdays and special occasions. And I’m all for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sister Maria comes to help out on occasion. She works part time as a receptionist so she’s great help when we need her and she knows what she’s doing. She can work all the gadgets and is pretty technology savvy. I’m thinking of asking her to become our full-time secretary. If work keeps coming in the way it is, we’ll need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA window pops up on my computer. It’s an instant messenger program I’ve never used. I signed up for it when I got the computer, it automatically logs in when the computer turns on but I haven’t added any friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/* \u003c![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]\u003e */\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehas made a friend request”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer name’s Valentina?

My dad is a carpenter and fascinated with anything wooden. Most of my childhood memories of him include him making something out of wood. When Mom died, he stopped tinkering and became a bit of a recluse. Unfortunately, I wasn’t much of a help to him because I was mourning the loss of my sweet Mia. We comforted each other as best we could but living in Cali became too hard for me, so I moved to New York. I think it took me moving to break him out of his spell. We call each other a few times a week to chat and Nat goes over on occasion to check up on him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/friend-zoned-friend-zoned-1/page-5.html","bookId":2798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM"}
