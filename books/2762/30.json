You don’t have to keep calling me that. Awesome One will do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he is awesome. I’m just never going to admit that to him. He’s cocky enough as it is… but that’s just the way I like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun beats down on our shoulders as we walk down to a pier. The sea laps softly at the wood and I stare down at the clear water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tell him again the mechanics of swimming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it,” he tells me. “Keep my head up, relax and float.

He seems thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mia,” he says huskily, as he pulls me to him. “I was just wondering about something. Remember a couple of months ago…you said you were falling for me. Then you said you weren’t quite there. You were going to let me know when you were, but you’ve never said anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pauses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd pauses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd looks at me with an eyebrow raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh happily.
