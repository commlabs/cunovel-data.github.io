{"id":64732,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe sun has just set when Day and I make our way out onto the main strip and head toward the other end of the street. Day leans heavily on my shoulder as we try to blend in with the crowds, his breath shallow and his face drawn with pain. I try my best to support him without looking out of place, but his weight makes me walk in an unbalanced line, as if I’d had too much to drink. “How are we doing?” he murmurs into my ear, his lips hot against my skin. I’m not sure if he’s half-delirious from the pain or if it’s my outfit, but I can’t say I mind his blatant flirtation tonight. It’s a nice change from our awkward train ride. He’s careful to keep his head down, his eyes hidden under long lashes and tilted away from the soldiers bustling back and forth along the sidewalks. He shifts uncomfortably in his military jacket and pants. A black soldier’s cap hides his white-blond hair and blocks a good portion of his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well enough,” I reply. “Remember, you’re drunk. And happy. You’re supposed to be lusting over your escort. Try smiling a little more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay plasters a giant artificial smile on his face. As charming as ever. “Aw, come on, sweetheart. I thought I was doing a pretty good job. I got my arm around the prettiest escort on this block—how could I not be lusting over you? Don’t I look like I’m lusting? This is me, lusting.” His lashes flutter at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks so ridiculous that I can’t help laughing. Another passerby glances at me. “Much better.” I shiver when he nudges his face into the hollow of my neck. Stay in character. Concentrate. The gold trinkets lining my waist and ankles jingle as we walk. “How’s your leg?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay pulls away a little. “Was doing fine until you brought it up,” he whispers, then winces as he trips over a crack in the sidewalk. I tighten my grip around him. “I’ll make it to our next rest stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember, two fingers against your brow if you need to stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, yeah. I’ll let you know if I’m in trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pair of soldiers pushes past us with their own escorts, grinning girls decked out in sparkling eye shadow and elegantly painted face tattoos, their bodies covered thinly by dancer costumes and fake red feathers. One of the soldiers catches sight of me, laughs, and widens his glazed eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What club you from, gorgeous?” he slurs. “Don’t remember your face around here.” His hand goes for my exposed waist, hungering for skin. Before he can reach me, Day’s arm whips out and shoves the soldier roughly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t touch her.” Day grins and winks at the soldier, keeping up his carefree demeanor, but the warning in his eyes and voice makes the other man back off. He blinks at both of us, mumbles something under his breath, and staggers away with his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to imitate the way those escorts giggle, then give my hair a toss. “Next time, just go with it,” I hiss in Day’s ear even as I kiss him on the cheek, as if he were the best customer ever. “Last thing we need is a fight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Day shrugs and returns to his painful walk. “It’d be a pretty pathetic fight. He could barely stand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and decide not to point out the irony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA third group of soldiers stumbles past us in a loud, drunken daze. (Seven cadets, two lieutenants, gold armbands with Dakota insignias, which means they just arrived here from the north and haven’t yet exchanged their armbands for new ones with their warfront battalions.) They have their arms wrapped around escorts from the Bellagio clubs—glittering girls with scarlet chokers and B arm tattoos. These soldiers are probably stationed in the barracks above the clubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check my own costume again. Stolen from the dressing rooms of the Sun Palace. On the surface, I seem like any other escort. Gold chains and trinkets around my waist and ankles. Feathers and gold ribbons pinned into my scarlet (spray-painted), braided hair. Smoky eye shadow coated with glitter. A ferocious phoenix tattoo painted across my upper cheek and eyelid. Red silks leave my arms and waist exposed, and dark laces line my boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there’s one thing on my costume that the other girls don’t wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chain of thirteen little glittering mirrors. They’re partially hidden amongst the other ornaments wrapped around my ankle, and from a distance it would seem like another decoration. Completely forgettable. But every now and then, when streetlights catch it, it becomes a row of brilliant, sparkling lights. Thirteen, the Patriots’ unofficial number. This is our signal to them. They must be watching the main Vegas strip all the time, so I know they’ll at least notice a row of flashing lights on me. And when they do, they’ll recognize us as the same pair they helped rescue in Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe JumboTrons lining the street crackle for a second. The pledge should start again any minute now. Unlike Los Angeles, Vegas runs the national pledge five times a day—all the JumboTrons will pause in whatever ads or news they’re showing, replace them with enormous images of the Elector Primo, and then play the following on the city’s speaker system: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the great Republic of America, to our Elector Primo, to our glorious states, to unity against the Colonies, to our impending victory!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot long ago, I used to recite that pledge every morning and afternoon with the same enthusiasm as anyone else, determined to keep the east coast Colonies from taking control of our precious west coast land. That was before I knew about the Republic’s role in my family’s deaths. I’m not sure what I think now. Let the Colonies win?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe JumboTrons start broadcasting a newsreel. Weekly recap. Day and I watch the headlines zip by on the screens:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eREPUBLIC TRIUMPHANTLY TAKES OVER MILES OF COLONIES’ LAND IN BATTLE FOR AMARILLO, EAST TEXAS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFLOOD WARNING CANCELLED FOR SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eELECTOR VISITS TROOPS ON NORTHERN WARFRONT, BOOSTS MORALE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of them are fairly uninteresting—the usual headlines coming in from the warfront, updates on weather and laws, quarantine notices for Vegas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Day taps my shoulder and gestures at one of the screens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQUARANTINE IN LOS ANGELES EXTENDED TO EMERALD, OPAL SECTORS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gem sectors?” Day whispers. My eyes are still fixed on the screen, even though the headline has passed. “Don’t rich folks live there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure what to say in return because I’m still trying to process the information myself. Emerald and Opal sectors . . . Is this a mistake? Or have the plagues in LA gotten serious enough to be broadcast on Vegas JumboTrons? I’ve never, ever seen quarantines extended into the upper-class sectors. Emerald sector borders Ruby—does that mean my home sector is going to be quarantined too? What about our vaccinations? Aren’t they supposed to prevent things like this? I think back on Metias’s journal entries. One of these days, he’d said, there will be a virus unleashed that none of us will be able to stop. I remember the things Metias had unveiled, the underground factories, the rampant diseases . . . the systematic plagues. A shiver runs through me. Los Angeles will quell it, I tell myself. The plague will die down, just like it always does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore headlines sweep by. A familiar one is about Day’s execution. It plays the clip of the firing squad yard where Day’s brother John took the bullets meant for Day, then fell facedown on the ground. Day turns his eyes to the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother headline is newer. It says this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMISSING\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSS NO: 2001963034\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e------------------------\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJUNE IPARIS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAGENT, LOS ANGELES CITY PATROL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAGE/GENDER: 15, FEMALE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHEIGHT: 5’4”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHAIR: BROWN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEYES: BROWN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLAST SEEN NEAR BATALLA HALL, LOS ANGELES, CA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e350,000 REPUBLIC NOTES REWARD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIF SEEN, REPORT IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR LOCAL OFFICIAL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what the Republic wants their people to think. That I’m missing, that they hope to bring me back safe and sound. What they don’t say is that they probably want me dead. I helped the country’s most notorious criminal escape his execution, aided the rebel Patriots in a staged uprising against a military headquarters, and turned my back on the Republic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they wouldn’t want that information going public, so they hunt for me quietly. The missing report shows the photo from my military ID—a face-forward, unsmiling shot of me, barefaced but for a touch of gloss, dark hair tied back in a high ponytail, a gold Republic seal gleaming against the black of my coat. I’m grateful that the phoenix tattoo hides half of my face right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe make it to the middle of the main strip before the speakers crackle again for the pledge. Day and I stop walking. Day stumbles again and almost falls, but I manage to catch him fast enough to keep him upright. People on the street look up to the JumboTrons (except for a handful of soldiers who line the edges of each intersection in order to ensure everyone’s participation). The screens flicker. Their images vanish into blackness, and are then replaced by high-definition portraits of the Elector Primo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pledge allegiance—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s almost comforting to repeat these words with everyone else on the streets, at least until I remind myself of all that’s changed. I think back to the evening when I’d first captured Day, when the Elector and his son came to personally congratulate me for putting a notorious criminal behind bars. I recall how the Elector had looked in person. The portraits on the JumboTrons show the same green eyes, strong jaw, and curled locks of dark hair . . . but they leave out the coldness in his expression and the sickly color of his skin. His portraits make him seem fatherly, with healthy pink cheeks. Not how I remember him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—to the flag of the great Republic of America—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the broadcast pauses. There’s silence on the streets, then a chorus of confused whispers. I frown. Unusual. I’ve never seen the pledge interrupted, not even once. And the JumboTron system is hooked up so one screen’s outage shouldn’t affect the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay looks up to the stalled screens while my eyes dart to the soldiers lining the street. “Freak accident?” he says. His labored breathing worries me. Hang on just a little longer. We can’t stop here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “No. Look at the troops.” I nod subtly in their direction. “They’ve changed their stances. Their rifles aren’t slung over their shoulders anymore—they’re holding them now. They’re bracing themselves for a reaction from the crowd.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay shakes his head slowly. He looks unsettlingly pale. “Something’s happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elector’s portrait vanishes from the JumboTrons and is immediately replaced with a new series of images. They show a man who is the spitting image of the Elector—only much younger, barely in his twenties, with the same green eyes and dark, wavy hair. In a flash I recall the touch of excitement I’d felt when I first met him at the celebratory ball. This is Anden Stavropoulos, the son of the Elector Primo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay’s right. Something big has happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Republic’s Elector has died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new, upbeat voice takes over the speakers. “Before continuing our pledge, we must instruct all soldiers and civilians to replace the Elector portraits in your homes. You may pick up a new portrait from your local police headquarters. Inspections to ensure your cooperation will commence in two weeks.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prodigy-legend-2/page-2.html","bookId":1695,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:37 AM"}
