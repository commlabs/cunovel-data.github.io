Today’s matters would certainly spread out and become a great joke to everyone.

But at this time, a trace of pleading appeared in Crimson Wishjade’s angry eyes. She was frightened. If Lin Ming were to hit her again, then her skirt would really be torn apart. Even if she were to use fire energy to form a skirt, that skirt wouldn’t be as tough as the fire rhino leather skirt. It was impossible for her to block the naked image that everyone would see.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, an angry and vigorous voice rang out, “Enough!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that instant, a red shadow flew up from the audience, flying straight towards the Divine Seal Altar, A massive wave of energy came crashing down.

He turned to see a tall red-haired middle-aged man floating a few hundred thousand feet away. This person had a similar aura to the Crimson Strifecloud in the Illusionary God Combat Array.
