Then run back. Do not stop until you return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ran. By the time I got back, it felt like my lungs were trying to force themselves up my trachea, the better to smack me around for abusing them. Both Gretchen and I collapsed into the grass gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are soft,\" Hickory repeated. I didn\u0027t argue, and not just because at the moment I was totally incapable of speaking. \"We are done for today. Tomorrow we will truly begin with your physical conditioning. We will start slowly.\" It and Dickory walked away, leaving Gretchen and me to imagine ways we were going to murder Hickory and Dickory, once we could actually force oxygen back into our bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMornings: school, like every other kid and teen not actively working in a field. Limited books and supplies meant sharing with others. I shared my textbooks with Gretchen, Enzo, and Magdy. This worked fine when we were all speaking to each other, less so when some of us were not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you two please focus?\" Magdy said, waving his hands in front of the two of us. We were supposed to be doing calculus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it,\" Gretchen said. She had her head down on our table. It had been a hard workout that morning. \"God, I miss coffee,\" she said, looking up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be nice to get to this problem sometime today,\" Magdy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, what do you care,\" Gretchen said. \"It\u0027s not like any of us are going to college anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We still have to do it,\" Enzo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do it, then,\" Gretchen said. She leaned over and pushed the book toward the two of them. \"It\u0027s not me or Zoe who has to learn this stuff. We already know it. You two are always waiting for us to do the work, and then just nodding like you actually know what we\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true,\" Magdy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Fine,\" Gretchen said. \"Prove it. Impress me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think someone\u0027s morning exertions are making her a little grumpy,\" Magdy said, mockingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means that since the two of you started whatever it is you\u0027re doing, you\u0027ve been pretty useless here,\" Magdy said. \"Despite what Gretchen the Grump is hinting at, it\u0027s the two of us who have been carrying the two of you lately, and you know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re carrying us in math?\" Gretchen said. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything else, sweetness,\" Magdy said. \"Unless you think Enzo pulling together that report on the early Colonial Union days last week doesn\u0027t count.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not \u0027we,\u0027 that\u0027s Enzo,\" Gretchen said. \"And thank you, Enzo. Happy, Magdy? Good. Now let\u0027s all shut up about this.\" Gretchen put her head back down on the table. Enzo and Magdy looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, give me the book,\" I said, reaching for it. \"I\u0027ll do this problem.\" Enzo slid the book over to me, not quite meeting my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfternoons: training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, how is the training going?\" Enzo asked me one early evening, catching me as I limped home from the day\u0027s workout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mean, can I kill you yet?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, no,\" Enzo said. \"Although now that you mention it I\u0027m curious. Can you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It depends,\" I said, \"on what it is you\u0027re asking me to kill you with.\" There was an uncomfortable silence after that. \"That was a joke,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" Enzo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t even get around to how to kill things today,\" I said, changing the subject. \"We spent the day learning how to move quietly. You know. To avoid capture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or to sneak up on something,\" Enzo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Yes, okay, Enzo. To sneak up on things. To kill them. Because I like to kill. Kill and kill again, that\u0027s me. Little Zoe Stab Stab.\" I sped up my walking speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnzo caught up with me. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"That wasn\u0027t fair of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just a topic of conversation, you know,\" Enzo said. \"What you and Gretchen are doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped walking. \"What kind of conversation?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, think about it,\" Enzo said. \"You and Gretchen are spending your afternoons preparing for the apocalypse. What do you think people are talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Enzo said, reaching out and touching my arm, which reminded me we spent less time touching each other lately. \"I\u0027ve told people that, too. Doesn\u0027t keep people from talking, though. That and the fact that it\u0027s you and Gretchen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the daughter of the colony leaders, she\u0027s the daughter of the guy everyone knows is next in line on the colony council,\" Enzo said. \"It looks like you\u0027re getting special treatment. If it was just you, people would get it. People know you\u0027ve got that weird thing you have with the Obin - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not weird,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnzo looked at me blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, okay,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People know you\u0027ve got that thing with the Obin, so they wouldn\u0027t think about it if it was just you,\" Enzo said. \"But the two of you is making people nervous. People wonder if you guys know something we don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous,\" I said. \"Gretchen is my best friend. That\u0027s why I asked her. Should I have asked someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have,\" Enzo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like who?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like me,\" Enzo said. \"You know, your boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, because people wouldn\u0027t talk about that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they would and maybe they wouldn\u0027t,\" Enzo said. \"But at least I\u0027d get to see you every once in a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have any good answer to that. So I just gave Enzo a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I\u0027m not trying to make you feel bad or guilty or whatever,\" Enzo said, when I was done. \"But I would like to see more of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That statement can be interpreted in many different ways,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s start with the innocent ones,\" Enzo said. \"But we can go from there if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And anyway, you see me every day,\" rewinding the conversation just a little. \"And we always spend time together at the hootenannies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t count doing schoolwork together as time together,\" Enzo said. \"And as much fun as it is to admire how you trained Hickory to imitate a sitar solo - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Dickory,\" I said. \"Hickory does the drum sounds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnzo gently put a finger to my lips. \"As much fun as it is,\" he repeated. \"I\u0027d rather have some time for just you and me.\" He kissed me, which was pretty effective punctuation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about now?\" I said, after the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t,\" Enzo said. \"On my way home to babysit Maria and Katherina so my parents can have dinner with friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waaah,\" I said. \"Kiss me, tell me you want to spend time together, leave me hanging. Nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I have tomorrow afternoon free,\" Enzo said. \"Maybe then. After you\u0027re done with your stabbing practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We already did stabbing,\" I said. \"Now we\u0027re on to strangulation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joke,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only have your word for that,\" Enzo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cute.\" I kissed him again. \"See you tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day training went long. I skipped dinner to head to Enzo\u0027s parents\u0027 homestead. His mother said he\u0027d waited around, and then headed over to Magdy\u0027s. We didn\u0027t talk to each other much the next day during school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvenings: study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have reached an agreement with Jerry Bennett to allow you to use the information center in the evenings twice a week,\" Hickory said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly felt sorry for Jerry Bennett, who I had heard was more than a little terrified of Hickory and Dickory, and probably would have agreed to anything they asked just so long as they left him alone. I made a mental note to invite Bennett to the next hootenanny. There\u0027s nothing to make an Obin look less threatening than to see one in front of a crowd, bobbing its neck back and forth and making like a tabla drum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHickory continued. \"While you are there, you will study the Colonial Union files of other sentient species.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you want us to learn about them?\" Gretchen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To know how to fight them,\" Hickory said. \"And how to kill them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are hundreds of species in the Conclave,\" I said. \"Are we supposed to learn about each of them? That\u0027s going to take more than two nights a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will be focusing on species who are not members of the Conclave,\" Hickory said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGretchen and I looked at each other. \"But they\u0027re not the ones planning to kill us,\" Gretchen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are many trying to kill you,\" Hickory said. \"And some may be more motivated than others. For example, the Rraey. They recently lost a war with the Enesha, who took control of most of their colonies before they were themselves defeated by the Obin. The Rraey are no longer a direct threat to any established race or colony. But if they were to find you here, there is no doubt what they would do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered. Gretchen noticed. \"You okay?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I said, too quickly. \"I\u0027ve met the Rraey before.\" Gretchen looked at me strangely but didn\u0027t say anything after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a list for you,\" Hickory said. \"Jerry Bennett has already prepared the files you have access to for each species. Take special note of the physiology of each race. This will be important in our instruction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To learn how to fight them,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Hickory said. \"And to learn how to kill them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree weeks into our studies I pulled up a race who were not on our list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, they\u0027re scary-looking,\" Gretchen said, looking over my shoulder after she noticed I had been reading for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re Consu,\" I said. \"They\u0027re scary, period.\" I handed my PDA over to Gretchen. \"They\u0027re the most advanced race we know about. They make us look like we\u0027re banging rocks together. And they\u0027re the ones who made the Obin what they are today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Genetically engineered them?\" Gretchen asked. I nodded. \"Well, maybe next time they can code for personality. What are you looking at them for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just curious,\" I said. \"Hickory and Dickory have talked to me about them before. They\u0027re the closet thing the Obin have to a higher power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their gods,\" Gretchen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"More like a kid with an ant farm,\" I said. \"An ant farm and a magnifying glass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds lovely,\" Gretchen said, and handed back the PDA. \"Hope I never get to meet them. Unless they\u0027re on my side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not on a side,\" I said. \"They\u0027re above.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Above is a side,\" Gretchen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not our side,\" I said, and switched the PDA back to what I was supposed to be reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate evening: everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this is a surprise,\" I said to Enzo, who was sitting on my doorstep as I came back from another thrilling night at the information center. \"I haven\u0027t seen you too much recently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t seen much of anybody recently,\" Enzo said, standing up to greet me. \"It\u0027s just you and Gretchen. And you\u0027ve been avoiding me since we broke up the study group.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not avoiding you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t been going out of your way to look for me,\" Enzo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, he had me there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t blame you for it,\" I said, changing the subject a little. \"It\u0027s not your fault Magdy threw that fit of his.\" After several weeks of increased sniping, things between Magdy and Gretchen finally reached toxic levels; the two of them had a shouting match in class and Magdy ended up saying some fairly not forgivable things and then stomping off, Enzo trailing behind. And that was the end of our little band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s all Magdy\u0027s fault,\" Enzo said. \"Gretchen\u0027s poking at him until he snapped didn\u0027t have anything to do with it at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready this conversation had gone twice to places I didn\u0027t want it to go, and the rational part of my brain was just telling me to let it go and change the subject. But then there was the not quite rational part, which was suddenly getting really annoyed. \"So are you hanging out on my doorstep just to dump on my best friend, or is there some other reason you dropped by?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnzo opened his mouth to say something, and then just shook his head. \"Forget it,\" he said, and started to walk off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blocked his path. \"No,\" I said. \"You came here for a reason. Tell me what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t I see you anymore?\" Enzo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you came here to ask me?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Enzo said. \"It\u0027s not what I came here to say. But it\u0027s what I\u0027m asking you now. It\u0027s been two weeks since Magdy and Gretchen did their thing, Zoe. It was between the two of them, but I\u0027ve hardly seen you since then. If you\u0027re not actually avoiding me, you\u0027re faking it really well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it was between Gretchen and Magdy, why did you leave when he did?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s my friend,\" Enzo said. \"Someone had to calm him down. You know how he gets. You know I\u0027m his heat sink. What kind of question is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just saying it\u0027s not just between Magdy and Gretchen,\" I said. \"It\u0027s between all of us. You and me and Gretchen and Magdy. When was the last time you did anything without Magdy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember him being there when we spend time together,\" Enzo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I mean,\" I said. \"You\u0027re always following him, keeping him from getting hit by someone or breaking his neck or doing something stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not his puppy,\" Enzo said, and for that minute he actually got a little angry. Which was new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored it. \"You\u0027re his friend,\" I said. \"His best friend. And Gretchen is mine. And right now our best friends can\u0027t stand the sight of each other. And that leaks into us, Enzo. Let me ask you, right now, how do you feel about Gretchen? You don\u0027t like her very much, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve had better days,\" Enzo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Because she and your best friend are at it. I feel the same way about Magdy. I guarantee you he feels the same way about me. And Gretchen isn\u0027t feeling very friendly to you. I want to spend time with you, Enzo, but most of the time, both of us are a package deal. We come with our best friends attached. And I don\u0027t want the drama right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s easier just not to bother,\" Enzo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m tired, Enzo,\" I said, spitting out the words. \"Okay? I\u0027m tired. Every morning I wake up and I have to run or do strength exercises or something that tires me out right after I\u0027ve gotten out of bed. I\u0027m tired before the rest of you are even awake. Then school. Then an entire afternoon of getting physically beat up in order to learn how to defend myself, on the chance some aliens want to come down here and kill us all. Then I spend my evenings reading up on every single race out there, not because it\u0027s interesting, but just in case I need to murder one of them, I\u0027ll know where its soft spots are. I hardly have time to think about anything else, Enzo. I am tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think all of this is fun for me? Do you think it\u0027s fun for me not to see you? To spend all my time learning to hurt and kill things? Do you think it\u0027s fun for me that every single day I get my nose rubbed in the fact there\u0027s a whole universe out there just waiting to murder us? When was the last time you thought about it? When was the last time Magdy thought about it? I think about it every day, Enzo. My time is spent doing nothing but. So don\u0027t tell me that it\u0027s just easier for me not to bother with the drama. You have no idea. I\u0027m sorry. But you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnzo stared at me for a minute, and then reached over to wipe my cheeks. \"You could tell me, you know,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed a small laugh. \"I don\u0027t have time,\" I said.
