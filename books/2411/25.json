On his hands and knees he crouched on the grass, fighting his rebellious stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ, Tuck. Jesus bleeding Christ. What\u0027re we going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker didn\u0027t answer. He lay on his back, staring up at heat-hazed stars. It took enough effort just to concentrate on breathing when he was so cold, so bitterly cold. \"In the pond,\" Dwayne said, his throat clicking as he swallowed. \"Somebody dropped her in our pond. We were in there with her. Jesus, we were swimming with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s past being bothered by it.\" He wanted to toss an arm over his eyes. Maybe that would help block out the image of that hand sticking out of the dark water, its fingers curled. As if it had been reaching for him. As if it would grab hold and pull him under. It had been worse because he\u0027d felt obliged to be certain. To be certain it was Darleen Talbot, and to assure himself that she was beyond help. So he\u0027d gritted his teeth and had taken that stiff, dead wrist, tugging against the weight that held the body down. And the head had bobbed up. He\u0027d seen-oh, God, he\u0027d seen what the knife had begun and what the fish were already ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe human form was so frail, he thought now. So vulnerable. So easily whittled away into something hideous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t just leave her in there, Tuck.\" But Dwayne shuddered at the prospect of going back into the water and touching what had once been Darleen Talbot. \"It\u0027s not decent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we have to.\" Tucker thought regretfully of the bottle he\u0027d tossed away. A few swallows of sour mash would do him some good just now. \"At least until Burke gets here. You go in and call him, Dwayne. One of us ought to stay here. Call Burke, and tell him what we found. Tell him Agent Burns better come along.\" Tucker sat up to drag off his wet shirt. \"And bring me out some dry smokes, will you? I wouldn\u0027t say no to a beer either,\" he began, then swore when he caught sight of Caroline walking toward them. Tucker scrambled up, intercepting her after three long strides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to see me?\" Caroline laughed and gave him a quick, hard hug. \"You two decide to take a swim? Delia sent me down to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on back up with Dwayne.\" Tucker wanted her as far away from death and misery as possible. \"Go on up and wait for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait for you.\" Drawing back, she saw by his face that there was trouble. Cautious, she looked from Tucker to his brother. Dwayne\u0027s lip had opened up again, and the blood was dark against his pale face. \"Have you been fighting? Dwayne, you\u0027ve got a split lip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ducked his head. Delia\u0027d give him hell about it. \"I\u0027ll call Burke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burke?\" Caroline grabbed Tucker\u0027s arm when he tried to nudge her along. \"Why do you need Burke?\" Her heart did a slow roll in her chest. \"Tucker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d know soon enough, and it might as well come from him. \"We found her, Caroline. In the pond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God.\" Instinctively, she looked toward the water, but Tucker shifted to block her vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwayne\u0027s going up to call Burke. You go with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stay with you.\" She shook her head before he could protest. \"I\u0027ll stay, Tucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tucker merely shrugged, Dwayne took off in a half run. A whippoorwill began to call, sweet and insistent, for a mate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" Even as she asked, Caroline knew the question was foolish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He blew out a long breath. \"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, poor Happy.\" She had to ask the rest, but it took a moment to force the words from her throat. \"Was it like the others?\" Caroline took his hand, holding tight until his gaze shifted to hers. \"I want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was like the others.\" Firmly, he turned her away from the lake. With his arm around her waist they listened to the night bird\u0027s song and watched the lights of Sweetwater glow against the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe official process worked with callous efficiency. Men crowded around the pond, their faces washed white by the harsh spotlights hooked to Burke\u0027s truck. Pictures were taken to record the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" Burns nodded toward the water. \"Let\u0027s pull her out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment no one spoke. Burke pressed his lips together and unhooked his gun belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it.\" Surprising himself, Tucker stepped forward. \"I\u0027m already wet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurke set his gun belt aside. \"It\u0027s not your job, Tuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my land.\" Turning, he took Caroline by the shoulders. \"Go inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll go in together when it\u0027s finished.\" She kissed his cheek. \"You\u0027re a good man, Tucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know about that, but as he slipped into the water, he was certain he was a stupid one. Burke was right, it wasn\u0027t his job. He didn\u0027t get paid to deal with this kind of horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased his way through the cool, dark water toward the hand, white as bone, fingers curved beckoningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did he feel it was his responsibility to drag a dead woman out of the water? She\u0027d been nothing to him in life, shouldn\u0027t she be less than nothing to him now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the pond was Sweetwater, he realized. And he was a Longstreet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the second time, he curled his fingers around the lifeless wrist. As the head rose, he watched her hair float and spread toward the surface. His stomach lurched. He tasted acid in the back of his throat and ruthlessly forced it down. Using his feet to tread, Tucker hooked an arm around the torso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence on the bank, the kind so deep you could hear your own heartbeat. A graveyard silence, he thought while he struggled against the weight that was trying to drag him and his burden down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grip slipped, and when he shifted and tightened it, her head lolled back on his shoulder. Tucker stiffened, but it wasn\u0027t revulsion that filled him. It was pity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker looked toward the bank. White faces stared back at him. He saw Dwayne, with an arm around Josie. Their eyes looked huge in the flood of light. Burke and Carl already hunkered down, ready to reach out and take the burden Tucker was dragging over. Caroline, her face wet, stood with her hand resting on Cy\u0027s shoulder. Burns stood back, observing, as though it were a moderately interesting play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something\u0027s tied to her legs,\" Tucker called out. \"I need a knife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s evidence, Longstreet.\" Burns stepped forward. \"I want it intact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You son of a bitch.\" Tucker managed to haul her another foot. \"Why don\u0027t you come on in and get your fucking evidence yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll help you, Mr. Tucker.\" Before anyone could stop him, Cy was running over and slipping into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ, boy, get back from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can help.\" Slick as an otter, Cy paddled over. \"I\u0027m strong enough.\" His face blanched when he swam close, but he reached down to take part of the weight. \"We can do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep your eye on the bank,\" Tucker told him. \"And try not to think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCy scissored his feet. \"I\u0027m thinking about what an asshole that FBI man is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a short and grisly swim. When they reached the bank, both Carl and Burke hooked hands under Darleen\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look the other way,\" Tucker ordered Cy. \"There\u0027s no shame in it.\" He would have done so himself, but the angle was wrong. So he saw what had been done to the body. As it was dragged effortfully out and onto the grass, he saw everything. \"Go on over with Caroline now, Cy. No.\" He caught the boy\u0027s head before Cy could turn it. \"Don\u0027t look this way. Go over with Caroline. You did good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yessir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker hauled himself out. He sat there a moment, his feet dangling in the water. \"Dwayne, give me a smoke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Josie who brought him a cigarette, already lighted. \"After that, I figure you deserve a whole one.\" She laid her cheek against his. \"I\u0027m sorry it had to be you, Tuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So\u0027m I.\" He took a greedy drag. \"Burke, don\u0027t you have a blanket to put over her? This isn\u0027t right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you civilians would go into the house,\" Burns began, \"this area will remain off limits until the investigation is completed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddammit, we knew her,\" Tucker said wearily. \"You didn\u0027t. Least you can do for her is cover her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on, Tuck.\" Burke reached down to help Tucker to his feet. \"There are things we gotta do. It\u0027s best if you went on while we get to it. We\u0027ll be as quick as we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw what was done to her, Burke,\" Tucker said in a raw voice. \"You can\u0027t be quick enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will stay available,\" Burns put in. \"You and your brother. I\u0027ll need to question you shortly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaying nothing, Tucker turned away to walk with Caroline and Cy back to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline wasn\u0027t much of a cook, but she heated up some soup to go with the roast beef Delia had sliced. Soup, it seemed to her, was one of those nerve-soothing foods. By the way Cy plowed through his, she decided it worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwayne scraped his bowl clean, then seemed embarrassed by his appetite. \"That was mighty tasty, Caroline. I appreciate you putting a meal together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delia did most of it before she left for the Fullers\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do appreciate it,\" Josie put in. \"Though I don\u0027t know how Dwayne can eat with that fat lip. Run into a door, honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tucker and I had a tussle.\" He reached for his iced tea. He didn\u0027t feel much like getting drunk tonight after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tucker hit you?\" Smiling a little, Josie rested her chin on her hand. \"That man\u0027s been using his fists more these past few weeks than he has his whole life. Now, what could y\u0027all be fighting about? Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027ve taken a shine to Caroline here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie winked at Caroline to include her in the joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing like that.\" Uncomfortable, Dwayne shifted in his chair. \"We just had a disagreement, that\u0027s all. That\u0027s how it happened. We started wrestling and ended up in the pond. Guess we stirred up the water quite a bit between that and racing to the far bank and back. Then Tucker... he practically bumped right into her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think about it.\" Josie rose to put her arms around his neck. \"It was just bad luck. Bad luck all around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a mighty cold way of putting it,\" Tucker said as he stepped into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie kept her cheek against Dwayne\u0027s hair. \"It\u0027s the truth. Sometimes the truth\u0027s cold. If you hadn\u0027t been wrestling around in the pond, you wouldn\u0027t have found her. She\u0027d still be dead, but she might\u0027ve stayed down. Then the two of you wouldn\u0027t be looking so peaked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker dropped into a chair. He knew his temper was on edge, but Josie\u0027s carelessness pushed a dangerous button. \"We won\u0027t look \u0027peaked\u0027 for long. Darleen\u0027s going to be dead forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just my point. Finding her like that only made things hard on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ, Josie, you\u0027ve got the sensitivity of a codfish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened at that, eyes hot, cheeks pale. \"I\u0027ve got plenty of sensitivity when it comes to my family. Maybe I don\u0027t give two hoots about what happened to that little slut-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josie.\" Wincing, Dwayne reached for her hand, but she shook him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just what she was, and her being dead doesn\u0027t change it. I\u0027m sorry for Happy and the rest, but I\u0027m just sick about how you and Dwayne came to be involved. If you think that makes me cold, Tucker Longstreet, that\u0027s fine. I\u0027ll just save my sensitivity for someone who appreciates it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slammed out, leaving the smoke of her temper lingering in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I\u0027ll go after her.\" Dwayne rose awkwardly. \"Smooth her feathers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her I\u0027m sorry, if you think it\u0027ll help.\" Resigned, Tucker rubbed his hands over his face. \"No use slicing at her for being what she is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Tucker, you want a beer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker lowered his hands and gave Cy a wan smile. \"About as much as I want to breathe right now. But I think I\u0027d do better with coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get it.\" Caroline opened a cupboard for a cup. \"We\u0027re all on edge, Tucker. She\u0027s just worried about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Did Delia go over to the Fullers\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she and Birdie were going to stay the night with Happy. Help take care of the baby. Cousin Lulu\u0027s upstairs watching a movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t add that the lady had commented that murders were much more interesting on TV than in real life, and had settled back with a bowl of popcorn and a bottle of Dixie beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you go on up with her, Cy?\" Tucker suggested. \"She likes company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I take the pup with me?\" He hauled Useless out from the dog\u0027s spot beneath the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" Caroline smiled. \"Don\u0027t let Cousin Lulu give him too much beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am. \u0027Night, Mr. Tucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Night, Cy.\" He touched the boy\u0027s arm. \"Thanks for helping out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d do anything for you, Mr. Tucker.\" The words came out in a rush. Then Cy colored deep and hurried from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Devotion like that\u0027s a precious gift.\" Caroline ladled out soup. \"You\u0027ll be careful with him, won\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to try.\" Tucker rubbed a hand over his rough chin. He hadn\u0027t shaved, though he\u0027d showered twice. \"I guess I wish he wouldn\u0027t look at me like I was Hercules, Plato, and Clark Kent all rolled into one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline set the bowl in front of him, brushed a hand through his hair. \"It\u0027s tough being a hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s tougher trying to be one when you haven\u0027t got the makings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I think you\u0027ll surprise yourself.\" Smiling, she sat beside him. \"I made you soup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I see.\" He took her hand. \"You sure are handy to have around, Caroline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been pretty busy surprising myself lately. I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t know me before, Tucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before doesn\u0027t mean diddly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This from a man who\u0027ll-at the drop of a hat-tell me stories about people who\u0027ve been dead for a hundred years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s different.\" He started to eat, more to please her than because he was hungry. After the first few spoonfuls, he discovered he was ravenous. \"What happened before matters because it shapes things. But who you were a year ago isn\u0027t as important as who you are now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like the way you think. Tucker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to stay tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze came back to hers, fastened there with a wealth of feeling and need. \"I want you to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, she rose. \"Let me fix you a sandwich.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeddy was back. Josie knew he was expected since she\u0027d spent the evening in Burns\u0027s bed and the FBI agent had told her so. The idea of having a pathologist and a special agent to juggle had eased her hurt and anger at Tucker\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d decided she wouldn\u0027t speak to her brother for a day or two-at least until he\u0027d apologized in person rather than sending Dwayne scrambling after her as proxy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still brooding over it the following afternoon. While the rest of Innocence was reeling in shock over the latest murder, Josie sat at the counter of the Chat \u0027N Chew, freshening her lipstick in her new purse mirror. Teddy had promised to join her for lunch as soon as he\u0027d finished his preliminary examination of the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earleen.\" Pouting, Josie tilted the mirror back to fluff at her hair. \"Do you think I\u0027m a cold-hearted woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cold-hearted?\" Earleen leaned on the counter and flexed her aching feet. \"Kinda hard to be hot-blooded and cold-hearted all at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePleased, Josie smiled. \"That\u0027s true. Being honest about things and not pretending otherwise doesn\u0027t make you cold. Why, it makes you true to yourself, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the mirror, Josie scanned the diner without turning around. Several of the booths were occupied. Beneath the crooning of Reba Mclntire from the juke, the conversation was all about Darleen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, half the people in here didn\u0027t have a minute\u0027s use for Darleen while she was alive.\" Josie snapped the mirror closed. \"Now that she\u0027s dead, they can\u0027t say enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s human nature,\" Earleen declared. \"It\u0027s like one of them artists whose paintings ain\u0027t worth shit while he\u0027s alive to paint \u0027em, then once he kills himself or gets hit by a truck, people fall all over themselves to pay a fortune for them. Human nature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie appreciated the analogy. \"So Darleen\u0027s worth more dead than she was alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she might have agreed, Earleen was superstitious enough not to speak ill of the dead. \"It\u0027s Junior I\u0027m sorry for. And that dear little boy.\" With a sigh, Earleen reached back to take an order off the shelf. \"And Happy and Singleton, too. The living\u0027s who suffers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Earleen walked off to serve a customer, Josie murmured in agreement. She dug through her purse for her atomizer of perfume, then squirted scent liberally on her wrists and throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Carl walked in, the conversation died, then picked up again in murmurs. Josie patted the stool beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on over here and sit. You look worn out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Josie, but I can\u0027t. Just come by to get some food to take back to the office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I get for you, Carl?\" Earleen popped back behind the counter, hoping to exchange food for news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a half dozen hamburgers. Maybe a quart of your potato salad and some cole slaw. Make it a gallon of iced tea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027re you going to want them burgers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make them all medium, Earleen, and load \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie picked up her Diet Coke. \"Y\u0027all must be busy as one-armed paperhangers down at the office if you can\u0027t even break for lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are that, Josie.\" He was so tired himself he could have slept standing up. Belatedly, he remembered to take off his hat. \"County sheriff and a couple of his boys\u0027re down. Agent Burns has had that fax machine clicking all morning. It\u0027s hot enough in that office to smoke a ham.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With all of you working so hard, you must have some clues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got a thing or two.\" He glanced over as Earleen turned expectantly from the grill. \"Now, I can\u0027t tell you what we got, official like. But y\u0027all know Darleen was killed like the others. We gotta figure it was the same person using the same weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It ain\u0027t right,\" Earleen said. \"We got some psychopathic killer running loose, and not a woman in the county can feel safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it ain\u0027t right. But we\u0027re going to stop him. You can take that to the bank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matthew says serial killers\u0027re different.\" Josie sucked on the straw. \"He says they can look and act just like regular people. It makes them hard to catch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll catch this one.\" He leaned closer. \"I figure I should tell you, Josie, since you\u0027ll be finding out soon anyway. Looks like Darleen was killed right there, right by the pond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet Jesus.\" Earleen was torn between excitement and terror. \"You mean to say he did it over to Sweetwater?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got reason to think so. I don\u0027t mean to scare you, Josie, but you want to be mighty careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a cigarette from the pack on the counter and her fingers shook lightly. \"I will be, Carl. You can take that to the bank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she blew out a stream of smoke. And she intended to find out exactly what they knew the minute she could get Teddy alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were reporters camped out in her yard. Caroline had stopped answering the phone. Invariably, it was another inquisitive newsman or -woman on the other end. To distract herself, she took out the scrapbook she\u0027d found in her grandmother\u0027s trunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline could see most of her own life on those pages. Her parents\u0027 wedding announcement clipped from the Philadelphia and Greenville papers. The studied, professional photographs taken at the wedding where her mother had worn an heirloom bridal gown-from the Waverly side. The card announcing the birth of Caroline Louisa Waverly. She\u0027d been named for her paternal grandmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few photographs, again professionally done, of the proud parents with their little bundle of joy. Then, of Caroline alone, one studio portrait for each year of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo snapshots, she noted, no out-of-focus or candid shots, except for the few her grandparents had taken themselves on her brief visit all those years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewspaper clippings marking her musical career, showing her at six and twelve and twenty, and the years between and after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of the few things her grandparents had had of her, Caroline thought as she set the book back inside the trunk. Now it was one of the few things she had of her grandparents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry,\" she murmured, and drew deeply of the scent of lavender and cedar that wafted from the trunk. \"I wish I\u0027d known you better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached in and took out a cardboard box. Inside, wrapped in tissue, was a tiny christening gown trimmed with white ribbons and yellowing lace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps her grandmother or grandfather had worn it, Caroline thought as she ran her fingers over the soft white lawn. Surely her mother had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saved it for me.\" Touched, she brushed her cheek over it. \"I couldn\u0027t wear it when my turn came, but you saved it for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, she wrapped it back into its bed of tissue. One day, she vowed, her child would wear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUseless raced out of the room to stand at the top of the steps, then raced back again as someone hammered on the door. Caroline set the box back in the trunk, then took out a pair of bronzed baby shoes. She smiled over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bother, Useless. It\u0027s just one of the idiot reporters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caroline! Dammit, open up before I have to kill one of these jackasses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tucker.\" Jumping up, she ran downstairs with the dog at her heels. \"Sorry.\" As she unlocked the door, she could see the reporters crowding behind him, thrusting out their mikes, snapping pictures and shouting questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dragged Tucker in by the arm, then planted herself in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get off my porch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Waverly, how does it feel to find yourself living a real life murder mystery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Waverly, is it true you came to Mississippi to mend a broken heart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you really collapse in-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it true you killed-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you acquainted with-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get off my porch!\" she bellowed. \"And get off my land while you\u0027re at it. You\u0027re trespassing, the lot of you, and we have laws down here. And if one of you so much as sets a toe over my boundary line without invitation, I\u0027ll shoot if off.\" She slammed the door, threw the bolt, and started to turn when Tucker scooped her up in a quick circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, you sounded just like my mama did when she got her dander up.\" He kissed her before setting her on her feet. \"You\u0027re losing the Yankee in your speech, too. Pretty soon you\u0027ll be saying \u0027y\u0027all\u0027 and \u0027fix\u0027n to\u0027 just like a native.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, but shook her head. \"I will not.\" She touched a hand to his cheek. He hadn\u0027t shaved, but most of the fatigue had drained out of his eyes. \"You look better than you did this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not saying much, seeing as I looked like death warmed over this morning. Felt like it, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I caught an hour in the hammock this afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelt like old times.\" He drew her close again, but this time when he kissed her it was slow and easy. \"So does that. I sure wish you\u0027d lowered your standards of respectability and shared my bed last night. I still wouldn\u0027t have slept, but I\u0027d\u0027ve felt better about being awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t seem right, with the house full of your family, and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the police poking \u0027round the pond half the night,\" he finished. Turning away, he walked into the parlor and glanced out of the window. \"Do something for me, Caro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go up and pack what you need, and come back to Sweetwater with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tucker, I told you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stayed last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You needed me to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still need you.\" When she said nothing, he spur around. \"This isn\u0027t the time for poetry and romance And I\u0027m not asking because I want you in bed with me I\u0027d stay here with you if that was all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. Don\u0027t ask me to choose between you and my family, Caroline, because I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I go home without you, I\u0027ll be eaten up with worry over you. If I stay, it\u0027ll be the same for Josie and Delia and the rest.\" He pulled her back to him, held her close. Then, restless, he yanked away to pace the room. \"He\u0027s still out there somewhere, Caroline. And he was at Sweetwater.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand that, Tucker. I know he left the body there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He killed her there.\" Eyes filled with turmoil, he turned back. \"He killed her there, in sight of my house, by the trees where I fished with Cy only days ago. A tree my mother planted. Burke told me enough, maybe too much. I\u0027m going to tell you. I don\u0027t want to, but I\u0027m going to so you understand that I\u0027ve got to go back there, and I\u0027m not going without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a long, measuring breath. \"He staked her out on the ground under the tree. They found the holes where he\u0027d staked her hands and feet. And the blood the rain didn\u0027t wash away. I saw what he did to her. I\u0027m not likely to forget what she looked like when I helped pull her out of the water. I\u0027m not likely to forget it was done where my mother planted a willow tree, where I used to play with my brother and sister, across the water from where I kissed you the first time. I\u0027m not likely to forget any of that. He\u0027s not going to touch anything else that\u0027s important to me. Now I\u0027m asking you to get what you need and come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped forward to take the hands he\u0027d balled into fists. \"I don\u0027t need much.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/carnal-innocence/page-25.html","bookId":2411,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:14 AM"}
