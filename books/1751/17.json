Their view of the final object of the search was somewhat obscured by the underbrush behind which they remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed said, \"Holy smokes. Look at that. It\u0027s al shiny silver or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was Slim who was really excited. He caught at the other. \"I know what this is. It\u0027s a spaceship. That must be why my father came here. He\u0027s one of the biggest astronomers in the world and your father would have to call him if a spaceship landed on his estate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about? Dad didn\u0027t even know that thing was there. He only came here because I told him I heard the thunder from here. Besides, there isn\u0027t any such thing as a spaceship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, there is. Look at it. See those round things. They\u0027re ports. And you can see the rocket tubes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know so much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim was flushed. He said, \"I read about them. My father has books about them. Old books. From Beforethewars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Huh. Now I know you\u0027re making it up. Books from Beforethewars!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My father has to have them. He teaches at the University. It\u0027s his job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice had risen and Red had to pull at him. \"You want them to hear us?\" he whispered indignantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it is, too, a spaceship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look here, Slim, you mean that\u0027s a ship from another world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s got to be. Look at my father going round and round it. He wouldn\u0027t be so interested if it was anything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other worlds! Where are there other worlds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everywhere. How about the planets? They\u0027re worlds just like ours, some of them. And other stars probably have planets. There\u0027s probably zillions of planets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed felt outweighed and outnumbered. He muttered, \"You\u0027re crazy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then. I\u0027ll show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down there. I\u0027m going to ask my father. I suppose you\u0027ll believe it if he tells you. I suppose you\u0027ll believe a Professor of Astronomy knows what-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had scrambled upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed said, \"Hey. You don\u0027t want them to see us. We\u0027re not supposed to be here. Do you want them to start asking questions and find out about our animals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care. You said I was crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Snitcher! You promised you wouldn\u0027t tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to tell. But if they find our themselves, it\u0027s your fault for starting an argument and saying I was crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take it back then,\" grumbled Red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, all right. You better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a way, Slim was disappointed. He wanted to see the space-ship at closer quarters. Still, he could not break his vow of secrecy even in spirit without at least the excuse of personal insult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed said, \"It\u0027s awfully small for a spaceship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, because it\u0027s probably a scout ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet Dad couldn\u0027t even get into the old thing.\" So much Slim realized to be true. It was a weak point in his argument and he made no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed rose to his feet; an elaborate attitude of boredom all about him. \"Well, I guess we better be going. There\u0027s business to do and I can\u0027t spend all day here looking at some old spaceship or whatever it is. We\u0027ve got to take care of the animals if we\u0027re going to be circus folks. That\u0027s the first rule with circus folks. They\u0027ve got to take care of the animals. And,\" he finished virtuously, \"that\u0027s what I aim to do, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim said, \"What for, Red? They\u0027ve got plenty of meat. Let\u0027s watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no fun in watching. Besides Dad and your father are going away and I guess it\u0027s about lunch time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed became argumentative. \"Look, Slim, we can\u0027t start acting suspicious or they\u0027re going to start investigating. Holy smokes, don\u0027t you ever read any detective stories? When you\u0027re trying to work a big deal without being caught, it\u0027s practically the main thing to keep on acting just like always. Then they don\u0027t suspect anything. That\u0027s the first law-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, all right\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim rose resentfully. At the moment, the circus appeared to him a rather tawdry and shoddy substitute for the glories of astronomy, and he wondered how he had come to fall in with Red\u0027s silly scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown the slope they went, Slim, as usual, in the rear. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-17.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
