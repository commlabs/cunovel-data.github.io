She was from the coast, and she’d left behind a man she loved – this was Lether, don’t forget, and her whole community was trapped in the Indebted way of life. It’s why she came to work for our family. As for the young man, well, he was sent to sea.’ He was silent for a moment, remembering, and then he said, ‘Every night, she told me how she wanted her life to turn out – though of course I didn’t realize that at the time. But the truth of it was, she wanted that happy ending. She needed to believe in it. For her, and for everyone else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara sighed. ‘What happened to her?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As far as I know, she’s still there, at the country estate.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are you trying to break my heart, Henar?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. ‘My father worked the system as best he could, and he was not unkind with his Indebted. About a year before I left to train with the Lancers, watermelon tits with big eyes married the son of one of our horse-trainers. My last vision of her, her belly was out to here and those tits were even bigger.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She’d given up on her man from the sea, then. Well, probably wise, I suppose. Part of growing up.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenar eyed her, and then away, out over the rocky landscape. ‘I think about her, every now and then.’ He grinned. ‘I even used to fantasize about her, yes, in the way young men will do.’ The grin faded. ‘But mostly I see her sitting on the edge of the bed, her hands flying and her eyes getting wider, and in that bed is her own child. A boy. Who will dream sweet dreams. And when the lantern is turned down, when she’s standing by the door to his room, that’s when the tears will run down her cheeks. And she’ll remember a young man on the edge of the sea.’ Lostara’s breathing had changed, somehow, and her face was hidden from his view. ‘My love?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer reply was muffled. ‘It’s all right. Henar, you keep surprising me. That’s all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’ll survive this, Lostara Yil,’ he said. ‘And one day I will lead you by the hand up to my father’s house. And we’ll see him, standing there, waiting for us. And he will laugh.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, wiping at her cheeks. ‘Laugh?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There are pleasures in the world, Lostara Yil, that go beyond words.’ I heard one of those pleasures once. And I will hear it again. I will .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Before I reached the lofty position of inexhaustible masturbation that is Demidrek Septarch of the Great Temple,’ Banaschar was saying, ‘I had to follow the same rituals as everyone else. And one of those rituals was to counsel commoners – who knows why they’d ever seek out a priest of the Autumn Worm, but then, the truth of it is, the real and true function of priests of all colours is simply that of listening to a litany of moans, fears and confessions, all for the betterment of someone’s soul – never could figure out whose, but no matter.’ He paused. ‘Are you actually listening, Adjunct?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It appears that I have little choice,’ she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Glass Desert stretched ahead of them. A small flanking troop, scouts, he assumed, were slightly ahead and to the left – north – of the vanguard, moving on foot as was everyone else. But directly before Banaschar and the Adjunct there stretched nothing but a broken plain studded with crystals, beneath a ghoulish sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ex-priest shrugged. ‘Now isn’t this an interesting turn. Blessed woman, will you hear my tales of mortal woe? Will you give counsel?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look she cast at him was unreadable and it occurred to him, an instant later, that it was just as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cleared his throat. ‘Occasionally, one of them would complain. About me. Or, rather, about us sanctimonious shits in these ridiculous robes and whatnot. You know what they’d be so irritated about? I’ll tell you. Love . That’s what.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second glance, even briefer than the first one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. ‘Precisely. They asked: “You, priest – you, with that hand beneath the vestments – what in Hood’s name do you know about love? More to the point, what do you know about romance ?” You see, most people end up moaning about relationships. More than being poor, or lame or sick, more than any other topic you could imagine. Lovers, husbands, wives, strangers, sisters – endless confessions and desires and betrayals and all the rest. That’s why the question would eventually come round – being priests we’d excused ourselves from the whole mess. Hardly a strong position from which to dispense inane truisms passing as advice. Do you follow me so far, Adjunct?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-170.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
