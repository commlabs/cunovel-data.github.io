Mosag, Menandore, Sukul Ankhadu, blah blah.’ He waved one hand. ‘But we’re here, sweetness. We got its name, y’see.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jaghut cocked her head. ‘Then, I am not needed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, that’s true enough. Unless you care for a drink?’ He tugged the jug free of Pinosel’s grip, raised it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jaghut stared a moment longer, then she said, ‘A pleasing offer, thank you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe damned sun was up, but on this side the city’s wall was all shadow. Except, Sergeant Balm saw, for the wide open gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, Masan Gilani did that unthinkable thing again and rose in her stirrups, leaning forward as she urged her horse into a gallop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom just behind Balm, Throatslitter moaned like a puppy under a brick. Balm shook his head. Another sick thought just popping into his head like a squeezed tick. Where was he getting them from anyway? And why was that gate open and why were they all riding hard straight for it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd was that corpses he saw just inside? Figures moving about amidst smoke? Weapons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was that sound from the other side of that gate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sharpers!’ Deadsmell called out behind him. ‘Keneb’s in! He’s holding the gate!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeneb? Who in Hood’s name was Keneb?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ride!’ Balm shouted. ‘They’re after us! Ride for Aren!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasan Gilani’s rising and lowering butt swept into the shadow of the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter cried out and that was the sound all right, when the cat dives under the cartwheel and things go squirt and it wasn’t his fault he’d hardly kicked at all. ‘It dived out there, Ma! Oh, I hate cities! Let’s go home-ride! Through that hole! What’s it called? The big false-arched canti-levered hole!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlunging into gloom, horse hoofs suddenly skidding, the entire beast slewing round beneath him. Impact. Hip to rump, and Balm was thrown, arms reaching out, wrapping tight round a soft yielding assembly of perfected flesh-and she yelped, pulled with him as he plunged past dragging Masan Gilani from her saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHard onto cobbles, Balm’s head slamming down, denting and dislodging his helm. Her weight deliciously flattening him for a single exquisite moment before she rolled off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorses stumbling, hoofs cracking down way too close. Soldiers rushing in, pulling them clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalm stared up into a familiar face. ‘Thorn Tissy, you ain’t dead?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ugly face spread into a toad’s grin-toad under a brick oh they smile wide then don’t they-and then a calloused hand slapped him hard. ‘You with us, Balm? Glad you arrived-we’re getting pressed here-seems the whole damned city garrison is here, tryin’ to retake the gate.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Garrison? What’s Blistig thinking? We’re on his side! Show me the famous dancing girls of Aren, Tissy, that’s what I’m here to see and maybe more than see, hey?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorn Tissy dragged Balm onto his feet, set the dented helm back onto Balm’s head, then he took him by the shoulders and turned him round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was Keneb, and there, just beyond, barricades of wreckage and soldiers crouching down reloading crossbows while others hacked at Letherii soldiers trying to force a breach. Somewhere to the right a sharper detonated in an alley mouth where the enemy had been gathering for another rush. People screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFist Keneb stepped up to Balm. ‘Where are the rest, Sergeant?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Adjunct and the army!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In the transports, sir, where else? Worst storm I’ve ever seen and now all the ships are upside down-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Balm Deadsmell said, ‘Fist, they should be on the march.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Get Masan Gilani back on her horse,’ Keneb said and Balm wanted to kiss the man, ‘and I don’t care if she kills the beast but I want her to reach the Adjunct-they need to step it up. Send their cavalry ahead riding hard.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re running low on munitions and quarrels and there’s more of the Letherii gathering with every damned breath and if they find a decent commander we won’t be able to hold.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas the Fist talking to Balm? He wasn’t sure, but he wanted to turn round to watch Masan Gilani jump with her legs spread onto that horse’s back, oh yes he did, but these hands on his shoulders wouldn’t let him and someone was whimpering in his ear- \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-449.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
