I\u0027m going to keep trying anyway.\" She pauses, then says, \"Do you want to know how your chemistry partner is holding up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"Nope. Don\u0027t care.\" The words almost get stuck in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs in frustration, then walks over to the window ledge and picks up the chemistry book. \"Should I take this back with me, or leave it here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts the book back on the ledge and heads for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I\u0027d chosen biology instead of chemistry,\" I say as she opens the door to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winks at me knowingly. \"No, you don\u0027t. And just so you know, Dr. Aguirre will be coming to visit later today. I\u0027d advise against throwing things at him as he walks through the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got out of the hospital after two weeks, my mom took us to Mexico. A month later I got a job as a valet at a hotel in San Miguel de Allende, near my family\u0027s house. A nice hotel, with whitewashed walls and pillars in the front entrance. I acted as an interpreter when needed, since my English was better than most of the employees\u0027. When I went out with the guys after work, they tried to set me up with Mexican girls. The girls were beautiful, sexy, and definitely knew how to tempt a guy. The problem was, they weren\u0027t Brittany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed to get her out of my head. And fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried. One night an American girl staying at the hotel brought me up to her room. At first I thought it would take having sex with another blond girl to erase that one night I had with Brittany. But once I was about to do it, I froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized then that Brittany had ruined every other girl for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not Brittany\u0027s face, not her smile, not even her eyes. All of that surface stuff made the world see her as beautiful, but it was the deeper stuff that made her different. It was the gentle way she wiped her sister\u0027s face, the way she took chemistry so seriously, the way she showed her love even when she knew what and who I was. I was about to do a drug deal, something she was adamantly against, and she still loved me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now, three months after the shooting, I\u0027m back in Fairfield about to face what Mrs. P. would call my greatest fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnrique is sitting at his desk at the auto body shop, shaking his head. We talked about Halloween night and I forgave him for whatever involvement he\u0027d had in letting Lucky know I\u0027d been with Brittany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnrique lets out a long, slow breath after I tell him what I\u0027m going to do. \"You could die,\" he says, looking up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be able to help you. None of your friends in the Blood can help you. Reconsider, Alex. Go back to Mexico and enjoy the rest of your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve made my choice and have no intention of backing down. \"I\u0027m not gonna be a coward. I need to do this. I need to quit the Blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" And for my papa. And for Paco. And for me and my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What good is quitting the Blood if you end up dead?\" Enrique asks. \"Your jumping in will seem like a holiday party compared to this. They\u0027ll even make OG\u0027s participate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of answering, I hand him a piece of paper with a phone number on it. \"If anythin\u0027 happens to me, call this guy. He\u0027s the only friend I\u0027ve got who\u0027s not connected.\" Not connected to the Blood, or Brittany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night I\u0027m facing a warehouse full of people who consider me a traitor. I\u0027ve been called a bunch of other things tonight, too. An hour ago I told Chuy, who\u0027d taken over Hector\u0027s position, I wanted out--a clean break from the Latino Blood. Just one little hitch ... in order to do that I need to survive their gauntlet--a 360 violation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuy, stiff and stern, steps forward with a Latino Blood bandanna. I scan the onlookers. My friend Pedro is standing in the back, his eyes averted. Javier and Lucky are there, too, their eyes blazing with excitement. Javier is a crazy motherfucker and Lucky is not happy he lost the bet even though I never collected. Both will enjoy being able to beat the shit out of me while I can\u0027t fight back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnrique, my cousin, is leaning against the wall in the corner of the warehouse. He\u0027ll be expected to participate in the challenge, to aid in breaking whatever bones possible until I pass out. Loyalty and commitment mean everything to the LB. You break that loyalty, you break that commitment. . . you\u0027re as good as an enemy in their eyes. Worse even, because you were one of them. If Enrique steps forward to protect me, he\u0027s toast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand proud while Chuy covers my eyes with the bandanna. I can do this. If it brings me to Brittany in the end, it\u0027s all worth it. I\u0027m not gonna even think about the other option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my hands are bound behind my back, I\u0027m led to a car and pushed into the backseat while two people flank me. I have no clue where we\u0027re headed. Since Chuy is in charge now, anything is possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA note. I never wrote a note. What if I die and Brittany never knows how I feel about her? Maybe it\u0027s a good thing. She\u0027ll be able to get on with her life easier thinking I\u0027m a prick who betrayed her and never looked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty-five minutes later the car is off-road. I can tell by the gravel crunching under the tires. Maybe knowing where I am would take the edge off, but I can\u0027t see a damn thing. I\u0027m not nervous. More like anxious to know if I\u0027ll be one of the lucky ones to survive. And even if I do survive, will someone find me? Or will I die alone in some barn, warehouse, or abandoned building? Maybe they\u0027re not going to beat me. Maybe they\u0027ll take me to the roof of a building and just push me off. Se acabo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNah, Chuy wouldn\u0027t like that. He likes to hear the screaming and pleas of strong guys brought down to their knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not going to give him the satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m led out of the car. From the sound of my feet against gravel and stones, we\u0027re in the middle of nowhere. I hear more cars parking, more feet following behind us. A cow moos in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA warning moo? Truth is, I want to do this. If it\u0027s interrupted, it will postpone the inevitable. I\u0027m willing. I\u0027m ready. Let\u0027s get it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if I\u0027ll be hung by my hands to a branch of a tree, strung up like a whipping boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man, I hate the unknown. Estoy perdido.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay here,\" I\u0027m instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if I have anywhere to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone is walking toward me. I can hear the gravel crunch with each step. \"You are a disgrace to this brotherhood, Alejandro. We protected you and your family, and you\u0027ve decided to turn your back on us. Is that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish my life was a John Grisham novel. His heroes always seem to be one step away from death but come up with a brilliant plan. It usually includes hiding information that will ruin the bad guy, and if the hero ends up dead, the bad guy will be ruined for life. Unfortunately, real life can\u0027t be wrapped up with a nice little bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hector was the one who betrayed the Blood,\" I respond. \"El traidor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe response to my calling Hector a traitor is a hard fist to my jaw. Shit, I wasn\u0027t ready for that because I can\u0027t see a fucking thing with this blindfold on. I try not to wince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You understand the consequences of leaving the Blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI work my jaw back and forth. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear crunching stones as a circle of people close in. I\u0027m the bull\u0027s-eye this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn eerie silence settles over the crowd. Nobody laughs; nobody makes a sound. Some of the guys surrounding me have been my friends all my life. Like Enrique, they\u0027re waging a war inside themselves. I don\u0027t blame them. The lucky ones haven\u0027t been chosen to fight today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout warning, I get punched in my face. Attempting to keep myself upright is hard, especially because I know more hits are coming. It\u0027s one thing to be in a fight you could possibly win, but it\u0027s another to know you\u0027ve got zero chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething sharp slashes my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I get punched in the ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach blow is connecting with my upper body--no inch is left untouched. A slice here, a fist there. I stagger a few times, only to be pulled upright and slammed into another hard fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got a gash in my back and it stings as if flames are licking at my skin. I can tell Enrique\u0027s punches because they don\u0027t pack as much fury as the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemories of Brittany keep me from crying out in pain. I\u0027m going to be strong for her . . . for us. I\u0027m not going to let them control whether I live or die. I\u0027m in charge of my destiny, not the Blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no clue how much time goes by. A half hour? An hour? My body is weakening. I\u0027m having trouble standing. I smell smoke. Are they going to push me into a fire? The bandanna is still secured over my eyes, but it doesn\u0027t matter because I\u0027m pretty sure my eyes are swollen shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like caving and falling to the ground but force myself to stand tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m probably unrecognizable now, hot blood streaming from gashes in my face and body. I can feel my shirt being ripped open and it\u0027s falling off in pieces, exposing the scar where Hector shot me. A fist punches me right there. It\u0027s too much pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slump to the ground, my face scraping the gravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, I\u0027m not sure I can make it. Brittany. Brittany. Brittany. As long as I repeat the mantra in my head, I know I\u0027m still alive. Brittany. Brittany. Brittany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs the smell of smoke real, or is it the smell of death?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the thick haze in my mind I think I hear someone saying, \"Don\u0027t you think he\u0027s had enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear a distant but distinct \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtests follow. If I could move, I would. Brittany. Brittany. Brittany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore protests. Nobody protests during these challenges. It\u0027s not allowed. What\u0027s happening? What\u0027s next? It must be worse than the beating, because I hear a lot of arguing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold him facedown,\" Chuy\u0027s voice rings out. \"Nobody betrays the Latino Blood on my watch. Let this be a lesson to anyone else who tries to betray us. Alejandro Fuentes\u0027s body will always be marked, a reminder of his betrayal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burning smell gets closer. I have no clue what\u0027s about to happen until my upper back is touched with what feels like hot coals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I groaned. Or growled. Or screamed. I don\u0027t know anymore. I don\u0027t know anything anymore. I can\u0027t think. All I can do is feel. They might as well have thrown me into the fire, this is a torture worse than anything I could have imagined. The smell of burning skin sears my nostrils as I realize the coals aren\u0027t coals at all. The bastard is branding me. El dolor, el dolor . . . Brittany. Brittany. Brittany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 57 Brittany\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s April first. I haven\u0027t seen Alex in five months, since the day after the shooting. The gossip about Paco and Alex finally died down and the extra psychologists and social workers have left the school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week I told the school social worker I slept more than five hours, but that was a lie. Since the shooting I\u0027ve had trouble sleeping, always waking in the middle of the night because my mind won\u0027t stop analyzing that awful conversation Alex and I had in the hospital. The social worker said it\u0027ll take a long time to let go of my feelings of betrayal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is, I don\u0027t feel betrayed. More like sad and deflated. After all this time, I still go to bed staring at the pictures of him in my cell phone from the night we went to Club Mystique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter being released from the hospital, he quit school and disappeared. He may be out of my life physically, but he\u0027ll always be a part of me. I can\u0027t let go even if I wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne positive thing that came from all of the craziness is that my family took Shelley to Colorado to see Sunny Acres, and my sister really liked it. They have activities every day, play sports, and even have celebrities visit every three months. When Shelley heard they have famous people come visit and do concerts and benefits, if she hadn\u0027t been strapped in she would have fallen out of her wheelchair. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-43.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
