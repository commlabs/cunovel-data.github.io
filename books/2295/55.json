The hammer was drawn back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held Jess in her arms. The girl was in a swoon. She was an awkward weight. In the moment, Kate heard Jess\u0027s beating heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeith helped Fran stand up, get her robe straight and stem the blood pouring from her nose with paper tissues. Kate had another insight. Keith, the callous predator, was more into Fran than she was him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeBoys took the gun away from her head and showed it to her. A revolver. The cylinder was full. Matt silver bulletheads. That ammo would settle her hash, all right. He took aim again. His floppy cuffs were damp, stained with his own bloodsweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t expect help from the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaying anything was likely to annoy DeBoys enough to finish her quickly. He could have Anna bite Jess, then glut himself on the snake woman, so he wouldn\u0027t miss his fix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened. A figure was outlined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Eastman. Not a Black Monk. She was saved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newcomer stepped into the room. Lava light rolled over his face. Not James Eastman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb Croft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last person in the world who\u0027d want to save her. Indeed, someone who\u0027d be only too happy to watch her execution. He\u0027d been cheated of it during the Terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf DeBoys shattered her skull with silver in front of Croft, it would be like putting a ripe red apple on the Professor\u0027s desk. He\u0027d get a first class degree without sitting any exams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate relaxed and let Jess roll out of her arms. The unconscious girl rucked up the carpet and ended up face-down. Her sacrificial dress was backless. She had fluff and grit stuck to her bare skin and white silk-covered rump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat might be the last thing Kate ever saw. A Van Helsing\u0027s bum. She would have words with God\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;if He existed\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;about this turn of events. Perhaps she\u0027d get a better answer from the Other Fellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sir, she\u0027s not worthy,\u0027 DeBoys said. \u0027She won\u0027t kill.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCroft smiled, a matter of a twitch of his dead mouth over jagged fangs. Blue and green blobs of light fought over his face, an eternal yin-yang struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Won\u0027t she indeed?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027She\u0027s not a real vampire, sir.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCroft chuckled, a sound like a shower of razor-blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween the beats of Jessica\u0027s heart, between the ticks of Croft\u0027s expensive wristwatch, Kate stood up, shoulder-slammed DeBoys against the wall, took his gun away, rammed its barrel under his ribs, and shot him, firing upwards, bursting his heart with silver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step away from the wall and turned\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;red speckles grew in a circle a foot across on the back of his cape, as if the lining were leaking through\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;then fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna hissed. Kate pointed the gun at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re not a killer,\u0027 she said, forked tongue darting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m not a murderer,\u0027 Kate explained. \u0027I don\u0027t believe in capital punishment. I\u0027m not a sadist. I don\u0027t enjoy killing, but...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Kate Reed was\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;is\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a terrorist, space kidettes,\u0027 Croft told his remaining students. \u0027If Mr DeBoys had paid attention to my lectures, he\u0027d know that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I haven\u0027t had to kill anyone since...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t need to tell these people that. She had no nostalgia for the Terror or the Irish Civil War.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeBoys looked like he didn\u0027t believe he could die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to kick the smug, dead bastard. He\u0027d made her go against her principles, after all. He had turned her into a killer. With that annoying clarity she hoped would soon wear off, she saw she\u0027d served Croft\u0027s purpose too. The Black Monks\u0027 antics brought on him attention he did not seek. She\u0027d ended that. If anyone was Grand Master of the Black Monks now, he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, she could shoot him and have done with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d come up in the dock just after Donna Rogers. With a few character witnesses and equivocal testimony from the other Black Monks\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;who would, she guessed, feel disillusioned with their masters and mentors about now\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;she might get away with it. Penny, for one, had skated off after worse. And Genevieve. Lord, what other vampires had done...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, annoyingly, it remained. She was not that kind of girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorway behind Croft was crowded. A gunshot always drew attention. Everyone wanted to know what had happened. James Eastman was there, just behind Croft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother unwelcome intuition. She\u0027d mistaken Croft for Eastman in silhouette because they looked alike. It wasn\u0027t common, but some vampires could father children on warm women. Eastman called Croft Big Daddy. And hated him. Kate could only guess what the former Lord Charles Croydon, despoiler of warm wenches, had done to some poor Californian in about 1940. She gave Eastman the gun. How he used it was his decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso in the crowd was Nezumi, one sock rolled down around her ankle, scratches on her face, hockey stick on her shoulder. Neither twin was there. Nezumi blew upwards, shifting her fringe out of her eyes. She flicked a glance at the dead man on the floor and nodded approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate accepted that she had saved herself, and not waited for someone else to do the dirty work. She could live with the guilt. The five or six others she\u0027d killed had all been trying to murder her too. She\u0027d not drunk any of their blood. She would not let being a vampire define her like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, with an audience, she needed to make a gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knelt by DeBoys, stuck her fingers in the ruin of his back, and licked them clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImages and impressions sparked. A big house, riding to hounds, flogging and being flogged, a lot of women, black candles and goat-heads, a beer glass smashing on an old man\u0027s face, pain, pain, blood, blood, blood. and nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Franklyn came at her, spitting venom. Nezumi twisted the handle of her hockey stick and drew a steel short-sword from it. She placed the edge of the blade against the snake-woman vampire\u0027s throat. Anna closed her mouth and shed scales, showing a new, as-yet-unused face. Nezumi nodded, seriously, and Anna stepped away from the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone must have called the police by now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-55.html","bookId":2295,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:16 PM"}
