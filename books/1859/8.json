She\u0027d be disgusted if she knew everything it entailed, not to mention the full coverage robe I was supposed to buy, which means Emily still walks around in tiny towels. Of course, I spend extra time in the shower stroking out my morning wood so that I\u0027m able to have some semblance of decency the rest of the day. Walking around with an Emily induced boner would certainly make our situation uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the topic of dating and relationships hasn\u0027t been broached since January, that doesn\u0027t mean it has gone away. Instead, it\u0027s been the elephant in the room for eight long months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there an anniversary song?\" Emily asks jokingly. \"There\u0027s one for birthdays.\" She starts singing Happy Birthday, replacing \"birthday\" with \"anniversary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help but smile given the joy the woman before me holds for the simplest of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s two years today, Ethan; two years ago you came over and opened my window, two years since you recognized I was alone and in need. Two years ago you opened your home and heart to a perfect stranger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she says heart quieter than the rest, mine skips a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice wavers at the end of her speech, indicating tears are about to follow. I reach out to her, pull her into me, and hold her tightly as she surrenders to the sadness. This is the only touch I\u0027m allowed - the only appropriate embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking in the mirror, I see a man whose extraordinarily proud. While I may not be the mama bird watching her baby bird fly from the nest, there is still pride deep in my chest. Emily graduates today from high school. It\u0027s an accomplishment, which given the circumstances, is astounding. Today is special, and it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever worn a tie, so I check it one last time. My tie isn\u0027t the only surprise I have for Emily today. I purchased my very first car this morning, and I plan to drive Emily to her graduation in a 1998 Toyota Corolla. It belonged to Margie, my boss, but her husband bought her a new one. He sold me the Corolla with 160,000 miles at an unreasonably low price. I\u0027d say he was giving me a bit of charity, but no matter, it\u0027s mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine and Emily\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get-out!\" Emily shouts moments later as she looks at the champagne colored car parked on the street and then back at me. Her mouth is hanging open, unsure of what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on; get in. We have a graduation to get to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother is way hot,\" I hear the blonde say. Emily doesn\u0027t respond, but another high-pitched voice does. \"That\u0027s not her brother, you clueless bitch.\" Emily told me about this once, where females call each other names as terms of endearment, but I don\u0027t get it. If one of the guys at the store called me a bastard or asshole, I\u0027d punch his face, endearment aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gretchen...\" I hear Emily plead. \"Please don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? He\u0027s not - which, of course begs the question, why aren\u0027t you bangin\u0027 his brains out, little Emily Evans?\" Truth be told, I want to know Emily\u0027s response. It\u0027s not like I haven\u0027t thought about it a thousand times, but I\u0027m curious to know if she thinks about it too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to - \" then I hear footsteps rapidly retreating. I decide to make myself known and walk out of the hallway where I\u0027ve been hiding since the conversation seems to be over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Ethan, you just missed Emily.\" The blonde motions down the hall in the direction Emily went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound hits me immediately as I near a classroom with an open door. Thankfully, it\u0027s a sound I haven\u0027t heard for a while, but hearing it now cuts me like a hot knife through cold butter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emily?\" I call to her as I enter the nearly empty room. The desks and chairs are stacked, waiting patiently for another round of students in the fall. Emily looks up, red-faced and glassy-eyed. She regards me for a moment, then bursts into another round of sobs. For a second, I think about how ugly crying is. I think Emily is beautiful, but the way her face contorts... it\u0027s just so unattractive. This crying mess in front of me doesn\u0027t look like Emily at all. Then the few remaining scraps of humanity I think I have left kick in, and those superficial and negative thoughts float away. All I\u0027m seeing now is my Emily in pain - and I want to make it stop. I go to her as fast as my legs can carry me and take her in my arms, holding her close. We\u0027ve only embraced a few times, but for me, it\u0027s special every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter several minutes, Emily has calmed and she raises her head to look at me. Her eyes are clear now, and as she gazes into my eyes, I think about how beautiful she is. It\u0027s all I can do not to place my lips over hers. We\u0027re so close that just a few inches forward would connect us. I want her so much sometimes it\u0027s hurts. But that\u0027s not meant to be, and my sinful thoughts have to remain hidden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ethan, I have to tell you something. Well, ask you something, really. I mean I\u0027m going to tell you something, but then I\u0027m going to - \" I cut her off by placing my hand gently over her mouth. She rambles when she\u0027s nervous, plus my hand will keep me from kissing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deep breath,\" I coach her and myself. After a few relaxing sighs, I encourage her to start again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell me anything, Emily. I\u0027m here for you. You can trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut never in a million years would I expect what she says next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ethan, I love you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacant/page-8.html","bookId":1859,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:16 PM"}
