The rain entangled parasol leaves and gloomy hearts alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth had reached the end of the long outer corridor, but he didn’t walk out. He, too, was reluctant to get wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie walked up and stood behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth knew Liu Changjie was there, but he said nothing. Neither did Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood there quietly at the end of the corridor, watching the rain fall on the parasol trees in. They stood there for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Power of Hu really is cruel.” Dragon Fifth let out a long sigh. “He is not only cruel to others, he is cruel to himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps because he is at the end of his road,” said Liu Changjie indifferently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And because he is at the end of the road, you’re going to let him go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m also a cruel person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No you’re not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed, but it wasn’t a happy laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth looked back at him. “At the least, you will let him maintain his reputation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because his reputation wasn’t stolen. He earned it through suffering and hard work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can see that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have any personal animosity toward him. I don’t want to see his reputation ruined.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you’re not bringing him to justice. You’re not making him return the things he stole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I don’t need to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t need to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is a very intelligent person. I don’t need to make him. He should come to me himself to resolve the issue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so you’re waiting here for him to come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the case is still not closed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth muttered to himself for a moment, then said, “If he’s willing to return the stolen property, willing to solve all the problems himself, then the case will be closed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should know why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth turned his head and gazed at the distant, dark clouds. After a long time he quietly said, “You can’t let Qiu Hengbo go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t.” His face suddenly was filled with a very solemn look. “No one can violate the law, or universal truths. Anyone who breaks the law must be punished.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth looked back and stared at him. “Who are you, really? Why are you investigating this matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie didn’t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You obviously are not who you say you are,” said Dragon Fifth. “But you also don’t want to sell yourself out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Both Power of Hu and I investigated your background, yet neither of us found anything to indicate you were lying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really don’t understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed. “When I encounter something I don’t understand, I use a special method to deal with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What method?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I don’t understand something, I don’t think about it. At least temporarily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And afterwards?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever the secret it is, it will be revealed eventually. You just have to wait patiently, and eventually you will figure it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he couldn’t stop thinking about it, but he could stop asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain fell in sheets, twilight grew deeper and deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight footsteps could be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a hand was visible, carrying a lantern, walking slowly down the gloomy corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lamplight revealed a head of white hair, and the face of Power of Hu’s faithful follower, the old doorman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had long ago mastered the ability to conceal sorrow within his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The two guests have not left yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We haven’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man nodded his head. “Of course the two guests aren’t gone. However, the master is gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s gone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man stared at the curtains of falling rain. “A storm may arise from a clear sky. People have mornings and evenings, disaster and happiness. I never thought that the master’s sickness would flare up again so suddenly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He died of sickness?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man nodded his head. “His rheumatism had long since seeped into his marrow. He’s been a cripple for a long time, and to keep living down to this day hasn’t been easy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was completely expressionless, but within his eyes could be seen a strange expression. It was hard to say if he was grieving for Power of Hu, or begging Liu Changjie not to reveal his master’s secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie looked at him, and finally nodded his head. “Very well. So he died of sickness. I saw long ago that the disease was getting very serious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn expression of gratitude filled his eyes, and he sighed. “Thank you. You really are a good person. The master did not misjudge you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing again, he slowly turned and walked away down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going?” asked Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To announce the master’s death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where will you make the announcement?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At Madam Autumn’s.” The man’s voice was filled with resentment. “If it wasn’t for her, the master’s illness might not have been so bad. Now that the master is gone, I will definitely make sure she knows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie’s eyes shone. “Don’t tell me she will come here to pay her respects?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She will come.” He spoke one word at a time. “She must come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain outside the corridor grew thicker and thicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man walked out of the corridor, and the lantern in his hand was instantly extinguished by the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed he didn’t notice. Carrying the extinguished lantern, he slowly walked off into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight had fallen, enveloping everything in blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his crooked, emaciated frame disappeared into the night, Dragon Fifth let out a sigh. “It seems you were correct. Power of Hu didn’t disappoint.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie also sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But,” Dragon Fifth said, “I still don’t understand why Qiu Hengbo ‘must’ come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re not going to think about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed. “Because I believe that in the end, all secrets will be revealed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and stared at Dragon Fifth. “There’s an expression I think you should never forget.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What expression?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“‘Heaven’s net is wide meshed, nothing escapes it. The way of Heaven is fair, but the guilty will not escape.’” His eyes shone in the darkness. “Whoever commits crimes, they should each and every one forget about escaping justice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDusk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is dusk every day, but every dusk is different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, every person dies, and yet there are many types of death. Some people die bravely and with honor, others die in an ordinary and humble way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu’s death was neither ordinary nor humble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany had come to his mourning hall to pay respects. Some were his disciples and friends, others merely came to because of his reputation. There was one person missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadam Lovesickness had not arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie wasn’t anxious. He hadn’t even asked about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he hadn’t stopped Dragon Fifth from leaving. He’d known all along that Dragon Fifth would leave, the same as he knew Qiu Hengbo would arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth seeing her would only complicate matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiu Hengbo would come, so Dragon Fifth had no choice but to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen seeing Dragon Fifth off, he’d taken him to the end of the corridor and said, “I’ll definitely come looking for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When? When will you come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed. “When it’s time to drink, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth laughed. “I always drink at Heavenly Fragrance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mourning hall had been set up in the spacious, ancient main hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie was nowhere to be seen, only the white-haired old servant, along with effigies of a virgin boy and a virgin girl, keeping vigil over the coffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night was deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEerie lamplight shone onto the exhausted face of the old servant. He himself looked like an effigy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMourning couplets, written on strips of white cloth, were hung all about, and there were piles of paper effigies of houses, horses, ships, and other lucky objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese things had been gathered in preparation to be burned on the nights of “Receiving the Third” and “Accompanying Night.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe effigy of the horse cart was remarkably true to life. It had a man leading the horses, a man driving the cart, even extra helpers, horse tackle and whips. Their livery and their faces were all extremely lifelike. It was unfortunate that Power of Hu couldn’t see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night wind was dull and desolate, the lamplight flickered, and then the shadow of a visitor floated into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor was wearing mourning clothes on top, and underneath, the dark clothes of someone who wishes to remain hidden at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old servant raised his head and glanced at him. The man knelt down, and the old servant knelt alongside. He kowtowed, and the old servant kowtowed with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a famous hero of the martial world like Power of Hu passes away, it’s relatively common for unknown figures of the Jianghu world to come in the dead of night to pay respects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t an unusual thing, and was nothing to be shocked about or to even ask questions about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, this night visitor asked, “Master Hu is really dead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old servant nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But the old man was fine just a few days ago. How could he suddenly pass away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A storm may arise from a clear sky,” said the old servant gloomily. “People have mornings and evenings, disaster and happiness. These matters, no one can predict.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did the old man pass?” It seemed this passing visitor was very interested in Power of Hu’s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He died of sickness. He had a very serious disease.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor let out a long sigh. “I didn’t see the old man for such a long time. I had no idea I would never see him again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sadly, you were just a bit too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would it be possible for me to pay homage to his remains?” It seemed this visitor couldn’t let go of the idea of seeing Power of Hu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” The old servant’s response was very direct. “Others can. You can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor seemed shocked. “Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old servant lowered his head. “Because he didn’t know you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor seemed more shocked. “How do you know that he didn’t know me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I don’t know you,” replied the servant coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you know everyone he knew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old servant nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor also lowered his head. “And if I’m set on seeing him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that you don’t want to see him,” was the cold response. “The person who wants to see him is someone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor frowned. “Do you know who does want to see him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old servant nodded again. With a cold laugh, he said, “I’m only confused about one thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Madam Autum doesn’t think the master is dead, so she wants to see his corpse. Why didn’t she come herself, instead of sending a Five Gates thief like you to harass his spirit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor’s face changed. His hands flipped out to reveal a pair of poison-coated deerskin gloves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old servant refused to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor laughed. “Even if I’m just a Five Gates thief, I can still take your life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed he really was ready to spring to action, but at that exact moment, a cold laugh could be heard. “Shut your mouth and get out of here. Get the hell out!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was mesmerizing, as mesmerizing as if it had emanated from heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA third person could not be seen in the mourning hall, and it was impossible to tell where the voice came from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old servant did not seem shocked at all.
