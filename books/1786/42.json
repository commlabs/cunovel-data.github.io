I wish… I wish I could talk to my mother. I\u0027m not exactly certain how to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course. Amelia liked to manage everything, to be authoritative and competent no matter what she did. But the entire process of childbearing would be one of increasing dependence and helplessness, until the final stage, when nature took over entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam pressed his lips into her gleaming dark hair, which smelled like sweetbriar. He began to rub her back in the way he knew she liked best. \"We\u0027ll find some experienced women for you to talk to. Lady Westcliff, perhaps. You like her, and God knows she would be forthright. And regarding what you\u0027re going to do… you\u0027ll let me take care of you, and spoil you, and give you anything you want.\" He felt her relax a little. \"Amelia, love,\" he murmured, \"I\u0027ve wanted this for so long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you?\" She smiled and snuggled tightly against him. \"So have I. Although I had hoped it would happen at a more convenient time, when Ramsay House was finished, and Poppy was betrothed, and the family was settled-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, with your family there will never be a convenient time.\" Cam eased her back to lie on the bed with him. \"What a pretty little mother you\u0027ll be,\" he whispered, cuddling her. \"With your blue eyes, and your pink cheeks, and your belly all round with my child…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I grow large, I hope you won\u0027t strut and swagger, and point to me as an example of your virility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do that already, monisha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia looked up into his smiling eyes. \"I can\u0027t imagine how this happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t I explain that on our wedding night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckled and put her arms around his neck. \"I was referring to the fact that I\u0027ve been taking preventative measures. All those cups of nasty-tasting tea. And I still ended up conceiving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rom,\" he said by way of explanation, and kissed her passionately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Amelia felt well enough to join the other women for tea in the receiving room, the men went downstairs to the Rutledge\u0027s gentlemen\u0027s room. Although the room was ostensibly for the use of hotel guests, it had become a favorite haunt of the peerage, who wished to share the company of the Rutledge\u0027s many notable foreign visitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ceilings were comfortably dark and low, paneled in glowing rosewood, the floors covered in thick Wilton carpeting. The gentlemen\u0027s room was cornered with large, deep apses that provided private spaces for reading, drinking, and conversing. The main space was furnished with velvet-upholstered chairs and tables laden with cigar boxes and newspapers. Servants moved unobtrusively through the room, bringing snifters of warmed brandy and glasses of port.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSettling in one of the unoccupied octagonal apses, Kev requested brandy for the table. \"Yes, Mr. Merripen,\" the servant said, hastening to comply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What well-trained staff,\" Dr. Harrow remarked. \"I find it commendable that they give impartial service to all the guests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev slanted him a questioning glance. \"Why wouldn\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I imagine that a gentleman of your origins does not receive service at every establishment you frequent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I find that most establishments pay more attention to the quality of a man\u0027s clothes than the shade of his complexion,\" Kev replied evenly. \"Usually it doesn\u0027t matter that I\u0027m a Rom, so long as I can afford their wares.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Harrow looked uncomfortable. \"My apologies. I\u0027m not usually so tactless, Merripen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev gave him a short nod to indicate that no offense had been taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarrow turned to Cam, seeking to change the subject. \"I hope you\u0027ll allow me to recommend a colleague to attend Mrs. Rohan during the remainder of your stay in London. I\u0027m acquainted with many excellent physicians here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would appreciate that,\" Cam said, accepting a brandy from a servant. \"Although I suspect we won\u0027t remain in London much longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Winnifred seems to have a great fondness for children,\" Harrow mused. \"In light of her condition, it\u0027s fortunate that she will have nieces and nephews to dote on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other three men looked at him sharply. Cam had paused in the act of lifting the brandy to his lips. \"Condition?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her inability to have children of her own,\" Harrow clarified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the devil do you mean, Harrow?\" Leo asked. \"Haven\u0027t we all been trumpeting about my sister\u0027s miraculous recovery, due to your stellar efforts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has indeed recovered, my lord.\" Harrow frowned thoughtfully as he stared into his brandy snifter. \"But she will always be somewhat fragile. In my opinion, she should never try to conceive. In all likelihood the process would result in her death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heavy silence followed this pronouncement. Even Leo, who usually affected an air of insouciance, couldn\u0027t manage to conceal his reaction. \"Have you made my sister aware of this?\" he asked. \"Because she has given me the impression that she fully expects to marry and have her own family someday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have discussed it with her, of course,\" Harrow replied. \"I have told her that if she marries, her husband would have to agree that it would be a childless union.\" He paused. \"However, Miss Hathaway is not yet ready to accept the idea. In time, I hope to persuade her to adjust her expectations.\" He smiled slightly. \"Motherhood, after all, is not necessary for every woman\u0027s happiness, much as society glorifies the notion.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-42.html","bookId":1786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM"}
