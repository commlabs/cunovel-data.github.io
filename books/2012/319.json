Otataral? You unsheathed Otataral? Oh, you fool . And these, her last thoughts, bubbled with a kind of dark pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enemy broken, routed, Warleader Mathok rode up to Paran’s position near the westernmost rise, and reined in. ‘High Fist! The last have fled east, down into the valley. Shall we pursue?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ Paran replied, watching as Quick Ben and Kalam approached from across the killing field. ‘Mathok, begin gathering up forage for your horses. Send parties deeper into the valley if needed – but for resupply only, no chasing down. I fear we shall have to ride hard now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘South, Mathok. South.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Warleader wheeled his mount round, yelling commands at his second, T’morol, who waited a short distance back with a wing of cavalry, and then rode off in the direction of his main force. Mathok’s raiders had been eager, and they had acquitted themselves well. Watching the Warleader ride away, Paran rubbed at the back of his neck. ‘No wonder you winced at every move, Dujek,’ he said under his breath. ‘I’m a mass of knotted ropes.’ Still, the enemy broke at first contact, and what could have been a nasty scrap turned into a slaughter. A mere handful of casualties, and most of those from idiots falling on weapons in their haste to pursue . Ensorcelled voices were all very well, but if that was where all the discipline and courage came from … now, we can see the flaw in that, can’t we?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘High Fist,’ said Quick Ben, walking up like a man who’d taken a beating. His face was drawn, his eyes skittish with something that might be pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParan nodded. ‘High Mage. Was it as bad as it looks?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not really. Just out of practice. Lost touch with being subtle, I think.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA curious thing to say, Paran reflected, and then he faced Kalam. The assassin’s weapons were sheathed, and he looked rather pleased with himself. For no reason he cared to discover, Paran found he wanted to take that smugness down a notch or two. You’ve been killing people, after all . He regarded him for a moment longer before saying, ‘Your wife wishes your attention.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man scowled. ‘Now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was easy . ‘Since you’re covered in blood, Corporal, you might want to wash first.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben snorted. ‘I’d forgotten, Kalam. You’re a lowly corporal – meaning I can order you around.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just try it, you Hood-bitten snake.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the assassin had left them, the High Mage turned to Paran. Hesitated, and then said, ‘Felt something, far to the southwest …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As did I, Quick Ben.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat skittish look returned. ‘Do you know what it was?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Mage sighed. ‘Back to that, then, is it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParan cocked his head. ‘When I asked Shadowthrone for Kalam, I admit that I didn’t expect you to be the delivery man. My last sense of you was in the company of my sister’s army, keeping your head down.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben nodded, looking thoughtful. ‘You were able to sniff out things like that? I’m impressed, Ganoes Paran. You have come a long way from the nervous, gut-sick captain I remember from Black Coral.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m still gut-sick, High Mage,’ he said. ‘And as for sensing distant powers, alas, that’s been growing ever more uncertain. And obviously, since coming within the influence of the Assail warren I have been effectively blind. But with my sister, it was never easy in the best of circumstances—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Her sword.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Her sword, yes. And … other things.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben’s nod was sympathetic. ‘Sisters, aye.’ Then his gaze sharpened. ‘That … manifestation we felt. Do you think … was it her?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParan frowned. Just the mention of his stomach had delivered a nip of pain, and then vague nausea, reluctant to fade. And look at us, still stepping round each other. Forget all that, Paran. Be honest, see what happens . ‘I don’t know, High Mage. But I mean to find out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben studied the mass of soldiers moving through the enemy supplies, and then he rubbed at his eyes. ‘Ganoes Paran, what are we? Here, what are we?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParan felt his face twisting as anxiety gnawed again at his stomach. ‘Quick Ben, we’re soldiers of the Emperor. It’s all we ever have been.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben shot him a look. ‘You were just a child when he ruled.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-319.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
