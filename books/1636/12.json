The team froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive meters ahead, a fern bent and sprang back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh rapidly blinked his green status light: the signal to open fire. This was the best target they\u0027d had all morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppressed gunfire surrounded him. The fern exploded into a shower of confetti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single Spartan hidden by the fern turned, their SPI armor flashing silver from the staccato of stun rounds that peppered its surface. Their foot caught on a root and they tumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh repeated the go-ahead signal, and his squad made sure the target stayed down with several bursts of well-placed rounds. The ballistic gel underlayer of their armor could take a heck of a pounding before breaking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter three seconds, he flashed red, and they ceased fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia moved up and slapped a lime-green sticky flag on the still-writhing Spartan\u0027s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe target was now officially \"dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh activated a NAV marker and alerted C and C for pickup of the \"corpse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground trembled, just for a moment, but all the Spartans in Team Saber froze, and then scanned the jungle, looking for the source of the disturbance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarthquake? Not likely. There was no tectonic activity on Onyx. That left only two possibilities: impact or detonation. Neither was especially welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh motioned for Saber to move out. They slinked through the jungle and emerged on a plain. Here small limestone granite and quartz mesas, grottos, and fissures extended to the north— up to and beyond the high fence of Zone 67.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zone was where the \"ghost\" of Onyx was supposed to be. It\u0027d been spotted once or twice according to other Spartan candidates: a single eye in the dark. They just made up that stuff to scare plebes. Ash had, however, heard of a Beta Company squad that had vanished near here and never been found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around warily and spotted a naturally eroded tunnel that extended through a hill. Ash pointed and Team Saber settled inside to assess the tactical situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh pulled off his helmet, and wiped the blood from his nose and hair. \"Too close,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still, we got one,\" Holly said, pulling off her own golden mirrored helmet, \"and we didn\u0027t lose one of ours… although you sure gave it a good try.\" She scratched the fuzz on her head, which she had buzz-cut into a series of bear-claw scratch patterns. The length was a-okay by the regs, but some of the other teams teased her about it. Holly got a little wild about the teasing, and she had been demoted twice for fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante removed his helmet and felt his scarred face for any damage. Satisfied, he retrieved two black flash-bang grenades from his pack. \"Found these, just before yours went off. Caught the trip wires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh nodded. He should have reprimanded Dante for sticking his hands near a set of primed grenades. Then again, Dante had near-magical abilities when it came to explosives. He always knew when they were about to go, and when they wouldn\u0027t. That or he was the luckiest person he\u0027d ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia kept her SPI helmet on. She slipped out of the cave, taking up a guard position outside. Ash wasn\u0027t worried. She was the best sneak in Gamma Company. They called her \"O\" for short because she was as whisper-quiet as her vowel namesake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh turned to Mark. \"Head check,\" he said, and patted his friend on the back of his helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark pulled the helmet off, and Ash saw a nasty bruise on his cheek. Mark ran his hands over his shaved head and worried the edges of that bruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" Mark said. He smoothed the inner lining of his armor, making sure it was perfect, and then slipped the helmet back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey called Mark \"The Mark,\" because he was their best marksman—good with a sniper rifle, but better with a rifle on full auto in all-out target-rich free-for-all. The more pressure on him, the cooler he got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh spotted bands of rough onyx along the tunnel wall, black and white and streaked with flecks of gold. He ran a gloved finger over the patterns, intrigued by the geological oddity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then snapped out of it and focused on the here and now. He slipped his helmet back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Audio check,\" Ash whispered over TEAMCOM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreen status lights winked back. Good. No one was deaf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dull thump echoed off the distant mesa walls, and dust rained down from the cave ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeam Saber instinctively dropped to a crouch. Ash pulled his sidearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big one,\" Dante muttered. \"Artillery? One of the new four-forties?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think the Lieutenant Commander would use artillery on us,\" Ash whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not normally,\" Holly replied. \"But this is the last test. Maybe he\u0027s pulling out all the stops to figure out who\u0027ll get top honors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTop honors. Ash had pushed Team Saber to stay on top for the last three years: honing their specialties; learning every lesson Endless Summer threw at them; and thinking, moving, and acting together as a single razor-edged weapon. Only two other teams were even close in the rankings. Gladius and Katana. Top honors would mean bragging rights and respect. It would mean they were the best. That they\u0027d won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver TEAMCOM, Ash said, \"O, you get a direction on that blast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia\u0027s status light winked red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Ash said, \"we\u0027ll assume it\u0027s artillery for now. I can\u0027t believe the Lieutenant Commander would be using it… but Mendez is another story. You hear incoming, scatter, and take cover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour green LEDs lit on his heads-up display, acknowledging the order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh had read somewhere that you never heard the artillery shell that killed you. He had no desire to personally test that battlefield legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the plan for Katana and Gladius?\" Mark asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katana\u0027s down one,\" Ash replied. \"We\u0027ll focus on the weaker of the two. We\u0027ll find—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thump and the ground shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Closer,\" Olivia whispered over TEAMCOM. \"Vector north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh stepped out of the tunnel and took cover by a large boulder. The others followed and their SPI armor blended into the rocky terrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this was another trap, then they were probably stepping out right into a sniper\u0027s line of fire. But Ash didn\u0027t think so. No one would use ordnance that big so close, not even Mendez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn explosion like that wasn\u0027t something you could throw together from rocks and branches and a couple of flash-bang grenades, either… so that eliminated Teams Katana and Gladius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo who was doing it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty meters to the north v/as the triple fence surrounding Zone 67. Electrified razor wire, motion sensors, and lanes of minefields made an effective barrier. If pressed, Team Saber could have gotten around it—but they wouldn\u0027t. The LC\u0027s orders had been crystal clear: DO NOT CROSS. It would count as an instant disqualification for top honors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about the other teams? Just a quick hop over and lateral move to flank him? No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them would risk a disqualification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a dust storm about three kilometers into Zone 67, a wall of sand, swirling smoke… and fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA distant mesa exploded—vaporized into a mushroom of glittering quartz dust, a hail of boulders, and roiling flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh instinctively ducked, and his insides clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d seen big explosions before. Nothing like that, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two kilometers,\" Dante said. \"Felt that one in my bones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched the stones rain from the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few Archer missiles maybe…\" Mark murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDots swirled about the edge of the expanding cloud of dust. If Ash didn\u0027t know better he\u0027d have sworn they were vultures. But Onyx didn\u0027t have raptorlike avian species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh zoomed magnification on his faceplate. At five-times he saw the dots had a three- fold symmetry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unslung his sniper rifle and sited through the scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were drones of some sort. But not UNSC MAKOS. Not Covenant Banshees fliers, either. They were a few meters long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree dull steel booms that surrounded a centra! eye, glowing like molten iron. No obvious jets. No cockpit. There were a dozen of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has to be an experimental prototype,\" Dante said. Maybe Zone 67 is a testing range for new weapons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wouldn\u0027t be \u0027testing\u0027 a megaton worth of destructive force while we were so close,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr was this part of the final test? Some new threat that the three squads would have to band together to defeat? That would be Chief Mendez\u0027s style: change the rules in the middle of a test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drones moved away from the atomized mesa, drifted closer to Team Saber\u0027s location, stopping short just on the opposite side of the Zone 67 fence, where they circled another butte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh spied motion atop that formation. Shutters from a a camouflaged bunker popped open, and heavy machine-gun fire strafed the drones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lead drone\u0027s three booms snapped forward to make a triangular flat plane. A glimmering film of gold popped into place and fifty-caliber rounds impacted and bounced off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Energy shields!\" Dante said. \"Has to be Covenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh reluctantly agreed with this assessment. This was no game, no final honors test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe war had arrived on Onyx.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broadcast over an open COM channel: \"Currahee C and C, come in. This is Saber One. We have an emergency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer. His radio light was green. He was broadcasting, but no one was listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Radio check,\" Ash said to his team. \"Everyone try to get the Lieutenant Commander or the Chief. Try to raise the Agincourt, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh used his sniper rifle and tracked the drones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remaining eleven lined up behind the one distorted to form an energy shield; their red eyes aligned and pointed directly at the mesa top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen emerged from the bunker with M19 missile launchers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drones\u0027 eyes flared to a brilliant gold—energy projected forward, flicking like a rapier strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men and bunker wavered a moment, erupted into flames, and vaporized. The mesa top then detonated into a cloud of dust and molten rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground tilted and cracked. Team Saber retreated into the tunnel and debris rained over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh squinted back through the haze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drones had scattered and moved forward, zigzagging over the rocky terrain: a search pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved to the opposite end of the tunnel and risked another open COM broadcast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Team Katana, Team Gladius, Covenant activity in Zone 67. Forget the test, guys. We\u0027ve got a situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0700 HOURS, OCTOBER 31, 2552 (MILITARY CALENDAR) \\ ZETA DORADUS SYSTEM, NEAR CAMP CURRAHEE, PLANET ONYX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt scanned the horizon with his binoculars. He watched the pattern of the wind in the tree line, the birds that had taken wing, and a whisper of smoke that snaked up from the canopy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was trouble in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his perch in the \"tree house\" he couldn\u0027t see the source of the disturbance near the Spartan test area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tree house was a platform a hundred meters off the jungle floor in the titan arms of a banyan tree. The only electronics here were the radio and the AI projection unit. Everything else was low-tech: optic binoculars and telescopes, parabolic sound collection dishes, good old-fashioned signal flags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the Agincourt got?\" he asked Mendez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Mendez turned to Kurt, pressing the bud receiver into his ear. \"A lot of static.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncountering broadband interference. They\u0027re moving to high orbit to get a clear picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Agincourt had just delivered supplies for the incoming Delta Company. Kurt had asked for a little observational assistance before they broke orbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pass my thanks to the Commander,\" Kurt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Mendez\u0027s face darkened. \"They\u0027re breaking up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dish-sized AI projector sparked to life, and warm red sunlight sparked and filled the tree house. It solidified into a tall Cherokee brave, bare-chested, wearing buckskins, feathered spear in his massive hand. This was Endless Summer, the ONI AI stationed at the ultrahigh-secure facility thirty kilometers to the north, a place that technically no longer existed, it was so secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AI gestured for Kurt and then he vanished, replaced by the lightning-bolt symbol for a UNSC priority flash communique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AI that had replaced Deep Winter was aloof, had barely tolerated Kurt and his staff, and it never initiated communication. This was trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt stepped closer and the pad scanned his biometrics.
