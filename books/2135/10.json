It was perfect for viewing the Vegas skyline from...or leaping from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t try this at home, kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hot desert wind buffeted my naked body. My longish hair snapped behind me horizontally. Standing naked on a balcony\u0027s edge was liberating. Despite being perpetually cold and despite the hot desert wind, I shivered slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, the wind was blowing where, as they say, the sun don\u0027t shine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at the city. An image of the young boxer collapsing in the ring came to me as I stood there. No surprise. This was the city where he\u0027d died, where his autopsy had been conducted, and where I was beginning to suspect he had possibly been killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd not by Russell Baker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether or not Caesar Marquez\u0027s death was an accident - or something else - remained to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t need a psychic hit to know that something screwy was going on here. Something wasn\u0027t right. What exactly, I didn\u0027t know. Maybe I would never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head back and spread my arms and deeply inhaled the heated desert air - air that was suffused with something that smelled suspiciously like all-you-can-eat $1.99 BBQ ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood like that for some time, and the longer I did so, the more I was certain of one thing: I was becoming less and less human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd more and more something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew this because no human stood on the ledge of their hotel balcony, with arms spread, head tilted back, naked as the day they were born, reveling in their freedom, knowing that an even greater freedom was about to come. A freedom from gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stood there, the wind whipping my hair into a frenzy, I wasn\u0027t thinking of my kids or Kingsley or Fang or anyone. In fact, I wasn\u0027t thinking at all. I was only feeling, only sensing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind, the heat, the smells, the sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt elemental. Animalistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t feel like a mother or a friend or a lover. I didn\u0027t feel human. I felt, instead, deeply connected to the Earth, a part of the Earth, a part of its elements, its raw material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head forward, knowing that I had to either jump or go back inside. Sooner or later, the cops would be beating down my door. A naked woman on a balcony\u0027s ledge was bound to draw some attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I sure as hell wasn\u0027t going back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flame appeared in my thoughts. A single, unwavering flame, and within the flame was a creature that should have looked hideous to me, but didn\u0027t. It was a creature I felt an extreme fondness for. A love for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, after all, me. In a different shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA very different shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered my arms and looked down. There was nothing to hinder my drop. No buttresses or projecting balconies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a straight drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I did just that, tilting forward away from the ledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropping. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-10.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
