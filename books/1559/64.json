Then a strange look crossed his features and he pointed off behind the man in black. “What in the world can that be?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in black turned around and looked. “I don’t see anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, well, I could have sworn I saw something, no matter.” The Sicilian began to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t understand what’s so funny,” said the man in black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell you in a minute,” said the hunchback. “But first let’s drink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he picked up his own wine goblet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in black picked up the one in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guessed wrong,” said the man in black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You only think I guessed wrong,” said the Sicilian, his laughter ringing louder. “That’s what’s so funny. I switched glasses when your back was turned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing for the man in black to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fool!” cried the hunchback. “You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is ‘Never get involved in a land war in Asia,’ but only slightly less well known is this: ‘Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quite cheery until the iocane powder took effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in black stepped quickly over the corpse, then roughly ripped the blindfold from the Princess’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard everything that happ—” Buttercup began, and then she said “Oh” because she had never been next to a dead man before. “You killed him,” she whispered finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I let him die laughing,” said the man in black. “Pray I do as much for you.” He lifted her, slashed her bonds away, put her on her feet, started to pull her along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” Buttercup said. “Give me a moment to gather myself.” The man in black released his grip. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-64.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
