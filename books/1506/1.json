His name was Artpe Hirtana Kelduke.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHis name was spread across the human world as being one of the Four Heavenly Kings.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf one mentioned the Four Heavenly Kings of the Demon King\u0027s army, the humans would think about the monsters that could cause mountains to fall. They were seen as beings that could cause earthquakes and the seas to dry. However, Artpe was different.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe was someone who had been recognized by the Demon King through polishing his strange ability. He was granted the prestigious title of being one of the Four Heavenly Kings thanks to his strange ability\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, he was weak.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe would make an entrance with an awesome aura wrapped around him, but in the end, he would die by the hands of the hero\u0027s party. Then a being with a more awesome aura would show up and say, \u0027Hoo hoo hoo. In truth, he was the weakest of the Four Heavenly Kings!\u0027 In this story, he was cast as being the weakest of the Four Heavenly Kings.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“The hero is really coming, commander. Don\u0027t we have to run away before that happens?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs expected of the subordinates under the weakest of the Four Heavenly Kings, all the demons under his direct command were lacking in firepower. On top of it all, their temperament was lacking too.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“If you want to run away, you should try running away.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I\u0027m sorry!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHis subordinate was thinking about running away even before the fight. He hit his subordinate in the back of the head and climbed to the top of the Demon King\u0027s castle. When he did, he could clearly see the hero\u0027s party coming through a doghole created to bypass the castle wall. It seemed this was their attempt at secretly infiltrating the castle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhenever a Demon King was born to conquer the world, a hero always appeared to put a spoke in the wheel. The hero was the Demon King army\u0027s ultimate enemy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“She really is here. The Demon King is on borrowed time now.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe hero had appeared around three years ago, yet she was already here. Who would have expected this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eArtpe couldn\u0027t smack himself in the back of the head for having such a thought.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eStill, he was a bit relieved. She was here much earlier than expected, there was no way the hero would be able to win against the Demon king.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“The problem is that my troops will be the first to face them.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMaybe a Demon King\u0027s mind was reshaped when the successor put on the crown. The crazy Demon King had a terrible personality and he always sent the weakest amongst the Demon race to fight the hero first.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis strong-willed hero was able to rapidly grow for the past 3 years because the weakest demons were sent first, then the degree of difficulty was slowly increased as the troops failed. If the Demon King wasn\u0027t a lord, Artpe would have smacked him in the back of the head.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCurrently, Artpe was moving, and the reason behind his action was obvious. The weakest force in the Demon King\u0027s castle was his force, and he was their commander. No one from the Demon King\u0027s castle would lift a finger until every single one of them was killed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eArtpe decided to look at the bright side. He was one of the Four Heavenly Kings, would he really be killed by a new hero? The last time he checked on her level was about an year ago, and the hero had been level 200. She might have grown a little bit, but she wouldn\u0027t even be able to scratch the Demon King\u0027s castle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Let\u0027s check her out first.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis was the ability that allowed Artpe to reach his command post. He activated the \u0027Read All Creation\u0027. It was as the words implied, it was an ability that allowed him to find out information about anything that existed in this world. This innate ability was one of the reason why the Demon King kept Artpe by his side.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe had trained his ability through the years, so he was able to successfully activate it from a long distance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSeveral lines appeared in front of his eyes, written in the language of the Demon Clan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e[Name - Maetel]\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e[Race : Human Female]\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e[Title : Hero]\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eArtpe was at a loss for words.

However, in the end, he was still one of the Four Heavenly Kings. He was level 350, and he had considerable amount of skills. However, this was also why he knew what the disparity between him and the hero meant.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEven a single level difference meant that one\u0027s soul was outclassed, it was impossible to beat the other unless one had a really good Skill.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat would happen if there was a difference of 24 levels?

He wanted to crawl through the doghole made by the hero. How great would it be if he could run away to a place where a being from the Demon race wouldn\u0027t be recognized? He wanted to go to a peaceful place where fighting and war didn\u0027t exist. How great would it be if he could just live peacefully while raising some cows!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Koo-ooh-ooh.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen he had that thought, a red choker appeared on his smooth neck, ruthlessly tightening.

Once his innate ability took hold, it was impossible to escape from it. One had to follow all of his orders, and if one held thoughts that ran contrary to his orders, their neck would be choked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen that happened, death was the final outcome. One had to turn back into a docile sheep to follow his order, or they could just choose to die. Artpe had to select one of the two choices right now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe wanted to live a little bit more, so he chose the former option.

On such occasions, Artpe struggled to live by not resisting against the orders of the Demon King. This was why he was able to stay alive until now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe had experienced scenes of violence until he was fed up with it, he wouldn\u0027t be broken by a mere hero.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, it was also clear that he would lose for sure if events continued along down this path. Artpe thought hard on how he would be able to survive this. In the end, he chose the last resort. He hadn\u0027t wanted to choose this option.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Please go contact Etna-nim.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShe was the only woman amongst the Four Heavenly Kings, the leader of the Army of Thieves.

Even among the Demon race, who was famous for being ill tempered, she clearly possessed a pure nature, which was why she was popular amongst her subordinates. A woman of such caliber liked him, this was a big blessing for him even if she wasn\u0027t his type.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo why did Artpe turn down her proposal until now? The man who was ranked 1st amongst the Four Heavenly Kings was in love with Etna. Artpe didn\u0027t want to make an enemy of this man, so he had turned down her offer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, he couldn\u0027t worry about making a future enemy right now.
