THE PROPOSAL OF ARABELLA.","content":"\u0026nbsp;\"Johanna,\" said Arabella Wilmot, as they passed out of the Temple by the old gate at Whitefriars, \"Johanna, if there had been no Mark Ingestrie in the world, could you not have loved some one else truly?\" \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, no—oh, no.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not such a one as Colonel Jeffery?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, Arabella, I respect and admire Colonel Jeffery. He comes fully up to all my notions of what a gentleman should be, but I cannot love him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Arabella sighed. The two young girls passed Todd\u0027s shop upon the other side of the way, and Johanna shuddered as she did so, and repeated in a low voice—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He went there, but he never left.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nay, but you should remember that was Thornhill.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Thornhill, alias Ingestrie.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will cling to that idea.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I cannot help it, Arabella. Oh, that I could solve the dreadful doubt. You speak to me of finding consolation and hope from the possibility that this Thornhill might not have been Ingestrie; but I feel, Arabella, that the agony of that constant doubt, and the pangs of never ending thought and speculation upon that subject will drive me mad. I cannot endure them—I must be resolved one way or the other. It is suspense that will kill me. I might in the course of time reconcile myself to the fact that poor Mark had gone before me to that world where we shall assuredly meet again; but the doubt as to his fate is—is indeed madness!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a manner about Johanna, as she pronounced these words, that was quite alarming to Arabella. Perhaps it was this alarm which went a long way towards inducing her, Arabella, to say what she now said to Johanna—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you forgotten your idea of going disguised to Todd\u0027s, Johanna? And have you forgotten what Mr. Ben, your friend from the Tower, told you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What? Oh, what, Arabella—what did he tell me that I should remember?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why that Todd had placed a placard in his window, stating that he wanted a boy in his shop. Oh, Johanna, it would be so romantic; and to be sure, I have read of such things. Do you think you would have courage sufficient to dress yourself again in my cousin\u0027s clothes, and go to Todd\u0027s shop?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, yes—I understand you—and apply for the vacant situation.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Johanna; it might, you know, afford you an opportunity of searching the place, and then, if you found nothing which could assure you of the presence at one time there of Mark Ingestrie, you would come away with a heart more at ease.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should—I should. He could but kill me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who? who?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sweeney Todd.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, no—no, Johanna, your stay would not exceed a few short hours.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, what long hours they would be.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Johanna, I almost dread the counsel I am giving to you. It is fraught probably with a thousand mischiefs and dangers, that neither you nor I have sufficient experience to see; and now that I have said what I have, I beg of you to think no further of it, and from my heart I wish it all unsaid.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, Arabella, why should you wish it unsaid? It is true that the course you suggest to me is out of the ordinary way, and most romantic, but, then, are not all the circumstances connected with this sad affair far out of the ordinary course?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, yes—and yet—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Arabella, I will do it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, Johanna, Johanna—if any harm should come to you—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then absolve yourself, Arabella, from all reproach upon the subject. Remember always that I go upon my own responsibility, and against your wishes, feelings, and advice. All that I now ask of you is that you will once more lend me that disguise, and assist me in further making myself look like that I would represent myself, and I shall then, perhaps, ask no more of your friendship in this world.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Arabella was horrified. The plan she had proposed had, from her course of romantic reading, such charms for her imagination, that she could not have forborne mentioning it, but, now that in earnest Johanna talked of carrying it out, she became terrified at what might be the consequences. In the open streets she was afraid of making a scene by any further opposition to Johanna, whose feelings, she saw, were in a great state of excitement; but she hoped that she would be able yet to dissuade her from her purpose when she got her home.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Say no more now of it, Johanna, and come home with me, when we will talk it over more at large.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am resolved,\" said Johanna. \"The very resolution to do something bold and definite has given me already a world of ease. I am different quite in feeling to what I was. I am sure that God is, even now, giving me strength and calmness to do this much for him who would have risked anything for me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To reason with any one impressed with such notions would have been folly indeed, and Arabella forbore doing so at that juncture. She could not but be amazed, however, at the firmness of manner of Johanna now, in comparison with the frantic burst of grief which she had so recently been indulging in. Her step was firm, her lips were compressed, and her countenance, although more than usually pale, was expressive in every feature of highly-wrought determination.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She will do it or die,\" thought Arabella, \"and if anything happens to her, I shall wish myself dead likewise.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In this state of feeling—not a very amiable one—the two young girls reached the abode of Arabella Wilmot. The strongly marked feeling of composure and determination by no means left Johanna, but, if anything, seemed to be rather upon the increase, while occasionally she would mutter to herself—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes—yes; I will know all—I will know the worst.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When they were alone in the little chamber of Arabella—that little chamber which had witnessed so many of the mutual confidences of those two young girls—Arabella at once began to say something that might provoke a discussion about the propriety of the hazardous expedition to Todd\u0027s, but Johanna stopped her by saying as she laid her hands gently upon her arm—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Arabella, will you do me two favours?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A hundred; but—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nay, hear me out, dear friend, before you say another word. The first of those favours is, that you will not, by word or look, try to dissuade me from my purpose of going in disguise to Todd\u0027s. The second is, that you will keep my secret when I do go.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh! Johanna! Johanna!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Promise me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. I do—I do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am satisfied. And now, my own dear Arabella, let me tell you that I do not think that there is any such danger as you suppose in the expedition. In the first place, I do not think Todd will easily discover me to be aught else than what I pretend to be, and if I should see that I am in any danger, Fleet Street, with all its living population, is close at hand, and such a cry for aid as I, being, as I am, forearmed by being forewarned, could raise, would soon bring me many defenders.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Arabella sobbed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And then, after all, I only want to stay until, by one absence of Todd\u0027s from the house, I shall be able to make a search for some memorial of the visit of Mark Ingestrie there. If I find it not, I return to you at once better satisfied, and with better hopes than I went forth. If I do find it, I will call upon the tardy law for justice.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Johanna—Johanna, you are not the same creature that you were!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I know it. I am changed. I feel that I am.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Arabella looked at the sweet childish beauty of the face before her, and her eyes filled with tears again at the thought that something near akin to despair had implanted upon it that look of unnatural calmness and determination it wore.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You doubt me?\" said Johanna.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh! no—no. I feel now that you will do it, and feeling that, I likewise feel that I ought not to drive you to seek assistance from another, in your enterprise. But something must be arranged between us.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In what respect?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Such as, if I should not hear of you within a certain time, I—I—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You would feel bound to find me some help. Be it so, Arabella. If I do not come to you or send to you, before the midnight of to-morrow, do what you will, and I shall not think that you have committed any breach of faith.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am content, Johanna, to abide by those conditions; and now I will say nothing to you to bend you from your purpose, but I will pray to Heaven that you may become successful, not in finding any record of Mark Ingestrie, but in procuring peace to your mind by the utter absence of such record.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will go now.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No—no, Johanna. Bethink you what pain your unexplained absence would give to your father. Something must be said or done to make him feel at ease during the, perhaps, many hours that you will be absent.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is well thought of, Arabella. Oh! how selfish we become when overwhelmed by our own strange emotions! I had forgotten that I had a father.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was now agreed between the two young girls that Johanna should go home, and that Arabella Wilmot should call for her, and ask Mr. Oakley\u0027s permission for her (Johanna) to come to her upon a visit for two days. It was no very unusual thing for Johanna to pass a night with her friend, so that it was thought such a course now would have the effect of quieting all anxiety on account of the absence of the young girl from her parental home.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89618.html","bookId":510,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:23:56 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:23:56 AM"}
