No one else even lookedtoward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe how well I\u0027m taking this, Maggiethought. Something\u0027s wrong with me. I\u0027m not hysterical at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind had gotten hold of the idea quiteclearly, but there was no reaction in her body, no terrible feeling in her stomach. An instant later itswept over her, exactly what she\u0027d been afraid of. A wash of adrenaline that made her skin tinglepainfully and a horrible sensation of falling in her stomach. A numbness that started in her cheeksand spread to her lips and jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, please, she thought stupidly. Please let it notbe true. Maybe he\u0027s just hurt.That would be allright. He had an accident and he\u0027s hurt-but notdead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if he were hurt her mother wouldn\u0027t bestanding there screaming. She would be on her way to the hospital, and nobody could stop her. So thatdidn\u0027t work, and Maggie\u0027s mind, darting and wheel ing like a frightened little animal, had to go back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto Please don\u0027t let this be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely, at that moment, it seemed as if theremight be some way to make it not true. If sheturned around and sneaked back to her bedroombefore anyone saw her; if she got into bed and pulled the blankets over her head and shut hereyes...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t leave her mother screaming like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then the screams died down a little. Her father was speaking in a voice that didn\u0027t sound at all like his voice. It was a sort of choked whisper.\"But why didn\u0027t you tell us you were going climbing? If you left on Halloween then it\u0027s been sixdays. We didn\u0027t even know our son was missing....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\" Sylvia was whispering, too. \"Wedidn\u0027t expect to be gone long. Miles\u0027s roommatesknew we were going, but nobody else. It was justa spur-of-themoment thingwe didn\u0027t have classeson Halloween and the weather was so nice andMiles said, hey, let\u0027s go out to Chimney Rock. And we justwent....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, let\u0027s go.He used to say that kind of thing to me, Maggie thought with a strange, dazed twinge.But not since he met Sylvia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male sheriff was looking at Maggie\u0027s father.\"You weren\u0027t surprised that you hadn\u0027t heard from your son since last Friday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He\u0027s gotten so independent since he movedout to go to college. One of his roommates calledthis afternoon to ask if Miles was here-but hedidn\u0027t say that Miles had been gone for almost aweek. I just thought he\u0027d missed a class orsomething....\" Maggie\u0027s father\u0027s voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheriff nodded. \"Apparently his roommatesthought he\u0027d taken a little unauthorized vacation,\"he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They got worried enough to call us tonight-but by then a ranger had already pickedup Sylvia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSylvia was crying. She was tall but willowy, fragile looking. Delicate. She had shimmering hair sopale it was almost silvery and clear eyes the exactcolor of wood violets. Maggie, who was short andround faced, with fox-colored hair and brown eyes,had always envied her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not now. Nobody could look at Sylvia nowwithout feeling pity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happened that first evening. We started up,but then the weather started turning bad and weturned around. We were moving pretty fast.\" Sylviastopped and pressed a fist against her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s kind of a risky time of year for climbing,\" the female sheriff began gently, but Sylvia shookher head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was right, Maggie thought. It wasn\u0027t thatbad. Sure, it rained here most of the fall, but sometimes what the weather people called a high pressure cell settled in and the skies stayed blue for amonth. All hikers knew that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, Miles washt scared of weather. He wasonly eighteen but he\u0027d done lots of hard climbs in Washington\u0027s Olympic and Cascade ranges. He\u0027dkeep climbing all winter, getting alpine experience in snow and storms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSylvia was going on, her voice getting more jerkybreathless. \"Miles was...he\u0027d had the flu aweek before and he wasn\u0027t completely over it. Buthe seemed okay, strong. It happened when we were rappelling down. He was laughing and joking andeverything.... I never thought he might be tired enough to makea mistake....\" Her voice wavered turned into a ragged sob and the ranger puthis arm around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething inside Maggie froze. Amistake?Miles?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was prepared to hear aboutasudden avalanche or a piece of equipment failing. Even Sylviafalling and knocking Miles off. But Miles makinga mistake?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie stared at Sylvia, and suddenly somethingin the pitiful figure bothered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something odd about that delicatelyflushed face and those tear-drenched violet eyes. Itwas all too perfect, too tragic, as if Sylvia werean Academy award-winning actress doing a famousscene-and enjoying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know howit happened,\" Sylvia was whispering. \"The anchor was good. We should have hada back-up anchor, but we were in a hurry. And he must have ...oh, God, there must have beensomething wrong with his harness. Maybe thebuckle wasn\u0027t fastened right, or the carabiners might have been upside down...:\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Maggie\u0027s feelings crystalized. It was asif everything came into focus at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s impossible. That\u0027s wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiles was too good. Smart and strong and anamazing technical climber. Confident but careful. Maggie only hoped she\u0027d be that good someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way he\u0027d buckle his harness wrong, or clip his \u0027biners upside down. No matter how sick hewas. In fact, no way he\u0027d go without a back-upanchor. I\u0027mthe one who tries to do things like that,and then he yells at me that if I\u0027m not careful I\u0027m going to have an adventure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiles doesn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it meant Sylvia was lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought came to Maggie on a little wave ofshock. It made her feel as if she were suddenlyspeeding backwards, or as if the room were receding from her very fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why?Why would Sylvia make up such a terrible story? It didn\u0027t make any sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSylvia had a hand half covering her eyes now.\"I looked for him, but ...there was icefall...a crevasse...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo body. She\u0027s saying there\u0027s no body .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, a new wave of heat swept over Maggie.And, strangely, what made her certain of it was Sylvia\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose violet eyes had been turned down for mostof the time Sylvia had beentalking, fixed on theSpanish tiles in the entry hall. But now, as Sylviagot to the last revelation, they had shifted toward Maggie. Toward Maggie\u0027s feet. They fixed there,slid away, and then came back and stayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made Maggie glance down at her own feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy socks. She\u0027s staring at my socks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne red and one blueand she\u0027s noticing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike an actress who\u0027s said the same lines oftenenough that she doesn\u0027t even need to pay attention to them anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, hot anger was burning through Maggie\u0027s shock, filling her so there was no room foranything else. She stared hard at Sylvia,whoseemed to be very far away but very bright. And inthat same instant she knew for certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis girl is lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must have done something-something terrible. And she can\u0027t show us Miles\u0027s body - or maybethere isn\u0027t a body because he\u0027s still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! Maggie felt suddenly lifted by hope. It is alla mistake. There\u0027s no reason for Miles to be dead.All we have to do is make Sylvia tell the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nobody else in the room knew. They wereall listening asSylvia went on with her story. Theyall believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t get out before the weatherhit....I hadto stay in the tent for three days. When I got out Iwas so weak, but I managed to signal to some climbers. They saved me, took care ofme....Bythen it was too late to look for him. I knew there was no chance he\u0027d made it through thatstorm....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke down completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger began talking about weather conditions and recovery efforts, and suddenly Maggie\u0027smother was making strange gasping noises andsinking toward the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom!\" Frightened, Maggie started toward her.Her father looked up and seemed to realize for thefirst time that she was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Maggie. We\u0027ve had some bad news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s trying to take care of me. But he doesn\u0027trealize...I\u0027ve got to tell him....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" she said urgently.\" L isten. There\u0027s something-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie,\" her mother interrupted, stretching outa hand. She sounded rational, but there was something wild in her eyes. \"I\u0027m so sorry, baby. Something awful has happened-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she fainted. Suddenly Maggie\u0027s fatherwas staggering under dead weight. And then theranger and one of the sheriffs were brushing pastMaggie. They were holding her mother up, and hermother\u0027s head was lolling, moving around on aboneless neck, and her mother\u0027s mouth and eyeswere part open and part closed. A new kind ofawful feeling came to Maggie, making her weakand giddy. She was afraid she would faint herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where can we-\" the male officer began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s the couch,\" Maggie\u0027s father said hoarselyat the same time. There was no room for Maggie.She could only stand out of the way and dizzilywatch them carryher mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they did, Sylvia began murmuring. It tookMaggie a moment to focus on the words. \"I\u0027m sosorry. I\u0027m so sorry. I wish there was something ...I should go home now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay right here,\" the female officer said,looking toward Maggie\u0027s mother. \"You\u0027re in no condition to be walking anywhere. You\u0027d be in the hospital now if you hadn\u0027t insisted on coming herefirst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need a hospital. I\u0027m just so tired..:\u0027The officer turned. \"Why don\u0027t you go sit in thecar?\" she said gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSylvia nodded. She looked fragile and sad as shewalked down the path toward the squad car. It wasa beautiful exit, Maggie thought. You could practically hear the theme music swelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Maggie was the only one with the chance toappreciate it. She was the only one watching asSylvia reached the car ... and paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then turned away from it and continued ondown the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the end credits run, Maggie thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she thought, she\u0027s going to her apartment. Maggie stood frozen, pulled in two directions. She wanted to stay and help her mother. But something inside her was utterly furious and focused and it was screaming at her to follow Sylvia.Instinct had always been Maggie\u0027s strong point.She hung there for a moment, with her heartpounding so hard that it seemed to be coming out-of her mouth. Then she ducked her head andclenched her fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a gesture the girls on her soccer teamwould have recognized. It meant that Steely Neelyhad made up her mind and was going to rush inwhere smarter people feared to tread. Look out,world; it\u0027s stomping time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie whirled and dashed back down the hallinto her bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slapped the light switch on and lookedaround as if she\u0027d never seen the place before.What did she need-and why did she always keepit so messy? How could she find things?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicked and pulled at a pile of bath towelsuntil a pair of hightop tennis shoes emerged, thenshe jammed her feet in them. There was no timeto change her pajama top. She snatched a dark blue jacket off the floor and found herself, just fora moment, nose to nose with a photograph stuckinto the frame of her mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA picture of Miles, on the summit of MountRainier. He was grinning and giving the thumbs upsign. His hat was off and his auburn hair was shining in the sun like red gold. He looked handsomeand a little wicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrawled in black marker across white snow was\"For the bossiest, nosiest, stubbornest, BEST little sister in the world. Love, Miles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith no idea whyshe was doing it, Maggie pulledthe picture out of the mirror. She shoved it in herjacket pocket and ran back down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was gathered around the couch, now.Even Jake was nosing his way in. Maggie couldn\u0027t see her mother, but the lack of frantic activity toldher that there wasn\u0027t any crisis going on. Everyoneseemed quiet and restrained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027ll just take a few minutes. It\u0027s better for me notto tell them anything until I\u0027m sure. I\u0027ll probablybe back before they even realize I\u0027m gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that jumble of excuses in her mind, sheslipped out the front door to follow Sylvia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-black-dawn-night-world-8/page-2.html","bookId":2081,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:55 PM"}
