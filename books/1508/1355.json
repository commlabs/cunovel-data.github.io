As for Lin Ming’s speculations, he had no time to speak them to Empyrean Divine Dream. But in truth, this wouldn’t necessarily have been useful.

He was one of the spies that the saint race had sent to infiltrate the Divine Realm at a great cost; his status was incomparably sensitive. If certain people learned that Tian Mingzi was cooperating with the saint race, he would die without a grave!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was a crime that would bring the judgment of the universe down on him; Tian Mingzi simply couldn’t afford this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd if the black-robed man died, then there was an extremely high chance that his status had been exposed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi’s complexion turned incomparably gloomy. He closed his eyes and then suddenly opened them. He originally thought that with the black-robed man’s strength, he alone would be enough to end the battle. He never imagined that such an incident would occur. Could that youth who obtained the primordial epoch spirit root have some great figure standing behind them? Otherwise, with the black-robed man’s strength, it was impossible for him to be killed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi hesitated for a moment. If there truly was a top master standing behind this youth, then he might not necessarily be able to deal with him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I must take the risk. If I don’t take action now and this secret is revealed, then it will be difficult for me to take shelter anywhere in the Divine Realm!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi decided to move. The black-robed man was too important; he needed to silence all witnesses and bury his crimes. Otherwise, his only choice would be to abandon the foundation he had been laying down on the Demondawn Great World for the last 50,000 years.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a hand tearing through the fabric of space, Tian Mingzi grasped his devil sword and stepped into the void.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sword was eight feet long, longer than the height of an adult male. The sword edge was cold and keen, with the design of a vicious demon engraved on it. It looked incomparably dreadful.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn just several dozen breaths of time, Tian Mingzi passed through a space-time door to an area thousands of miles away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSpace shifting wasn’t something that could be instantly done, but required some time. Moreover, the area Lin Ming was at was not the central mainland of Demondawn Great World, but a distant star called Skybreak Planet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi knew the location of this planet.

Tian Mingzi could clearly feel the aura that the black-robed man left behind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He really died… even his corpse is gone.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe disappearance of the corpse left Tian Mingzi feeling even more restless. He let out a long breath, his complexion still gloomy and dim.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“There is the aura of Black Demon, the aura of the youth who captured the primordial epoch spirit root, and also the aura of a master, but that has already faded away. This feeling… could it be an incarnation?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi wasn’t a stranger to incarnations. Some top masters would occasionally create incarnations to protect their descendants, but creating one cost a certain amount of their cultivation. Normally, they wouldn’t be freely manufactured.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAn incarnation would consume at least several hundred years of cultivation, and it would also disappear after a single use. Thus, those juniors that could obtain an incarnation created by a master were definitely of a high status.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi couldn’t help but reconsider Lin Ming’s status and background.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Less than 60 years of age, and can kill six Divine Lord powerhouse. It’s reasonable for him to come from a large influence, and likely even one greater than the Skydark Holy Lands. If this was just the matter of the primordial epoch spirit root, then I wouldn’t pursue this matter against such an influence. But now, since it involves the saints, I have no choice but to slay everyone involved, no matter what troubles I must incur. Luckily, this top master only sent out an incarnation and not their true self, thus giving me the chance to kill those involved.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi closed his eyes. In that moment, he seemed to blend together with the world, becoming one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Omniscience Lucidity Art!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi’s sense swept out like a tide. In that moment, everything within a thousand miles fell into Tian Mingzi’s vision, continuing to expand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………….\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn an open mountain valley, there was a giant white altar. This altar was 50 miles wide. A mortal horse would have to gallop for hours to run a circle around it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis altar was the Skybreak World’s lower realms transmission array.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe altar belonged to a local eighth-grade sect of Skybreak Planet – the Skybreak Sect. For a sect to be named after the planet, this meant that this Skybreak Sect was the number one sect of this planet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“All right, you will soon pass through the void. Let me warn you in advance that during the transmission process you will encounter all sorts of dangerous space turbulence. This is an extremely risky endeavor. If you are to die at that time then don’t blame us, you can only blame yourself for being weak. Are we clear?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the altar, an Elder of the Skybreak Sect traced his beard as he spoke. There were seven or eight martial artists standing in front of him, most of them at the Divine Lord realm as well as two at the Divine Transformation realm. The worst one was Lin Ming; he was only at the middle Divine Sea.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis Skybreak Sect Elder’s words were mostly meant for Lin Ming. To fly from the Divine Realm to the lower realms was far more dangerous than flying from the lower realms to the Divine Realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was because the space of the Divine Realm was incomparably vast and it was also like a beacon that exuded a faint guiding strength of the Heavenly Dao Laws. For a martial artist to fly from the lower realms to the Divine Realm was far smoother.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut to return to the lower realms was to go against this strength, like swimming against a rapid current. There were many dangers involved. In the eyes of this Skybreak Sect Elder, for a Divine Sea realm martial artist to return to the lower realms, there would be nine chances of dying and once chance of living. However, Lin Ming had already paid double the amount of violet sun crystals, and the Skybreak Sect Elder certainly wouldn’t reject such a rich offer. To say it plainly, whether Lin Ming lived or died wasn’t his problem at all. All that mattered was that he had his fee of violet sun crystals in hand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“We understand, just hurry up!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany people were in a hurry. There were many matters they had to process in the lower realms and they weren’t interested in listening to the nonsense of this old man.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm, then I wish you a safe and successful journey.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Skybreak Sect Elder slowly went to start the transmission array. As Lin Ming stood atop the altar, he let out a long breath. He was about to leave Demondawn Great World. Once he did, there would be far fewer troubles.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Sky Spill Planet could guarantee him absolute safety. And once he returned to the Divine Realm, he could find a safe area and hide his identity while he looked for a chance to report his findings to Empyrean Divine Dream. Whether or not his guesses had been right, whether or not Empyrean Divine Dream believed him, or whether Tian Mingzi was connected to this matter at all, the likely outcome was that Tian Mingzi would inevitably be focused on by Empyrean Divine Dream. At that time, his days would not pass peacefully.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOnce that happened, Tian Mingzi would no longer have the chance to move against him. In fact, if Lin Ming’s speculations about Tian Mingzi were correct, Tian Mingzi would simply be killed off.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the transmission array was just about to start, Lin Ming suddenly felt his mind turn cold. A terrifying sense dropped down from the skies, sweeping over his body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sense was like the gaze of a devil, clearly observing him from head to toe without missing the slightest detail!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Damn!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was very clear that the person who sent out such a terrifying sense was definitely a Great World King level character.

Although he could change his appearance, he couldn’t yet change his aura. When he killed the black-robed man, he would inevitably have left his aura in that area. Moreover, his cultivation was clearly at the middle Divine Sea realm – this wasn’t something he could conceal! If a middle Divine Sea martial artist was going to the lower realms, their goal was likely to flee.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith all of this combined together, in addition to the fact that the transmission array wasn’t too far off, Tian Mingzi had definitely discovered him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming felt as if his body had dropped into an ice bath.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Quick!
