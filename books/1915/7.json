Like I don\u0027t want to move, the pleasure of having Rush inside me is so great. I wrap my arms around his neck and kiss him, bite at his lower lip, play tongue war as his fingers press into my ass with every slow yet deep thrust. I\u0027ve completely forgotten where I am, where we are. It\u0027s just empty space, air to breathe while we fuck each other like rabbits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groans against my mouth, holding us tight together as he grinds his hips into me, circling, then driving upward again. My breasts bounce with each thrust, and my pelvis is completely slick with moisture. It\u0027s running down both our thighs, and I love that. Just like I love hearing him move, the slap of him against me. It\u0027s so primal, so uninhibited. Neither one of us is trying to hide our need, our desperation for each other. It\u0027s obvious in every guttural thrust, every drop of pre-come inside of me, every suck of my tongue into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rake my hands down his neck to his shoulders. God, his skin is so hot, so hard with lean muscle. I wish I could feel the artwork beneath my fingers as he drives into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Addison,\" he rasps against my hungry mouth. \"Tell me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I mumble nearly incoherently. \"Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me why you came back? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groan. He\u0027s so deep inside of me now my walls are contracting around him. Much more of this and I\u0027m going to come. \"You know why!\" I cry out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For forgiveness?\" His fingers brush over the seam of my ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can only nod. My breath is stalled inside my lungs and my heart is slamming against my chest. Oh, god...is he? Is he going to touch me there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn, woman.\" He eases his fingers lower, drenches them with my cream, then returns to my ass. \"It\u0027s done. Okay, Ads? It\u0027s over. You have it. No more of this bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, he enters me with one wet finger. \"Oh, fuck, you\u0027re tight. Around my cock and around my finger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cry out. It\u0027s too much. Pressure and pleasure and memories. This was something only we shared. I loved it. I loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moves us. Somewhere. A wall, I think. He presses back against it and bears down on me, fucking me so hard I scream, all the while using his finger in slow, gentle strokes. The combination is my downfall. I cling to him, my eyes clenched tight. I\u0027m shaking, convulsing, writhing, a wave of dizziness coming over me. And yet, I can\u0027t stop. I buck against him, moaning that I need more, I need all of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah, that\u0027s it, baby,\" he snarls close to my ear. \"Your pussy\u0027s fisting me, milking me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy nails dig into his shoulders as I feel him jerk and grow impossibly bigger inside of me. I gasp, shove my hips forward. I can\u0027t get close enough. His finger presses deeper into my rear and his thrusts go hard, fast and deep, hitting that spot in me that sends my flying. And I\u0027m off, gone. Shattered. Crying out my climax, my eyes flood with tears. Waves upon waves of intense heat lash over me as Rush continues to fuck me, using my orgasm to send him into his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Addison,\" he groans, thrusting fiercely into me, chasing his high. \"My Ads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the hot rush of his come bathe my walls, and I grip him even tighter, hold him even closer as he eases his finger out of me and satisfies my last clenches of orgasm with four deep, yet slow thrusts into my sex. God, this is right. This is it. How it\u0027s supposed to be. Finally, he slows, drops his head back against the wall and wraps his arms around my waist, locking me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck, Ads,\" he breathes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I say, dragging my tear-stained face across his shoulder. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word, he pushes away from the wall and heads out of the kitchen. Sweat clings to us both as he carries me down the long hallway. I know where we\u0027re going. I saw it on my tour. His bedroom. It\u0027s big and modern and right now that\u0027s all I can register or care about because when we enter, he goes straight for the bed and lays me down, oh-so gently, on my side. No lights are on, but the moon\u0027s magnificent glow streams in through the massive floor-to-ceiling windows. The sheets feel cool and soft against my skin, but they\u0027re nothing compared to the hot, hard body that tucks in behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a good five minutes, or maybe it\u0027s an hour, I don\u0027t know or care, we just lie together like sweaty spoons. I stare out the window to the landscape in the distance and let myself acknowledge the perfection in the moment. Coming to Las Vegas, I hadn\u0027t even dreamed I\u0027d get to share this again with Rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and try to calm my breathing. Tomorrow I\u0027m supposed to go back, to home and school. I have a paper due on Monday...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Rush whispers against my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shiver. \"I don\u0027t know.\" Thinking. Trying not to think. \"I could easily fall asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groans softly. \"Shit, me too. But, baby, there\u0027s not going to be any sleeping tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel his cock, hard and ready against the curve of my butt. My back arches automatically. \"You want me to stay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s quiet for a second, and I wish I had a super power that allowed me to hear the thoughts of others. Or maybe just one other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Addison,\" he says finally. \"I have you in my bed. You\u0027re not going anywhere. Not tonight, not...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops himself. And I panic. The last thing in the world I want is for this moment to go south, and if he starts overthinking, that\u0027s exactly where we\u0027re headed. Whatever happens tomorrow, happens. Tonight, we\u0027re going to kiss, and lick each other, and laugh, and fuck. That\u0027s it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll to my belly and give him a seductive smile. \"I\u0027m very open to being your prisoner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes instantly darken. \"How open?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he watches, a grin pulling at his mouth, I come up on all fours. \"How\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groans. He\u0027s so gorgeous and so completely captivating, I could stare at him for days without a break. No food, no water. Just Rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn, Ads,\" he practically growls. \"That sweet ass kills me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he slips a hand beneath me and plays gently, erotically with my nipple, I close my eyes and sigh. It\u0027s done. I\u0027m done. Forever. I swear, to whoever is up there directing traffic, this guy owns me. My heart, my body, every cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy pussy stirs with heat, and I squirm, wanting him again. Just the thought of him entering me, inch by steely inch, makes hot shards of pleasure rip through my sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes open. His hand is gone from my breast, and he\u0027s behind me now, his fingers working the tape from between my shoulder blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I say, glancing over my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taking off the bandage.\" He\u0027s flush against me now, the thick shaft of his cock moving tantalizingly between my sensitive flesh as he works. \"It\u0027s been two hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours? I feel a pang of anxiety, like time is moving too fast. Tomorrow\u0027s coming too quickly. \"How is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sucks air between his teeth and his eyes lift to mine. \"Perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I see it?\" I feel the hard, wet pressure of his cock against my opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes still locked to mine, he shakes his head. \"Not yet,\" he says, sinking into me with a groan. \"Not yet.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/first-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-1/page-7.html","bookId":1915,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:02 PM"}
