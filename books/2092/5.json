She was sitting on the bench beside him and he hadn\u0027t even noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found my Scholar! She\u0027s called Dr. Malone. And she\u0027s got an engine that can see Dust, and she\u0027s going to make it talk - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see you coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t looking,\" she said. \"You must\u0027ve been thinking about something else. It\u0027s a good thing I found you. Look, it\u0027s easy to fool people. Watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo police officers were strolling toward them, a man and a woman on the beat, in their white summer shirtsleeves, with their radios and their batons and their suspicious eyes. Before they reached the bench, Lyra was on her feet and speaking to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, could you tell me where the museum is?\" she said. \"Me and my brother was supposed to meet our parents there and we got lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe policeman looked at Will, and Will, containing his anger, shrugged as if to say, \"She\u0027s right, we\u0027re lost, isn\u0027t it silly.\" The man smiled. The woman said: \"Which museum? The Ashmolean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that one,\" said Lyra, and pretended to listen carefully as the woman gave her instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill got up and said, \"Thanks,\" and he and Lyra moved away together. They didn\u0027t look back, but the police had already lost interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" she said. \"If they were looking for you, I put \u0027em off. \u0027Cause they won\u0027t be looking for someone with a sister. I better stay with you from now on,\" she went on scoldingly once they\u0027d gone around the corner. \"You en\u0027t safe on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing. His heart was thumping with rage. They walked along toward a round building with a great leaden dome, set in a square bounded by honey-colored stone college buildings and a church and wide-crowned trees above high garden walls. The afternoon sun drew the warmest tones out of it all, and the air felt rich with it, almost the color itself of heavy golden wine. All the leaves were still, and in this little square even the traffic noise was hushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally became aware of Will\u0027s feelings and said, \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you speak to people, you just attract their attention,\" he said, with a shaking voice. \"You should just keep quiet and still and they overlook you. I\u0027ve been doing it all my life. I know how to do it. Your way, you just - you make yourself visible. You shouldn\u0027t do that. You shouldn\u0027t play at it. You\u0027re not being serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think so?\" she said, and her anger flashed. \"You think I don\u0027t know about lying and that? I\u0027m the best liar there ever was. But I en\u0027t lying to you, and I never will, I swear it. You\u0027re in danger, and if I hadn\u0027t done that just then, you\u0027d\u0027ve been caught. Didn\u0027t you see \u0027em looking at you? \u0027Cause they were. You en\u0027t careful enough. If you want my opinion, it\u0027s you that en\u0027t serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027m not serious, what am I doing hanging about waiting for you when I could be miles away? Or hiding out of sight, safe in that other city? I\u0027ve got my own things to do, but I\u0027m hanging about here so I can help you. Don\u0027t tell me I\u0027m not serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had to come through,\" she said, furious. No one should speak to her like this. She was an aristocrat. She was Lyra. \"You had to, else you\u0027d never find out anything about your father. You done it for yourself, not for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were quarreling passionately, but in subdued voices, because of the quiet in the square and the people who were wandering past nearby. When she said this, though, Will stopped altogether. He had to lean against the college wall beside him. The color had left his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know about my father?\" he said very quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe replied in the same tone. \"I don\u0027t know anything. All I know is you\u0027re looking for him. That\u0027s all I asked about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asked who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The alethiometer, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a moment for him to remember what she meant. And then he looked so angry and suspicious that she took it out of her rucksack and said, \"All right, I\u0027ll show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she sat down on the stone curb around the grass in the middle of the square and bent her head over the golden instrument and began to turn the hands, her fingers moving almost too quickly to see, and then pausing for several seconds while the slender needle whipped around the dial, flicking to a stop here and there, and then turning the hands to new positions just as quickly. Will looked around carefully, but there was no one near to see; a group of tourists looked up at the domed building, an ice-cream vendor wheeled his cart along the pavement, but their attention was elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyra blinked and sighed, as if she were waking after a sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother\u0027s ill,\" she said quietly. \"But she\u0027s safe. There\u0027s this lady looking after her. And you took some letters and ran away. And there was a man, I think he was a thief, and you killed him. And you\u0027re looking for your father, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, shut up,\" said Will. \"That\u0027s enough. You\u0027ve got no right to look into my life like that. Don\u0027t ever do that again. That\u0027s just spying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know when to stop asking,\" she said. \"See, the alethiometer\u0027s like a person, almost. I sort of know when it\u0027s going to be cross or when there\u0027s things it doesn\u0027t want me to know. I kind of feel it. But when you come out of nowhere yesterday, I had to ask it who you were, or I might not have been safe. I had to. And it said...\" She lowered her voice even more. \"It said you was a murderer, and I thought, \u0027Good, that\u0027s all right, he\u0027s someone I can trust.\u0027 But I didn\u0027t ask more than that till just now, and if you don\u0027t want me to ask anymore, I promise I won\u0027t. This en\u0027t like a private peep show. If I done nothing but spy on people, it\u0027d stop working. I know that as well as I know my own Oxford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have asked me instead of that thing. Did it say whether my father was alive or dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, because I didn\u0027t ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both sitting by this time. Will put his head in his hands with weariness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said finally, \"I suppose we\u0027ll have to trust each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right. I trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill nodded grimly. He was so tired, and there was not the slightest possibility of sleep in this world. Lyra wasn\u0027t usually so perceptive, but something in his manner made her think: He\u0027s afraid, but he\u0027s mastering his fear, like Iorek Byrnison said we had to do; like I did by the fish house at the frozen lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, Will,\" she added, \"I won\u0027t give you away, not to anyone. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I done that before. I betrayed someone. And it was the worst thing I ever did. I thought I was saving his life actually, only I was taking him right to the most dangerous place there could be. I hated myself for that, for being so stupid. So I\u0027ll try very hard not to be careless or forget and betray you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing. He rubbed his eyes and blinked hard to try and wake himself up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t go back through the window till much later,\" he said. \"We shouldn\u0027t have come through in daylight anyway. We can\u0027t risk anyone seeing. And now we\u0027ve got to hang around for hours...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hungry,\" Lyra said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he said, \"I know! We can go to the cinema!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll show you. We can get some food there too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a cinema near the city center, ten minutes\u0027 walk away. Will paid for both of them to get in, and bought hot dogs and popcorn and Coke, and they carried the food inside and sat down just as the film was beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyra was entranced. She had seen projected photograms, but nothing in her world had prepared her for the cinema. She wolfed down the hot dog and the popcorn, gulped the Coca-Cola, and gasped and laughed with delight at the characters on the screen. Luckily it was a noisy audience, full of children, and her excitement wasn\u0027t conspicuous. Will closed his eyes at once and went to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe woke when he heard the clatter of seats as people moved out, and blinked in the light. His watch showed a quarter past eight. Lyra came away reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the best thing I ever saw in my whole life,\" she said. \"I dunno why they never invented this in my world. We got some things better than you, but this was better than anything we got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill couldn\u0027t even remember what the film had been. It was still light outside, and the streets were busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"D\u0027you want to see another one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they went to the next cinema, a few hundred yards away around the corner, and did it again. Lyra settled down with her feet on the seat, hugging her knees, and Will let his mind go blank. When they came out this time, it was nearly eleven o\u0027clock - much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyra was hungry again, so they bought hamburgers from a cart and ate them as they walked along, something else new to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We always sit down to eat. I never seen people just walking along eating before,\" she told him. \"There\u0027s so many ways this place is different. The traffic, for one. I don\u0027t like it. I like the cinema, though, and hamburgers. I like them a lot. And that Scholar, Dr. Malone, she\u0027s going to make that engine use words. I just know she is. I\u0027ll go back there tomorrow and see how she\u0027s getting on. I bet I could help her. I could probably get the Scholars to give her the money she wants, too. You know how my father did it? Lord Asriel? He played a trick on them...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they walked up the Banbury Road, she told him about the night she hid in the wardrobe and watched Lord Asriel show the Jordan Scholars the severed head of Stanislaus Grumman in the vacuum flask. And since Will was such a good audience, she went on and told him the rest of her story, from the time she escaped from Mrs. Coulter\u0027s flat to the horrible moment when she realized she\u0027d led Roger to his death on the icy cliffs of Svalbard. Will listened without comment, but attentively, with sympathy. Her account of a voyage in a balloon, of armored bears and witches, of a vengeful arm of the Church, seemed all of a piece with his own fantastic dream of a beautiful city on the sea, empty and silent and safe: it couldn\u0027t be true, it was as simple as that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut eventually they reached the ring road, and the hornbeam trees. There was very little traffic now: a car every minute or so, no more than that. And there was the window. Will felt himself smiling. It was going to be all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait till there\u0027s no cars coming,\" he said. \"I\u0027m going through now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a moment later he was on the grass under the palm trees, and a second or two afterward Lyra followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey felt as if they were home again. The wide warm night, and the scent of flowers and the sea, and the silence, bathed them like soothing water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyra stretched and yawned, and Will felt a great weight lift off his shoulders. He had been carrying it all day, and he hadn\u0027t noticed how it had nearly pressed him into the ground; but now he felt light and free and at peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Lyra gripped his arm. In the same second he heard what had made her do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in the little streets beyond the caf¨¦, something was screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill set off at once toward the sound, and Lyra followed behind as he plunged down a narrow alley shadowed from the moonlight. After several twists and turns they came out into the square in front of the stone tower they\u0027d seen that morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty or so children were facing inward in a semicircle at the base of the tower, and some of them had sticks in their hands, and some were throwing stones at whatever they had trapped against the wall. At first Lyra thought it was another child, but coming from inside the semicircle was a horrible high wailing that wasn\u0027t human at all. And the children were screaming too, in fear as well as hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill ran up to the children and pulled the first one back. It was a boy of about his own age, a boy in a striped T-shirt. As he turned Lyra saw the wild white rims around his pupils, and then the other children realized what was happening and stopped to look. Angelica and her little brother were there too, stones in hand, and all the children\u0027s eyes glittered fiercely in the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fell silent. Only the high wailing continued, and then both Will and Lyra saw what it was: a tabby cat, cowering against the wall of the tower, its ear torn and its tail bent. It was the cat Will had seen in Sunderland Avenue, the one like Moxie, the one that had led him to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he saw her, he flung aside the boy he was holding. The boy fell to the ground and was up in a moment, furious, but the others held him back. Will was already kneeling by the cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she was in his arms. She fled to his breast and he cradled her close and stood to face the children, and Lyra thought for a crazy second that his daemon had appeared at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you hurting this cat for?\" he demanded, and they couldn\u0027t answer. They stood trembling at Will\u0027s anger, breathing heavily, clutching their sticks and their stones, and they couldn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Angelica\u0027s voice came clearly: \"You ain\u0027 from here! You ain\u0027 from Ci\u0027gazze! You didn\u0027 know about Specters, you don\u0027 know about cats either. You ain\u0027 like us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy in the striped T-shirt whom Will had thrown down was trembling to fight, and if it hadn\u0027t been for the cat in Will\u0027s arms, he would have flown at Will with fists and teeth and feet, and Will would have gladly joined battle. There was a current of electric hatred between the two of them that only violence could ground. But the boy was afraid of the cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where you come from?\" he said contemptuously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter where we come from. If you\u0027re scared of this cat, I\u0027ll take her away from you. If she\u0027s bad luck to you, she\u0027ll be good luck for us. Now get out of the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Will thought their hatred would overcome their fear, and he was preparing to put the cat down and fight, but then came a low thunderous growl from behind the children, and they turned to see Lyra standing with her hand on the shoulders of a great spotted leopard whose teeth shone white as he snarled. Even Will, who recognized Pantalaimon, was frightened for a second. Its effect on the children was dramatic: they turned and fled at once. A few seconds later the square was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before they left, Lyra looked up at the tower. A growl from Pantalaimon prompted her, and just briefly she saw someone there on the very top, looking down over the battlemented rim, and not a child either, but a young man, with curly hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later they were in the flat above the caf¨¦. Will had found a tin of condensed milk, and the cat had lapped it hungrily and then begun to lick her wounds. Pantalaimon had become cat-formed out of curiosity, and at first the tabby cat had bristled with suspicion, but she soon realized that whatever Pantalaimon was, he was neither a true cat nor a threat, and proceeded to ignore him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyra watched Will tending this one with fascination. The only animals she had been close to in her world (apart from the armored bears) were working animals of one sort or another. Cats were for keeping Jordan College clear of mice, not for making pets of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think her tail\u0027s broken,\" Will said. \"I don\u0027t know what to do about that. Maybe it\u0027ll heal by itself. I\u0027ll put some honey on her ear. I read about that somewhere; it\u0027s antiseptic...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was messy, but at least it kept her occupied licking it off, and the wound was getting cleaner all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure this is the one you saw?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. And if they\u0027re all so frightened of cats, there wouldn\u0027t be many in this world anyway. She probably couldn\u0027t find her way back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were just crazy,\" Lyra said. \"They would have killed her. I never seen kids being like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have,\" said Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his face had closed; he didn\u0027t want to talk about it, and she knew better than to ask. She knew she wouldn\u0027t even ask the alethiometer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was very tired, so presently she went to bed and slept at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little later, when the cat had curled up to sleep, Will took a cup of coffee and the green leather writing case, and sat on the balcony. There was enough light coming through the window for him to read by, and he wanted to look at the papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere weren\u0027t many. As he\u0027d thought, they were letters, written on airmail paper in black ink. These very marks were made by the hand of the man he wanted so much to find; he moved his fingers over and over them, and pressed them to his face, trying to get closer to the essence of his father. Then he started to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFairbanks, Alaska\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWednesday, 19 June 1985\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy darling - the usual mixture of efficiency and chaos - all the stores are here but the physicist, a genial dimwit called Nelson, hasn\u0027t made any arrangements for carrying his damn balloons up into the mountains - having to twiddle our thumbs while he scrabbles around for transport. But it means I had a chance to talk to an old boy I met last time, a gold miner called Jake Petersen. Tracked him down to a dingy bar and under the sound of the baseball game on the TV I asked him about the anomaly. He wouldn\u0027t talk there - took me back to his apartment. With the help of a bottle of Jack Daniel\u0027s he talked for a long time - hadn\u0027t seen it himself, but he\u0027d met an Eskimo who had, and this chap said it was a doorway into the spirit world. They\u0027d known about it for centuries; part of the initiation of a medicine man involved going through and bringing back a trophy of some kind - though some never came back. However, old Jake did have a map of the area, and he\u0027d marked on it where his pal had told him the thing was. (Just in case: it\u0027s at 69¡ឰ2\u0027 11\" N, 157¡ឱ2\u0027 19\" W, on a spur of Lookout Ridge a mile or two north of the Colville River.) We then got on to other Arctic legends - the Norwegian ship that\u0027s been drifting unmanned for sixty years, stuff like that. The archaeologists are a decent crew, keen to get to work, containing their impatience with Nelson and his balloons. None of them has ever heard of the anomaly, and believe me I\u0027m going to keep it like that. My fondest love to you both. Johnny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUmiat, Alaska\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday, 22 June 1985\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy darling - so much for what did I call him, a genial dimwit - the physicist Nelson is nothing of the sort, and if I\u0027m not mistaken he\u0027s actually looking for the anomaly himself. The holdup in Fairbanks was orchestrated by him, would you believe? Knowing that the rest of the team wouldn\u0027t want to wait for anything less than an unarguable reason like no transport, he personally sent ahead and canceled the vehicles that had been ordered. I found this out by accident, and I was going to ask him what the hell he was playing at when I overheard him talking on the radio to someone - describing the anomaly, no less, except he didn\u0027t know the location. Later on I bought him a drink, played the bluff soldier, old Arctic hand, \"more things in heaven and earth \" line. Pretended to tease him with the limitations of science - bet you can\u0027t explain Bigfoot, etc. - watching him closely. Then sprung the anomaly on him - Eskimo legend of a doorway into spirit world - invisible - somewhere near Lookout Ridge, would you believe, where we\u0027re heading for, fancy that. And you know he was jolted rigid. He knew exactly what I meant. I pretended not to notice and went on to witchcraft, told him the Zaire leopard story. So I hope he\u0027s got me down as a superstitious military blockhead. But I\u0027m right, Elaine - he\u0027s looking for it too. The question is, do I tell him or not? Got to work out what his game is. Fondest love to both - Johnny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColville Bar,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlaska Monday, 24 June 1985\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarling - I won\u0027t get a chance to post another letter for a while - this is the last town before we take to the hills, the Brooks Range. The archaeologists are fizzing to get up there. One chap is convinced he\u0027ll find evidence of much earlier habitation than anyone suspected. I said how much earlier, and why was he convinced. He told me of some narwhal-ivory carvings he\u0027d found on a previous dig - carbon 14-dated to some incredible age, way outside the range of what was previously assumed; anomalous, in fact. Wouldn\u0027t it be strange if they\u0027d come through my anomaly, from some other world? Talking of which, the physicist Nelson is my closest buddy now - kids me along, drops hints to imply that he knows that I know that he knows, etc. And I pretend to be bluff Major Parry, stout fellow in a crisis but not too much between the ears, what. But I know he\u0027s after it. For one thing, although he\u0027s a bona fide academic his funding actually comes from the Ministry of Defense - I know the financial codes they use. And for another his so-called weather balloons are nothing of the sort. I looked in the crate - a radiation suit if ever I\u0027ve seen one. A rum do, my darling. I shall stick to my plan: take the archaeologists to their spot and go off by myself for a few days to look for the anomaly. If I bump into Nelson wandering about on Lookout Ridge, I\u0027ll play it by ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater. A real bit of luck. I met Jake Petersen\u0027s pal the Eskimo, Matt Kigalik. Jake had told me where to find him, but I hadn\u0027t dared to hope he\u0027d be there. He told me the Soviets had been looking for the anomaly too; he\u0027d come across a man earlier this year high up in the range and watched him for a couple of days without being seen, because he guessed what he was doing, and he was right, and the man turned out to be Russian, a spy. He didn\u0027t tell me more than that; I got the impression he bumped him off. But he described the thing to me. It\u0027s like a gap in the air, a sort of window. You look through it and you see another world. But it\u0027s not easy to find because that part of the other world looks just like this - rocks and moss and so forth. It\u0027s on the north side of a small creek fifty paces or so to the west of a tall rock shaped like a standing bear, and the position Jake gave me is not quite right - it\u0027s nearer 12\" N than 11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWish me luck, my darling. I\u0027ll bring you back a trophy from the spirit world. I love you forever - kiss the boy for me - Johnny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill found his head ringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father was describing exactly what he himself had found under the hornbeam trees. He, too, had found a window - he even used the same word for it! So Will must be on the right track. And this knowledge was what the men had been searching for... So it was dangerous, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill had been just a baby when that letter was written. Seven years after that had come the morning in the supermarket when he realized his mother was in terrible danger, and he had to protect her; and then slowly in the months that followed came his growing realization that the danger was in her mind, and he had to protect her all the more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, brutally, the revelation that not all the danger had been in her mind after all. There really was someone after her - after these letters, this information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea what it meant. But he felt deeply happy that he had something so important to share with his father; that John Parry and his son Will had each, separately, discovered this extraordinary thing. When they met, they could talk about it, and his father would be proud that Will had followed in his footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night was quiet and the sea was still. He folded the letters away and fell asleep. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-subtle-knife-his-dark-materials-2/page-5.html","bookId":2092,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:56 PM"}
