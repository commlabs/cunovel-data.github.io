The afternoon after the atomic blast, I peer through the carefully hidden trapdoor and discover sheets of copper, magnetic crosses arranged in odd angles, and, most important of all, an empty crystal vial, waiting to be filled with blood. A mirror rests above the vial. It can reflect either the sun or the moon, depending on how much you want to wager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI call Seymour Dorsten, explain the possibilities to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, he cautions. He is on his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit down and wait. Time passes slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything you require is in the basement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo I still want a daughter? Do I still crave immor?tality?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep questions. I have no answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour arrives and tries to talk me out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing human is not so great, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a vampire gets old, I counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that I will attempt the transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I need some of his blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake me a vampire first, he pleads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat will not work, I remind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, he protests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer is no, I say firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take his blood, fill the vial to the brim, then tell him to get lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the sun is at its peak, I lie down on the copper sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magnets draw out my aura. The magic begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I awake, I feel weak and disoriented. Some?one is knocking at the door. I have to struggle up the steps to answer it. There is a spongy texture to my skin I have never noticed before, and my vision is blurred. I am not even sure where I am--only that it is dark. Blood pounds in my head, and I feel I will be sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow moves outside the glazed side window panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust before I open the door, I remember everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I human?\" I whisper to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet I am not given a chance to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knocking continues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\" I call in a hoarse voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s your darling,\" the person replies. Odd. It doesn\u0027t sound like Seymour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet the voice is familiar. From long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the tone is a little demanding. Sort of impa?tient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open the door,\" the person calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if I should:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring down at my trembling hands, I wonder many things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTO BE CONTINUED ... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/red-dice-the-last-vampire-3/page-18.html","bookId":2512,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:36 PM"}
