Let\u0027s hear it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hear what?\" Ron said plaintively. \"I wasn\u0027t doing anything!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sure,\" the guard sneered. \"He wasn\u0027t doin\u0027 a thing. Just snoopin\u0027 around, that\u0027s all.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The swinging door opened.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s going on here?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ron Carver looked at himself; at his own face, now strange and stony; at his own eyes, now bright and disinterested; at his own mouth, now a thin line of discontent. He heard his own voice, in a dangerous inflection he had never known before.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sorry, sir,\" the guard said, reddening. \"Didn\u0027t know you were inside. Wouldn\u0027t have disturbed you—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How did he get here?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Gosh, sir, I really don\u0027t know. He says he was lookin\u0027 for Dr. Minton—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Minton,\" Ron Carver\u0027s voice said. \"Yes, of course. He would be looking for Minton, wouldn\u0027t he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sir?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Never mind. Bring the boy into my quarters. Then get Dr. Minton up here at once.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They pushed the swinging door open and shoved Ron ahead of them. The room was an anomaly in this pristine government building, a warm room of deep-colored woods and thick carpeting. He was placed in a leather chair, his feet not touching the floor. The two men exited, and Ron Carver\u0027s body walked to an oaken desk and sat in the padded swivel chair behind the blotter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" he said. \"This is something of a surprise for me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And how about me?\" Ron said hoarsely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man laughed. \"Yes, we are both surprised. Was it Robert Burns? Yes, of course. \u0027To see ourselves as others see us....\u0027\" He chuckled, and reached for a cigarette. \"Filthy habit, this. Don\u0027t know how I picked it up. Possibly a deep-seated trait of yours, Mr. Carver. Odd how these things can be transferred.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The door opened again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dr. Minton!\" Ron leaped to his feet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The doctor\u0027s face went white behind the gray beard and moustache.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you\u0027ve found him,\" he said softly, to neither of them in particular.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No,\" Ron Carver\u0027s body answered. \"I didn\u0027t find him, doctor. Rather, he found us. Isn\u0027t that right, Mr. Carver?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes!\" Ron said. \"And now I want to know the truth!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I, too, need answers,\" the Ron-body said stiffly. \"I need answers at once, Dr. Minton. I would think this requires an explanation.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I couldn\u0027t do it,\" the doctor whispered. \"I couldn\u0027t do what you wanted, Scholar.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do what?\" Ron said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All right, then,\" the Ron-body said coldly. \"You failed once. But you\u0027re far too intelligent to make the same mistake twice. So you have your assignment, Dr. Minton. I will get you the help you need. But kill this—this remnant—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He turned away in disgust, and picked up the telephone. He spoke under his breath for a few moments, and then hung up. \"Dr. Luther will be here in just a moment. He\u0027ll arrange things with the laboratory. It will all be very painless and quick.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ron said: \"What are you talking about?\" He looked wildly towards the old man, who had aged even further since entering the room. \"Dr. Minton—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The door opened. A brisk young man, carrying a small valise, appeared.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All set downstairs,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good,\" the Ron-body answered. \"Then get it over with.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ron struggled for a moment in the young man\u0027s grip, but he found it iron.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Please, Ron.\" Doctor Minton\u0027s eyes were moist. \"Don\u0027t make any trouble. Please....\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3272/89521.html","bookId":513,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:53:08 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:53:08 AM"}
