A Heavenly Emperor was after all a Heavenly Emperor, and he was able to forcefully suppress his injuries, sealing his blood flow. However, when he looked at Zhou Weiqing once more, at the three companions that he had placed his hopes in to hold the youth off… he could only see several hundred bright three-coloured lightning pearls covering those three ‘naked pigs’[1. TJSS is referring to how they have been stripped of all their Equipment and powers].\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA dark gold figure appeared once more in front of Meng Gui.

If one were to describe his previous feelings regarding Zhou Weiqing’s arrogance as anger, now… there was only horror and terror left in his heart.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe display of power Zhou Weiqing had shown was just too great… reaching a level that he could not even imagine. Was this really something a young man barely over the age of twenty could pull off? Meng Gui felt as if he would rather face the familiar Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, Long Shiya, rather than this demonic youth in front of him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It’s your turn.” The wings behind Zhou Weiqing’s back spread, the giant grey figure behind his back suddenly rushing and merging into his body. Next, a demonic aura that was so powerful that it rose into the skies burst forth, turning Zhou Weiqing’s entire body grey.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurrently, Zhou Weiqing was like a massive grey whirlpool, a terrifying suction force warping the air, Devouring all of the atmospheric energies around, leaving Meng Gui with nothing to draw on. At the same time, it also sealed off all his possible escape routes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWithout any atmospheric energies to rely on, even if he was a Heavenly Emperor, Meng Gui could not depend on his physical speed alone to escape Zhou Weiqing’s pursuit.

Ever since he had reached the Heavenly Emperor stage, this was the first time he had been forced into such a wretched and miserable state.

Furthermore, when one reached the Heavenly Emperor stage, their body was already fused with their spirit and soul to form a powerful weapon. Now that Zhou Weiqing had taken off an arm from Meng Gui, it could be said to have broken his primordial qi and base power. Meng Gui was now only able to use around seventy percent of his normal power. In the current situation, it would be difficult for him to actually defeat Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, Meng Gui quick recovered, displaying a psyche that none of the other Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings could compare to. Facing Zhou Weiqing’s immense pressure, he slowly calmed down.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Young man, don’t go too far.

At this stage, our Heavenly Core Nucleus would undergo a qualitative change. Regarding this, you can ask Fatty Long. If I self-detonate my Heavenly Emperor Core Nucleus, perhaps you and Fatty Long can escape without any issues, but this entire city will definitely be destroyed. Not just the citizens, even your family and the Heavenly Bow Royal Family will also go up in smoke.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing’s expression changed, as he took an involuntary step back, looking at his Master hovering in midair.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLong Shiya nodded towards Zhou Weiqing. This Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had not fully recovered from his sheer shock. He had been watching the entire process of Zhou Weiqing dealing with all the Blood Red Hell powerhouses, and the shock in his heart was already at the maximum. These were all Heavenly Kings with the Destruction Attribute! With the three of them joining forces, Long Shiya had to admit to himself that even if he wanted to take care of those fellows, it would take him some time. Furthermore, there was still that Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui at the side. However, Zhou Weiqing had forcefully used his own power to kill three enemies, with Meng Gui injured. Of course, some part of Meng Gui’s injuries could be attributed to his own mistakes and underestimation of Zhou Weiqing, but in the end this young disciple of his had to have the power to back it up and actually make use of those mistakes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe both had nine pieces of Legendary Set Equipment boosting their strength, but Long Shiya did not think he could compare with Zhou Weiqing’s physical strength any longer. Although his base cultivation was still higher than Zhou Weiqing by an entire Jewel, just in terms of physical strength he was no match for him. The Dragon-Tiger Transformation that held the two imposing bloodlines… this was something that Long Shiya could not match, let alone the existence of the Saint Energy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHis precious disciple had already reached such a power level. Long Shiya did not even dare guarantee that in a one versus one fight, he could actually defeat Zhou Weiqing. This was a mere year that they had been apart! This Little Fatty had already grown to such a degree. If he was given some more time, perhaps even the top powerhouse Xue AoTian would have to give up his seat as the strongest in the world right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, this was clearly not the time to ruminate over such matters. The Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui’s words, Long Shiya had naturally heard them. Indeed, Meng Gui had not been lying. When one reached the Heavenly Emperor stage, their Heavenly Core Nucleus would undergo a qualitative transformation. If self-detonated, even Long Shiya would not dare to take it full on. Let alone this city below… one which the Heavenly Bow Empire could not afford to abandon and lose.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eGetting the signal from his Master, Zhou Weiqing’s ferocious demonic aura began to slowly withdraw slightly, and Meng Gui breathed a sigh of relief. Of course, he could choose to self-detonate; in that case the Heavenly Bow City would be destroyed, and it would be a heavy blow to the entire Heavenly Bow Empire. At the same time, that would achieve the target of blocking the Heavenly Bow Empire’s path to the south. However, Meng Gui was also human, especially a top powerhouse like him, who would be willing to give up their life just to fulfil such a mission! Cultivating for over eighty years to reach the Heavenly Emperor stage; the higher level one has reached, the more they would treasure their lives. A Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Core Nucleus detonating was far more destructive indeed, however as compared to a Heavenly King self-detonating, where they still had a small chance of survival, the Heavenly Emperor would definitely perish together with their Heavenly Core Nucleus.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs such, if it was not a matter of last resort, he would never make such a choice.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing’s expression was rather ugly, and he gave a short sigh before saying: “It looks like I have no choice but to let you off today. However, if I let you go, my powers will be revealed to the Blood Red Hell. That will be far too detrimental to the future of the Heavenly Bow Empire.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSeeing that he had relented, Meng Gui’s heart was overjoyed. Hastily, he said: “In this regard, you do not have to worry. I can swear on my Heavenly Core that I will never reveal the powers that you displayed today. I am willing to leave the Blood Red Hell and live in seclusion, hidden from them. I will no longer interfere in the matters of the Boundless Mainland.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing pursed his lips, his brow furrowed deeply.
