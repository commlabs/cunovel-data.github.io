The formation of alien vessels headed straight toward Menachite Mountain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Covenant communiques scrolled across a screen next to the pilot\u0027s seat and then ceased.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Incoming transmissions from the convoy ... I guess they don\u0027t like strays,\" Polaskimuttered calmly, looking at the Cove.nant calligraphy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027re not shooting,\" the Admiral said, gripping the back of Polaski\u0027s seat. \"We\u0027re fine.Just fly, Warrant Officer.\" He turned to the Master Chief. \"Get \u0027em ready, son.\"The Chief nodded and moved aft to the rest of the squad. His three Spartans as well as Lieutenant Haverson, Locklear, and Sergeant Johnson stood over an array of weapons laidout on the deck. Anton ticked \"off the inventory: Shotguns, a fuel rod gun, Jackhammer rocket launchers, plasma and HE pistols, and every type of grenade—take your pick.\"The Chief picked up five clips of ammunition for his MA5B assault rifle, three frag grenades, and a shotgun for close work. Nothing fancy—he wanted to keep it simple so hecould keep one eye on the rest of his team.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 184HALO: FIRST STRIKELocklear hefted the fuel rod gun, grunting from the exertion. The weapon glowed an eeriegreen along its fuel casing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Grace relieved him of the too-heavy weapon and shouldered it with ease.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Make sure you get a handgun,\" the Chief told Locklear. \"We\u0027ll be in close quarters underground.\"\"Roger that,\" Locklear said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027re close,\" the Admiral called out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief moved up to the cockpit to watch. The line of dropships and drones maneuvered toward a pile of truck-sized stones that had been carved from the mountain.A spiraling hole, ten kilometers across, sat\u0026nbsp; where Menachite Mountain had once risen majestic and impregnable, covered with forests and glaciers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was only a strip mine now, with a single shaft drilled down its center. A Covenantcruiser hovered over the shaft, and the purple glow of a grav lift knifed into the hole.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s our LZ,\" Whitcomb announced. \"Polaski, I want you to drive this crate straightdown—but ease up a tad on the en.gines and let their grav beam do the work. It\u0027ll take us all the way down to whatever\u0027s at the\u0026nbsp; bottom.\"\"With respect, Admiral,\" Polaski said, \"I\u0027m not sure we\u0027ll fit.\"The Admiral squinted at the hole. \"We\u0027ll fit,\" he said. \"I have every confidence in you,Warrant Officer. Now make it quick. I don\u0027t think anyone topside is going to think us going down there is a good idea.\"\"Yes, sir!\" Her eyes locked onto the hole. \"No problem, sir.\"The Master Chief marveled at the Admiral\u0027s lack of fear. He trusted the man\u0027s judgment;he had been criticized during his campaigns for unorthodox tactics and strategies, but hisinsight had been proven correct each\u0026nbsp; time. The Master Chief, however, also had observedthat the higher up the chain of command you received your orders, the more likely those orders would de.mand the near impossible.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hang on,\" the Chief called back to his team.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Polaski nosed the Covenant dropship over and plummeted into the dark purplescintillating grav beam. The instant they entered the field, the ship jumped, accelerated,and shuddered into the hole drilled through solid\u0026nbsp; rock.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ERIC NYLUND 185Cut off from the thin shreds of sunlight above, the ship went dark. The internal runninglights glowed a faint blue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ve got no room to maneuver in here,\" Polaski whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Haverson climbed forward. \"Admiral Whitcomb, sir, I see how we can get in—assuming this hole leads somewhere— but it\u0027s the other part of your plan that\u0027s unclear.What\u0027s our exit strategy, sir?\"The Admiral\u0027s steely glare inned Haverson. \"I\u0027ve got it fig.ured out. You just shoot whenI tell you to and keep it all pppuck.ered up tight. Got it?\"Haverson clenched his jaw, looking extremely unsatisfied. \"Yes, sir.\"Polaski focused intently on the walls of the tunnel rushing toward her craft. \"Short-rangesensors have a contact,\" she said. \"It looks like the bottom of the shaft. ETA sixty secondsat this speed.\"The Admiral leaned closer to the Chief and whispered, \"We\u0027re gonna get hit heavy bwhatever\u0027s down there. You make sure you hit them back three times harder. Then yyyouet Anton on point and see if he can\u0027t locate your Spartans. I\u0027m guessing they\u0027ve gone toggground.\"Before the Chief could reply, the Admiral moved aft and grabbed an assault rifle and twoHE pistols. He clipped plasma and frag grenades to his belt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thirty seconds,\" Polaski called out. She cut the engines, and the dropship coasted on thegrav beam only. \"There\u0027s something down there,\" she said. \"Is that sunlight?\"The dropship emerged into a titanic room—three kilometers across, circular, with adozen galleries circumscribing the space. Overhead, a holographic sun and a dozenmoons wheeled along its domed ceiling. Except for\u0026nbsp; the hole drilled into the mountain bythe Covenant, the holographic projection was perfect.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Admiral scrutinized the room, and his dark eyes locked onto a gathering of Covenantforces on the floor, near one edge of the great room. \"There,\" he said, and pointed. \"I makeout about a hundred of them: a few\u0026nbsp; Elites, Jackals, mostly Grunts. Looks like they\u0027reclearing a cave-in and not ready for company yet. Good.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Polaski, land us half a kilome\u0027ter from em and then dust off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 186HALO: FIRST STRIKEI want you back in that hole ASAP. Plug it up. We don\u0027t want to leave our back door wideopen.\"\"Aye, sir,\" Polaski replied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Admiral Whitcomb addressed Li. \"You\u0027re our rear guard, son. Stay here and guard theship with Polaski. Sorry.\"\"Sir! Yes, sir,\" Li replied. The Master Chief detected a hint of bitterness in the Spartan\u0027svoice for drawing what he undoubt.edly would think was soft duty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Their dro ship eased lower until it was a meter above the blue tiles of the room; the sidehatches opppened. The Chief jumped out first, followed by Anton, Lieutenant Haverson, andLocklear. From the hatch on the opposite side leapt the Admiral, Sergeant Johnson, andGrace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The dropship immediately rose into the hole in the ceiling, far enough in to be shieldedfrom any stray ground fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Move, everyone,\" the Admiral growled. He pointed at Grace and Locklear. \"You two, firelong-range weapons. Everyone else, haul ass. Take them out, people.\"The Admiral\u0027s plan was sound. He wasn\u0027t risking the dropship—their only means ofescape—by landing too close to the enemy. They still had the element of surprise; theCovenant would have never anticipated an assault\u0026nbsp; on the heart of their operation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But how long would this advantage last? How long before that cruiser blasted theirdropship to atoms? The Covenant were not their most dangerous enemy. Time was.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Grace paused, muscled the fuel rod gun to a forty-five-degree angle into the air, andlaunched a round. The alien weapon hissed and spat a glowing sphere of energy. Theblast arced over the half-kilometer distance,\u0026nbsp; impacted, and exploded in a green flash.Grunts and Jackals flew through the air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Locklear fired two Jackhammer rockets, then dropped the spent launcher. The pair ofrockets connected with a cluster of Elites who had—until a second ago—been runningthe show. The twin explosion obscured that\u0026nbsp; end of the room with billow.ing clouds ofdust, fire, and smoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief motioned for his team to spread out and move forward at a jog.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ERIC NYLUND 187Ahead there were silhouetted Grunts and Jackals in the dust clouds, screaming and shooting at the air, each other, anything that moved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Keep moving,\" the Master Chief said. \"Move while they don\u0027t know what\u0027s hit them.\"Anton paused and knelt next to a set of tracks dug into the tiled floor. \"Kelly\u0027s been thisway,\" he reported over the COM.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief clicked on Red Team\u0027s COM frequency. \"Kelly? Fred? Joshua? Spartans,acknowledge this signal.\"Only static answered him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A hundred meters from the stunned Covenant work crew, a stray plasma bolt fired from the hazy, rubble-strewn region deto.nated a few meters from the Master Chief. He sent aspray of au.tomatic fire across the area,\u0026nbsp; hoping to force the enemy to keep their headsdown.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Grace halted and fired the fuel rod gun again. A second glow.ing burst of radioactive energy flashed overhead and detonated along the far wall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the intense light, the Master Chief saw that a dozen Jackals had braced themselves along the wall and overlapped their en.ergy shields to create a phalanx. Behind them five Elites readied plasma rifles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Down,\" he shouted, and dived to one side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Grace hit the floor and rolled away. Plasma bolts sizzled over their heads, and the Master Chief\u0027s shields drained as a shot hit too close. The barrage turned several of the blue tiles around him into a crater of blackened\u0026nbsp; glass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Grenades—up and over those shields, Spartans,\" Admiral Whitcomb bellowed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief and Anton primed plasma grenades and hurled them from their prone positions. They hit the far wall and dropped into the cluster of Elites and Jackals—behindtheir shields. There was a pair of blue\u0026nbsp; flashes, and the enemy forma.tion blew apart.Jackals scattered and ran.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Grace fired the fuel rod gun, hit the broken phalanx forma.tion, and blew them literally tobits. She dropped the weapon. \"Rad counter at max dosage,\" she called out. \"This thing\u0027stoo hot to use anymore.\"\"Back away!\" the Chief ordered. \"Those things have a fail-safe!\"HALO: FIRST STRIKEGrace sprang back, just in time. The fallen fuel rod gun sparked, sputtered, and then blew with the force of a frag grenade. Black.ened, twisted tile rained down on them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Locklear jogged up and fired at the Grants fleeing the excava.tion. They weren\u0027t armed.Locklear mowed them down without remorse.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From a pile of shattered stone, a pair of battered Elites struggled to rise. Blood and bone exploded outward from their chests, and they spun around toward the source of thisforce—boulders pushed away from the\u0026nbsp; blocked passage. Three Spartans emerged from their cover, assault rifles smoking from their recent discharge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John knew instantly the three were Kelly, Fred, and Will.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He ran forward to meet them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fred lowered his weapon. \"Anton ... Grace ... John?\" he said disbelievingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief opened a COM channel to his Spartans. \"It\u0027s me. I wish I had time toexplain everything. I will—later. Let\u0027s get the hell out of here first.\"Kelly quickly reached out and swiped her two fingers across John\u0027s faceplate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He wanted to return the smile, but at that moment Admiral Whitcomb, running full force,skidded to a stop next to the Spar.tans. He was followed in short order by Haverson, Locklear, and Johnson, who kept looking\u0026nbsp; over his shoulder to scan the huge empty room around them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is this everyone?\" Admiral Whitcomb asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, sir,\" Fred replied. \"There\u0027s one more.\" He turned and ex.tended his hand back into the partially collapsed tunnel. \"Ma\u0027am? It\u0027s safe to come out.\"For a heartbeat the Master Chief forgot that he was in the heart of an enemy\u0027s camp; heforgot about the war, that Reach had fallen, and everything else he had gone through inthe last few days. He had never thought\u0026nbsp; he would see her again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey emerged from the partially caved-in tunnel. She brushed dust from the hem ofher skirt and lab coat with one slender hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Admiral Whitcomb,\" she said, \"a pleasure to see you again. My thanks for the rescue. Itwas far timelier than you couldERIC NYLUND 189imagine.\" She turned to the Master Chief. \"Or is it you I have to thank for this daringThe Master Chief found he had no words to answer. He also bristled at her casual use of operation, John?\"his given name... but he could for.give her that. She had always used his name—never hisrank or serial number.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He noticed the fist-sized crystal clutched in her hand. It had a thousand facets andemitted a brilliant blue light the color of sapphires and sunlight on water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank anyone you want, Catherine,\" Admiral Whitcomb said. \"Throw us all a party ifthat\u0027ll make you happy... once we\u0027re out of here.\" He clicked open his COM. \"Polaski, getdown—\"Sergeant Johnson set his hand on the Admiral\u0027s arm and nod.ded toward the far wall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it, Sergeant?\" The Admiral\u0027s voice died in his throat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief\u0027s motion tracker flickered on his heads-up display, but there was nosolid contact... nor did he see any.thing across the entire three-kilometer-wide cavern.Had it picked up a camouflaged Elite? No, the\u0026nbsp; dust in the air would have certainly given itaway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No one move,\" the Admiral whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John saw them, then. He saw them all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had missed them before because he had thought it was the haze in the air rippling, thedust, maybe the distance causing a miragelike image. He hadn\u0027t thought it possible for somany Covenant to be so still.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On each level of the twelve tiered galleries that circumscribed the gigantic room stoodCovenant soldiers.
