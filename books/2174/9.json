Maybe someone\u0027s discovered something they\u0027re not sharing.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027One of us? They wouldn\u0027t!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nature, then,\u0027 he said. \u0027Nature asserting itself in the interest of Man.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sometimes you sound like a cultist!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It isn\u0027t the Cyborgs,\u0027 he said. \u0027We know that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Glisson said it was beneficient.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But it\u0027s genetic shaping. That\u0027s blasphemy to them. Physical alteration of the bioframe, that\u0027s their way.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Like Glisson,\u0027 she said. \u0027That robot with flesh.\u0027 Again she pressed her cheek against him. \u0027That\u0027s what I fear - they\u0027ll do that to our son... our sons.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The courier service outnumbers the Cyborgs a hundred to one,\u0027 he said. \u0027As long as we stick together, we\u0027ll win.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But we\u0027re just flesh,\u0027 she said, \u0027and so weak.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And we can do something all those Sterries together can\u0027t do,\u0027 he reminded her. \u0027We can perpetuate our own kind.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What does it matter?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Optimen never die.\u0027 Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSVENGAARD waited for night and checked the area through the observation screens in his office before going down to the vat room. In spite of the fact that this was his hospital and he had a perfect right here, he was conscious of doing a forbidden thing. The significance of the interview at Central hadn\u0027t escaped him. The Optimen wouldn\u0027t like this, but he had to look in that vat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused in the darkness of the vat room, stood there near the door, realizing with a sense of detachment that he had never before seen in here without the full blaze of lights. There were only the glow bulbs behind gauges and telltales now -faint dots and circles of luminescence by which to orient himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thrap-thrap-thrap of viapumps created an odd contrapuntal rhythm which filled the gloom with a sense of urgency. Svengaard imagined all the embryos in there (twenty-one at the morning count) their cells reaching\u0027 out, doubling and redoubling and re-redoubling in the strange ecstasy of growth -becoming unique, distinct, discrete individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot for them the contraceptive gas that permeated Folk breathing spaces. Not yet. Now, they could grow almost as their ancestors had grown before the genetic engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard sniffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nostrils, instinctively alerted by the darkness, sensed the amniotic saltiness of the air. From its odor, this room could almost have been a primal seashore with life burgeoning in its ooze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard shuddered and reminded himself, I\u0027m a sub-molecular engineer, a gene surgeon. There\u0027s nothing strange here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the thought failed to convince him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed himself away from the door, headed down the line looking for the vat with the Durant embryo. In his mind lay the clear memory of what he had seen in that embryo - the intrusion that had flooded the cells with arginine. Intrusion. Where had it originated? Was Potter correct? Was it an unknown creator of stability? Stability... order... systems. Extended systems... infinite aspects of energy that left all matter insubstantial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese suddenly were frightening thoughts here in the whispering gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stumbled against a low instrument stand, cursed softly. His stomach felt tight with the urgency of the viapumps and the real urgency in the fact that he had to finish here before the duty nurse made her hourly rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn insect shape, shadow against shadows, stood out against the wall in front of him. He froze and it took a moment for him to recognize the familiar outlines of the meson microscope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard turned to the luminous numbers on the vats -twelve, thirteen, fourteen... fifteen. Here it was. He checked the name on the tag, reading it in the glow of a gauge bulb:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Durant.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about this embryo had the Optimen upset and Security in an uproar. His regular computer nurse was gone -where, nobody could say. The replacement walked like a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard wheeled out the microscope, moving gently in the darkness, positioned the instrument over the vat, made the connections by feel. The vat throbbed against his fingers. He rigged for scanning, bent to the viewer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp out of the swarming cellular mass came a hydrophilic gene segment. He centered on it, the darkness forgotten as he pushed his awareness into the scope-lighted field of the viewer. Meson probes slid down... down into the mitochondrial structure. He found the alphahelices and began checking out polypeptide chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA puzzled frown creased his brow. He switched to another cell. Another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cells were low in arginine - he could see that. Thoughts brushed their way through his mind as he peered and hunted, How could the Durant embryo, of all embryos, be low on arginine? Any normal male would have more sperm protamine than this. How could the ADP-ATP exchange system carry no hint of Optiman? The cut wouldn\u0027t make this much difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, Svengaard sent his probes down into the sex identifiers, scanned the overlapping helices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFemale!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightened, checked number and tag, \u0027Fifteen. Durant.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard bent to the inspection chart, read it in the gauge glow. It showed the duty nurse\u0027s notations for the eighty-first hour. He glanced at his watch: still twenty minutes before she made the eighty-second hour check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Durant embryo could not possibly be female, he thought Not from Potter\u0027s operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had switched embryos,\u0027 he realized. One embryo would activate the vat\u0027s life- system responses much like another. Without microscopic examination, the change couldn\u0027t be detected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Svengaard\u0027s mind, the most likely candidates were the Optimen. They\u0027d removed the Durant embryo to a safe place and left a substitute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBait, he thought. Bait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho are they trying to catch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightened, mouth dry, heart pumping rapidly. A sound at the wall to his left brought him whirling around. The vat room\u0027s emergency computer panel had come to life, tapes beginning to turn, lights winking. A read-out board clattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no operator!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvengaard whirled to run from the room, collided with a blocky, unmoving shape. Arms and hands gripped him with unmerciful pressure and he saw beyond his captor a section of the vat room wall open with dim light there and movement. Then darkness exploded in his skull. Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEATAC HOSPITAL\u0027S new computer nurse got Max Allgood on the phone after only a short delay while Security traced him. Allgood\u0027s eyes appeared sunken. His mouth was pulled into a thin line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes?\u0027 he said. \u0027Oh, it\u0027s you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Something important\u0027s come up,\u0027 she said. \u0027Svengaard\u0027s in the vat room examining the Durant embryo under microscope.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood rolled his eyes. \u0027Oh, for the love... Is that why you got me out of... is that why you called me?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But there was a noise and you said-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Forget it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I tell you there was a commotion of some kind in that room and now Doctor Svengaard\u0027s gone. I didn\u0027t see him go.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He probably left by another door.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There is no other door.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Look, sweetie, I have half a hundred agents there covering that room like a blanket. A fly couldn\u0027t move in that room without our scanners picking it up.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen check with them to see where Svengaard\u0027s gone.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, for-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Check!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All right!\u0027 Allgood turned to his hot line, got the duty agent. The computer nurse could hear him through her open line. \u0027Where\u0027s Svengaard?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muffled voice responded, \u0027Just went in and examined the Durant embryo under the microscope, then left.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Went out the door?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just walked out.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood\u0027s face came back onto the computer nurse\u0027s screen. \u0027You hear that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I heard, but I\u0027ve been down at the end of the hall ever since he went in. He didn\u0027t come out.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You probably turned your back for five seconds.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ll...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You did, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I may\u0027ve looked away just for a second, but-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So you missed him.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But I heard a commotion in there!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If there was anything wrong, my men would\u0027ve reported it. Now, forget this. Svengaard\u0027s no problem. They said he\u0027d probably do this and we could ignore it. They\u0027re never wrong about such things.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If you\u0027re sure.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m sure.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Say, why are we so interested in that embryo?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You don\u0027t need to know, sweetie. Get back to work and let me get some sleep.\u0027 She broke the connection, still wondering about the noise she had heard. It sounded like something being hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood sat staring at the blank screen after the nurse signed off. Noise? Commotion? He formed a circle with his mouth, exhaled slowly. Crazy damn\u0027 female!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, he stood up, turned back to his bed. The doxie playmate he\u0027d brought in for the night lay there in the rosy light of a gloom dispeller, half awake, looking at him. Her eyes under long lashes filled him with sudden rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Get the hell out of here!\u0027 he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat upright in the bed, wide awake, staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Out!\u0027 he said, pointing to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tumbled out of bed, grabbed her clothing and ran out the door, a flash of pink flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly when she\u0027d gone did Allgood realize who she\u0027d remind. ed him of - Calapine, a dull Calapine. He wondered at himself then. The Cyborg had said the adjustments they made, the instruments they\u0027d implanted, would help him control his emotions, permit him to lie with impunity even to Optimen. This outburst now - it frightened him. He stared down at one of his slippers abandoned on the gray rug, its mate vanished somewhere. He kicked the slipper, began pacing back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was wrong. He could feel it. He\u0027d lived almost four hundred lovely years, most of them in Optiman service. He had a well-trained instinct for rightness and wrongness. It was survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad the Cyborg lied to him? Was he being used for some trick of their own?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stumbled over the slipper, ignored it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoise. Commotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a low curse, he returned to the hot line, got his duty agent. The man\u0027s face on the screen looked like an infant\u0027s - puffy lips and big, eager eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Go down to that vat room and inspect it,\u0027 Allgood said. The fine tooth. Look for signs of a commotion.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But if anybody sees us-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Damn it to hell! Do as I say !\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, sir!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agent clicked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllgood threw off his robe, all thought of sleep forgotten, ran through a quick shower and began dressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was wrong. He could feel it. Before leaving his quarters he put out a call to have Svengaard picked up and brought in for questioning. Ten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBY eight A.M., the streets and speedwalks of Seatac\u0027s industrial district-north swarmed with machine and foot traffic - the jostling impersonals of people following the little strung- out channels of their private concerns. Weather control had said the day would be held to a comfortable seventy-eight Fahrenheit with no clouds. An hour from now as the day settled into its working tempo, traffic would become more sparse. Dr Potter had seen the city at that pace many times, but he had never before been immersed in the shift-break swarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was aware that the Parents Underground had chosen this time for its natural concealment. He and his guide were just two more impersonals here. Who would notice them? This didn\u0027t subtract, though, from his fascinated interest in a scene that was new to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA big female Sterrie in the green-white striped uniform of a machine-press operator in the heavy industry complex pushed past him. She looked to Potter like a B2022419 G8 cut with cream skin and heavy features. In a gold loop in her right ear she wore a dancing doll breeder fetish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost in lock step behind her trotted a short man with hunched-up shoulders carrying a short brass rod. He flashed an impish grin at Potter as they passed, as much as to say: \u0027Here\u0027s the only way to get through a crowd like this.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotter\u0027s guide turned Potter aside onto the step-down walk and then into a side street. The guide was an enigma to Potter, who couldn\u0027t place the cut. The man wore a plain brown service suit, coveralls. He appeared reasonably normal except for a pale, almost sickly skin. His deeply set eyes glittered almost like lenses. A skull cap concealed his hair except for a few dark brown strands that looked almost artificial. His hands when they touched Potter to guide him felt cold and faintly repellent. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-eyes-of-heisenberg/page-9.html","bookId":2174,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:55 PM"}
