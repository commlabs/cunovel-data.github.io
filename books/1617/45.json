Rollo\u0027s bolstering smile and kind words had betrayed him as a true friend to Haley. And though chances were good the stoic would never demonstrate as much again, she\u0027d always have memories of this thoughtfulness as proof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a quiet smile and nodding, turned to face Finola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire danced behind the witch, the flames blazing whiter and hotter than a bonfire should. It cast Finola\u0027s face in blackness, made her seem larger than life. Long shadows cut along the dirt, reaching toward Haley, and their blackness subsumed her feet, her calves. She wondered if the chill prickling in their wake was merely imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinola\u0027s sinewy arm stretched toward her, fingers reaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley took a deep breath. She was terrified now. But there was no other choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her head, looking once more at Rollo. She wanted a nod, one last smile, some reassurance that this was going to be all right. But he merely locked eyes with hers, his gaze sympathetic. He\u0027d lend her strength, but Haley was alone now. She alone could make this choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlexing her fingers, she turned back to Finola and let the witch take her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sharp inhale, the woman\u0027s head snapped back. Her face pointed to the sky, and despite the dimness of the moon, the whites of her eyes glowed eerily bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley heard humming, so low at first, it seemed to originate from inside her own head. It grew louder, and she realized the sound came from Finola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch was in a trancelike state, muttering. The susurration gradually coalesced into words, growing louder and louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers seized, clawing Haley\u0027s skin. Haley gave an instinctive tug, but the woman\u0027s grip only tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled Haley to the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod help me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could stop it all now. Live her life, find her own little island and make do from that moment on. This seemed…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewrong. A dark thing, an evil thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla. Turning back now would mean good-bye forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley rolled her shoulders back. The only way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped slowly, letting Finola lead her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStopping before the fire, the witch dropped Haley\u0027s hand suddenly. Backed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she began to dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinola whirled around, the sleeves of her robes fluttering over and through the fire as she spun like a dervish around the blaze. Nonsensical staccato sounds popped from her mouth, bits of spittle landing with a hiss in the fire. The flames licked at her cloak now, but rather than catching fire, it only glowed brighter, whiter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman opened her mouth wide, a black maw in the darkness. A horrific cry erupted, a sharp, steady ululation sounding her dance around the flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley clutched her skirts in her fists. No choice, no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch stopped short. Pulled something from her robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the painting. Magda\u0027s painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thrust it into Haley\u0027s hands. Firelight licked the edges of the portrait, illuminating the face of Magda\u0027s dead brother. He looked up at her, so innocent, with bright red hair and a slight smile curving his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuilt stabbed her. It seemed an abomination. As if she were somehow sullying the memory of this boy. Peter, was it? An image of innocence, defiled by this witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed Haley\u0027s hand once more. Finola\u0027s fingers were cold now, icy and dry, the skin of her fingertips thin, like an old woman\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinola took Haley\u0027s hand and rubbed it over the portrait. The paint smudged with the pressure and Peter\u0027s image blurred. He was a surreal face now, still looking up at her, the memory of that once-captured innocence an indictment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla. MacColla, what am I doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda had given Haley the painting. It was her only hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda had known what this meant. No guilt. No choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda would want it this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny splinters bit into her palm. Haley\u0027s reflex was to pull back, but Finola\u0027s grip was like steel. She intoned, Gaoth o\u0027n rionnaig Earraich Teas o \u0027n rionnaig Shamhraidh, Uisg\u0027o\u0027n rionnaig Fhogair, Reothadh o\u0027n rionnaig Gheamhraidh. Wind from the Spring Star, Heat from the Summer Star, Water from the Autumn Star, Frost from the Winter Star. Hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last resonated long and low through the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch took Haley\u0027s finger and used it like an instrument, forming strange, abstract shapes along the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooseflesh shivered along her body like ice. What the…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stole a backward glance at Rollo, standing in the shadows, watching. The way he stiffened, putting his hand to his sword, spoke to the terror in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must. Haley gave him a small nod, and turned her head from him for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The hero sleeps in his tomb,” Finola chanted. Her hand dragged Haley\u0027s finger faster, mercilessly etching out shapes along the wooden panel. “The hero chose a path to doom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the tackiness of her own blood on its surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A hero\u0027s cairn, and fates that were. The star road, to him, take her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though Haley knew her head was immobile, it felt as if it whipped back and forward again. Vertigo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrenalin kicked in, making her hyperaware of every sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take her, take her.” The witch\u0027s voice was low now. An inhuman rumbling that seemed to come from the trees all around, from the lake water, from the sky above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Think her on her love. Become one with stars above.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? Was she supposed to be thinking about MacColla? Finola hadn\u0027t given her instructions. She tried to speak, but her tongue was thick and dead in her mouth. Wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she need to think something specific to go back to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To dissolve into skies. To save him who dies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vertigo seized her again, and this time didn\u0027t let go, propelling a dull click-click in her head, spinning, spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flames at her back felt suddenly cold, her lungs breathing the smoke of dry ice, not fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley was chilled, her body bloodless and insubstantial, and her heart fluttered lighter and lighter, until she thought it a hummingbird set to flit from her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod help me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take her. Take her. Take her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe humming stopped, and she sagged abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt sapped, saddened. She was steeped in heightened emotion, felt thick with it. Didn\u0027t it work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whirling in her head subsided and she struggled, her eyelids fluttering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt hands holding her. Warm hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRollo? Had she collapsed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley shuddered a de ep inhale. Managed to give her head a shake. Opened her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood before MacColla, her chin in his hands. “This is farewell, leannan,” he told her. “Do you not have a kiss for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley shrieked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leapt up and into MacColla\u0027s arms, wrapping her legs around his waist, clawing her hands in his hair. She felt thick black hanks of it tug tight at his scalp, but she didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had her MacColla back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley kissed him deeply, opening her mouth wide to him, her tongue delving deep, savoring him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled away. “Laces,” she said frantically, reaching behind her back to undo the bodice of her dress. “Help me. The laces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla laughed. “Oh, leannan.” He put her down and spun her, tugging hard at the ties. She felt cool air hit her shoulders, then her back, as he pulled the gown down hard. “Had I known what a simple request would do” - he nibbled and licked along the line of her shoulders - “I\u0027d have been asking you more politely from the start.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quiet,” she commande d, turning to face him. “Just kiss me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye,” he said huskily. His good humor was gone, leaving his eyes hungry, hooded. He took her mouth roughly with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapping an arm around her waist, he whisked her backward. They stumbled over the long musket he \u0027d given her, abruptly parting their kiss. “Careful,” he said quickly, holding her from falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.” She glanced down and back up again. “My trusty musket,” she said sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her a moment, brows furrowed in amusement and confusion . “Och, woman, \u0027tis time for you to quiet yourself and kiss me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla seized her mouth once more. He shuffled them briskly backward, pushing her hard against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stone was cold and rough on her naked back, and she welcomed the reminder that she was alive. That he was alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley tugged at his clothes, his belt and empty shoulder scabbard fell with a clatter to the ground, followed by the heavy sound of his plaid cascading to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed the gown from her hips and their clothing was a tangle at their feet. Frustrated, she kicked wildly at all the layers of fabric, eliciting a husky laugh from MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easy.” he muttered, squatting down to sweep the pile away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t easy me!” she snapped. “You have no idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hm?” He began to stand again, but when she tangled her fingers roughly in his hair, he squatted again, kneeling before her, a husky laugh in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla slid his large hands around the backs of her thighs and gave a squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh… ” she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nach tu a tha bòidheach,” he murmured. “You\u0027re so beautiful, mo leannan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley looked down, and the sight of him, staring up at her with such pure want in his eyes, sent a shock of desire through her core. She felt herself grow wet, expansive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re alive,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to tremble as MacColla turned his focus to her body. His mouth hovered just above her skin, just almost kissing her. “Cho maiseach ris a\u0027 ghrèin” His breath was hot on her belly, her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauty like the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered, feeling those rough palms caressing her legs, stroking around to cup her ass, up her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your hands,” she whispered. His fingers spanned her, so long and strong. “I missed your hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought both palms to rest on her stomach. His thumbs edged down, rubbing along the inside of her legs, tracing the vee of her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer knees buckled, and with a rasp of a laugh, he moved quickly to catch her, leaning his body in close to hold her up against the wall. Weak, Haley rested her hands on his shoulders, giving him more of her weight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-45.html","bookId":1617,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM"}
