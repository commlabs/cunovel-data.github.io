Hot breath tickles the back of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Orpheus sang his way in,” hisses the shadow on her left, the green-eyed. “Do you have a song for us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSephie shakes her head. Even if she could carry a tune, her voice is caught in her throat and she can’t remember the words to any song she knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s bleeding,” the golden-eyed beast whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSephie flexes her right hand; crusted blood cracks on her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So she is.” The silver eyes lean in. “Living blood. It’s been a long time since we’ve tasted that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe holds up her hand. “Is this enough? Will this pay our way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green-eyed sister hisses. “Ghoul blood is cold and dusty. I want something sweeter. Perhaps . . . ” Something cool and scaly touches Sephie’s cheek and she fights a flinch. “A young girl’s tears. Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sephie—” Caleb’s voice drifts through the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be silent, little ghost. This is her bargain to make.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong clawed fingers catch her right hand, pull it down. Hot breath stings the cuts. She clenches her fist, reopening the wounds. The pain of tearing scabs makes her gasp, makes her eyes water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blood and tears, fine. Take them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerpents writhe against her face, tongues flickering toward her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we all may name a price,” the silver-eyed woman says, “then I want a kiss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSephie closes her eyes. Moisture beads on her lashes, and the snakes lick it away. The beast’s tongue laps her hand, hot and rough, rasping against the cuts. “Fine,” she whispers. “Just do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand cups her cheek, cold and lifeless, tilts her chin up. The woman’s mouth closes on hers. Silk-dry lips, icy tongue, teeth like icicles. She tries to breathe, but the kiss steals the air from her lungs, steals the heat from her veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can take it all, the woman’s voice whispers deep in the whorls of her brain. All your pain, all your fear. Even your debt. We can take everything, and you’ll be free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s truly crying now, crying and bleeding and gasping for air. Snakes in her eyes, teeth piercing her hand, and that tongue in her mouth, leeching her dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does that leave for me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing. You’ll have nothing, be nothing, want nothing. And nothing will ever hurt you again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe can’t answer, can’t feel her limbs or her tongue. Caleb is shouting somewhere far away, calling her name. But she can’t answer, because she’s falling into the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dark doesn’t want her, spits her out again, and she wakes with a gasp. Cold, so cold, and she can’t stop shivering. Caleb holds her; he’s warmer than she is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?” she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re gone. I thought you were, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sits up, rubs her stinging eyes. Her right hand is shredded, like she was mauled by a dog, but none of the wounds are bleeding. Her chest aches, and it’s hard to get enough breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are the ghosts?” she asks, glancing around the empty cavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They went on, into the forest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully she stands, leaning on Caleb. He feels more solid now, more real. Or maybe she’s less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on. Let’s find the garden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA path leads into the trees, like the sisters promised. Birds and insects sing in the darkness, and animals move through the underbrush. The peach-golden moon is high overhead, dripping light through the canopy, turning all the leaves to amber and jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trail takes them straight to the garden wall, and this time, the gate is easy to find. Curling iron, the bars wrapped thick with vines and flowers. One side stands open, and the werewolves are waiting for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Sephie isn’t afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, children,” one beast says. After the guardians in the cave, its growling voice is welcoming, kind. “We wondered when you would find the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind drifts past them, flutters Sephie’s hair. The smell of the garden eases some of the aching cold inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns to Caleb. His color is better, and as she watches, the constant dripping blood slows, dries. An instant later the wound is healed, leaving nothing but tangled dark curls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer wounds are still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come with me,” he says, stroking her hair. “Stay with me. We’ll be all right here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leans against him, hears the whisper of a heartbeat in his chest. So tired. Not scared anymore—now she’s just numb. It would be so nice to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb bends down and she lifts her head for a kiss, a kiss to warm her frozen lips, to ease the memory of the cave. It could be like this here, like it was before things went so wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill Seth wonder what happened to her? Will Anna? Will they worry? She won’t be hungry here, won’t owe anything to anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll take care of you,” Caleb whispers, his stubble scratching her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stiffens, turns her head aside. “You never could do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I tried to be what you wanted . . . ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never should have asked.” She pulls away, runs her fingers over his cheek. “I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s up there for you? What’s worth going back to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. But it’s something. It’s my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sephie—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goodbye, Caleb.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilts her head toward the gate, and the waiting monsters. “Go on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes a hesitant step toward the garden. She waves once in farewell, then turns away. She doesn’t look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cavern is empty. No one challenges her as she climbs the black and winding stair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway up, her hand starts to hurt again, and then to bleed. Not long after, she begins to cry. When she reaches the top of the steps, her chest burns, and all her weary muscles ache. But she’s not afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Sephie opens the door, the weight of her debt settles heavy on her shoulders. She pauses on the threshold, breathes in the garden’s scent again. Then she steps into the light and noise and stink of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBLAMED FOR TRYING TO LIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJESSE BULLINGTON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe summer after Charles’s mother died he decided to become a werewolf. Not really, of course, he wasn’t crazy, even after the murder and moving to a city that was as hot and wet as the inside of a mouth, every breeze like warm breath in his face, every afternoon the clouds sneezing warm rain; he wasn’t crazy and he wasn’t a kid who believed everything he read or saw in a movie. He was really, really bored, though, and he didn’t have any friends, and one of his library books on werewolves had a six page chapter on how people turned into them, and with the start of tenth grade still a month away Charles figured in the name of science he should put the book to the test. He knew nothing would come of it, not really, but he’d never drunk water from a wolf’s pawprint or dealt with the Devil, either, so who knew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he had hit on the plan back when they were making him see the two psychologists he wouldn’t have mentioned it, obviously, but he knew what the shrinks would probably have said. The older one would think that Charles’s ambition came from an urge to protect himself and his remaining family, and the younger one would have told him that lycanthropy was his way of metaphorically dealing with his post-puberty anxiety. They were both, in Charles’ estimation, dumb as balls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Jenkins said Rickards is an urban high school,” Charles had told Mr. Matherne, his A.P. history teacher and an old friend of his mother’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jenkins dropped the U on you, huh?” Mr. Matherne shook his head the way he always did when Mr. Jenkins came up, as though the principal’s name was a fly buzzing around his ears. “You know what that means, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ghetto,” Charles and Mr. Matherne said in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won’t be easy, being the only vegan in the ghetto,” said Mr. Matherne, and that was the double truth, Ruth. Charles’s dad didn’t buy that shit, and his gramma, while she tried, didn’t understand, and so the only people he knew who really understood what the V-word meant were back in Baltimore. Person, Charles would correct himself, person, because even back home he’d never told his friends when he restarted his vegan clock, and while Mr. Matherne was still embedded in 4A waging his one man war against ignorance, Charles’s mom was gone, even if her bones weren’t going anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouthside was the ghetto, too, Charles soon realized, even worse than the Frenchtown neighborhood that lay bunched up on the far side of the public library. Lie-berry, his gramma pronounced it, and Charles winced every time. For an “urban” area there were a lot of dirt roads linking the narrow paved streets, actual dirt roads shaded by the huge live oaks that peppered Tallahassee, as if the rednecks who had built the place didn’t know the meaning of the word city. The shotgun shack Charles moved into with his dad and gramma was over a mile from the library but three blocks from the nearest liquor store, two if you took the path through the kudzu-smothered vacant lot next door. That’s a ghetto, all right, Mr. Matherne had agreed in his last email to Charles, watch out for drive-bys. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/running-with-the-pack/page-51.html","bookId":2622,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:49 PM"}
