I thought maybe I could find the location of Enrico Dandolo’s tomb.” She hurried over to the light well and held the phone high overhead near the glass, trying to get a signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnrico Dandolo, Langdon thought, having barely had a chance to consider the doge before having to flee the area. Despite their current predicament, their visit to St. Mark’s had indeed served its purpose—revealing the identity of the treacherous doge who severed the heads from horses … and plucked up the bones of the blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, Langdon had no idea where Enrico Dandolo’s tomb was located, and apparently neither did Ettore Vio. He knows every inch of this basilica … probably of the Doge’s Palace, too. The fact that Ettore hadn’t immediately located Dandolo’s tomb suggested to Langdon that the tomb was probably nowhere near St. Mark’s or the Doge’s Palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo where is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon glanced over at Sienna, who was now standing on a pew that she had moved under one of the light wells. She unlatched the window, swung it open, and held Ferris’s phone out into the open air of the shaft itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outdoor sounds of St. Mark’s Square filtered down from above, and Langdon suddenly wondered if maybe there was some way out of here after all. There was a line of folding chairs behind the pews, and Langdon sensed that he might be able to hoist one up into the light well. Maybe the upper grates unlatch from inside as well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon hurried through the darkness toward Sienna. He had taken only a few steps when a powerful blow to his forehead knocked him backward. Crumpling to his knees, he thought for an instant that he had been attacked. He had not, he quickly realized, cursing himself for not anticipating that his six-foot frame far exceeded the height of vaults built for the average human height of more than a thousand years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he knelt there on the hard stone and let the stars clear, he found himself gazing at an inscription on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanctus Marcus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at it a long moment. It was not St. Mark’s name in the inscription that struck him but rather the language in which it was written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLatin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his daylong immersion in modern Italian, Langdon found himself vaguely disoriented to see St. Mark’s name written in Latin, a quick reminder that the dead language was the lingua franca of the Roman Empire at the time of St. Mark’s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a second thought hit Langdon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the early thirteenth century—the time of Enrico Dandolo and the Fourth Crusade—the language of power was still very much Latin. A Venetian doge who had brought great glory to the Roman Empire by recapturing Constantinople would never have been buried under the name of Enrico Dandolo … instead his Latin name would have been used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenricus Dandolo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, a long-forgotten image struck him like a jolt of electricity. Although the revelation had come while he was kneeling in a chapel, he knew it was not divinely inspired. More likely, it was nothing more than a visual cue that sparked his mind to make a sudden connection. The image that leaped suddenly from the depths of Langdon’s memory was that of Dandolo’s Latin name … engraved in a worn marble slab, embedded in an ornate tile floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenricus Dandolo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon could barely breathe as he pictured the doge’s simple tomb marker. I’ve been there. Precisely as the poem had promised, Enrico Dandolo was indeed buried in a gilded museum—a mouseion of holy wisdom—but it was not St. Mark’s Basilica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the truth settled in, Langdon clambered slowly to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t get a signal,” Sienna said, climbing down from the light well and coming toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t need one,” Langdon managed. “The gilded mouseion of holy wisdom …” He took a deep breath. “I … made a mistake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna went pale. “Don’t tell me we’re in the wrong museum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sienna,” Langdon whispered, feeling ill. “We’re in the wrong country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 76\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in St. Mark’s Square, the Gypsy woman selling Venetian masks was taking a break, leaning against the outer wall of the basilica to rest. As always, she had claimed her favorite spot—a small niche between two metal grates in the pavement—an ideal spot to set down her heavy wares and watch the setting sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had witnessed many things in St. Mark’s Square over the years, and yet the bizarre event that now drew her attention was not transpiring in the square … it was happening instead beneath it. Startled by a loud sound at her feet, the woman peered down through a grate into a narrow well, maybe ten feet deep. The window at the bottom was open and a folding chair had been shoved out into the bottom of the well, scraping against the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the Gypsy’s surprise, the chair was followed by a pretty woman with a blond ponytail who was apparently being hoisted from within and was now clambering through the window into the tiny opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond woman scrambled to her feet and immediately looked up, clearly startled to see the Gypsy staring down at her through the grate. The blond woman raised a finger to her lips and gave a tight smile. Then she unfolded the chair and climbed onto it, reaching up toward the grate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re far too short, the Gypsy thought. And just what are you doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond woman climbed back down off the chair and spoke to someone inside the building. Although she barely had room to stand in the narrow well beside the chair, she now stepped aside as a second person—a tall, dark-haired man in a fancy suit—heaved himself up out of the basilica basement and into the crowded shaft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe, too, looked up, making eye contact with the Gypsy through the iron grate. Then, in an awkward twist of limbs, he exchanged positions with the blond woman and climbed up on top of the rickety chair. He was taller, and when he reached up, he was able to unlatch the security bar beneath the grate. Standing on tiptoe, he placed his hands on the grate and heaved upward. The grate rose an inch or so before he had to set it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Può darci una mano?” the blond woman called up to the Gypsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive you a hand? the Gypsy wondered, having no intention of getting involved. What are you doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond woman pulled out a man’s wallet and extracted a hundred-euro bill, waving it as an offering. It was more money than the vendor made with her masks in three days. No stranger to negotiation, she shook her head and held up two fingers. The blond woman produced a second bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisbelieving of her good fortune, the Gypsy shrugged a reluctant yes, trying to look indifferent as she crouched down and grabbed the bars, looking into the man’s eyes so they could synchronize their efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the man heaved again, the Gypsy pulled upward with arms made strong from years of carrying her wares, and the grate swung upward … halfway. Just as she thought they had it, there was a loud crash beneath her, and the man disappeared, plummeting back down into the well as the folding chair collapsed beneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe iron grate grew instantly heavier in her hands, and she thought she would have to drop it, but the promise of two hundred euros gave her strength, and she managed to heave the grate up against the side of the basilica, where it came to rest with a loud clang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathless, the Gypsy peered down into the well at the twist of bodies and broken furniture. As the man got back up and brushed himself off, she reached down into the well, holding out her hand for her money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ponytailed woman nodded appreciatively and raised the two bills over her head. The Gypsy reached down, but it was too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive the money to the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly there was a commotion in the shaft—angry voices shouting from inside the basilica. The man and woman both spun in fear, recoiling from the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen everything turned to chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark-haired man took charge, crouching down and firmly ordering the woman to place her foot into a cradle formed by his fingers. She stepped in, and he heaved upward. She skimmed up the side of the shaft, stuffing the bills in her teeth to free her hands as she strained to reach the lip. The man heaved, higher … higher … lifting her until her hands curled over the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith enormous effort, she heaved herself up into the square like a woman climbing out of a swimming pool. She shoved the money into the Gypsy’s hands and immediately spun around and knelt at the edge of the well, reaching back down for the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowerful arms in long black sleeves were reaching into the well like the thrashing tentacles of some hungry monster, grasping at the man’s legs, pulling him back toward the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Run, Sienna!” shouted the struggling man. “Now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gypsy saw their eyes lock in an exchange of pained regret … and then it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was dragged roughly down through the window and back into the basilica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond woman stared down in shock, her eyes welling with tears. “I’m so sorry, Robert,” she whispered. Then, after a pause, she added, “For everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, the woman sprinted off into the crowd, her ponytail swinging as she raced down the narrow alleyway of the Merceria dell’Orologio … disappearing into the heart of Venice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 77\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soft sounds of lapping water eased Robert Langdon gently back to consciousness. He smelled the sterile tang of antiseptics mixed with salty sea air and felt the world swaying beneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere am I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly moments before, it seemed, he had been locked in a death struggle against powerful hands that were dragging him out of the light well and back into the crypt. Now, strangely, he no longer felt the cold stone floor of St. Mark’s beneath him … instead he felt a soft mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon opened his eyes and took in his surroundings—a small, hygienic-looking room with a single portal window. The rocking motion continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m on a boat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon’s last recollection was of being pinned to the crypt floor by one of the black-clad soldiers, who hissed angrily at him, “Stop trying to escape!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had shouted wildly, calling for help as the soldiers tried to muffle his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to get him out of here,” one soldier had said to another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis partner gave a reluctant nod. “Do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt powerful fingertips expertly probing the arteries and veins on his neck. Then, having located a precise spot on the carotid, the fingers began applying a firm, focused pressure. Within seconds, Langdon’s vision began to blur, and he felt himself slipping away, his brain being starved of oxygen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’re killing me, Langdon thought. Right here beside the tomb of St. Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blackness came, but it seemed incomplete … more of a wash of grays punctuated by muted shapes and sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had little sense of how much time had passed, but the world was now starting to come back into focus for him. From all he could tell, he was in an onboard infirmary of some sort. His sterile surroundings and the scent of isopropyl alcohol created a strange sense of déjà vu—as if Langdon had come full circle, awakening as he had the previous night, in a strange hospital bed with only muted memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thoughts turned instantly to Sienna and her safety. He could still see her soft brown eyes gazing down at him, filled with remorse and fear. Langdon prayed that she had escaped and would find her way safely out of Venice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re in the wrong country, Langdon had told her, having realized to his shock the actual location of Enrico Dandolo’s tomb. The poem’s mysterious mouseion of holy wisdom was not in Venice after all … but a world away. Precisely as Dante’s text had warned, the cryptic poem’s meaning had been hidden “beneath the veil of verses so obscure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had intended to explain everything to Sienna as soon as they’d escaped the crypt, but he’d never had the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran off knowing only that I failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt a knot tighten in his stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plague is still out there … a world away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom outside the infirmary, he heard loud boot steps in the hall, and Langdon turned to see a man in black entering his berth. It was the same muscular soldier who had pinned him to the crypt floor. His eyes were ice cold. Langdon’s instinct was to recoil as the man approached, but there was nowhere to run. Whatever these people want to do to me, they can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where am I?” Langdon demanded, putting as much defiance into his voice as he could muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On a yacht anchored off Venice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon eyed the green medallion on the man’s uniform—a globe of the world, encircled by the letters ECDC. Langdon had never seen the symbol or the acronym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need information from you,” the soldier said, “and we don’t have much time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would I tell you anything?” Langdon asked. “You almost killed me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not even close. We used a judo demobilization technique called shime waza. We had no intention of harming you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shot at me this morning!” Langdon declared, clearly recalling the clang of the bullet on the fender of Sienna’s speeding Trike. “Your bullet barely missed the base of my spine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man’s eyes narrowed. “If I had wanted to hit the base of your spine, I would have hit it. I took a single shot trying to puncture your moped’s rear tire so I could stop you from running away. I was under orders to establish contact with you and figure out why the hell you were acting so erratically.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Langdon could fully process his words, two more soldiers came through the door, moving toward his bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking between them was a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn apparition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthereal and otherworldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon immediately recognized her as the vision from his hallucinations. The woman before him was beautiful, with long silver hair and a blue lapis lazuli amulet. Because she had previously appeared against a horrifying landscape of dying bodies, Langdon needed a moment to believe she was truly standing before him in the flesh. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inferno-robert-langdon-4/page-47.html","bookId":2415,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:25 AM"}
