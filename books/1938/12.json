Dolores Falk had loved her granddaughter deeply, and Anne Marie felt a responsibility to do as Dolores had requested. Anne Marie understood that Dolores’s love had protected the girl. Fortunately Ellen’s birth mother, Dolores’s daughter, who’d fallen into a life of drugs and crime, had surrendered all parental rights. This had made it possible for Anne Marie to adopt the child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeresa stuck her head in the off ice. “He’s back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLost in her thoughts, Anne Marie glanced up. “Who’s back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The one who came by when you and Ellen were in Paris,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeresa said, sounding a little impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Anne Marie hadn’t actually forgotten but she’d relegated the matter to the bottom of her list. “Has he asked to speak to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet, but I guarantee that’s what he’s here to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” Anne Marie pushed away from her desk and rose to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeresa remained standing in the doorway. She winked outrageously at Anne Marie, then lowered her voice. “He’s still hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Teresa! You’re a married woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer friend grinned from ear to ear. “True, but I’m not blind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie came around her desk and stepped quietly out of the off ice. Sure enough, a man stood at the counter, a man whose gaze went instantly to her face. Over the course of her life, men had often looked at her. She knew she was reasonably attractive and yet the look this man gave her expressed more than casual interest, more than mere appreciation. His gaze was intent, meaningful, even expectant. Anne Marie felt confused by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved behind the counter by the cash register. “Can I help you?” she asked, keeping her voice cool and yet polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you Anne Marie Roche?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am.” She wondered again why this strikingly handsome man was seeking her out. Most likely he was here to sell her insurance or to show her a new gift line. She’d never seen him before, so it couldn’t be anything personal. Which was just as well; attractive though he was, Anne Marie could only respond to him in an abstract way. Since Robert’s death, she hadn’t been interested in dating. And once Ellen entered her life, her entire world had begun to revolve around her daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis demeanor changed. His eyes narrowed ever so slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Tim Carlsen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was that about? If he was a salesman, he hadn’t bothered with a friendly approach. “Hello, Tim,” she said, refusing to allow him to intimidate her. “Can I help you with something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Teresa, who’d busied herself organizing a display of new children’s books. She did her best to pretend she wasn’t listening in on the conversation, although she couldn’t avoid hearing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I ask what this is about?” Anne Marie asked, trying again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps it would be better if we spoke privately,” Tim said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stiffened his shoulders. “Ellen,” he said quietly. “This is in regard to the child you’ve recently adopted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie felt the oxygen rush from her lungs. But rather than reveal her surprise, she gestured calmly toward her off ice. She felt paralyzed as she tried to f igure out what possible connection this man could have to her daughter. The birth certif icate hadn’t named a father, and yet…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the off ice, she took her seat behind the desk. Tim pulled up a chair across from her, not waiting for an invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know my daughter?” she asked, wanting to make sure he understood that no one else had any legal right to the child. Her visitor shook his head. “I’m sorry to say that I do not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, this information reassured Anne Marie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know about Ellen, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve only heard of her.” Tim stared at the f loor. “I’m a recovering alcoholic with eight years’ sobriety.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeard of her how? was the f irst thing she wanted to ask. But she had no idea how to respond to his confession, nor did she understand why he felt it was necessary to tell her such a personal fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Congratulations,” she said tentatively, “but what’s that got to do with Ellen or me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I met Candy Falk at probably the lowest point in my life,” he continued, ignoring her question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one needed to remind Anne Marie that Candy Falk was Ellen’s birth mother and a known drug addict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back then Candy and I were both using.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drugs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim nodded. “Drugs, all kinds of drugs, you name it. But also alcohol. It wasn’t a good time…. Like I said, it was a low point for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tingling spread down Anne Marie’s neck. Her suspicion had been correct. She was starting to connect the dots and she didn’t like the picture that was taking shape in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You still haven’t told me what any of this has to do with my daughter,” she said curtly. Ellen was part of Anne Marie’s life now. A very precious part, and she wasn’t about to let some man— some stranger—step in and make a claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Tim ignored her question. “Candy and I broke up, and my family arranged for me to enter rehab. I’ve been clean and sober ever since.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I follow the twelve steps and traditions of AA. With my sponsor’s support, I’ve begun making amends wherever possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s good of you, but I don’t see what any of this has to do with Ellen or me.” As far as Anne Marie was concerned, this conversation was over. She stood and motioned toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please sit down, Ms. Roche.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer resolve melted under the force of his gaze and Anne Marie slowly sank back into her chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As part of my attempt to make amends, I tried to locate Candy,” Tim said. “I couldn’t f ind her but I remembered where her mother used to live.” He looked away. “I needed her forgiveness, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dolores?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke in a clear, even voice. “Candy and I stole money from her mother and I wanted to return it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie swallowed. This was only a fraction, a tiny fraction, of the pain Candy Falk had brought into her mother’s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remembered the house where Candy had taken me, but it was empty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t seem to hear. “The neighbor was watering her rosebushes and we got to talking. She said Dolores had passed away some time ago and that her grandchild had been adopted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie didn’t comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I asked where Candy was, but the neighbor didn’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was information Anne Marie was willing to pass along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know, either. Someplace in California, I think. I understand she’s still an addict.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suspected as much,” he said with a grimace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s sad….” In case Tim hadn’t heard, she added, “Ellen’s aunt, Clarisse, is in prison.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, and there was a brief silence. “I asked the neighbor a few more questions,” he said a moment later, “and found out that Dolores had custody of a little girl—Candy’s daughter. When I inquired about the child, the neighbor told me Ellen was eight when her grandmother died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s nine now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim looked directly into her eyes. “It was almost ten years ago that Candy and I lived together. We…didn’t use any form of birth control. It hit me that there’s a possibility Ellen might be my daughter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was what Anne Marie had feared he was about to say. She was ending his visit right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re mistaken, Mr. Carlsen. Ellen couldn’t possibly be your daughter,” Anne Marie insisted. “Ellen is my child, and I have the paperwork to prove it.” Bolting to her feet once again, she planted her hands on the edge of her desk. “I think you should leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Tim didn’t move and his dark eyes burned into hers. “I understand this comes as a shock and I apologize for that. All I’m asking for is the truth. I want to know if I’m Ellen’s father. I don’t feel that’s an unreasonable request.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unfortunately, it is unreasonable. Ellen has been adopted by me. As I just explained, Ellen is my child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you adopted her did you receive parental consent?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie felt she owed him nothing more than the bare facts. “Your name isn’t on the birth certif icate and the state had no way of contacting you, even if it does turn out that you’re Ellen’s biological father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim’s features tightened. “I haven’t stopped thinking about her from the moment I heard Candy had a baby.” He ran his hand through his hair. “What you don’t know is that after we split and I was in rehab, Candy twice attempted to contact me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never read her letter or returned her phone call,” he said, interrupting her. “As far as I was concerned, she was bad news and involved in a life I no longer wanted to live. It’s stupid of me, I guess, but it never occurred to me that she might be pregnant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie spoke slowly, trying to ensure that everything was clear. “Candy Falk rescinded all parental rights. Nothing can be done to change this. It’s over and done with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I realize that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Then you also realize that you have no rights whatsoever with regard to Ellen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do have rights.” He obviously wasn’t willing to back down and glared at her unflinchingly. “If Ellen’s my child, and I have every reason to believe she is, then I want to know her. She has a right to know me, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie shook her head. “Whether Ellen is your biological daughter or not isn’t the issue. Ellen has another family now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another father?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you married?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s none of your business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I disagree. It’s very much my business. Perhaps I should speak with your husband,” Tim said. He seemed to think he was calling her bluff or, worse, that he’d be able to reason with another man. Either way, his suggestion infuriated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie paused, unwilling to admit that she was widowed. She saw that he’d noticed her silence and hurriedly added, “I’m sorry, that’s impossible just now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have no intention of taking Ellen away from you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nearly laughed out loud. “I’d like to see you try. As I keep telling you, Ellen is my child now, my daughter. Whether or not she’s related to you is beside the point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps it is to you. However, to me, it’s vital. If I’m Ellen’s biological father, I should at least have the opportunity to meet my own daughter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s too late for that,” Anne Marie said, refusing to bend. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-6/page-12.html","bookId":1938,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:45 AM"}
