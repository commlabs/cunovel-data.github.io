He bought this?” Was I that predicable? “What is he fucking psychic?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, “Sometimes I think he is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pursed my lips, “You sure it was for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, “Does it look like it belongs to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed her lips together and nodded, “Yeah, dumbass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at the tags I’d removed and winced, “He’s gonna know I took the tags off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled back the curtain, “You owe me ten bucks and a new pair of Christian Louboutin ankle boots.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fair enough,” I muttered and walked out of the room to the seats out front. I almost sat in a different one, but I remembered I was the one who was angry. I needed a reason. I sat down and looked at the plate of prawns and sauce in front of me. My stomach gurgled. I rubbed it and picked up a prawn by its tail. I dragged it through the still warm sauce and moaned when I took the first bite. “This is good, Roxy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned as she passed me, “You like it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “Wow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winked and walked to the front of the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored his existence and enjoyed my meal, as I broke off a piece of bread and dragged it through the sauce on the plate. The crusty bread was still warm. I moaned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cleared it and placed a plate of seared white fish, with a creamy sauce and roasted vegetables. The sauce was a lime and cilantro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When was the last time you ate a proper meal?” he finally spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged and drank from my wine glass. I knew when it was, but I wasn’t in the mood to admit the last thing I’d eaten was picks and nibbles of random foods. I wished I’d eaten the entire fruit salad at Fritz’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoped they were okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my clutch on the table. I would need to call when we landed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to take better care of yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him, “I need the stability back in my life. I need you and the CI, and CIA, and James to leave me alone. I was eating regularly before. I was drinking water and eating five meals a day and going to yoga. Now I’m hopping on planes and eating food from convenience stores, and I still don’t know that my kids and mom are safe, or if my husband is really dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me, “I knew you would look nice in that outfit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and turned back to my plate of food, gulping back the last of my second glass of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you angry with me? You think I caused all of this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving him my death stare and then letting it slide into indifference, I shrugged, “I don’t know what to believe. There are too many versions of you to possibly know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked, “You know me; you just don’t want to admit you like what you see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and turned back to my dinner. We landed just after Roxy cleared our food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged her as I left the plane, “I’ll get you those shoes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pinched, “You better not, but I want my ten bucks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and kissed her cheek, “Another magnificent meal. I don’t even know how you can get the fish so perfect on a plane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes, “You flatter and then I have to make sure it’s out of the park next time too.” I could see her eyeballing Servario nervously. He was stoic. I decided that should be his new name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “I doubt that will be an issue,” and followed Steve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis broad shoulders and thick back made me wonder how he stayed so fit. He seemed pretty lazy. He was probably one of those guys who stayed fit, no matter what they did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked to the SUV waiting for us. I had noticed we weren’t back in Boston. We flew into San Diego.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach was a ball of nerves. I looked a Servario, “I thought we were going home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a blank look, “When did I say that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to call my cat sitter and get her to drop by and feed the cat. I’ve been gone for days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched my face for a second, “Fine. Make it fast and speaker phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out the cellphone he gave me and dialed her, praying Coop traced my calls. I wanted him close in case this was a huge mistake and I needed an evac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?” she answered on the first ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beth, how are you? It’s, Evie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Evie, how are you doing? Are you okay?” she sounded sad still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, “I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are the kids?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “They’re good. Sad, but good. Anyway, the reason for my call is I need you to stop over and check on Ralph and make sure he’s okay. I’m in San Diego for a couple days. We’re in San Diego. We decided to take a trip and I forgot, in all the chaos, to call you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, of course. I’ll see him once a day and check on the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Servario, “That should be great. You have a key still, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes I do. Have a great trip out west!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, forgetting what I was doing, “Thanks sweetie. Say hello to your mom.” I hung up the phone and shook my head, “So weird. Her world is normal and mine is destroyed,” I muttered, before I could stop myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing. When the truck stopped, the door was opened. I climbed out, ignoring everything around me. I was overcome with the strangest feeling I’d had since my husband died/ran away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my hand and pulled me in a door. I caught a warm breeze, loaded with the smell of the ocean and frowned, “Are we at the beach?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me inside and closed the door. He looked at me, “Don’t try anything. They will hurt you, if you try to leave.” He pressed his lips against my forehead and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going?” I asked, like I had a right to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved, “Out for the night,” and vanished down a long wide corridor. I looked around at the splendor. Everything of his was beautiful. My home was amazing and in all the right areas, whereas his was all luxury. Luxury I was completely alone in and not in the mood to enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and walked into the large sitting area off the front room. A bottle of Apothic was already opened and poured into the carafe next to the empty bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI poured a glass, sighing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls were covered in art. It was rich and warm Spanish-styled home. It suited the sexy version of him I wanted to see again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slumped into a leather, burnt-orange sofa and drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Out for the night?” I muttered and pulled out my phone, tapping it against my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head game of being the one who was pissed off, didn’t work. He didn’t come crawling and beg to know why or brought me flowers. Of course seeing it now, the reason for James’ constant worry about my moods was obvious. He had a guilty conscience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood and grabbed the carafe and walked down the other hallway. I clicked on light switches, only to discover an array of stunning rooms. Finally, I reached a room with a large fireplace and fabric couches. I curled up on one with my wine and dialed 9-1-1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce answered, “Hey?” She looked worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a finger to my lips, “Hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned, “You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “Yeah. I just need answers. Did Fitz get away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked an eyebrow, “Yeah. He woke us up and dragged us to some safe house. We stayed for two hours, then got in a helicopter, and then a private jet. He dropped us in Boston.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt confusion all over my face, “Jet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, “Yeah. Jet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the background I heard Coop yelling. The phone went crazy and then refocused on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked savage, “What did I say, Evie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need answers, Coop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a face, “Don’t give me that shit. Fitz filled in a lot of blanks. We were getting somewhere. You fucking bailed, because you wanted to see him again and don’t bullshit me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “No, I swear. Fitz was never going to tell us anything useful. What more do we know? We know what the Burrow is and that’s it. We don’t know where it is, or who’s there, or what to do with the information. We still don’t have any resources.” I sighed and looked down shaking my head. His sentence hit my ears, “Wait, what? Did you say jet? Where the hell did Fitz get a jet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop’s look matched mine, “He hasn’t always had that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted, “Uh no. The buyout for people like us is about half the value of a pension.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused, “Weird. He seemed pretty comfy in it. The pilot knew him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wriggled my nose, “Was the pilot gay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop scoffed, “How the hell should I know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, “Ask Luce.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, “Yo, was that pilot gay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear her response, “Almost as gay as you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored their banter and replied, “He might be dating the owner. Gay people hire gay people, so they don’t get fired for being gay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned harder, “Gays don’t get fired for being gay, it’s not the fifties, Evie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my eyebrows, “Coop, a teacher got fired in Idaho last week, because her dead mother’s obituary had her partner’s name in it. She’s a lesbian.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw dropped, “Are you for real?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s sick. Okay, but back to brass tax. I’m coming to get you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winked, “This is what’s wrong with the world. Stay close; I’ll let you know when I’m ready to get picked up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled, “Try not to have too much fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, “I think you need to head back to Sweden for the week. You seem tense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flipped me the bird and I pressed it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped the phone and looked around the room. The huge wall-mounted TV looked like something I would be able to use, without too many problems. Of course, I had to search high and low for the remote. It took me twenty minutes to turn it on. I couldn’t get sound but I watched the picture. It was Casablanca. It was at the part where she walks into the bar and sees the piano player. I almost tear up, as I see her ask him to play the song they liked. Seeing the anger and the way Bogart storms across the bar to stop Sam from playing the song, makes me think of Servario. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-29.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
