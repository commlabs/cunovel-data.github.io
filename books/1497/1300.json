The figure emitted a rich ferocious aura. His appearance surprisingly resembled the expert from the Ancient Void Dragon tribe, whom Xiao Yan had met, Hei Qing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Old brother Hei Qing… why have you come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was also startled as this human figure suddenly appeared. His tone was filled with surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh, I have come to look for you regarding some matters. Those old fellows from the tribe have dispatched me to find you. Dammit! Fortunately, Zi Yan left a dragon seal on you. Otherwise, I really would have ended up looking for you until I died…” Hei Qing looked at Xiao Yan as though he had found his savior. He hurriedly rushed over and heaved a great sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look for me?” Xiao Yan knit his brows upon hearing this. What matter could lead an Ancient Void Dragon to him? Could it be…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has something happened to Zi Yan?” Xiao Yan’s eyes suddenly widened as he turned to Hei Qing and asked a question in a deep voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is not in trouble. However, there is something that requires your help… if you have the time, you should leave with me.” Hei Qing rubbed his head as he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan hesitated for a moment when he saw Hei Qing’s somewhat grave expression. After which, he nodded. It seemed that the matter was quite a big one. Otherwise, it would not cause an expert like Hei Qing to be this frantic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once I resolve the trouble here, I will take a trip with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there some trouble?” Hei Qing recovered only after hearing Xiao Yan’s words. He turned his head, took a look, and continued in a stunned manner, “It is that old soke Mo Yu from the Hall of Souls… do you remember this uncle Hei Qing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hei Qing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Tianzun was slightly startled. His expression was gloomy as he suddenly appeared to have remembered something. His expression changed a little as he exclaimed, “You are Hei Qing from the Ancient Void Dragon tribe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is the name ‘Hei Qing’ something that an old soke like you can say? With your position as the ninth, you do not possess the qualification to do so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHei Qing wrapped his arms in front of his chest. He curled his mouth and did not give any face to the ninth Tianzun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ninth Tianzun’s face became extremely dark and gloomy when he heard Hei Qing’s rude words. However, he did not reveal any fury because he clearly understood that this large man in front of him was an extremely troublesome fellow. Even he was no match for this person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This friend. This old self is an Elder of the Profound Sky Sect, Shenluo Guizun. This Xiao Yan is a person that my Profound Sky Sect intends to capture. I hope that this friend will not intervene.” The ninth Tianzun was aware of Hei Qing’s background, but Shenluo Guizun was not. After seeing Xiao Yan gradually fall into a disadvantage, how could they let him just flee, so Shenluo Guizun cupped his hands together and spoke in a deep voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Profound Sky Sect? What is this thing?” Hei Qing knit his brows. He waved his hand somewhat impatiently and said, “All of you should hurry up and get lost. I am looking for little brother Xiao Yan regarding some matters. Stop wasting this father’s damn time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShenluo Guizun and Yaohua Liangzun’s expressions changed after hearing Hei Qing’s vulgarities. They both furiously cried out, “You dare to disrespect my Profound Sky Sect? You are seeking death!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter their loud cries sounded, the two of them stepped through empty space. Their bodies immediately rushed forward like lightning. Dark and cold Dou Qi violently smashed toward Hei Qing without being held back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two six star Dou Zuns actually possess the courage to scream in front of this father?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHei Qing laughed out of anger when he saw the two rushing over and advanced instead of pulling back. Both of his fists tightened and the muscles all over his body fluctuated in a strange manner. Finally, he sent his fists forward without any fancy attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo metal fists smashed out and formed two black spatial marks. The black spatial marks moved quickly before violently colliding with the duo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just what is this fellow’s origin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bodies of Shenluo Guizun’s group trembled after the collision. Their expressions immediately turned pale. The frightening strength they faced, which seemed to be able to destroy everything, caused a terror to surge from deep within their hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grug.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terror had just appeared when their throats filled with something sweet. They both spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. Their bodies flew back like kites with their strings broken. They violently shot into the forest below, smashing into the ground and forming a hundred-meter-deep pit. The powerful remnant force completely destroyed the large trees within a hundred meter radius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clap clap…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHei Qing sent the two flying with a punch from each fist. After which, he patted his hands together. His face was filled with ridicule. His eyes, which contained some ill intent, glanced at the gloomy face of the ninth Tianzun. He said, “Mo Yu, are you going to get lost by yourself or shall this father do it for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hei Qing, you should not act so arrogantly. Xiao Yan is someone the hall chief wants to capture. Are you really going to protect him?” Ninth Tianzun coldly demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHei Qing narrowed his eyes. He rubbed his hands together as he replied in a faint voice, “This father doesn’t care about all this. Those old fellows from the clan want me to find Xiao Yan. Since this father is here, everyone should forget about bringing him away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fury within the eyes of the ninth Tianzun surged. Both of his hands slowly tightened and emitted cracking sounds. Frightening Dou Qi slowly spread from his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wish to fight? Alright, the old me also wishes to see if you have improved after so many years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHei Qing coldly chuckled. His body became distorted. It emitted a muffled thunder-like bone explosion. Following the sound of these bones appearing, his body became even larger. An extremely powerful pressure was vaguely emitted from his strong body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ninth Tianzun’s eyes twitched involuntarily when he sensed the pressure. He inhaled a deep breath of air and suppressed the fury within his heart. He was aware that he was no match for Hei Qing with his strength. Even if he attacked, he would not gain an advantage. Moreover, the control over space that an Ancient Void Dragon exhibited was something that no one could match. Even someone stronger than an Ancient Void Dragon would find it difficult to defeat and successfully retain the other party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hei Qing, I don’t believe that you can protect this brat forever!” The ninth Tianzun spoke in a dense tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is not up to you to be concerned about this…” Hei Qing glanced at him and replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ninth Tianzun coldly snorted. His heart was filled with an unwillingness. It was unexpected that he had successfully avoided Yao Chen, but had ended up attracting someone from the Ancient Void Dragon tribe. He did not expect Xiao Yan to have a relationship with this tribe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Hei Qing had shown himself, the ninth Tianzun understood that capturing Xiao Yan had become an impossible task. The Ninth Tianzun could only clench his teeth when he thought of this. He stared at Xiao Yan viciously and said, “Xiao Yan, you can’t just hide forever. I do not believe that someone will always be there to rescue you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter uttering those words, the ninth Tianzun ceased to remain in this place. He turned around and was just about to leave when Hei Qing suddenly opened his mouth , “Mo Yu, when you return, inform those people above you not to go against Xiao Yan and the members of the Xiao clan. The grudges between the Hun (Soul) clan and the Xiao clan have ceased to exist by now. By going overboard, there will come a point in time where all of you will regret it… these words are not spoken by this father. They are spoken by those old fellows within the tribe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ninth Tianzun narrowed his eyes when he heard Hei Qing’s final sentence. He coldly laughed, “It is pointless telling me this. No one will be able to stop my Hall of Souls from doing anything. The Gu clan cannot, and your Ancient Void Dragon tribe also cannot!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ninth Tianzun’s body shook after uttering these words. He transformed into a ray of light and disappeared into the horizon in the blink of an eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHei Qing gently rubbed his fist as he watched the ninth Tianzun’s disappearing figure. His expression was cold. A moment later, he turned his head to look at Xiao Yan. He smiled and said, “Little brother Xiao Yan, are you alright?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have troubled old brother to intervene again.” Xiao Yan cupped his hands as he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh, it doesn\u0027t matter. This time around, my Ancient Void Dragon tribe is going to have to trouble you…” Hei Qing shook his head. He hesitated for a moment before continuing, “You will become aware of the exact reason once you have come with me. If there is nothing else, can we leave now? This matter is of great importance. Nothing must go wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing that even Hei Qing, who had a rough character, was acting with such seriousness, Xiao Yan’s heart was solemn. Just what had caused the Ancient Void Dragon tribe to become this anxious?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, however, can I bring my friend along?” Xiao Yan pointed at Qing Lin a short distance away. When Hei Qing appeared, the Elder from the Profound Sky Sect, who had been entangled in a battle with Qing Lin, swiftly withdrew. He withdrew even quicker when he saw Hei Qing send Shenluo Guizun’s group flying with a punch. That fellow was so frightened that he dared not approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it’s fine…” Hei Qing glanced at Qing Lin and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan only sighed in relief after seeing a nod. It had only be a short while since the ninth Tianzun had left. He was worried about Qing Lin returning alone. It was naturally for the best that Hei Qing had agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Xiao Yan sighed in relief, he waved his hand and returned the Sky Demon Puppet, which had been beaten until thousands of scars and hundreds of holes had appeared on its body. He sighed quietly within his heart. The Sky Demon Puppet, which had followed him for a long time, showed signs of becoming scrap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Xiao Yan stored away the puppet, Qing Lin also returned her experts into her eyes, leaving a frightened Hua Jin standing in the sky. She showed her terror while she looked at Hei Qing. His might caused her to feel shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Young master Xiao Yan, are we going to let this woman off? It’s her fault we were intercepted this time around.” Qing Lin softly inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no time…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan glanced at the woman and shook his head. They were pressed for time and he was too lazy to personally teach this woman a lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big brother Hei Qing, let’s leave…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan turned to look at Hei Qing as he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHei Qing nodded. His hand lifted through the air in front of him and tore a spatial crack. Xiao Yan and Qing Lin’s bodies entered in a flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHua Jin sighed in relief when she saw Xiao Yan’s group leaving. She uttered a string of vicious curses in her stomach. However, those curses had just appeared in her heart when Hei Qing, whose foot had just stepped toward the spatial crack line in the sky, paused. He waved his large hand without turning his head. Waves of frightening forces tore through space and landed on Hua Jin’s body in an instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grug!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn incomparably strong force caused Hua Jin to spit out a mouthful of fresh blood. Her body violently smashed into a mountain. Large rocks rolled down and buried her deep underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do not think that this father will not attack you just because you are a woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHei Qing swung his large hand after sending Hua Jin flying with a slap. He flashed closer to the spatial crack. With a ‘chi’ sound, he entered it and disappeared with it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1299\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1301\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1300","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM"}
