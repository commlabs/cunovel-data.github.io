I can\u0027t take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me up to stand in front of him, keeping his c**k in me until the soles of my heels touched the hardwood floor. \"Come home with me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t leave Cary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll drag him out of here with us. Shh...Before you complain, whatever he hopes to get out of this party, I can make happen. Being here accomplishes nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027s having fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you here.\" He suddenly seemed distant, his tone far too controlled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know how badly it hurts me when you say that?\" I cried softly, my chest tight with the pain of it. \"What\u0027s wrong with me that you don\u0027t want me around your family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angel, no.\" He hugged me, his hands roaming my back in soothing caresses. \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with you. It\u0027s this place. I don\u0027t - I can\u0027t be here. You want to know what\u0027s in my dreams? It\u0027s this house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" My stomach knotted with worry and confusion. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in my voice lured him to press a kiss between my eyebrows. \"I\u0027ve been rough with you today. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m edgy and agitated being here, but that\u0027s no excuse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cupped his face and stared into his eyes, seeing the tumultuous emotions he was so used to hiding. \"Don\u0027t ever apologize for being yourself with me. It\u0027s what I want. I want to be your safe place, Gideon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are. You don\u0027t know how much, but I\u0027ll find a way to tell you.\" He rested his forehead against mine. \"Let\u0027s go home. I bought some things for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? I love gifts.\" Especially when they came from my self-professed unromantic boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCautiously, he began to pull out of me. I was shocked to feel how wet I was, how copiously he\u0027d come. The final few inches of his c**k slid out in a rush and se**n slicked my inner thighs. A moment later, two audacious droplets fell to the hardwood floor between my spread legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shit.\" He groaned. \"That\u0027s so damn hot. I\u0027m getting hard again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the brazen display of his virility and felt warm. \"You can\u0027t go again after that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell if I can\u0027t.\" Cupping my sex in his hand, he rubbed the slickness all over me, coating the outer lips and massaging it into the folds. Euphoria spread through me like the warmth of fine liquor, a sense of contentment that came solely from the knowledge that Gideon found gratification in me and my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m an animal with you,\" he murmured. \"I want to mark you. I want to possess you so completely there\u0027s no separation between us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy h*ps began to move in tiny circles as his words and touch reignited the desire he\u0027d goaded with the thrusts of his cock. I wanted to come again, knew I\u0027d be miserable if I had to wait until we reached his bed. I was a sexual creature with him, too, so physically attuned to him and so positive that he would never physically hurt me, that I was...free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI encircled his wrist with my fingers and gently directed his hand around my hip to reach for me from behind. Nipping his jaw with my teeth, I gathered the courage he inspired in me and whispered, \"Touch me here with your fingers. Mark me there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe froze, his chest lifting and falling rapidly. \"I don\u0027t\" - his voice strengthened - \"I don\u0027t do anal play, Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking into his eyes, I saw something dark and volatile. Something very painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf all the things for us to have in common...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raw passion of our lust gentled into the warm familiarity of love. With my heart breaking, I confessed, \"I don\u0027t either. At least not voluntarily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then...why?\" The confusion in his voice moved me deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged him, pressing my cheek to his shoulder and listening to the slightly panicked beat of his heart. \"Because I believe your touch can erase Nathan\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Eva.\" His cheek pressed to the crown of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuggled closer. \"You make me feel safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe held each other for long moments. I listened to his heartbeat slow and his breathing smooth out. I inhaled deeply, relishing the mix of his personal scent mixed with the scent of hard lust and harder sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the tip of his middle finger slid gossamer-soft over the pucker of my anus, I stilled and pulled back to look at him. \"Gideon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why me?\" he asked softly, his beautiful eyes dark and stormy. \"You know I\u0027m f**ked up, Eva. You saw what I...that night you woke me...You saw, damn it. How can you trust me with your body this way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I trust my heart and what it tells me.\" I smoothed the frown line between his brows. \"You can give my body back to me, Gideon. I believe you\u0027re the only one who can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes closed and his damp forehead touched mine. \"Do you have a safeword, Eva?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, I pulled back again to study his face. A few members of my therapy group had talked about Dom/sub relationships. Some required total control to feel safe during sex. Others fell on the opposite side of the line, finding that bondage and humiliation satisfied their deep-seated need to feel pain to experience pleasure. For those who practiced that lifestyle, a safeword was an unambiguous way to say \"stop.\" But I couldn\u0027t see how that had any relevance to me and Gideon. \"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need one.\" Between my legs, the gentle stroke of his finger became less tentative. He repeated his question, \"Do you have a safeword?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027ve never needed one. Missionary, doggy style, B.O.B.... that\u0027s about the extent of my mad skills in the sack.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-68.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
