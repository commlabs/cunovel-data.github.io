A member of the clergy guided him to the back of the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolden sunlight streamed into the room through the windows, showing the motes of dust in the air. Furniture and all other decorations were simple, as was customary in the church of justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you have any needs, please press the doorbell here. We will await any orders… Also, the meeting with the other lords will be after dinner. Paladin Rafiniya will arrive very soon.” The servant that had brought Leylin in withdrew and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafiniya came quickly. After all, Leylin was a legendary, and it was necessary to show him the required respect. Unfortunately for such a moronic paladin, Leylin had no common topic to discuss with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter enjoying a simple dinner, Leylin was guided to a small drawing room. A few masters with powerful auras were lying in wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are these the other legendaries?’ Leylin nodded and headed inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was rather small. There was a bright red fur rug on the ground as well as a fireplace that was blazing brightly. However, there was no scent of smoke in the air. While this was the north, the room was still as warm as if it were spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You… You must be the rumoured wizard from the outer seas. Leylin, right? You really are very young!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s entrance immediately gathered their attention. A long-haired woman wrapped in a red mink fur coat stood up with a kind smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides us old geezers of the north, you arrived quite quickly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was evidently a legendary, and from the elemental domain power around her, she was a legendary wizard!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me introduce myself. My name is Lillian, and next to me here is the paladin of the god of justice, Sire Patrick. Next to the fireplace is the protector of the north, the legendary druid, Alegor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were very few legends in the room, numbering only three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Queen Alustriel of Silverymoon and her chief scholar, Blu were not around. They were people that Leylin had wished to meet, and this left him slightly disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Leylin presented himself humbly on the surface and greeted the three of them politely while judging them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillian was a traditional wizard. Undulations from magic items and scrolls were emitted from her body, and there even seemed to be some hidden aura there, likely some legendary item she had with her. Her battle might was not to be underestimated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick, on the other hand, was a man of few words and looked rather cold. This actually had Leylin snickering inside. Recalling the legendary paladin that had died at his hands, who had been said to be a judge or something like that, he was sure that the god of justice’s church must have been dealt a great blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last one was the legendary druid, Alegor, who was dressed in an interesting manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a burly man over three metres tall and with a thick brown beard. Next to his fuzzy ears was a pair of large forked horns like that of elks, with some leaves appearing at the tip. This druid did not wear much, and only had some beast hide and leaves that had been used to make an apron. This revealed a hairy and broad chest, which made him seem rather wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Initially, as the protector of nature, I should not participate in these activities. However, those orcs are destroying nature to a terrifying degree, which goes against the most fundamental cycle and harmony here…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlegor now looked solemn, giving Leylin all the information he needed in a few sentences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, all druids took on the responsibility of protecting nature. They were strongly against any actions taken to destroy it, and there was even the rise of radicals against this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter occupying the north, the orcs were doing more damage to the environment in order to obtain more resources and materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe queen of Silverymoon had a great relationship with druids, which was why they began reminiscing about the time when she had been in power. It was understandable why they were hard at work here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eye of the North… Protector of nature, as well as a paladin who is comparable to the judge from before…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin estimated the power they had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith these the four of them, it was impossible to turn the orc empire upside down, but it was possible to affect the successes or failures of a few campaigns!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, they were only the first batch that had arrived. The true trump cards were still hidden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What a pity… Even so, it’s not possible to sway the orcs’ power in the north. At the most, we can crack their foundations as a kingdom, but unless all the human gods band together, it’s impossible to chase them out and restore our power. However, is that plausible?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile having all sorts of complicated emotions inside, Leylin walked out of the church and into Yorkshire, where it was now night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it was late, this place was still rather boisterous. From the dazzling rays from various churches, there were also large oil lamps in front of shops. Some citizens strolled around after dinner, melodious holy songs and prayers sounding in the background. It was leisurely and relaxing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But… seems like the effects from the refugees of the north are yet to disappear…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin found that there was a very high frequency of patrolling, as well as occasional thievery, and he could not help but shake his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surge of residents of the north was the greatest challenge for security. The huge increase in population, as well as entrance of nobility from the north, had increased the price of daily necessities and resulted in many citizens unable to voice their unhappiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, the people of Yorkshire did not think well of these refugees. All believed that they had not only stolen their jobs, but were also a huge burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps they knew of a legend’s senses and that sending people to monitor him would be useless unless a legendary thief or assassin were dispatched. Leylin strolled around and found that there were no people following him nor any magic for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, perhaps they have assured themselves that with the gods support, I wouldn’t be able to do anything against them…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin shook his head and could not help but laugh, before then turned into a dimly lit alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreams of dark red fog appeared by him, concealing his original aura. It was as if he had turned into a whole other person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people around him were all in a flurry, and none discovered this abnormality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With dreamforce concealing me, anything monitoring me will be rendered useless…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin stepped out of the alley that had an illusion hidden within and, as his figure flashed a few times, disappeared from the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Leylin’s legendary strength as well as boost from the illusions of dreamforce, it was just too easy to prevent any spying on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight fluctuated, and the next time Leylin appeared, he had arrived in a secret room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black fog in the surroundings seemed to be like a huge beast that devoured everything. There was only a yellow light in the centre that emitted bright rays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few figures with powerful auras were dressed in black robes, waiting by the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re early…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the black-robed people spoke to Leylin in a crisp, female voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never thought you’d have arrangements here in Yorkshire too…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin watched the female wizard before him. Under the light, she had removed her disguise and revealed her original appearance. This was the legendary wizard he had just seen, Lillian!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you transmit a message to me right before leaving… and there’s these people…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this legendary wizard had looked normal during the meeting before, she had suddenly sent him an address at the end, wanting him to come here alone. There were also other powerful beings, and every one of them was a legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gathering like this was definitely not for some sort of banquet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve already set up multiple isolating spell formations. Even if its a god, none can discover our conversation unless their true body were to descend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillian spoke with a smile, eyes seeming to burn, “Do you still not know the reason why we legends have gathered?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat great plans could there be when a group of legends had sneakily gathered?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf profits were the largest priority, then what could attract these exemplary beings would be ascension to godhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin knew this full well and smiled, “Well then, you haven’t introduced me to them yet…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keke… Is a little brat who just entered our domain capable of plotting with us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, a black-robed person standing next to Lilian snickered, sounding like an ghostly owl in the night, causing hair to stand on end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Boom!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremendous and cold deathly aura with great pressure attacked Leylin in the next instant, like raging waves. There were even cries from maligned souls as well as powerful negative energy, corrosive auras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the black-robed beings did not move as they watched on with smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this a probe? As expected, in circles like this in the dark, power is everything!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a thought, Leylin’s body did not move and allowed the deathly aura to go past him. Many undulations rippled on the wall behind him, but he was completely unharmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What a dense deathly aura… And you are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin then smiled at the stunned black-robed person and asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re capable!” He declared, but did not make any more movements. Evidently, he found Leylin worthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-979\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-981\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-980","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:22 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:22 AM"}
