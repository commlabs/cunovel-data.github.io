If I’m ever going to be great at anything I wan...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut him off, “I think someone’s following me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Princess, I can’t hear you, please wait for me. Don’t leave the house. Just stay there and wait for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored him and tried to whisper louder, “I think there’s someone coming.” I realized I was exactly like the idiots on the crime shows. I was such a stereotype it wasn’t even funny, college girl roaming the city drunk and alone. “Shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice got panicked, “Erin, what’s shit? I can’t hear anything else you’re saying. What’s going on? Why do you sound scared? I don’t care that you just said that stuff. I just want to have this conversation with you. I want to see you, when I say the things I wanna say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” I muttered again, hurrying to the apartment and ignoring him. I couldn’t hang up; I needed him to be there still, so I wasn’t alone. I was about to become a skin suit and the last thing I ever said, was a confession to a guy about being more than me, even in my own mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s happening?” he asked sounding angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands shook as I looked back. The man watched me. Was he really though, or was I just acting so crazy that he was staring at the display. My hands shook as I opened the door. I pulled it shut, dropping my phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ERIN!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the phone, “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, “I thought a man was following me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouted again, “Where the fuck are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouted back, “I’m home!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For Christ’s sake, where’s the guy following you? Is he in the house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moaned, “There is no guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear him getting frustrated but I needed water and a bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Princess, I swear to God, you’re going to be the death of me. What the hell? Is there a guy or not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned, “There was. I thought he was following me. He was just walking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’ll be at the house in two minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized suddenly, he was out of breath and the bar noise was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was coming home… After everything I had just said? My drunk mind was whirling until a light bulb came on. It was one of those drunken evil light bulbs, but it was better than dealing with the shit I’d said ten minutes before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI muttered really low into the phone, “What? I couldn’t hear you. I’m gonna hit the hay.” I hung the phone up and ran the rest of the stairs to the apartment, jamming the key in the door and racing inside. I ran to my room, pulled off my shorts and shirt, and stalked out into the kitchen. I grabbed the Gatorade, he’d just bought, from the fridge and cracked it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rushed into the apartment. He was almost heaving and covered in sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, “Hey! Don’t you have more show to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked homicidal as he glanced around the house, “So… you’re… fine?” He struggled to get his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around like what he was saying was absurd, “Yeah.” I swayed a little bit, while trying to maintain my cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flickered on my push up bra and panties. I turned, bending over completely and grabbed the freezer drawer, placing the Gatorade at the back of the drawer. I stayed there for an extra second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I stood up, I could see the look in his eyes had worsened. He took a step back, putting his hand to his mouth, “Oh man. Are those Victoria’s Secret’s Brazilian-butt underwear?” he moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held up the piece of ice, I’d discreetly pulled from the drawer and ran it over my cleavage, “Yeah? What’s up with you? You’re acting weird.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his hands through his hair, backing up farther, “Seriously? I ran like five blocks to get here, and this was a trap? So all that, ‘Lochlan you’re the best, I can’t compete with you—OMG a man is following me’ was shit?” He even raised his tone to mimic my voice, but really just sounded like a cartoon character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, shaking my head. I tossed the ice in the sink and walked up to his chest. I looked up into his eyes, “How do you boys say that?” I tapped my fingernail against my cheek, “Oh yeah, don’t hate the player, hate the game?” I blinked a few times and walked by him to the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You… you cheated hardcore. You made me think you were in trouble. How could you do that?” He was mystified, but my lack of clothes seemed to be making him confused enough, the dark-eyed look didn’t come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at him, “You let me believe you were some crazy, southern hick who was making an attempt at being a rock star.” My words slurred a bit, “You didn’t tell me you were a famous star.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to me, towering over me. The furrowed brow were there instantly, “Are you fucking dense? All those people asking me for my signature? The fucking cop on the first day we met, asked for it. You assumed that. What, you can’t fucking Google shit? I thought it was hilarious you didn’t know who I was. In fact, I liked it. You treated me like shit and yelled at me, like people used to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched and looked at the door, “You probably should go back to the bar, before the crowd gets mad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue/black eyes bore down on me, “We closed after that song. We only played one set.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the sobering feeling of the heat of him standing over my mostly-naked body. He ran a finger down my jawline, “Princess, you scared me for real. No games when it comes to that, okay? I can’t handle you not being safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “I… I didn’t mean to. I really thought he was following me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze narrowed, “You have to tell me what the deal is with you. Mace, paranoia, sketchy about leaving the apartment except in the morning, and only for running with your mace. What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped back, “It’s nothing.” My back pressed against the wall by the bathroom door. He stepped closer, putting his arms on either side of me, “It’s safe to tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed the vomit slithering up my throat, as a shudder took control of my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed bitterly, “You’re hanging on by a thread, aren’t you? You’re gong to barf any second? You drank too much didn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for the bathroom door and opened it, “Go get sick. We can talk tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again and slipped into the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt at the toilet, realizing he’d ran as fast as he could to come and make sure I was safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought lasted seconds, before the wine came back with vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe New Deal, AKA playing house\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke with a start and a gasp. My head spun. I moaned, wincing at the bad feelings covering me. I was on my bed. I didn’t remember much. I was still in my lacy Brazilian-butt underwear and push-up bra. I pulled it off and pulled on a tee shirt and some sweats. It was cool in the room. There was a note, a glass, and a small carton of something on my bedside table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Princess,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrink this and take these pills and come wake me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurry up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eL’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered, looking at the carton. It was coconut water. I popped the pills in my mouth and poured the murky-looking liquid into the glass and drank it back. It wasn’t so bad. Not as coconut flavored as I imagined it would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left the room to see him passed out, in his clothes still, on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tiptoed to the kitchen. Flashbacks of me in my underwear were trying to get through the barrier in my brain. I pushed them away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI poured a glass of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at him, “Hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, “How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “Stop shouting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, “I suspected.” He came and grabbed my hand, pulling me to the front door. He grabbed my flip-flops from the organized shelf next to the door and continued to walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to go. Where are we going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scooped me up into his arms, “Somewhere necessary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe carried me down the stairs like I weighed nothing. “Put me down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “No, your drunk ass is gonna go too slow and I’m starving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI panicked a little, mostly because I had no energy, “Loch, I can’t leave the house like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, “I like it when you accidentally call me Loch.” He always ignored the things he didn’t want to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got to the car, he opened the door and placed me inside. I sat inside and got my bearings. He climbed in, grinning, “You don’t drink, do you?” He passed me my shoes. I slipped them on, trying not to heave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat was burning from the puking and my head was spinning, “No. I never pass the two-glass rule.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t say anything else, thank God, until we got to a small mom-and-pop establishment. I made a face but he pointed a finger, “Trust me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him and with all my might I tried to say no, but I didn’t. The nod was almost involuntary. I opened the car door and he was there, holding a hand out for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recoiled, “You’re being sweet to try to trick me into losing the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “Not today, I swear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes sparkled. He didn’t even know he was doing it. I groaned and let him pull me from the car. I burped. He gave me a worried look. I laughed, “There’s nothing left. I got it all out last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed my hand on his arm and closed the door, “Okay, but if you throw up on me, I might just let you win.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, “I’ll remember that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we walked inside, he pulled me to a booth. It sounded like I was squeaking against rubber, when I sat. I looked around, frowning, “What is this dump? Why do you always eat in seedy, shitty places? Is that guy smoking?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/my-side/page-10.html","bookId":2792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:38 PM"}
