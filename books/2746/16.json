Love, DeeDee.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex had done her best to make the note sound blah, adding lots of unnecessary pauses and dull inflections, but there wasn\u0027t any denying that this DeeDee person meant business. After all, I didn\u0027t write notes on pink paper with fancy writing. I didn\u0027t even own pink paper. Edible paper— yes, but pretty pink paper—no way! So there it was, proof in black-and-white (or … well…pink-and-blue, but you get what I mean), that I was officially out of my league. That I really was nobody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz must have read my expression, because she jumped to say, \"This doesn\u0027t mean anything, Cam. It\u0027s in the trash!\" She turned to Bex. \"That\u0027s got to mean something, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s when I couldn\u0027t ignore it anymore: the universal truth that, despite our elite education and genius IQs, we didn\u0027t know boys. DeeDee, with her pink paper and ability to make the big, puffy J\u0027s, might have known the significance of a boy like Josh putting her perfect pink note in the trash, but we sure didn\u0027t. The boy of my dreams may have been as close as the town of Roseville—just two miles, eighty security cameras, and a big honking stone fence away, but he and I would never speak the same language (which is totally ironic, since \"boy\" was the one language my school had never tried to teach me).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay, Liz,\" I said softly. \"We knew it was a long shot. It\u0027s—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" I felt Bex\u0027s hand lash out and grab my wrist. \"Tell me what you told him again.\" She read my blank expression. \"That night?\" she prompted. \"When you told him you were homeschooled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He asked if I was homeschooled, and I said yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what reason did you give?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For …\" I started, but my voice trailed off as I looked at the stack of papers that she had laid out between us. \"Religious reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a program for the Roseville Free Will Baptist Assembly, a flyer for the United Methodist Church of Roseville, and a handful of others. Either Josh was collecting church bulletins for some kind of bizarre scavenger hunt, or he\u0027d been busy traipsing to Sunday schools and Tuesday-night teen socials for an entirely different reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s looking for you, Cam,\" Bex said, beaming as if she\u0027d just made the first step in cracking the ultimate code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence washed over us. My heart pounded in my chest. Bex and Liz were staring at me, but I couldn\u0027t pull my gaze away from what we\u0027d found—from the hope that was spread out across our floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess that\u0027s why none of us noticed the door opening. I guess that\u0027s why we jumped when we heard Macey McHenry say, \"So, what\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twelve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" I shot back, way too quickly for the lie to be any good. Here\u0027s the thing about lying: a part of you has to mean it—even if it is a tiny, sinister shred that only lives in the blackest, darkest parts of your mind. You have to want it to be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on,\" Macey said with a roll of her eyes. \"It\u0027s been, what? Two weeks?\" I was shocked. Macey cocked her head and asked, \"You been to second base yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are entire books in the Gallagher Academy library about female independence and how we shouldn\u0027t let men distract us from our missions, but all I could do was look at Macey McHenry and say, \"You think I could get to second base?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate to admit it, but it was probably one of the greatest compliments I had received in my whole, entire life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Macey only rolled her eyes and said, \"Forget I asked,\" as she strolled to the pile of garbage and, unsurprisingly, turned up her perfect nose and said, \"This is disgusting!\" Then she looked at me. \"You must have it bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeave it to Bex to keep her cool and say, \"We\u0027ve got CoveOps homework, Macey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven I almost believed that what we were doing was perfectly innocent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey looked down at our piles, examining the scene as if this were the most exciting thing she\u0027d seen in months, which absolutely, positively could not have been true, since I know for a fact that her class had been in the physics labs when Mr. Fibs got attacked by the bees he thought he\u0027d genetically modified to obey commands from a whistle. (Turns out they only respond to the voice of James Earl Jones.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name is Josh,\" I said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cammie!\" Liz cried, as if she couldn\u0027t believe I was giving such sensitive intel to the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Macey only repeated, \"Josh,\" as if trying it on for size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said. \"I met him when we had a mission in town, and … well…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you can\u0027t stop thinking about him…. You always want to know what he\u0027s doing… . You\u0027d kill to know if he\u0027s thinking about you….\" Macey said, like a doctor reeling off symptoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" I cried. \"That\u0027s sooooo it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"That\u0027s too bad, kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was only three months older than me, so I totally could have gotten mad about the \"kid\" thing, but I couldn\u0027t get mad at her—not then. I wasn\u0027t exactly sure what was happening, but one thing was becoming obvious: Macey McHenry had intel I desperately needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told me I had a lucky cat,\" I said. \"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have a cat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Technicality.\" I waved that fact away. \"So, what does it mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds like he wants to play it cool…. That he might like you, and he wants to keep his options open in case you decide you don\u0027t like him, or if he decides he doesn\u0027t like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then I saw him on the street, and I overheard him telling a friend that I was \u0027nobody.\u0027 But he\u0027d been really nice and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you have been busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He acts really nice, but based on what he told his friend—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\" Macey stopped me. \"He said that to a friend? Another guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you believed him?\" She rolled her eyes. \"Total hearsay. Could be posturing, could be territory marking, could be shame over liking the new weird chick—I\u0027m assuming he thinks you\u0027re a weird chick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thinks I\u0027m homeschooled for religious reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" she said, nodding as if that were answer enough. \"I\u0027d say you\u0027ve still got a shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOH. MY. GOSH. It was as if the gray storm clouds had parted and Macey McHenry was the sun, bringing wisdom and truth into the eternal darkness. (Or something a lot less melodramatic.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust in case you missed my point: Macey McHenry knows about boys!! Of course, this shouldn\u0027t have come as a huge, colossal surprise, but I couldn\u0027t help myself; I was groveling at her feet, worshipping at the altar of eyeliner, push-up bras, and coed parties without parental supervision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Liz said, \"That\u0027s amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to help me,\" I pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooh, sorry. Not my department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it wasn\u0027t. It was clear that Macey McHenry was the lurkee, not the lurker. She couldn\u0027t possibly understand life on the outside, looking through the window at a place she\u0027d never know. Then I thought about the hours she\u0027d spent locked away in the silence of those headphones and wondered, or could she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore me stood a person who was capable of cracking the Y chromosome code, and I wasn\u0027t going to let her get away that easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well tell it to someone who isn\u0027t the freaking mascot of the seventh-freaking-grade!\" She eased onto her bed and crossed her legs. \"So there is only one way that I am going to care about your boy problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWork brain, work, I urged my mind, but it was like a car stuck in the mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting out of the newbie classes,\" Macey said. \"And you\u0027re going to help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really didn\u0027t like the sound of this, but I still managed to ask, \"What\u0027s in it for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For starters, I don\u0027t have a conversation with our friend Jessica Boden about an early morning trip to the labs with an old Dr Pepper bottle, or a late-night trip outside the grounds, where someone came home with leaves in her hair.\" She smirked at Liz. \"Or a certain Driver\u0027s Ed incident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, I didn\u0027t doubt that Macey was a Gallagher Girl, too. The looks Liz and Bex were giving me said that they agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know Jessica\u0027s mother is a trustee?\" Macey said, her voice dripping with sarcastic irony. \"See, Jessica\u0027s mentioned that fact to me about a hundred and fifty times now and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, already,\" I said, stopping her. \"What else do I get?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A soul mate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies, this is a business of alliances,\" Mr. Solomon said as he stood in front of our class the next morning. \"You may not like these people. You may hate these people. These people may represent everything you hate, but all it takes is one thing, ladies—one thread of commonality to form a bond in our lives.\" He strolled back to his desk. \"To make an ally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0027s what I had with Macey—an alliance. We weren\u0027t friends; we weren\u0027t enemies. I wasn\u0027t exactly blocking off Fourth of July weekend to spend at her place in the Hamptons, but I planned on playing nice just the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen lunchtime rolled around, Macey strolled over to our table, and I braced myself for what was going to happen. If the Communists and the Capitalists could fight together to take down the Nazis … I told myself. If Spike could fight alongside Buffy to rid the world of demons … If lemon could join forces with lime to create something as delicious and refreshing as Sprite, then surely I can work alongside Macey McHenry for the cause of true love!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sitting beside me. She was eating pie. I had to look again. Macey\u0027s eating pie?! And then she actually spoke, but I couldn\u0027t hear her over the roar of a nearby debate (in Korean) about whether Jason Bourne could take James Bond, and if it mattered whether it was Sean-Connery-Bond or Pierce-Brosnan-Bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you say something, Macey?\" I asked, but she cut me a look that could kill. She reached into her bag, ripped off a sliver of Evapopaper, and scribbled:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan we study tonight? (Tell anyone, and I\u0027ll kill you in your sleep!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven o\u0027clock?\" I asked her. She nodded. We had a date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pie had looked pretty good, so I got up to go get some, and when I did, I glanced at the Vogue Macey had been reading, but I couldn\u0027t learn much about fashion, because Macey\u0027s organic chemistry notes were taped inside, covering that month\u0027s salute to silk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on the floor of our suite that night with Macey\u0027s homework scattered around us, I wasn\u0027t really sure how this alliance business was supposed to work. Luckily, Liz had been giving it some thought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can start by explaining what this means.\" She held DeeDee\u0027s note up to Macey\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ew!\" Macey cried, turning her head and holding her nose as she pushed the paper away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what Liz lacked in strength, she made up for in tenacity. She shoved the note back in Macey\u0027s direction despite Macey\u0027s complaint of, \"I thought you got rid of all that trash!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, not this. This is evidence,\" Liz said, stating what, in her mind, was the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh! Gross.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-16.html","bookId":2746,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:34 PM"}
