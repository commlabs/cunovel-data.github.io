There Are No Words For This.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella\u0027s body, streaming with red, started to twitch, jerking around in Rosalie\u0027s arms like she was being\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eelectrocuted. All the while, her face was blank - unconscious. It was the wild thrashing from inside the center of her body that moved her. As she convulsed, sharp snaps and cracks kept time with the spasms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie and Edward were frozen for the shortest half second, and then they broke. Rosalie whipped Bella\u0027s body into her arms, and, shouting so fast it was hard to separate the individual words, she and Edward shot up the staircase to the second floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sprinted after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morphine!\" Edward yelled at Rosalie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice - get Carlisle on the phone!\" Rosalie screeched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room I followed them to looked like an emergency ward set up in the middle of a library. The lights were brilliant and white. Bella was on a table under the glare, skin ghostly in the spotlight. Her body flopped, a fish on the sand. Rosalie pinned Bella down, yanking and ripping her clothes out of the way, while Edward stabbed a syringe into her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many times had I imagined her naked? Now I couldn\u0027t look. I was afraid to have these memories in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening, Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s suffocating!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The placenta must have detached!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in this, Bella came around. She responded to their words with a shriek that clawed at my eardrums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get him OUT!\" she screamed. \"He can\u0027t BREATHE! Do it NOW!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the red spots pop out when her scream broke the blood vessels in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The morphine - ,\" Edward growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"NO! NOW - !\" Another gush of blood choked off what she was shrieking. He held her head up, desperately trying to clear her mouth so that she could breathe again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice darted into the room and clipped a little blue earpiece under Rosalie\u0027s hair. Then Alice backed away, her gold eyes wide and burning, while Rosalie hissed frantically into the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bright light, Bella\u0027s skin seemed more purple and black than it was white. Deep red was seeping beneath the skin over the huge, shuddering bulge of her stomach. Rosalie\u0027s hand came up with a scalpel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let the morphine spread!\" Edward shouted at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no time,\" Rosalie hissed. \"He\u0027s dying!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand came down on Bella\u0027s stomach, and vivid red spouted out from where she pierced the skin. It was like a bucket being turned over, a faucet twisted to full. Bella jerked, but didn\u0027t scream. She was still choking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Rosalie lost her focus. I saw the expression on her face shift, saw her lips pull back from her teeth and her black eyes glint with thirst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Rose!\" Edward roared, but his hands were trapped, trying to prop Bella upright so she could breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI launched myself at Rosalie, jumping across the table without bothering to phase. As I hit her stone body, knocking her toward the door, I felt the scalpel in her hand stab deep into my left arm. My right palm smashed against her face, locking her jaw and blocking her airways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used my grip on Rosalie\u0027s face to swing her body out so that I could land a solid kick in her gut; it was like kicking concrete. She flew into the door frame, buckling one side of it. The little speaker in her ear crackled into pieces. Then Alice was there, yanking her by the throat to get her into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I had to give it to Blondie - she didn\u0027t put up an ounce of fight. She wanted us to win. She let me trash her like that, to save Bella. Well, to save the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ripped the blade out of my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Alice, get her out of here!\" Edward shouted. \"Take her to Jasper and keep her there! Jacob, I need you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t watch Alice finish the job. I wheeled back to the operating table, where Bella was turning blue, her eyes wide and staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CPR?\" Edward growled at me, fast and demanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI judged his face swiftly, looking for any sign that he was going to react like Rosalie. There was nothing but single-minded ferocity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get her breathing! I\u0027ve got to get him out before - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother shattering crack inside her body, the loudest yet, so loud that we both froze in shock waiting for her answering shriek. Nothing. Her legs, which had been curled up in agony, now went limp, sprawling out in an unnatural way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her spine,\" he choked in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get it out of her!\" I snarled, flinging the scalpel at him. \"She won\u0027t feel anything now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I bent over her head. Her mouth looked clear, so I pressed mine to hers and blew a lungful of air into it. I felt her twitching body expand, so there was nothing blocking her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips tasted like blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear her heart, thumping unevenly. Keep it going, I thought fiercely at her, blowing another gust of air into her body. You promised. Keep your heart beating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the soft, wet sound of the scalpel across her stomach. More blood dripping to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next sound jolted through me, unexpected, terrifying. Like metal being shredded apart. The sound brought back the fight in the clearing so many months ago, the tearing sound of the newborns being ripped apart. I glanced over to see Edward\u0027s face pressed against the bulge. Vampire teeth - a surefire way to cut through vampire skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered as I blew more air into Bella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe coughed back at me, her eyes blinking, rolling blindly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay with me now, Bella!\" I yelled at her. \"Do you hear me? Stay! You\u0027re not leaving me. Keep your heart beating!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes wheeled, looking for me, or him, but seeing nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared into them anyway, keeping my gaze locked there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then her body was suddenly still under my hands, though her breathing picked up roughly and her heart continued to thud. I realized the stillness meant that it was over. The internal beating was over. It must be out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward whispered, \"Renesmee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Bella\u0027d been wrong. It wasn\u0027t the boy she\u0027d imagined. No big surprise there. What hadn\u0027t she been wrong about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t look away from her red-spotted eyes, but I felt her hands lift weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me...,\" she croaked in a broken whisper. \"Give her to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I should have known that he would always give her what she wanted, no matter how stupid her request might be. But I didn\u0027t dream he would listen to her now. So I didn\u0027t think to stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething warm touched my arm. That right there should have caught my attention. Nothing felt warm to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t look away from Bella\u0027s face. She blinked and then stared, finally seeing something. She moaned out a strange, weak croon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Renes... mee. So... beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she gasped - gasped in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I looked, it was too late. Edward had snatched the warm, bloody thing out of her limp arms. My eyes flickered across her skin. It was red with blood - the blood that had flowed from her mouth, the blood smeared all over the creature, and fresh blood welling out of a tiny double-crescent bite mark just over her left breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Renesmee,\" Edward murmured, like he was teaching the monster manners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t look at him or it. I watched only Bella as her eyes rolled back into her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a last dull ga-lump, her heart faltered and went silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe missed maybe half of one beat, and then my hands were on her chest, doing compressions, i counted in my head, trying to keep the rhythm steady. One. Two. Three. Four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreaking away for a second, I blew another lungful of air into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t see anymore. My eyes were wet and blurry. But I was hyperaware of the sounds in the room. Theunwillingglug-glug of her heart under my demanding hands, the pounding of my own heart, and another - a fluttering beat that was too fast, too light. I couldn\u0027t place it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced more air down Bella\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you waiting for?\" I choked out breathlessly, pumping her heart again. One. Two. Three. Four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the baby,\" Edward said urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Throw it out the window.\" One. Two. Three. Four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give her to me,\" a low voice chimed from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward and I snarled at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne. Two. Three. Four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got it under control,\" Rosalie promised. \"Give me the baby, Edward. Til take care of her until Bella ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed for Bella again while the exchange took place. The fluttering thumpa-thumpa-thumpa faded away with distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move your hands, Jacob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up from Bella\u0027s white eyes, still pumping her heart for her. Edward had a syringe in his hand\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- all silver, like it was made from steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis stone hand knocked mine out of the way. There was a tiny crunch as his blow broke my little finger. In the same second, he shoved the needle straight into her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My venom,\" he answered as he pushed the plunger down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the jolt in her heart, like he\u0027d shocked her with paddles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it moving,\" he ordered. His voice was ice, was dead. Fierce and unthinking. Like he was a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emachine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored the healing ache in my finger and started pumping her heart again. It was harder, as if her blood was congealing there - thicker and slower. While I pushed the now-viscous blood through her arteries, I watched what he was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like he was kissing her, brushing his lips at her throat, at her wrists, into the crease at the inside of her arm. But I could hear the lush tearing of her skin as his teeth bit through, again and again, forcing venom into her system at as many points as possible. I saw his pale tongue sweep along the bleeding gashes, but before this could make me either sick or angry, I realized what he was doing. Where his tongue washed the venom over her skin, it sealed shut. Holding the poison and the blood inside her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blew more air into her mouth, but there was nothing there. Just the lifeless rise of her chest in response. I kept pumping her heart, counting, while he worked manically over her, trying to put her back together. All the king\u0027s horses and all the king\u0027s men...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was nothing there, just me, just him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking over a corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause that\u0027s all that was left of the girl we both loved. This broken, bled-out, mangled corpse. We couldn\u0027t put Bella together again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it was too late. I knew she was dead. I knew it for sure because the pull was gone. I didn\u0027t feel any reason to be here beside her. She wasn\u0027t here anymore. So this body had no more draw for me. The senseless need to be near her had vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe moved was the better word. It seemed like I felt the pull from the opposite direction now. From down the stairs, out the door. The longing to get away from here and never, ever come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go, then,\" he snapped, and he hit my hands out of the way again, taking my place this time. Three fingers broken, it felt like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straightened them numbly, not minding the throb of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed her dead heart faster than I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not dead,\" he growled. \"She\u0027s going to be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure he was talking to me anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning away, leaving him with his dead, I walked slowly to the door. So slowly. I couldn\u0027t make my feet move faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was it, then. The ocean of pain. The other shore so far away across the boiling water that I couldn\u0027t imagine it, much less see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt empty again, now that I\u0027d lost my purpose. Saving Bella had been my fight for so long now. And she wouldn\u0027t be saved. She\u0027d willingly sacrificed herself to be torn apart by that monster\u0027s young, and so the fight was lost. It was all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered at the sound coming from behind me as I plodded down the stairs - the sound of a dead heart being forced to thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to somehow pour bleach inside my head and let it fry my brain. To burn away the images left from Bella\u0027s final minutes. I\u0027d take the brain damage if I could get rid of that - the screaming, the bleeding, the unbearable crunching and snapping as the newborn monster tore through her from the inside out___\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to sprint away, to take the stairs ten at a time and race out the door, but my feet were heavy as iron and my body was more tired than it had ever been before. I shuffled down the stairs like a crippled old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested at the bottom step, gathering my strength to get out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie was on the clean end of the white sofa, her back to me, cooing and murmuring to the blanket-wrapped thing in her arms. She must have heard me pause, but she ignored me, caught up in her moment of stolen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRjesavate i\u0026gt;itanje brqj 10 odiikiiiio 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoje od dole navednih tvrdnji su tacne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1.

Rosalie had what she wanted, and Bella would never come to take the creature from her. I wondered if that\u0027s what the poisonous blonde had been hoping for all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held something dark in her hands, and there was a greedy sucking sound coming from the tiny murderer she held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent of blood in the air. Human blood. Rosalie was feeding it. Of course it would want blood. What else would you feed the kind of monster that would brutally mutilate its own mother? It might as well have been drinking Bella\u0027s blood. Maybe it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy strength came back to me as I listened to the sound of the little executioner feeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrength and hate and heat - red heat washing through my head, burning but erasing nothing. The images in my head were fuel, building up the inferno but refusing to be consumed. I felt the tremors rock me from head to toe, and I did not try to stop them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie was totally absorbed in the creature, paying no attention to me at all. She wouldn\u0027t be quick enough to stop me, distracted as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam had been right. The thing was an aberration - its existence went against nature. A black, soulless demon. Something that had no right to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething that had to be destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like the pull had not been leading to the door after all. I could feel it now, encouraging me, tugging me forward. Pushing me to finish this, to cleanse the world of this abomination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie would try to kill me when the creature was dead, and I would fight back. I wasn\u0027t sure if I would have time to finish her before the others came to help. Maybe, maybe not. I didn\u0027t much care either way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t care if the wolves, either set, avenged me or called the Cullens\u0027 justice fair. None of that mattered. All I cared about was my own justice. My revenge. The thing that had killed Bella would not live another minute longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Bella\u0027d survived, she would have hated me for this. She would have wanted to kill me personally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t care. She didn\u0027t care what she had done to me - letting herself be slaughtered like an animal. Why should I take her feelings into account?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was Edward. He must be too busy now - too far gone in his insane denial, trying to reanimate a corpse - to listen to my plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I wouldn\u0027t get the chance to keep my promise to him, unless - and it was not a wager I\u0027d put money on - I managed to win the fight against Rosalie, Jasper, and Alice, three on one. But even if I did win, I didn\u0027t think I had it in me to kill Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I didn\u0027t have enough compassion for that. Why should I let him get away from what he\u0027d done? Wouldn\u0027t it be more fair - more satisfying - to let him live with nothing, nothing at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made me almost smile, as filled with hate as I was, to imagine it. No Bella. No killer spawn. And also missing as many members of his family as I was able to take down. Of course, he could probably put those back together, since i wouldn\u0027t be around to burn them. Unlike Bella, who would never be whole again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if the creature could be put back together. I doubted it. It was part Bella, too - so it must have inherited some of her vulnerability. I could hear that in the tiny, thrumming beat of its heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts heart was beating. Hers wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a second had passed as I made these easy decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trembling was getting tighter and faster. I coiled myself, preparing to spring at the blond vampire and rip the murderous thing from her arms with my teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie cooed at the creature again, setting the empty metal bottle-thing aside and lifting the creature into the air to nuzzle her face against its cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect. The new position was perfect for my strike. I leaned forward and felt the heat begin to change me while the pull toward the killer grew - it was stronger than I\u0027d ever felt it before, so strong it reminded me of an Alpha\u0027s command, like it would crush me if I didn\u0027t obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I wanted to obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe murderer stared past Rosalie\u0027s shoulder at me, its gaze more focused than any newborn creature\u0027s gaze should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarm brown eyes, the color of milk chocolate - the exact same color that Bella\u0027s had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shaking jerked to a stop; heat flooded through me, stronger than before, but it was a new kind of heat - not a burning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a glowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything inside me came undone as I stared at the tiny porcelain face of the half-vampire, half-human baby. All the lines that held me to my life were sliced apart in swift cuts, like clipping the strings to a bunch of balloons. Everything that made me who I was - my love for the dead girl upstairs, my love for my father, my loyalty to my new pack, the love for my other brothers, my hatred for my enemies, my home, my name, my se/f - disconnected from me in that second - snip, snip, snip - and floated up into space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not left drifting. A new string held me where I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot one string, but a million. Not strings, but steel cables. A million steel cables all tying me to one thing\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- to the very center of the universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see that now - how the universe swirled around this one point. I\u0027d never seen the symmetry of the universe before, but now it was plain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gravity of the earth no longer tied me to the place where I stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the baby girl in the blond vampire\u0027s arms that held me here now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRenesmee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom upstairs, there was a new sound. The only sound that could touch me in this endless instant. A frantic pounding, a racing beat...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA changing heart. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-4-breaking-dawn-twilight-4/page-19.html","bookId":2026,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:26 PM"}
