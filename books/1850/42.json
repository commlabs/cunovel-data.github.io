Floor to platform shelves stuffed full with books and CDs. A very nice stereo. A battered old chair and ottoman that wasn’t like the other furniture or equipment, not new, not stylish. There was a table next it, equally battered. A floor lamp behind the chair, its base going up and the shaded bulb drooping over the chair to provide light to read. A tatty, frayed old rug on the floor, so big, it filled the area. At the end, another cube, this paneled in a warm, worn wood, the door to it closed. That space was like it was from a different world, it didn’t fit, it seemed snug and cozy, inviting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit the bottom of the stairs and could delay no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes turned to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in the kitchen, bare-chested, coffee mug held aloft, eyes on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in that instant, it hit me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pros outweighed the cons. I wasn’t uncertain anymore. I was certain… very certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could be bossy and a lot of what he did freaked me out or pissed me off but when he was sweet, generous, sexy and open it was better than my best daydream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was good at daydreams, I’d spent a lot of time doing it, I made up the best daydreams ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo for reality to surpass that, certainty slotted in and when it did, it held firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rounded the horseshoe and saw he was wearing track pants, black with dark gray stripes down the sides, bare feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to him, right to him and didn’t stop until my body hit his, my arms slid around his waist and I pressed my face in the skin of his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere I mumbled, “Mornin’, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his arms glided around me, pulled me closer and he said into the top of my hair, “Mornin’, Sweet Pea. You sleep okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my head to press my cheek to his chest as I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” he murmured, giving me a squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Coffee?” he asked and I nodded against his chest again. “How do you take it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid my cheek against his warm skin as I tilted my head back to look at him, my brows going up when my eyes hit his black ones. “You don’t know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth twitched. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cream, half a sugar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows went up this time. “Half a sugar?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I save my sugar for when I eat it in cookie dough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, his arm tightening for a second as he did then he kept looking down at me and I watched his eyes get lazy. I’d never seen that, his eyes getting lazy. It was sensational.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he bent his head, touched his lips to mine and let me go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved to the coffeepot at the counter by the wall and I moved to the horseshoe bar and leaned against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I used a toothbrush,” I informed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” he replied, grabbing a mug from some shelves that were fixed to the brick where there was a bunch of shiny, midnight blue stoneware, stainless steel utensils hanging from hooks off the bottom shelves, gleaming pots and pans on the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess he didn’t need me to buy him a new toothbrush and it also appeared from the near new look of his eating and cooking supplies, he didn’t cook or eat much at his lair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you move the furniture back and have football matches on Saturdays with your commandos?” I asked the brown skin over defined muscle of his back as he poured my coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he answered but I could hear the smile in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rugby?” I went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twisted to the fridge and opened it repeating, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Paintball?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took out the milk, closed the fridge and looked over his shoulder at me, grinning. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm,” I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished my coffee and brought it to me then rested a hip against the counter, his body facing mine, our bodies touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a sip from my coffee as he did the same with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made good coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You make good coffee,” I shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head back to look at him. “And you’re tidy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows drew together. “I’m tidy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your bathroom is clean, there isn’t a tangle of cargos and skintight shirts all over the floor of your bed platform and your stockpiles of guns and ammo have obviously been cleared away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dimples popped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he replied, “Disordered house, disordered mind, disordered life, babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was true. I knew it because Dad had taught me that and it was also a principle I lived by which was why my living room drove me batty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t picture you cleaning,” I shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t. Janine does it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Janine?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Takes care of this place, takes care of base. Janine’s in charge of order so I can focus on other shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm,” I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe employed a lot of people. He drove a top of the line Camaro. He installed elaborate security systems. He could afford expensive, designer shoes. He could heat a cavernous warehouse to the point he could walk around barefoot and bare-chested and I was comfortable in only his shirt and a thong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You live in an old warehouse,” I pointed out the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he agreed to the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a lot of space, Hawk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot of space,” I went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned then took a sip of coffee. I did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his mug came away from his lips, he stated, “Don’t like close. Need room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you’ve got it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned again, put down his coffee mug, took mine from my hand, put that down too and then moved into me at the front, his hands sliding around at my waist to my back, wrapping around and pulling me to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested my hands on his chest and looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re cute in the morning,” he told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cute and sweet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm,” I mumbled, glad he thought that but I’d always been a morning person. I was a night person too. I was an anytime person when I wasn’t stressy and in a bad mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his hands left my back and I watched his eyes get heated and intense as they studied my face. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mystery-man-dream-man-1/page-42.html","bookId":1850,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM"}
