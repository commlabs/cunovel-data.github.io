When I revert to not being so studly, she relaxes, stretches, groans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to get something to eat,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, are you famished?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beyond famished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I saw that movie.\" I grin, faux-mischievously. \"What about room service?\" I suggest, my voice deepening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stands there, contemplating something, glances back at the TV, then her eyes carefully scan the ceiling. Finally she murmurs, \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go out for dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now? It\u0027s only five,\" I point out. \"Is anything open yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a place,\" she murmurs. Something on the ceiling, in the corner, dominates Jamie\u0027s attention and she moves toward it, reaching up, then-realizing something-stops herself. She turns around, tries to smile, but apparently she can\u0027t help it: the room seems to worry her in some way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, it\u0027s just a set,\" I\u0027m saying. \"Forget about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the restaurant doesn\u0027t serve until 6 Jamie gets us into Le Caprice at 5:30 with a cryptic phone call she makes in the cab on the way to Arlington Square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was supposed to have dinner with Amanda Harlech but I think this will be much more, er, interesting,\" she says, tucking the cell phone back into her handbag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s me,\" I say. \"A blast from the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile sitting across the table from her in Le Caprice I\u0027m aware that Jamie Fields is so beautiful that she\u0027s starting to blow away whatever residual memories of Lauren Hynde I might have held on to and after knocking back a martini and some white wine we order crab-and-corn chowder and a plate of chargrilled squid and the two of us start relaxing into the moment, only briefly interrupted on Jamie\u0027s part by a few giant yawns and a slightly deadened look behind those very cool blue eyes. I order another martini, momentarily thinking, This is gonna be so easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you go after shooting today?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a Himalayan rejuvenation treatment at Aveda in Harvey Nichols,\" she says. \"I needed it. I deserved it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool, hip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what arc you doing in London, Victor?\" she asks. \"How did you find me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby,\" I\u0027m saying, \"it was purely accidental.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" she says somewhat dubiously. \"What were you doing on the set this morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just browsing, doing some shopping in Nothing Hill, minding my own business and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Notting Hill, Victor,\" Jamie says, motioning to a waiter for more bread. \"Notting Hill.\" Continue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her, sending out vibes; some hurtle back at me, others land softly, sticking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s waving a hand in front of my face. \"Hello? Victor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah,\" I say, blinking. \"Um, could you repeat the question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How-did-you-find-me?\" she asks tensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just stumbled onto... things, y\u0027know?\" I squint, making an airy motion with my hands, hoping it clarifies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds like you but I\u0027m not buying it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay,\" I say, grinning sexily at her, leaning in, seeing how far I can push this mode. \"Someone at a party-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor,\" she interrupts, \"you\u0027re a very good-looking guy. You don\u0027t need to push it with me, okay? I get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sexy grin fades and I sit back and take a sip of the martini, then carefully wipe my lips with a napkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Proceed,\" she says, arms crossed, staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone at a party I was at mentioned, um, something,\" I say, distracted, shrugging everything off. \"Maybe it was at the Groucho Club.
