A thunderbolt was about to strike Hollywood with a vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmerica\u0027s alliance with Russia had ended and a Red Scare swept the U.S. An ambitious senator named Joseph McCarthy sensed an opportunity to make himself important. One day, he announced that there were communists in the Army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many?\" he was asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hundreds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy\u0027s answer created a furor and he was on the covers of magazines and on the front pages of newspapers everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis next announcement was that he had discovered communists in the Navy and defense industries, and each time he gave an interview to the press, the numbers kept changing - always growing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn investigative committee was formed by J. Parnell Thomas and a small group of congressmen. It was called HUAC - the House Un-American Activities Committee. The committee first targeted a group of Hollywood screenwriters, accusing them of being members of the Communist Party and inserting communist propaganda into their screenplays. Witnesses were subpoenaed to appear for hearings before the committee, in Washington.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs McCarthy\u0027s fame increased, he became more reckless. Innocent people who were being accused of being communists lost their jobs, with no chance to defend themselves. Defense industries and other businesses were investigated by the committee, but Hollywood had the highest profile, and the committee took advantage of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writers, producers, and directors called to testify had three choices: They could admit they were communists and name names; they could deny they were communists; or they could refuse to testify and face imprisonment. The committee was ruthless. They insisted that if any of the people brought before them admitted they were communists, they must then name fellow communists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen accused writers who refused to answer the committee\u0027s questions were sent to jail. In addition, 324 people were blacklisted in the industry, and hundreds of innocent lives were destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Hollywood, the studio heads held a secret meeting to decide how to put the best face on what was happening. They made an announcement that they would not employ anyone who was in the Communist Party. This was the beginning of a ten-year blacklist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDore Schary, who was running RKO studios, boldly declared that he would quit before firing a writer accused of being a communist. Shortly after that, when the committee named a writer working at RKO, Schary fired him. The members of the Screenwriters Guild were outraged. Schary asked for a chance to explain his position to the writers. The guild auditorium was packed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to remind all of you,\" Schary said, \"that I\u0027m a writer, too. That\u0027s how I got started. I know a lot of you expected me to resign as head of RKO when they forced me to fire one of my writers. The reason I didn\u0027t was that I felt that staying on as head of the studio, I can do more to protect you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was when he lost his audience. His self-serving speech brought boos and hisses, and the meeting abruptly ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning in the midst of all of this, Marvin Schenck, a studio executive who was a relative of Nicholas Schenck, called me into his office. No one was sure exactly what Marvin Schenck\u0027s job was, but there was a rumor that he was getting paid three thousand dollars a week to look out his window and raise the alarm if he saw a glacier moving toward the studio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarvin was in his late forties, a small balding man, with the charisma of an undertaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Sidney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me and said, accusingly, \"Did you vote for Albert Maltz at the Writers Guild meeting last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had had a meeting the night before to elect a new board of directors. It was a closed meeting, but I was so startled by the question that I didn\u0027t think to ask him how he knew how I had voted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you vote for Maltz?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just read a novel of his, The Journey of Simon McKeever. It\u0027s a beautifully written book and we need good writers like him on the guild\u0027s board.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who told you to vote for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting angry. \"No one told me to vote for him. I told you why I voted for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone must have told you to vote for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice was raised. \"Marvin - I just told you I voted for him because he\u0027s a damned good writer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied a sheet of paper in front of him and then looked up. \"Have you been going around the studio the last few weeks, raising money for the children of the Hollywood Ten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when I lost it. What he was saying was true. I had started with my own contribution and then had gone around the studio raising more money to take care of the children whose fathers had been jailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t lose my temper often, but when I do, it erupts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m guilty, Marvin. I shouldn\u0027t have done that. Let the damned kids starve. If their fathers are in prison, the kids don\u0027t deserve to eat. Let them all die!\" I was screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down,\" he said. \"Calm down. I want you to go home and try to remember who told you to vote for Albert Maltz. I\u0027ll see you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stormed out of the office. I felt violated. The indignity of what was happening was lacerating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got no sleep that night. I tossed and turned and finally came to a decision. At nine o\u0027clock in the morning, I went back into Marvin Schenck\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I quit,\" I said. \"You can tear up my contract. I don\u0027t want to work at this studio anymore.\" I started toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute. Don\u0027t be hasty. I talked to New York this morning. They said if you\u0027ll sign a statement that you\u0027re not a communist and have never been a member of the Communist Party, this whole thing will be forgotten.\" He handed me a piece of paper. \"Will you sign this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at it and started to calm down. \"Yes,\" I said, \"because I\u0027m not a communist and I\u0027ve never been a communist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a humiliating experience, but nothing compared to what so many innocent people went through during that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will never forget the dozens of talented friends of mine who would never work in Hollywood again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn February of 1948, the Academy Award nominations were announced. I was one of five nominees, for writing the original screenplay of The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer. I started to receive congratulations from my fellow workers, my agent, and friends, but I knew something they did not know: I had no chance of winning the Oscar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pictures I was up against were extremely popular. They included Chaplin\u0027s Monsieur Verdoux, A Double Life, Body and Soul, and the powerful foreign picture Shoeshine. Just being a nominee was honor enough. I wondered which one of them would win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got a call from Dona Holloway, congratulating me on my nomination. Dona and I had become good friends. We often went to the theater together, or a concert, and she was always interesting company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning of the Oscars, Dona telephoned. She had recently left William Morris and had gone to Columbia Studios as Harry Cohn\u0027s personal assistant, and I felt that Cohn was lucky to have her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting ready to go to the Oscars?\" Dona asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded shocked. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dona, I don\u0027t have a chance of winning. Why should I sit there and be embarrassed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If everyone felt the way you do,\" she said, \"there wouldn\u0027t be anyone there to receive an Oscar. You have to go. What do you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. Why not be a good sport and applaud the winner? \"Will you go with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet I will. I want to see you up on that stage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Twentieth Annual Academy Awards were held at the Shrine Auditorium. The awards were not televised then, but they were carried by two hundred ABC radio stations and the Armed Forces Radio Network. The auditorium was packed. Dona and I took our seats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you nervous?\" Dona asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was no. This was not my evening. This evening belonged to one of the other writers who would get an Oscar. I was a spectator. I had no reason to be nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ceremonies began. The winners began stepping up to the stage to receive their Oscars and I sat back, relaxed, enjoying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, they came to the award for best original screenplay. George Murphy, an actor who had starred in many movie musicals, announced, \"The nominees are . . . Abraham Polonsky, for Body and Soul . . . Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, A Double Life . . . Sidney Sheldon, The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer . . . Charles Chaplin, Monsieur Verdoux . . . and Sergio Amidei, Adolfo Franci, Cesare Giulio Viola, and Cesare Zavattini for Shoeshine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Murphy opened the envelope. \"And the winner is . . . Sidney Sheldon, for The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat frozen in my seat. Any nominee with half a brain would have prepared a just-in-case speech. I had prepared nothing. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Murphy called my name again, \"Sidney Sheldon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDona was prodding me. \"Get up there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up in a daze and stumbled toward the stage, while the audience applauded. I walked up the steps and George Murphy shook my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Murphy said, \"Mr. Sheldon, in the interests of science and posterity, would you mind telling us where you got this original idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could I not have prepared something? Anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was staring at him. \"Er - well - when I was back in New York, they had a lot of - you know - bobby-soxers around, and watching them gave me the idea that there might be a picture in it. So, I - I put it together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not believe the asininity of what I was saying. I felt like a complete fool. I finally pulled myself together long enough to thank the cast and Irving Reis. I thought about Dore Schary and whether I should mention his name. He had behaved disgracefully and I was angry with him. On the other hand, he had co-produced the movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". . . and Dore Schary,\" I added. I accepted my Oscar and stumbled off the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got back to my seat, Dona said, \"That\u0027s so wonderful. How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did I feel? I felt more depressed than I had ever felt in my life. I felt as though I had stolen something from people who deserved it more than I did. I felt like a phony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe awards went on, but from that moment, what was happening on the stage became a blur. Ronald Colman was holding an Oscar and talking about A Double Life. Loretta Young was thanking everyone for The Farmer\u0027s Daughter. Everything seemed to go on forever. I could not wait to get out of there. On what should have been the happiest night of my life, I was suicidal. I have to see a psychiatrist, I thought. Something is wrong with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe psychiatrist\u0027s name was Dr. Judd Marmer. He had been recommended to me by friends who had consulted him. I knew that he had many patients in show business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Marmer was a large, earnest man, with silver-gray hair and probing, blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Sheldon, what can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of how I had run away from the meeting with the psychologist at Northwestern University.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said honestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you come to see me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a problem and I don\u0027t know what it is. I have a job I like at MGM. I\u0027m making a lot of money. I won an Oscar a few days ago and - \" I shrugged. \"I\u0027m just not happy. I\u0027m depressed. I fought hard to get there, and I succeeded and . . . there\u0027s no \u0027there.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. Do you get depressed often?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes,\" I said, \"but everyone does. I\u0027m probably wasting your time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have plenty of time. Tell me about some of the things that have depressed you in the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about all the times when I should have felt happy, and instead felt miserable, and all the times when I should have been depressed and was happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, when I was in New York, a songwriter named Max Rich . . .\" I talked and he listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever felt suicidal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sleeping pills from Afremow\u0027s drugstore . . . You can\u0027t stop me, because if you stop me now I\u0027ll do it tomorrow . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you feel a loss of self-esteem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a feeling of worthlessness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you feel that you don\u0027t deserve your success?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was reading my mind. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have feelings of inadequacy and guilt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me.\" He leaned forward and pressed a button on the intercom. \"Miss Cooper, tell my next patient that there will be a delay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a cold chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Marmer turned to look at me. \"Mr. Sheldon, you\u0027re suffering from manic depression.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated the sound of it. \"What exactly does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a brain deviation that involves episodes of serious mania and depression, where moods swing from euphoria to despair. It feels as though there\u0027s a thin screen between you and the world. So, in a sense, you\u0027re an outsider looking in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth was dry. \"How serious is it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Manic-depressive illness can have a devastating effect on people. At least two million Americans suffer from it, one in ten families. For some reason, it seems to strike artistic people. Vincent Van Gogh had it, Herman Melville, Edgar Allan Poe, Virginia Woolf, to name a few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made me feel no better. That was their problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long will it take to cure it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause. \"There is no cure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to panic. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best we can do is to try to control it with drugs.\" He hesitated. \"The problem is that sometimes there are bad side effects. Approximately one in five people who are manic-depressive eventually commit suicide. Twenty to fifty percent attempt suicide at least once. It\u0027s a major contributing factor in thirty thousand suicides a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there, listening, feeling suddenly sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There will be times when, with no warning, you will lose control of your words and your actions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was finding it hard to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Marmer continued. \"There are various forms of the disorder. Some people can go weeks, months, or years with no extreme ups and downs. They have periods of normal moods. That type is classified as \u0027euthymia.\u0027 I believe that\u0027s the form you have. Unfortunately, as I said, there is no cure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow at least what was happening to me had a name. He gave me a prescription and I left his office, shaken. And then I thought, He doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s talking about. I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m fine. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-other-side-of-me/page-18.html","bookId":2371,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM"}
