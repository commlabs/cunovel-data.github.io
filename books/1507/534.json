Fear inundated their hearts; this shadow of death which lurked over them far exceeded the mission they had been given by Patriarch Huyan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout the slightest hesitation, the three Nascent Soul Cultivators turned and used their most powerful escape arts to flee at top speed. They went all out. One of them, of the mid Nascent Soul stage, crushed a violet-colored jade slip between his fingers, causing a violet glow to surround his body and then propel him away with explosive speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother mid Nascent Soul Cultivator, having witnessed the failure of Sir Wu’s blood escape art, and how he was even injured by using it, didn’t dare to use the same technique. Instead, he drew upon the life power of his own Nascent Soul, ignoring the fact that it began to wither as a result. He shot away at incredible speed off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final Cultivator had the highest Cultivation base of all, the late Nascent Soul stage. As he fled, he produced a crude Feng Shui compass from his bag of holding which he tossed out in front of him. It immediately emanated three glowing bands of light which stabbed into the air up ahead and then… ripped open a fissure!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout looking back, he dove into the fissure, the only thing on his mind being escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already completely shaken and filled with ultimate dread by Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Huyan Qing, he was completely stunned by everything that had just happened. His body was shaking and his breath came in ragged pants. His scalp was numb, and his heart was filled with intense regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Sir Wu explode caused his face to drain of blood, and cold sweat to break out all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao flicked his sleeve, sweeping away the gore that was all that remained of Sir Wu. At the same time, he pointed out with his right index finger. Instantly, several drops of blood flew toward him from the mass of gore that was flying in the opposite direction. It congealed on his fingertip into a glittering drop of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis blood was heart blood produced by the death of a great circle Nascent Soul Cultivator. Meng Hao looked at the blood for a moment and then flung his hand, causing it to split into three parts that shot toward the fleeing Cultivator who was surrounded by the Violet Qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drop of blood transformed into a streak of red as it shot through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Meng Hao made a grasping motion with his hand. The Devil Spear appeared along with an excited howling sound. Instantly, black mist roiled out, filled with ferocious faces. Strangely, once the faces saw Meng Hao standing there, they began to tremble and suddenly grew very quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao hefted the spear and then tossed it out into the air. Instantly, the ferocious faces within the mist once again began to howl as they shot toward the cultivator who was burning his Nascent Soul in order to flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving done these things, Meng Hao looked over at the late Nascent Soul Cultivator who was now already halfway through the fissure in the air. The fissure itself seemed to be on the verge of closing. Meng Hao slapped his bag of holding, causing an emerald glow to appear. Suddenly, a very ordinary looking fishing rod appeared in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he held the fishing rod, Meng Hao’s entire aura changed. It grew blurry, as if his body were somehow merging into the air around him. When Huyan Qing looked at him, he got a cold feeling, as if he were looking at some sort of predator that he was helpless to resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept, this was not a predator. This was a crushing power from a life force that was levels above him, something that could wrest away his life at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was impossible to perfectly describe the feeling in Huyan Qing’s heart. He was panting, and his body was trembling. The fear he was experiencing now far exceeded any fear he had felt before in his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t just him who was feeling such fear. The two fleeing mid Nascent Soul stage old men were also trembling, and could sense a pressure bearing down on them that far exceeded their own level. It quickly enveloped their entire hearts and minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir bodies trembled, and their souls shook. Their Karma… was suddenly visible!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost frightened of all was the late Nascent Soul Cultivator who had just passed through the fissure. Although he was on the other side of the fissure from nightmarish Meng Hao, in a different world, the trembling of his soul had reached an intense peak. It was as if some incredible, irresistible coldness were blasting across his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s expression was calm as he gripped the fishing rod. The world suddenly looked different, colorless. However, bright, colorful lights were visible on top of the heads of the people in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked at Huyan Qing. On top of the man’s head was a mass of bright, colorful threads, all grouped together. Shockingly, one of the threads was bright red, and incredibly thick. It was clearly different than the other threads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, Huyan Qing’s body was trembling violently. Meng Hao’s gaze and aura were thousands of times more terrifying than they had been before. His look earlier had merely been a threat, but this time, Huyan Qing felt as if his soul were growing cold. It was as if his entire life, all his secrets, were clearly visible to Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to him that all Meng Hao had to do was wish it, and he would instantly die. He could also tell that such a death would not be an ordinary death, which filled him with indescribable fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if… death was frightening enough as it was, but dying at Meng Hao’s hands would be infinitely more miserable and horrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Meng Hao looked at the other two fleeing mid Nascent Soul Cultivators, they experienced the exact same feeling as Huyan Qing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao could clearly see the brightly colorful threads attached to the tops of their heads. They too had an incredibly thick, red thread that was different from the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose thick threads caused Meng Hao’s face to flicker almost undetectably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So these are Karma threads,” murmured Meng Hao. He looked at the trembling old man on the other side of the disappearing fissure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had even more threads attached to his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What a pity,” said Meng Hao, shaking his head. “Based on my understanding of Karma, I can’t do what Ji Nineteen did, and sever the Karma…. However….” His eyes glinting fiercely, he waved the fishing rod out in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, a fishing line flew out. It moved so fast that it didn’t seem to move at all. It instantly appeared in front of the trembling old late Nascent Soul Cultivator. The old man suddenly felt something infinitely terrifying. Others could not hear the bloodcurdling scream that came out from his mouth, but Meng Hao could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao saw the line wrap around the old man. When he pulled back on the line, the man’s soul was ripped out of his body. His Nascent Soul rapidly withered, and his body turned pale white as he died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the fishing line returned to Meng Hao, he reached out and grabbed the soul, then crushed it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the soul dissipated, Meng Hao’s mind filled with a roaring sound. All of a sudden, he realized that he had a much deeper comprehension of Karma now, although he wasn’t sure he could explain exactly how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Huyan Qing saw everything that was happening, he could only scream with intense terror. The other two mid Nascent Soul Cultivators were shaking as they fled madly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e------\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote from Er Gen: Only 2,000 Chinese characters.
