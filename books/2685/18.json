School’s great,” he says, slowly losing his patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s Graham?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Graham?” He stares at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Graham.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is Graham?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you have a friend named Graham?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. I thought you did.” I take a large swallow of Mai Tai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Graham?” he asks, looking directly at me. “I don’t know anybody named Graham.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug this time, looking away. There are four fags sitting at the table across from us, one of them a well-known TV actor, and they are all drunk and two of them keep staring admiringly at Tim, who is oblivious. Tim recrosses his legs, bites at another nail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s your mother?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s great,” he says, his foot beginning to shake up and down so fast it’s blurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Darcy and Melanie?” I ask, grasping at anything. I’ve almost finished the Mai Tai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They get kind of irritating,” he says, looking behind me, in a monotone, his face a mask. “All they seem to do is drive down to Häagen-Dazs and flirt with this total geek who works there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle for a moment, unsure if I was supposed to. I get the waiter’s attention and order a third Mai Tai. The waiter brings it quickly and once he lays it down, our silence ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember when we used to come here, during the summer?” I ask, trying to ingratiate myself with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kind of,” he says plainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When was the last time we were all here together?” I wonder out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t really remember,” he says without thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it was two years ago. In August?” I’m guessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“July,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right,” I say. “That’s right. It was the weekend of the Fourth.” I laugh. “Remember the time we all went scuba diving and your mother dropped the camera overboard?” I ask, still chuckling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I remember are the fights,” he says dispassionately, staring at me. I stare back for as long as I can, then I have to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the fags whispers something to another fag and they both look over at Tim and laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go to the bar,” I suggest, signing the check the waiter must have set down when he brought the third Mai Tai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever,” he says, getting up quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m pretty drunk now and I’m weaving through a courtyard unevenly, Tim at my side. In the bar, an old Hawaiian woman dressed in a flowered robe, her neck thick with leis, plays “Hawaiian Wedding Song” on a ukelele. There are a few couples sitting at some of the tables and two well-dressed women, maybe in their early thirties, sitting alone at the bar. I motion for Tim to follow me. We take the two stools next to the women in their early thirties. I lean toward Tim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whaddya think?” I whisper, nudging him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About what?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whaddya think I mean?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About what?” He looks at me irritably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next to us. Them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim looks over at the two women, flinches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePausing, I stare at him, dumbfounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you go out with girls? What is this?” I’m still whispering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shhh. Don’t you date? Go dating?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorority girls and stuff, but …” He shudders. “What are you asking me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender comes over to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll have a Mai Tai,” I say, hoping I’m not slurring words. “What about you, Tim?” I ask, slapping him on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about me?” Tim asks back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What-do-you-want-to-drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. A Mai Tai, I guess. Whatever,” he says, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the women, the taller one, with auburn hair, smiles at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Odds look good,” I say, nudging him. “The odds look pretty good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What odds? What are you talking about?” Tim asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch this.” Leaning against the bar, I turn toward the two women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, ladies—what are you drinking tonight?” I ask. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-informers/page-18.html","bookId":2685,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:55 AM"}
