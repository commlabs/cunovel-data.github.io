The inheritance of an official Magus is a sufficient reason for this fellowship to be broken!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJayden spoke slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not only that!” Now, the metal liquid covered Bosain’s body and turned into a silver white armour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it was just a spell model, Grine Water or something of that sort, I wouldn\u0027t mind at all. But this is Norco Curadu Sfar’s legacy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain’s face became flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are talking about the great Magus Serholm! The inheritance of a rank 4 Morning Star Magus!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The great Magus Serholm?!” Clarity appeared on Jayden’s face. Of course, he had heard of the legend of this great Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in the legends, the great Magus Serholm used an alternative title. Apart from Leylin who had an overpowered way to store data and Bosain who had a solid family foundation, there were many who weren\u0027t aware of this fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since you know the reason, you can die in peace!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain did not conceal the killing intent on his face as he viciously slashed the silver white sword down upon Jayden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Hua!* The longsword split into countless small silver needles that were sent flying towards Jayden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e”Form a shield!” Jayden shouted. More vines appeared from the badge and took the form of a large shield, in front of Jayden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Ding Ding Dang Dang!* Countless needles fell like rain onto his shield, creating many small holes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge impact sent Jayden staggering backwards. His face became filled with despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jayden! I know all of your tricks. Apart from your magic artifact what other trump cards do you have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain spoke these words to try and shatter Jayden’s confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJayden retreated until his back hit a wall, then he turned his head and shouted to Leylin. “Leylin! Let\u0027s act together! If not we will both die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leylin! Don\u0027t believe him! If you can stay neutral and be on the sidelines, or even help me, I swear that you will obtain the friendship of the Lilytell family!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter listening to the persuasion of both sides, Leylin appeared panic-stricken; he staggered back two steps and spoke in a quivering voice. “No! I don\u0027t want any inheritance anymore, just let me go….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter hearing those words, Jayden’s face looked even more aghast and anxious. Even his vine shield had become smaller in size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain, on the other hand, laughed loudly. “Haha… My Lilytell family will definitely welcome a Potions Master like Leylin…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As for you Jayden! You\u0027re finished!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe longsword in Bosain’s hands split again and each droplet of liquid metal floated in the air, turning into dart-like objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With my blood....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter seeing the opponent’s attack, hopelessness surfaced on Jayden’s face. He used the same method as before and smeared his blood on the green badge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant, the green vine shield turned into a red giant one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The energy in your badge should deplete soon huh? Even if you use your blood as a substitute how long can you last?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain shouted and sent countless needles flying towards Jayden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red shield exploded and the innumerable needles pierced Jayden’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith countless holes present all over his body, Jayden was immediately dyed red. Regret and disbelief filled his face as he fell slowly to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hu hu…” Bosain was panting somewhat loudly at this moment. He turned around and faced Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well done! You did not attack me with him earlier!” With a sinister smile, Bosain pointed at Jayden who laid within a pool of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I, the heir to the Lilytell family, the pride of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, the silver white swordsman Bosain will grant you your preferred choice of death!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke, a commiserating yet toying expression appeared on his face; he was like a lion or tiger who was playing with a rabbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Choice… Way to die....” Leylin squeezed out a smile, “Mister Bosain, I don\u0027t quite understand you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My meaning is extremely clear, you can only die here!” Bosain’s expression was cold, “The inheritance of the great Magus Serholm is too important. I cannot allow the possibility of you leaking any information!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Originally, as a genius in Potioneering, you had a bright future. What a pity…” Bosain looked at Leylin regretfully, as if feeling sorry for his plight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps, you would like to end your own life … It might reduce some of the pain…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain edged closer and closer to Leylin, his voice gentle yet enticing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere seemed to be a magical force in his voice, luring Leylin to do things the way he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s eyes went blank, his lips unconsciously formed the following, “I want to…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s going to be a success!” exclaimed Bosain, gleefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Leylin raised his head and grinned, revealing a pair of bright and shiny teeth, he said, “I want you dead!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA silver streak flew from Leylin’s hand onto Bosain’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock filled Bosain’s face, but a layer of liquid metal automatically formed a mask, protecting his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Ka-Cha!* The silver light skid against the mask, emitting sparks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A pity that it’s a magic artifact with instantaneous defensive capabilities!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked at Bosain who was retreating, his face showed a hint of regret and disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You… You were pretending earlier!” Bosain touched his face which had already swollen, and his expression began to contort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Such a boring illusory spell! I was not afraid of it when I was a level 2 acolyte!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin smiled brightly, “This look suits you very well! Like a pig head!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re seeking death!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain’s face was flushed from anger; the liquid metal crept and covered his whole body, forming a silver armour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were a little bloodshot as he brandished his longsword and charged towards Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to pluck each and every tendon from your body, you useless trash who only knows Potioneering!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin frowned. A black longbow appeared in his hands and a frost arrow was shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Sssii!* Bosain did not dodge nor hide, letting the arrow land on his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frost arrow was blocked by the silver armour and turned into a white mist that covered the surface of Bosain’s armour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuffering from its effect, Bosain’s speed had lowered somewhat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have been watching you all along — all the potions in your bag should have been fully used up, am I right?” Bosain smiled maliciously, directly rushing at Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An accurate guess!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s smile did not waver, which suddenly made Bosain feel a bad premonition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is unfortunate, but my trump card is not related to potions!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fallen Star Pendant! Activate!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with Leylin’s command, a layer of silver-grey light radiated from his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis layer seemed like starlight, dim but sturdy and unwavering. It covered Leylin’s body forming a silver-grey armour all over him. On the surface of this armour, a few gems were flickering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain struck with his longsword, but he was blocked directly and grabbed by Leylin’s right hand, which was covered by the armour. Following which, Leylin viciously punched Bosain’s face!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Ka-Cha!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mask on Bosain’s face dented inwards and he immediately spat out several teeth as he flew backwards with a look of disbelief on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As expected using fists to hit someone feels the best!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin narrows his eyes and spoke with some satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Hua La La!* Bosain crashed into a few empty bookshelves and they toppled over him. Numerous decomposing wooden boards buried Bosain within the rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!* The wooden boards were blasted away. Once again Bosain stood before Leylin with his bright silver armour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have underestimated you! A defensive type magic artifact! You are actually the one amongst us with the most secrets!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain’s face now was extremely solemn. However, with two swollen lumps on both sides of his face, Leylin felt like laughing when he saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too much nonsensical stuff has been said!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s muscles bulged and he clashed with Bosain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!* *Bang!* *Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooming noises sounded from the study room, sending dust flying everywhere. Through the barely visible dust screen, two humanoid creatures wearing armour could be seen charging at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two creatures seemed not to be afraid of injuries. They only used the most brutal and barbaric fighting style — completely forsaking their defence, each one simply attacked his opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBookshelves collapsed continuously and chaos ensued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf not for the two creatures deliberately avoiding the middle study-table containing the remnants, it, too, would have shared the fate of those bookshelves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the seconds turning into minutes, it could be seen that the human figure — the one with the bright silver armour — seemed to be at a disadvantage. The white light on it, too, had somewhat dimmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, with a punch from the person armoured a silver-grey, the bright silver armour broke, turning back into its liquid metal form, and then it was restored to its original ball-shaped form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin once again stomped on Bosain who was on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Crack!*, the sound of breaking bones could be heard from Bosain’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter which, a shoe coated in silver-grey light nonchalantly stepped on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne corner of Bosain’s lips was overflowing with blood, “I regret this! If only my scroll was still here, if only I didn’t use ‘silver light’ so many times earlier!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Ka-Cha!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s eyes were devoid of emotion. He showed no quarter towards Bosain and withdrew a dagger from his robes and severed all 4 of Bosain’s limbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Arghh….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain’s facial muscles contorted, and cries of anguish reverberated in the whole study room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin kicked the severed limbs away and took out a hemostasis potion, after which he took out a hemostasis potion and poured it on Bosain’s wound — he wasn’t going to let Bosain bleed to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You...Just kill me!” Bosain’s face was extremely pale as he forced the words out from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could I have the audacity to kill a member of the mighty Lilytell family?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin smiled slightly, yet to Bosain, it seemed to be a very sinister and sadistic smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As the heir of a Magus family, you would definitely have some tracking spell cast on you by an official Magus. It is very likely that once I killed you, that official Magus would be able to sense it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin spoke slowly. At the same time, Bosain’s expression turned completely ashen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-115\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-117\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-116","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
