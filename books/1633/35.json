They’ve breached the perimeter. Fall back! Fall back! If anyone can hear this: the Covenant is groundside. Massing near the armory . . . they’re—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief copied these files and sent them over his squad’s COM channel. They had a right to know everything, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one reason the Covenant would launch a ground invasion: to take out the planetary defense generators. If they succeeded, Reach would fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was only one reason why the Covenant wanted the ship Circumference —to plunder its NAV\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edatabase—and find every human world, including Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Keyes appeared on the view screen. He held his pipe in one hand, squeezing it so tight his knuckles were white. “Master Chief, I believe the Covenant will use a pinpoint Slipspace jump to a position just off the space dock. They may try to get their troops on the station before the Super MAC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eguns can take out their ships. This will be a difficult mission, Chief. I’m . . . open to suggestions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can take care of it,” the Master Chief replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Keyes’ eyes widened and he leaned forward in his command chair. “How exactly, Master Chief?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With all due respect, sir, Spartans are trained to handle difficult missions. I’ll split my squad. Three will board the space dock and make sure that NAV data does not fall into the Covenant’s hands. The remainder of the Spartans will go groundside and repel the invasion forces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Keyes considered this. “No, Master Chief, it’s too risky. We’ve got to make sure the Covenant doesn’t get that NAV data. We’ll use a nuclear mine, set it close to the docking ring, and detonate it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, the EMP will burn out the superconductive coils of the orbital guns. And if you use the Pillar of Autumn ’s conventional weapons, the NAV database may still survive. If the Covenant search the wreckage—they may obtain the data.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True,” Keyes said, and tapped his pipe thoughtfully on his chin. “Very well, Master Chief. We’ll go with your suggestion. I’ll plot a course over the docking station. Ready your Spartans and prep two dropships. We’ll launch you—” he consulted with Cortana “—in five minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, Captain. We’ll be ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good luck,” Captain Keyes said, and snapped off the view screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuck. The Master Chief always had been lucky. He’d need luck more than ever this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to face the Spartans . . . his Spartans. They stood at attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly stepped forward. “Master Chief sir, permission to lead the space op, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Denied,” he said. “I’ll be leading that one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe appreciated her gesture. The space operation would be ten times more dangerous than the ground op.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant would outnumber them ten to one—or more—but the Spartans were used to taking the fight against numerically superior enemies. They had always won on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe extraction of the Circumference database, however, would be in vacuum and zero gravity—and they might have to fight their way past a Covenant warship to reach the objective. Not exactly ideal conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Linda and James,” he said. “You’re with me. Fred, you’re Red Team Leader. You’ll have tactical command of the ground operation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir!” Fred shouted. “Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now make ready,” he said. “We don’t have much time left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief regretted his unfortunate choice of words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartans stood a moment. Kelly called out, “Attention!” They snapped to and gave the Master Chief a crisp salute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood straighter and returned their salute. He was intensely proud of them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartans scattered and gathered their gear, racing for the dropship bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief watched them go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the mission the Spartans had been tempered for in mission after mission. It would be their finest moment . . . but he knew that it might also be their last moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Mendez had said that a leader would be required to spend the lives of those under his command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief knew he would lose comrades today—but would their deaths serve a necessary purpose . . . or would they be wasted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, they were ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn tapped the thrusters and rotated the Pelican dropship 180 degrees. He pushed the engines to full power to brake their forward momentum. The Pillar of Autumn had dropped them while she had been cruising at one-third full speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d need every millimeter of the ten thousand kilometers between them and the docking station to slow down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief had taken the Spartan’s modified Pelican, rigged with explosives. The station would be locked down—every airlock sealed. They’d have to blast their way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced aft. Linda checked one of the three sniper rifle variants she had brought. James inspected his thruster pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had picked Linda because no other single Spartan was as efficient at long-range combat. And that’s what the Master Chief wanted: long -range combat. If it came to hand-to-hand combat in zero gee with hordes of Covenant troopers . . . even his luck wouldn’t hold out too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had picked James because James had never quit. Even when his hand had been burned off, he had shrugged off the shock—at least for a while—and helped them dispatch the Covenant behemoths on Sigma Octanus IV. The Master Chief would need that kind of determination on this mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a long look out the front of the Pelican. Their sister dropship initiated a burn and hurtled toward Reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly, Fred, Joshua . . . all of them. Part of him longed to join them in the ground action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radar panel blinked a proximity warning; the Pelican was one thousand kilometers from the docking ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief tapped the thrusters to align the dropship. He squelched the proximity alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alert immediately re-sounded. Strange. He reached for the squelch again—then stopped as he saw the space around the Pelican change. Motes of green light appeared, pinpoints at first, which swelled like bruises on velvet black space. The green smears lengthened, compressed, and distorted the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—a Slipstream entry point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief cut the Pelican’s engines, slowing them for impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Covenant frigate materialized a kilometer from the dropship’s nose. Its prow filled their view screen. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-fall-of-reach-halo-1/page-35.html","bookId":1633,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:12 PM"}
