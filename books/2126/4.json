{"id":93895,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u003cp\u003eThere were sounds of stirring in the back of the house. Marisol\u0027s parents. Rob glanced that way, then back out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to get to her somehow. Find her and get her out of there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get her out,\" Anna said quietly. It wasn\u0027t a question, it was a confirmation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to,\" Rob said. \"I don\u0027t know what she has in mind, but it\u0027s not going to work. Not in that house of lunatics. They\u0027re dangerous. They\u0027ll kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to see you,\" Kaitlyn said, and moved closer to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tell he wasn\u0027t buying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true. Look at me, feel my thoughts. I came here to see you, Gabriel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was taking a chance. But she had come to see him, that much was true, and after he\u0027d just saved her life she was genuinely glad to see him. He could sense that much safely. And she was betting he wouldn\u0027t search below the surface, because that would mean getting close, letting her sense him. She had the strong feeling he didn\u0027t want that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was looking at her hard, his gray eyes narrowed against the light. Beautiful north light, slanting around them, making the modest houses look enchanted, making even Gabriel look golden and warm. She could only guess how it made her look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel dropped his eyes. His psychic senses had brushed her mind as lightly as a moth\u0027s wing. \"So you came to see me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve missed you,\" Kaitlyn said, and that was also true. She\u0027d missed his razor wit and the mocking humor that glinted behind his eyes and his strength in the web. \"I want to join you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was such a whopping huge lie that she expected to feel the alarms going off in his head. But he\u0027d withdrawn his mental probing and veiled himself. He wouldn\u0027t even look at her properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" Gabriel said, in a voice suddenly gone weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn saw her advantage and pounced. \"I did. I decided last night. I don\u0027t like Mr. Z, but I think some of the things he says are true. We have infinite possibilities-we just need room. Freedom. And we are superior to other people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel seemed to have gathered himself. \"You don\u0027t go in for that stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why shouldn\u0027t I? I\u0027m tired of running. I want to be with you, and I want power. What\u0027s wrong with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth had gone hard. \"Nothing\u0027s wrong-only you don\u0027t believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Test me.\" Kaitlyn\u0027s heart was pounding with the risk. \"Gabriel, I didn\u0027t know what we had together until you left. I care about you.\" This was it, the time to see whether she was true Hollywood material. She stepped even closer to Gabriel, almost touching him. \"Believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he wanted, he could reach into her mind and rip the truth out. Her thin shields wouldn\u0027t hold against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t try to probe her brain. He kissed her instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn surrendered to the kiss deliberately-she knew she had to, and she felt a flash of triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmall-town girl makes good. A star is born!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the triumph was swept away by something much stronger and deeper. Something fierce and joyous-and pure. They were clinging together, he was holding her as hard as she was holding him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElectricity seemed to arc between them. Everywhere they touched Kaitlyn could feel the sparks. His hand tangled in her hair, and she was frighteningly moved by the tiny tugs, the little pain it caused as his fingers worked. His lips brushed against hers again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ache was starting inside Kaitlyn. They were together, together, so close, and she wanted to be closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA trembling thrill raced through her-and then a flash of light. His fingers were on the nape of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of light-it was beginning. The sparks becoming a blue-white torrent. In a moment the transfer point would open, and her energy would flood into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ultimate sharing-but she couldn\u0027t. Their minds would be open to each other. She would have no shields-he would see everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn tried to pull away ... but it didn\u0027t work. He was holding her and she couldn\u0027t seem to let go of him. She didn\u0027t have the will-and in a moment he would see-A garage door roared to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn jumped and was saved. Gabriel lifted his head, looking at a house near them. Kaitlyn took the moment to step away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world was coming to life around them. It wasn\u0027t dawn but daylight. The door to another house was opening; a cat was running up a walkway. No one had noticed the tall boy standing in the street kissing a girl, or the crumpled figure at their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they\u0027ll see us in a minute,\" Kaitlyn whispered. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked quickly. At the intersection, Kaitlyn looked at him. \"Which way to the Institute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really want to go there?\" He looked doubtful, but not contemptuous as before. She\u0027d convinced him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to be with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel was confused. Confused and vulnerable- there was something fragile in his eyes. \"But-I hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t want to.\" Kaitlyn was sure of that suddenly. She\u0027d thought so before, but now she was sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he said shortly. \"I don\u0027t know anything anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Forget about it.\" She could tell he was still bewildered, but she figured that was probably good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more off\" balance, the less he\u0027d be likely to analyze her. She was still dizzy and bewildered herself from that kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, what am I getting myself into?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to think about it later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Joyce still running things?\" Joyce Piper was the woman who\u0027d recruited them both last winter- who\u0027d made the Institute seem like a legitimate place. Even now Kaitlyn had a hard time believing she was as bad as Mr. Z.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you can call it running things. She\u0027s supposed to be in charge, but-well, you\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn felt a surge of victory, suppressed it. He wasn\u0027t arguing anymore. He was assuming she\u0027d come, and that they\u0027d let her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to do it, she thought. She suddenly realized that it was wonderful good luck that she was arriving with Gabriel. He was going to help her immeasurably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they neared the Institute she thought, stand tall, walk tall. She held her head up. The first time she\u0027d come here she\u0027d been overwhelmed by anxiety. Worry\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout her new roommates-would they like her, would they accept her? Now she had much more serious things to worry about, but she had a purpose. She knew she looked cool and confident, almost regal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached into her duffel bag and pulled out Marisol\u0027s sunglasses. Put them on, flicked back her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I\u0027m ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel glanced at her. \"Those new?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t figure Marisol needs them anymore.\" She saw him raise his eyebrows at her new hardheartedness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Institute was purple. Well, of course she remembered that, but it was still a shock to see how truly purple it was. A wild thrill of homesickness ran through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Gabriel said, and led her to the door. It was locked. He rattled in exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I forgot the key-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your new talent for breaking and entering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the door opened. Joyce was standing there, her short blond hair slick and wet. She was wearing a pink sweater and leggings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, an aura of energy surrounded her, as if she might suddenly spring into action at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer aquamarine eyes were sparkling with life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel, where have-\" She broke off, her eyes widening. She\u0027d seen Kaitlyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment they just stood and looked at each other. Under her cool exterior, Kaitlyn\u0027s heart was pounding. She had to convince Joyce, she had to. But she could feel the waves of suspicion radiating from the blond woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, Joyce had fooled her, had fooled all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Kaitlyn\u0027s turn. Kait felt just like one of those Federal agents infiltrating the Mafia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you know what they do to them, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joyce-\" she began, making her voice gentle and persuasive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce didn\u0027t even glance at her. \"Gabriel,\" she said in a grating whisper, \"get her the hell out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn stared at Joyce in dismay. There was a buzzing in her ears, and she couldn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel saved her. \"Wait until you hear what she has to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce glanced from one of them to the other. Finally she said, \"Did you get the crystal shard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t find it,\" Gabriel answered without any discernible pause. \"They have it hidden someplace else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what difference does it make?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What dif- \" Joyce clamped her lips together and threw a glance behind her, as if worried she\u0027d be overheard. \"The difference is that he\u0027s going to be here tonight, wanting it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, are you going to let us in or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce let out a stifled breath, turned her gem-hard eyes on Kaitlyn again. She gazed for a long moment, then she abruptly reached out and snatched the sunglasses from Kaitlyn\u0027s face. Kait was startled but wouldn\u0027t show it; she returned the aquamarine gaze steadily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Joyce said at last. \"Come in. But this had better be good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good if you want another clairvoyant,\" Gabriel said once they were in the living room. \"You know Frost isn\u0027t very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce sat down, one trim pink leg crossed over the other. \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding,\" she said shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to join you,\" Kaitlyn said. The buzzing was gone from her ears; she could speak in cool, nonchalant tones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure!\" Joyce said. Her tone was sarcastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would I bring her here if it wasn\u0027t true?\" Gabriel asked. He flashed one of his brilliant, unsettling smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Joyce could reply he added, \"I\u0027ve looked into her mind. She\u0027s sincere. So why don\u0027t we just cut the bull? I\u0027m hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would she want to join us?\" Joyce demanded. She looked shaken by Gabriel\u0027s conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn went through her speech about believing Mr. Z\u0027s theories about psychics and supreme power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was getting good at it by now. And, she was finding, it was fairly easy to sell it to people who wanted power themselves. It was a motivation they could understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the oration Joyce bit her lip. \"I don\u0027t know. What about the others? Your friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about them?\" Kaitlyn said coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were involved with Rob Kessler. Don\u0027t deny it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn could feel Gabriel waiting for the answer, too. \"We broke up,\" she said. She wished, suddenly, that she had thought more about this part of the story. \"I was interested in Gabriel and that made him furious. Besides,\" she added with happy inspiration, \"he likes Anna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no idea what made her say it, but it had an unexpected effect on both Joyce and Gabriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce\u0027s eyebrows went up, but some of the tightness went out of her mouth. Gabriel hissed in a sharp breath-like someone about to say, I knew it all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn was startled. She hadn\u0027t meant that. Rob had never given any sign-and neither had Anna-or at least she didn\u0027t think so. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she couldn\u0027t think about it now. She had to stay firmly in the moment. She fixed her eyes on Joyce, who was looking torn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Kait said. \"This is straight up. I wouldn\u0027t come here if I wasn\u0027t serious-I wouldn\u0027t put my dad in that much danger.\" She held Joyce\u0027s gaze. \"Because you guys can do things to him, right? I wouldn\u0027t risk that.\" In fact, it wasn\u0027t something she had realized until a little while ago. Mr. Z\u0027s psychics could attack over any distance, and if they found out the truth about Kait, he\u0027d be an obvious target. Now it was too late to turn back-the only way to protect her dad was to make her act good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm. But you went all the way to Canada to fight us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I went to the Fellowship and found it was a crock. They can\u0027t even help themselves, much less anyone else. And-it\u0027s not that I don\u0027t care about Rob and the others anymore, but I can\u0027t stick with them when they\u0027re going to lose. I want to be on the winning side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Lydia,\" Joyce said, grimly amused. It was another hit; Kait could tell. \"Well, if nothing else I suppose we can use you as a hostage,\" Joyce murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case, can we get some breakfast?\" Gabriel asked, not waiting to see what Kaitlyn\u0027s reaction would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Joyce said briefly, handing Kaitlyn the sunglasses. \"Nobody else is up yet. Get it yourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little different from the cheerful-homemaker attitude you had before, Kaitlyn thought, not bothering to shield it from Gabriel. He grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen was different. Dirty, for one thing; there were dishes in the sink and Coke cans spilling out of the wastebasket. A cardboard box full of sloppily shut take-out containers was on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChinese food, Kaitlyn saw. Joyce never let us have take-out Chinese. And those boxes of Frosted Flakes and Captain Crunch in the pantry-what had happened to Joyce\u0027s health food kick? An act?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you she wasn\u0027t exactly running things anymore,\" Gabriel said under his breath, slanting a quirky glance at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. Kaitlyn shrugged and poured herself a bowl of Captain Crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were finished eating, Joyce said, \"Right, go upstairs and get yourself cleaned up. You can go in Lydia\u0027s room for now-then we\u0027ll see about further arrangements when he comes tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn was surprised. \"Lydia\u0027s living here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you,\" Gabriel said. \"Under her father\u0027s thumb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she and Gabriel reached the landing, Kait said, \"Which room do you have now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same as before.\" He indicated the best room in the house, the big one that had cable hookup and a balcony. Then he gave her an evil glance. \"Want to share it with me? You can use the Jacuzzi. And the king-size bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Joyce would put her foot down about that,\" Kaitlyn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know which room was Lydia\u0027s, but she knocked lightly on the door of the room she used to share with Anna. Then she looked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia, small in an oversize T-shirt, was just getting out of bed. She saw Kaitlyn and squeaked. Her eyes darted around the room, looking for an exit, then she took a sideways step toward the bathroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn chuckled. In a way, it was a relief to see someone more scared than she was. \"What\u0027s the hurry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said, feeling lazy and dangerous. Like Gabriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia seemed to be paralyzed. She wriggled a little, like a worm on a hook, then she blurted, \"He made me do it. I didn\u0027t want to leave you in Canada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lydia, you\u0027re such a liar. You did it for the same reason I did. You wanted to be on the winning side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia\u0027s cat-tilted green eyes opened even wider. She was a pretty little thing, with a pale and delicate face and a heavy shock of black hair. Or she would have been pretty if she hadn\u0027t always looked so guilty and slinking, Kait thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same reason you did?\" Lydia breathed. \"You mean-Father brought you here-?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came on my own, to join you guys,\" Kaitlyn said firmly. \"Joyce said I could share this room.\" She swung her duffel bag over the twin bed that wasn\u0027t rumpled, and dropped it with a thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d expected Lydia to look awed or understanding. Instead, Lydia looked as if she thought Kait was crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came on your own ...\" Then she stopped and shook her head. \"Well, you\u0027re right about one thing,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said. \"My father is going to win. He always wins.\" She looked away, lip curling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn eyed her thoughtfully. \"Lydia, how come you\u0027re at the Institute? You\u0027re not psychic-are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia shrugged vaguely. \"My father wanted me here. So Joyce could watch me, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you didn\u0027t really answer the question, Kaitlyn thought. Gabriel had said that if Kait had picked up the red-haired man\u0027s thoughts, either she or the red-haired man must be slightly telepathic. But Kaitlyn had been able to tell how Joyce felt about her, and now she was getting strong feelings from Lydia. It wasn\u0027t that she could tell exactly what they were thinking; more that she could get a sense of their general mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I\u0027m a telepath? It was a weird and unsettling thought. Telepathy in the web didn\u0027t count; Gabriel had hooked them together. But to sense other people\u0027s feelings was something new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike just now she could tell that Lydia had a lot on her mind-which meant she might be induced to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s it like around here?\" Kaitlyn asked casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia\u0027s lip curled farther, but she just shrugged again and said, \"Have you met the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Well, I mean, I\u0027ve seen their astral forms before, on the way to Canada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll probably like those better than their real forms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, why don\u0027t you introduce me?\" Kait suggested. She wasn\u0027t really as interested in the dark psychics as in the routine around here-something that might give her an idea where Mr. Z kept the crystal. But any information would be helpful, and she figured it was better to be aggressive in meeting Mr. Z\u0027s new students. She didn\u0027t want them to think she was afraid of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to see them?\" Lydia was afraid of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, come on, show me the psychic psychos.\" Kaitlyn kept her tone light and was rewarded with a faint, admiring grin. \"Let\u0027s tour the zoo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hallway, they nearly ran into Joyce. She glanced at them and then knocked briskly at the door of what had once been the common room for Kait\u0027s group. Without waiting for an answer, she threw the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody up! Renny, you have to get to school; Mac, we start testing in ten minutes. If you want any breakfast, you\u0027d better move it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved on, to yell at another door. \"Bri! School! Frost! Testing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn, with a clear view of the first room, had to keep herself from gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my God, I don\u0027t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was now a bedroom-sort of. Like a bedroom from a flophouse, Kaitlyn thought. No, worse. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-visions-the-passion-dark-visions-3/page-4.html","bookId":2126,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:28 PM"}
