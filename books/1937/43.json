She had a speeding ticket, but thankfully, nothing of any real importance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the next day, Anne Marie waited. The tension was almost more than she could bear. She left three messages for Evelyn Boyle, wanting to make sure there weren’t any problems with her background clearance. The social worker didn’t return any of the calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Anne Marie known where Ellen was staying, she would’ve driven there and parked outside the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she hadn’t heard anything by five o’clock on Thursday afternoon, Anne Marie was positive something had gone wrong. She’d been useless the entire day, too nervous and jittery to concentrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she was about to give up in despair, the door to the bookstore opened and Evelyn Boyle came in with Ellen at her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen looked at Anne Marie and burst into tears as she bolted toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie fell to her knees, her arms open for Ellen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey clung tearfully to each other. “You promised, you promised,” Ellen sobbed against her shoulder. “You said—you said…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all right,” Anne Marie whispered, brushing Ellen’s hair. “You’re here now, and no one’s going to take you away from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen sniffled. “Grandma Dolores went to live with Jesus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have anyone who loves me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you, Ellen,” Anne Marie whispered, tears streaking her face. “You’re going to be my little girl from now on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can live with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie couldn’t speak, so she just nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have to go back to the foster house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, not ever again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill sobbing, Ellen tightened her arms around Anne Marie’s neck. “Everyone I love goes away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not anymore, Ellen,” she promised. “Not if I can help it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I loved my mommy and she…she did bad things and she left me and then Grandma Dolores d-died and then you left me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t leave you,” Anne Marie insisted. “I would never leave you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued to hold each other until Baxter started to bark at the foot of the stairs. Anne Marie released Ellen who ran to open the door. The dog immediately did a dance of joy at the sight of his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiping the tears from her face, Anne Marie stood to find Evelyn Boyle watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe we have a good placement for Ellen,” she said, her own eyes moist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie wasn’t going to make another mistake. “I’ve decided I don’t want to be Ellen’s foster parent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of shock broke out across the other woman’s face. “I beg your pardon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to adopt her,” she said. “I want to make Ellen my legal daughter.” The child was already her daughter in every way that mattered. It was time to make that official.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom,” Anne Marie said, speaking softly into the receiver. It was late Monday evening, and Ellen had just gone to sleep. The poor kid still wasn’t sleeping well, so Anne Marie didn’t want to risk waking her. Every night since Dolores’s death, Ellen had ended up crawling into bed with Anne Marie and crying herself to sleep. The girl had suffered yet another loss. Being taken out of school, informed that her grandmother was dead and then shuffled off to a foster home hadn’t helped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anne Marie?” her mother murmured. “My goodness, I haven’t heard from you in weeks. Is something wrong? There must be if you’re phoning me this late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should’ve called earlier.” Handling the funeral arrangements and looking after Ellen had kept her busy. But the truth was, it hadn’t occurred to her to contact her mother until that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now she hesitated, fearing her mother’s reaction once she learned that Anne Marie was going to adopt Ellen. Her mother had made her disapproval known when she decided to marry Robert. She’d been equally negative when Anne Marie purchased the bookstore. Laura wasn’t a risk-taker and she’d been convinced that Anne Marie would be throwing away her investment. She generally believed in living a cautious, conventional life, although she wouldn’t have put it in those terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite her mother’s reactions in the past, Anne Marie felt compelled to seek her out. Perhaps it had to do with becoming a mother herself….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMight as well just blurt it out. “I thought I should tell you that you’re about to become a grandmother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strained silence followed her announcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re…pregnant?” Once again, Laura Bostwick’s reproach was evident. “I know you want a baby, Anne Marie, but I don’t think you have any idea what life’s really like for a single mother. Oh, dear…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It isn’t…I’m not—” Anne Marie didn’t get the opportunity to explain before her mother interrupted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you don’t mind me asking, who’s the father? No, don’t tell me. Obviously there’s a problem, otherwise you would’ve married him. You aren’t secretly married, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t need to know any more about him. He’s married, I suppose?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, sorry. I said not to tell me and then like a fool I ask. It’s none of my business. Well, you’re going to have a child. When are you due?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a bit more complicated than that,” she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For heaven’s sake, you haven’t done anything stupid, have you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” Anne Marie asked, a little taken aback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Artificial insemination, that’s what. I heard about it at the hairdresser’s. Apparently a lot of women are using artificial methods to get pregnant. Please don’t tell me you went to one of those fertility clinics and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother, I’m adopting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d finally shocked her mother into total silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember Ellen Falk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was her Lunch Buddy. You met her the Saturday before St. Patrick’s Day. We had lunch with you.” Surely her mother hadn’t forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another silence. Then Laura said, “Let me see if I have this straight. This second-grade girl you agreed to have lunch with once a week is the one you’re going to adopt?” Her mother sounded incredulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Mom. She came to stay with me, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yes, and I told you I thought it was rather nervy of that girl’s grandmother to call you in the middle of the night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dolores Falk died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis information appeared to unsettle Laura. “Oh…dear. That is a shame.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellen doesn’t have anyone else,” Anne Marie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re fond of the child?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love her as though I’d given birth to her myself,” Anne Marie confessed. “I’ve already talked to the social worker and asked to be considered as Ellen’s adoptive mother.” She closed her eyes, certain her mother would discourage her, as she had with every important decision Anne Marie had ever made, from the school she’d chosen to the man she’d married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Anne Marie…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that’s a wonderful thing to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer jaw fell so fast and hard, Anne Marie was surprised she hadn’t dislocated it. “You…think I’m doing the right thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dear girl, you’re old enough to decide what you want to do with your own life. If this child means so much to you, then by all means bring her into the family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as Anne Marie could remember, this was the first time in her adult life that her mother had supported her choices. She didn’t understand it, other than to assume the child had won over her mother’s heart in the hour or two they’d spent together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There won’t be any legal problems, will there?” Laura went on to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” Evelyn Boyle had to do a search for Ellen’s birth certificate and find out who was listed as the father. He would need to be contacted and given the opportunity to state his wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie was pretty sure Ellen’s biological father didn’t even know she existed. But if Evelyn managed to track him down…He could decide to declare his parental rights and Anne Marie would have no option but to relinquish Ellen. The thought made her feel ill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about her biological mother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She gave up all rights to her daughter three years ago when Ellen went to live with her grandmother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does that mean the mother can’t change her mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s too late for that. Anyway, if it wasn’t for Dolores, Ellen might’ve been put up for adoption years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The social worker was encouraging.” The fact that Ellen was living with Anne Marie and that they’d so obviously bonded was a hopeful sign. However, the issue of Ellen’s biological father still had to be resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie suddenly remembered something. “The wishes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I beg your pardon?” her mother said. “Stop mumbling, Anne Marie. How many times do I have to tell you? Speak up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, Mom. I was just thinking out loud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that about wishes? That’s what you said, isn’t it? It certainly sounded like wishes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellen has a list of wishes. Twenty wishes.” Anne Marie had no intention of referring to her own list or those of the other widows. Her mother would no doubt throw scorn on the idea or dismiss it as childish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Children do that sort of thing,” her mother said, confirming her suspicion. “I wouldn’t give it any mind. I suppose she wished for a mother and father?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no…nothing like that.” Then, because she felt she had to explain after bringing it up, she said, “Ellen wants to meet her father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every child wants that. My guess is she’s well rid of him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the conversation made no impact on Anne Marie. A few minutes after she ended the call, she wandered into Ellen’s tiny bedroom and watched the child as she slept, one hand flung out and resting on the dog, who was cuddled up close beside her. The poor kid was exhausted and seemed to be lost in her dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, in between working at the store and looking after Ellen, Anne Marie had called the school. She’d updated Helen Mayer, who’d cheered when Anne Marie told her about adopting Ellen. She’d even offered a character reference should any be needed in the adoption process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie was just afraid the proceedings might not get that far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday morning, three days after Dolores’s death, they’d visited the funeral home and arranged for a small private service. A short obituary written by Anne Marie appeared in the paper. Several neighbors stopped by on Sunday to pay their respects. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twenty-wishes-blossom-street-5/page-43.html","bookId":1937,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:06 AM"}
