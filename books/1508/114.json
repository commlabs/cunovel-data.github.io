He had thought that Lan Yunyue was a maidservant, but after noting the fine clothes Lan Yunyue was wearing, he realised that he had been mistaken. “You are… Lan Yunyue?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLan Yunyue regained her composure and bowed to the Tenth Prince, “Lan Yunyue greets His Highness the Cloud Prince.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe Tenth Prince looked up and down at Lan Yunyue. He sneered derisively and said, “Good! What a charmingly pitiful and pathetic appearance. No wonder Lin Ming was so utterly crazy for you. It’s such a pity.

You should know that Lin Ming will soon become a core disciple of the Seven Profound Martial House. You also know what sort of status the Seven Profound Martial House has in Sky Fortune Kingdom.

As long as he comes out from there, then there will be a chance to assassinate him! Your strength is insufficient. You will look for a suitable powerhouse that can handle him. I will secretly provide you with money and treasure. As long as the reward is enough, there will always be some wandering powerhouses who will be tempted.

Much less, the Tenth Prince’s natural disposition was to be overly suspicious and believe nobody. How could he tolerate such a danger by his side? Would he ever have peace eating or sleeping? Assassinate a core disciple of the Seven Profound Martial House? This accusation alone was enough to have the Seven Profound Valleys sentence the Tenth Prince to death!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf I fail, I will die!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf I succeed, I will die!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou deprive me of my wealth, destroy my future, and also want to take my life…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYang Zhen, you are too ruthless!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd my dear, sweet aunt; you also participated in this idea.

Lan Yunyue sat in the hall and watched as the Tenth Prince walked away, feeling helpless and lost.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eZhu Yan’s bedroom door was slightly ajar, leaving a small crack open like the jaws of some wild beast lying sideways. Lan Yunyue could not muster up the courage to step into that room, but she was also unable to leave. She could only stand in that empty and vacant hall, waiting.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAfter a quarter hour passed, Zhu Yan finally emerged from the room.

Lan Yunyue subconsciously glanced at it. She had been expecting this. It was the contract paper they had signed when they had become engaged to each other.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Tear it.” Zhu Yan exclaimed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“What… the… I’m sorry?\" Lan Yunyue’s hands froze.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Our engagement is dissolved.

How could this be?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eZhu Yan said, “When you and I were engaged, the only reason you did so was because of my status, power, influence, and money. Now, I no longer have these things. There is no longer a reason for you to stay with me. This engagement contract is now nothing more than a joke.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAfter Zhu Yan said this, he flicked his finger and the contract in Lan Yunyue’s hand was torn into fragments by true essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt that moment, Lan Yunyue’s mind blanked. In the Sky Fortune Kingdom, it was a shameful matter for a girl to become divorced after she was engaged. It would be difficult to remarry again. When wealthy people looked for a wife they would never settle for such women. If they did, it would only be as a concubine.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“You can go now.” Zhu Yan had completely calmed down. He turned and walked away, not giving Lan Yunyue even a last parting look. His heart was only filled with immeasurable hatred. The Zhu Yan of the past had died in that bedroom; how could he possibly have the thought to consider Lan Yunyue’s feelings?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs Lan Yunyue stepped out of the Zhu Family branch complex, she wandered onto the street in a daze. It was over… Zhu Yan and her were completely over…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShe suddenly discovered that she did not feel the sadness and gloomy misery of a young girl that was left by herself. Instead, she felt a kind of peaceful solace as she let out a sigh.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAlong with that torn engagement paper, those incomparably depressing and weary days had ended…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe late autumn night wind was thick with moisture, and it was chilly as it blew on the body. Sky Fortune City’s nightlife was as vivid as ever, as happy and buoyant sounds filled the air. Among the wanton and luxurious brothels, the vivid red lanterns hanging high in the air, and the dim lights, Lan Yunyue could hear the sounds of women chatting away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLooking at the noisy world around her, Lan Yunyue suddenly smiled. It was a bittersweet smile, filled with relief.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShe remembered her childhood, when she and Lin Ming would play with bamboo dragonflies on the moist spring grass.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShe remembered when they would go out in the rain to pick the small wildflowers together, or step across the slippery stones of a creek and dip their toes into the cool spring. Little fish would come up and nibble on their toes, giving them an itchy feeling… because Lin Ming grew up in a restaurant; he knew how to prepare a delicious meal in a short time. He would catch a pheasant, pick some wild herbs and wild fruits, and bring his own clay pots to cook a variety of tasty foods.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOne time when she was sick, he ran several miles in the pouring rain to grab some clear mountain spring water so that he could boil her some nutritious medicinal porridge…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever… she could no longer go back to those days.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBefore she had realized it, tears were already streaming down her face.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShe regretted. But what she regretted was not that Lin Ming had become Sky Fortune Kingdom’s most dazzling superstar, or that she missed her chance to become the wife of the next state marshal or the Seven Profound envoy. No… what she regretted was that she had discarded that simple, pure happiness for nothing but useless luxury and empty vanity.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShe walked aimlessly. Her frail and attractive body was wrapped in a simple blue long dress. Under the shining red lights of the lanterns, she was covered by a misty and lonely shadow. She was like a desolate blue butterfly that flew in the cold autumn wind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShe did not want to return to the Seven Profound Martial House. With her talent, she had already lost the support of precious herbs and medicines. In her life, she could no longer achieve a high martial arts cultivation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShe did not want to return to Green Mulberry City.

He was completely ignorant to how Zhu Yan and Lan Yunyue’s destinies had changed, and how Zhu Yan was completely filled with hatred towards him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe knew that that Zhu Yan’s enmity towards him had not been resolved. He also guessed correctly that Zhu Yan would wait for an opportunity to retaliate against him in the future. However, he could not kill Zhu Yan. For better or for worse, Zhu Yan was also an official disciple of the Seven Profound Martial House. To kill him would be challenging the authority of the Martial House.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Mister Lin, please get off.” A servant of the Crown Prince respectfully said as the carriage stopped.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming drew back the carriage curtains.

The mansion was not luxurious, but the inside was very elegant in its construction. There were small bridges that hung over flowing streams and winding rock corridors.
