{"id":36703,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X","content":"Howard Maitland\u0027s departure in January for the Philippines surprised several people.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why should he take such a long journey?\" Miss Mary Graham said to Miss Eliza—\"unless it is that he discovered that Miss Payton is not the sort of girl to make any man happy, and simply left the country.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wager he carried a mitten with him!\" Miss Eliza said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What! You think she refused him? Maria Spencer says she\u0027s only too anxious to get him. Meeting him in empty apartments! Perhaps that disgusted him. A gentleman does not like to be pursued.\"...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why has he gone away?\" Mrs. Childs asked Laura, mildly interested.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because he wants to hunt for shells.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I thought he was so attentive to Freddy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe she turned him down.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027ll get a crooked stick at last, if she doesn\u0027t look out,\" her father said, over the top of his newspaper.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Laura came and sat on the arm of his chair. \"Fred doesn\u0027t need a stick, Billy-boy; she can walk alone.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Every one of you needs a stick,\" Mr. William Childs assured her; \"and I don\u0027t know that I would confine it[Pg 117] to the thickness of my thumb, either, as the English law does.\" He reached up a plump hand and pulled her ear. Afterward he told his wife that Lolly was down by the head: \"What\u0027s the matter with her, Mother?\" he said. His two sons might have failed in their various businesses, or taken to their beds with mumps or measles, and he would not have looked as anxious as he did when he heard the little flat note in Laura\u0027s voice. \"Is she off her feed because I won\u0027t let her walk in that circus parade of Fred\u0027s?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, she\u0027s disappointed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I won\u0027t have a girl of mine tramping through the mud—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps it won\u0027t be muddy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It will! It always is. Anyway, I hope it will be. But if she is upset about it, I\u0027ll take her to St. Louis with me that week, so she won\u0027t feel she\u0027s backed out. Mother, you don\u0027t suppose she\u0027s missing that Maitland chap, do you? Hey? What?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, dear me, no! Why, Mr. Maitland has been paying attention to Freddy for the last year.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why doesn\u0027t she take him, and stop all her nonsense? I hear she told those poor, silly strikers in Dean\u0027s rubber-factory to support Smith, the \u0027Woman\u0027s Candidate\u0027! Much \u0027supporting\u0027 they can do! And the joke of it is, Smith himself owns the controlling stock. She had better be at home, darning her stockings.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, now, Father, you must remember it isn\u0027t as if Ellen didn\u0027t have plenty of servants to do things like that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 118]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hear she\u0027s signed that petition to have certain kinds of diseases registered. I don\u0027t know what the world\u0027s coming to, that girls know about such things!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, of course, girls are more intelligent than they used to be.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If she\u0027s so intelligent, I\u0027ll give her a book on Bacon-Shakespeare that will exercise her brains,—and she can stop concerning herself with matters that decent women know nothing about. Thank Heaven, our Laura is as ignorant as a baby! Or, if Fred is so bent on reforming things, let her have a Sunday-school class,\" said Mr. Childs, puffing and scowling. \"Look here, Mother, if you have any influence over her, try and get her to take young Maitland. I should sleep more easily in my bed if I thought she had a man to keep her in order.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But he has gone away,\" Mrs. Childs objected.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s because she has turned him down. Maybe he\u0027ll never think of her again; I wouldn\u0027t, if I were a young fellow! I\u0027d want a woman, not a man in petticoats. But if he does get on her track again, tell her to take him; tell her I say she\u0027ll get a crooked stick if she waits too long. You\u0027re sure Laura isn\u0027t blue about him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, Father! You are the most foolish man about that child!...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why has Maitland gone on that expedition, Fred?\" said Mr. Weston.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You can search me,\" said Miss Payton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Arthur Weston\u0027s hands, concealed in his pockets, tightened. \"She has refused him!\" he said to himself. (Alas![Pg 119] shooting ducks on the marshes had not helped him!) He had dropped in at 15 Payton Street, and Fred had taken him up to the flounced and flowery sitting-room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mother\u0027ll be in pretty soon,\" she said; \"so let\u0027s talk business, quick!\" She was apparently absorbed in \"business,\" which, as the winter thawed and drizzled into spring, flagged very much. \"And the office rent goes right along, just the same,\" she told her trustee, ruefully. \"I think, if I could have a little car to run around and look at places—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maitland put that idea in your head!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Frederica did not defend her absent adorer. Instead, she wailed over the rapacity of her landlord.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You ought to have made your rent contingent on your customers,\" Mr. Weston teased her; and roared when she took it seriously and said she wished she had thought of it. \"Give me some tea, Fred,\" he said; \"these questions of high finance exhaust me.\" Then he asked the usual question, and Fred gave the usual answer. \"But what do you hear from him?\" Weston persisted. \"I suppose you write to him occasionally? You mustn\u0027t be too cruel.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I don\u0027t hear much,\" she said. She took a letter out of her pocket and handed it to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When he had read it, he was silent for a while. (\"If this is the sort of letter a blighted being writes,\" he reflected, \"love has changed since my time.\")\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dear Fred,\" the letter ran, \"I\u0027m having the time of my life. Tell Laura Childs I saw a shell necklace that she\u0027d be perfectly crazy about. The dredging ...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 120]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then followed two pages about shells, which Mr. Weston, raising a bored eyebrow, skipped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Those books you sent were bully. They look very interesting. I haven\u0027t had time to read them yet. Tell Laura they use boa-constrictors here instead of cats; and tell her that the flowers are perfectly wonderful.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then came something about suffrage, ending with a ribald suggestion that the suffragists should get a Filipino candidate—\"He wouldn\u0027t cost so much as the chief of bosses, Mr. Smith; a Moro will root for \u0027votes for women\u0027 if you promise him a bottle of whisky.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is not losing sleep over being rejected,\" Arthur Weston thought, as he handed the letter back to her.... He had lost some sleep himself, lately: \"And there\u0027s no excuse for it,\" he told himself; \"I didn\u0027t fall in love, I strayed in—in spite of sign-posts on every corner! And now I\u0027m in, I can\u0027t get out. Damn it, I will get out!\" But each day it seemed as if he \u0027strayed\u0027 farther in....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why has H. M. gone off?\" Laura asked Frederica.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, you know! Shells,\" Fred said, astonished at the question.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tell that to the marines. Freddy, you bounced him!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I did not.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, then, if you didn\u0027t, what color are the bridesmaids\u0027 dresses to be?\" Laura retorted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get out!\" said Frederica.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why has Mr. Maitland left town?\" Mrs. Payton asked her daughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 121]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Shells.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh,\" Mrs. Payton said; \"but I thought he—you—I mean, I supposed ... Freddy, he\u0027s a nice fellow. I wish—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, nice enough,\" Fred admitted, carelessly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s refused him,\" Mrs. Payton thought; and sighed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Even Flora had to ask her question: \"Mr. Maitland has gone away, they say, Miss Freddy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So I hear.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Men,\" said Flora, heavily, \"is always going away! Why can\u0027t they stay in one place, same as ladies?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They are not so important as we are,\" Miss Freddy assured her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If they was all swep\u0027 out of the world, it would be just the same to me,\" said Flora, viciously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fred kept a severely straight face; all the household knew poor Flora had had another disappointment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why?\"—\"Why?\"—everybody asked. But Frederica only thought \"why.\" Her first feeling when he went away had been a sort of blank astonishment. Of course, it was all right; there was no reason he shouldn\u0027t go, only—\"Why?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Every day, as she worked at her desk, or took a trolley-car to the suburbs to inspect some apartment, or sat in absorbed silence opposite her mother at the dinner-table, she was saying, why? She was certain that he was fond of her. \"Did he go because he thought I was so deep in business that I wouldn\u0027t bother with him? Or because[Pg 122] he wanted to show me he could put in really serious licks of work? Or because he was afraid I\u0027d turn him down? Of course, I am awfully matter-of-fact,\" she admitted; \"but all the same, he\u0027s blind if he thinks that!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sometimes, when her mother commented vaguely on the weather, or on Flora\u0027s indelicacy in being so daft about men, or Miss Carter\u0027s perfectly unreasonable wish to go to the theater once a week, besides her regular evening out—\"I don\u0027t go once a year,\" Mrs. Payton said—Frederica would start and say, \"Beg your pardon? I didn\u0027t hear you.\" Nor would she hear her mother\u0027s dreary sigh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Freddy has nothing in common with me,\" Mrs. Payton used to think, and sigh again. It did not occur to her to say, \"I have nothing in common with Freddy.\" Certainly, they had nothing of mutual interest to talk about.... Mrs. Payton was wondering dully whether she had not better take a grain of calomel; why they would not eat cold mutton in the kitchen; whether Flora wouldn\u0027t be a little more cheerful now, for Miss Carter said that the McKnights\u0027 chauffeur was making up to her.... Fred was wondering how soon her last letter would reach Howard Maitland; foreseeing his interest in its contents—the news that Smith had been beaten, but pledged to the support of suffrage in his next campaign; calculating as to the earliest possible date of his reply.... Mrs. Payton was right; they had nothing in common. By and by, as the weeks passed, the mother and daughter, together only at meals, lapsed into almost complete silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I love both my children just the same, but Mortimore[Pg 123] is more of a companion than she is,\" Mrs. Payton thought, bitterly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was, however, one moment, in April, when Frederica did talk.... Mrs. Holmes had come in to dinner, and somehow things started badly. Mrs. Payton had said, sighing, that she was pretty tired; \"I really haven\u0027t got over the Christmas rush, yet,\" she complained. And Frederica, with a shrug, said that the Christmas debauch was getting worse each year. Then the suffrage parade was discussed. It had taken place the day before, in brilliant sunshine, and on perfectly dry streets, which greatly provoked Mrs. Holmes, who had prayed for rain. Naturally, she made vicious thrusts at the women who took their dry-shod part in it. She was thankful, she said, that William Childs had locked Laura up; anyhow, she hadn\u0027t disgraced the family!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you call taking her to St. Louis \u0027locking her up\u0027?\" Fred inquired. \"Laura gave in to Billy-boy, which was rather sandless in her. She is a dear, but she hasn\u0027t much sand.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She has decency, which is better. To show yourselves off to a lot of coarse men—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Weston watched the procession.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Only coarse women would do such a thing! And Arthur Weston might have had something better to do!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Frederica held on to herself; she even refrained from quoting Mr. Weston\u0027s comment on the parade: \"No doubt there were women in the procession who liked to be conspicuous; but there were others who marched with the consecration of martyrs and patriots!\" But of course it[Pg 124] needed only a word to bring an explosion. The word was innocent enough:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That Maitland boy,\" said Mrs. Holmes—\"I\u0027ve dropped my napkin, Flora; pick it up—why did he suddenly leave everything and go off?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Freddy says he\u0027s gone to dig shells,\" said Mrs. Payton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dig what?\" said Mrs. Holmes; \"people mumble so nowadays, nobody can understand them! Oh, shells? Yes. Funny thing to do, but I believe it\u0027s quite the thing for rich young men to amuse themselves in some scientific way. I suppose it doesn\u0027t need brains, as business does.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It isn\u0027t amusement,\" Frederica said; \"it\u0027s work.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Upon which her grandmother retorted, shrewdly: \"Anything you do because you want to, not because you have to, is an amusement, my dear. Like your real-estate business.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Frederica\u0027s lip hardened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"However,\" Mrs. Holmes conceded, \"to make his way in the world, a rich man, fortunately, doesn\u0027t need to be intelligent, any more than a pretty girl needs to be clever\"—she gave her granddaughter a malicious glance; \"all the same, young Maitland had better settle down and get married, and spend some of the Maitland money. (There goes my napkin again, Flora!)\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027d have no respect for him, if he did,\" Fred said. \"He would be too much like this family—living on dead brains.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her grandmother turned angry eyes on Mrs. Payton. \"You may know what your daughter means, Ellen; I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 125]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll tell you what I mean,\" Frederica said, \"you and Mother simply live on the money your husbands made and left you when they died. Since you were a girl, when you had to work because you were poor, you have never done a hand\u0027s turn to earn your living. Mother has never done anything. You are both parasites. Well, I am, too; but there\u0027s this difference between us: I am ashamed, and you are not. I am trying to do something for myself. But the only thing you two will do for yourselves will be to die.\" She looked at her speechless grandmother, appraisingly. \"Yes, death will be a real thing to you, Grandmother. You can\u0027t get anybody else to do your dying for you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ellen! Really!\" Mrs. Holmes gasped out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Freddy, stop!\" her mother said, hysterically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, what have either of you ever done to earn what you are at this moment eating?\" Fred inquired, calmly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Payton was speechless with displeasure, but Mrs. Holmes, shivering from the chill of that word Fred had used, helped herself wildly from a dish Flora had been holding, unnoticed, at her elbow. \"Ellen, I simply will not come here, if you allow that girl to speak in this way—before a servant, too!\" she added, as Flora retreated to the pantry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I merely told the truth,\" Fred said, with a bored look.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well,\" said her grandmother, \"then I will tell you the truth! You are a very unpleasant girl. And I don\u0027t wonder you are not married—no man would be such a fool as to ask you! A girl who cheapens herself by locking herself up in empty flats with any young man she[Pg 126] happens to meet, and signs indecent petitions, and rants in the public streets to a lot of strikers—why, you are not a lady! You are as plain as a pike-staff; and you have no manners, and no sense, and no heart—you\u0027ve nothing but cleverness, which is about as attractive to a man as a hair shirt! Maria Spencer told me she expected you would be ruined; but I said I would think better of you if you were capable of being ruined, or if anybody wanted to ruin you. You are not a woman; you are a suffragist! That\u0027s why you haven\u0027t any charm; not a particle!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank Heaven!\" Frederica murmured.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, unless men have changed since my day,\" Mrs. Holmes said, shrilly, \"a man wants charm in a woman, more than he wants brains.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is a matter of indifference to me what men want,\" Fred commented.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her grandmother did not notice the interruption—\"Though when we were young, some of us had brains and charm, too! There! That\u0027s the truth, and how do you like it? Ellen, why do you have your napkins starched so stiffly—they won\u0027t stay on your lap a minute!\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1821/52859.html","bookId":1026,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:23:17 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:23:17 AM"}
