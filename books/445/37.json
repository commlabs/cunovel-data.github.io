SELF-SURPASSING.","content":"“Will to Truth” do ye call it, ye wisest ones, that which impelleth you and maketh you ardent?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Will for the thinkableness of all being: thus do I call your will!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All being would ye MAKE thinkable: for ye doubt with good reason whether it be already thinkable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But it shall accommodate and bend itself to you! So willeth your will. Smooth shall it become and subject to the spirit, as its mirror and reflection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That is your entire will, ye wisest ones, as a Will to Power; and even when ye speak of good and evil, and of estimates of value.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ye would still create a world before which ye can bow the knee: such is your ultimate hope and ecstasy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The ignorant, to be sure, the people—they are like a river on which a boat floateth along: and in the boat sit the estimates of value, solemn and disguised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Your will and your valuations have ye put on the river of becoming; it betrayeth unto me an old Will to Power, what is believed by the people as good and evil.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was ye, ye wisest ones, who put such guests in this boat, and gave them pomp and proud names—ye and your ruling Will!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Onward the river now carrieth your boat: it MUST carry it. A small matter if the rough wave foameth and angrily resisteth its keel!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is not the river that is your danger and the end of your good and evil, ye wisest ones: but that Will itself, the Will to Power—the unexhausted, procreating life-will.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But that ye may understand my gospel of good and evil, for that purpose will I tell you my gospel of life, and of the nature of all living things.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The living thing did I follow; I walked in the broadest and narrowest paths to learn its nature.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With a hundred-faced mirror did I catch its glance when its mouth was shut, so that its eye might speak unto me. And its eye spake unto me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But wherever I found living things, there heard I also the language of obedience. All living things are obeying things.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And this heard I secondly: Whatever cannot obey itself, is commanded. Such is the nature of living things.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This, however, is the third thing which I heard—namely, that commanding is more difficult than obeying. And not only because the commander beareth the burden of all obeyers, and because this burden readily crusheth him:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An attempt and a risk seemed all commanding unto me; and whenever it commandeth, the living thing risketh itself thereby.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yea, even when it commandeth itself, then also must it atone for its commanding. Of its own law must it become the judge and avenger and victim.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How doth this happen! so did I ask myself. What persuadeth the living thing to obey, and command, and even be obedient in commanding?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hearken now unto my word, ye wisest ones! Test it seriously, whether I have crept into the heart of life itself, and into the roots of its heart!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wherever I found a living thing, there found I Will to Power; and even in the will of the servant found I the will to be master.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That to the stronger the weaker shall serve—thereto persuadeth he his will who would be master over a still weaker one. That delight alone he is unwilling to forego.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And as the lesser surrendereth himself to the greater that he may have delight and power over the least of all, so doth even the greatest surrender himself, and staketh—life, for the sake of power.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is the surrender of the greatest to run risk and danger, and play dice for death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And where there is sacrifice and service and love-glances, there also is the will to be master. By by-ways doth the weaker then slink into the fortress, and into the heart of the mightier one—and there stealeth power.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And this secret spake Life herself unto me. “Behold,” said she, “I am that WHICH MUST EVER SURPASS ITSELF.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To be sure, ye call it will to procreation, or impulse towards a goal, towards the higher, remoter, more manifold: but all that is one and the same secret.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rather would I succumb than disown this one thing; and verily, where there is succumbing and leaf-falling, lo, there doth Life sacrifice itself—for power!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That I have to be struggle, and becoming, and purpose, and cross-purpose—ah, he who divineth my will, divineth well also on what CROOKED paths it hath to tread!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whatever I create, and however much I love it,—soon must I be adverse to it, and to my love: so willeth my will.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And even thou, discerning one, art only a path and footstep of my will: verily, my Will to Power walketh even on the feet of thy Will to Truth!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the formula: ‘Will to existence’: that will—doth not exist!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For what is not, cannot will; that, however, which is in existence—how could it still strive for existence!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Only where there is life, is there also will: not, however, Will to Life, but—so teach I thee—Will to Power!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one; but out of the very reckoning speaketh—the Will to Power!”—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus did Life once teach me: and thereby, ye wisest ones, do I solve you the riddle of your hearts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, I say unto you: good and evil which would be everlasting—it doth not exist! Of its own accord must it ever surpass itself anew.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With your values and formulae of good and evil, ye exercise power, ye valuing ones: and that is your secret love, and the sparkling, trembling, and overflowing of your souls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But a stronger power groweth out of your values, and a new surpassing: by it breaketh egg and egg-shell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he who hath to be a creator in good and evil—verily, he hath first to be a destroyer, and break values in pieces.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus doth the greatest evil pertain to the greatest good: that, however, is the creating good.—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Let us SPEAK thereof, ye wisest ones, even though it be bad. To be silent is worse; all suppressed truths become poisonous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And let everything break up which—can break up by our truths! Many a house is still to be built!—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2158/61049.html","bookId":445,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM"}
