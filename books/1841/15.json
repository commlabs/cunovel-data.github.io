Her golden legs were drawn up against her chest, and her glorious hair covered most of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t help but smile. Lord, she reminded him of a kitten, curled up so snugly. Aye, she was enticing all right, and she was probably going to freeze to death if he didn\u0027t do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne didn\u0027t even open her eyes when Duncan picked her up and carried her over to the bed. He smiled over the way she instinctively cuddled up against his chest. She sighed, too, as if she were most content, and damn, she was smelling like roses again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan placed her on the bed and covered her. He tried to keep his manner distant, but he couldn\u0027t seem to stop himself from brushing his hand against the smoothness of her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne looked so vulnerable when she was sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely that was the reason he didn\u0027t want to leave. The urge to protect her was overwhelming. She was so innocent and so trusting. In his heart he knew he\u0027d never let her go back to her brother. She was an angel and he\u0027d not allow her near the demon Louddon, ever again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rules had turned upside down on Duncan. With a frustrated groan he walked over to the door. Hell, he thought, he didn\u0027t know his own mind anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Madelyne\u0027s doing, though she certainly couldn\u0027t be aware of that fact. She drove him to distraction, and when he was near her, he couldn\u0027t think much at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan decided he\u0027d have to put distance between himself and Madelyne until he settled the issues bothering him. Yet, as soon as he made up his mind to avoid Madelyne, his mood blackened. Duncan muttered an expletive, turned, and slowly closed the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne was still weak enough that the enforced isolation didn\u0027t bother her. Yet after two more days, with only Gerty and Maude making an occasional visit, she was feeling the effects of her prison. She paced the room until she knew every inch of it by heart, and then began to drive the servants to distraction when she insisted on doing what they deemed was common work. Madelyne scrubbed the floor and the walls. The physical exercise didn\u0027t help much. She felt as caged as an animal. And she waited, hour upon hour, for Duncan to come to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne kept telling herself that she should be thankful Duncan had all but forgotten her. Lord, wasn\u0027t she used to being forgotten?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen another two days had passed, Madelyne was close to throwing herself out the window just to diversify her routine. She was bored enough to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood by the window and stared out into the fading sunset, thinking about Duncan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne thought she might have conjured him up in her mind, for even as she thought about how much she wanted to see him, he suddenly appeared. The door opened, bouncing against the stone wall announcing his arrival, and there he stood, looking fierce and powerful, and altogether too handsome for her peace of mind. God\u0027s truth, she could have stared at him for the rest of the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edmond is going to remove the threads now,\" Duncan told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan walked into the room and over to stand in front of the hearth. He folded his arms across his chest, giving Madelyne the idea that he was bored with this mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was hurt by his cold manner, yet determined he\u0027d never know it. She gave him what she hoped was a most tranquil expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord, she was a sight to behold. Madelyne was dressed in a cream-colored gown and a blue overtunic. A braided rope was wrapped around her slender waist, accentuating her feminine curves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair wasn\u0027t pulled away from her face but rested against the swell of her breasts. Such a thick, curly mass of hair it was, worthy of any queen, the color of sable, Duncan thought, though intertwined with threads of red as well. He remembered the feel of it, so soft and silky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled, irritated over the way she continued to disturb him. He couldn\u0027t quit staring at Madelyne either, admitting that he\u0027d missed having her by his side. A foolish thought, and one he\u0027d never openly acknowledge, but there all the same, prickling him into a new awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt suddenly dawned on him that Madelyne was wearing his colors, and he grinned. He doubted she was aware of that fact, and had she not looked so damn kissable, he might have mentioned it just to see her reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne couldn\u0027t look at Duncan long. She was afraid he\u0027d see how much she\u0027d missed him. And then he\u0027d have a good gloat, she thought to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like to know what you are going to do with me, Duncan,\" she said. She turned her gaze to the floor, not daring to look up to see how he was taking her question, else completely lose her train of thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAye, her ability to concentrate was always in jeopardy whenever she was around Duncan. She didn\u0027t understand her reaction to him, but accepted it all the same. The baron was able to worry her without speaking a word. He disturbed her peace of mind, confused her too. When he was close to her, she wanted him to leave. Yet when he was away from her, she missed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne turned her back on Duncan and looked out the window again. \"Do you think to keep me locked in this room for the rest of my life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan smiled over the worry he\u0027d heard in her voice. \"Madelyne, the door wasn\u0027t barred,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you jesting?\" Madelyne asked. She turned around and gave him the most incredulous look. \"Do you mean to tell me I haven\u0027t been locked in this tower all week?\" Lord, she felt like yelling. \"I could have escaped?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, you couldn\u0027t have escaped, but you could have left the room,\" Duncan answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you,\" Madelyne announced. She folded her arms in front of her, mocking his stance. \"You would lie just to make me feel foolish. You have an unfair advantage, Duncan, for I never, ever lie. Therefore,\" she concluded, \"it is an uneven match.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond appeared in the open doorway. The middle brother was wearing his usual frown. Yet he looked wary, too, and stared at Madelyne a good while before he walked inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll hold her down this time,\" he told Duncan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne gave Duncan a worried glance and saw him smile. \"Madelyne doesn\u0027t have a fever now, Edmond, and is as docile as a kitten,\" he remarked. He turned to Madelyne then and instructed her to go to the bed so that Edmond could remove the bandage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne nodded. She knew what needed to be done, but shyness overcame common sense. \"If you would both leave, I would have a moment\u0027s privacy to prepare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prepare what?\" Duncan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a gentle lady,\" Madelyne stammered. \"I\u0027ll not let either of you see anything but my injury. That is what I would prepare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was blushing enough to make Duncan realize she\u0027d meant every word. Edmond started to cough but Duncan\u0027s sigh was louder. \" \u0027Tis not the time for modesty, Madelyne. Besides, I\u0027ve seen… your legs already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne straightened her shoulders, gave him a good glare, and then hurried over to the bed. She grabbed one of the animal skins that had fallen to the floor, and when she was situated on top of the bed, she draped the skin over her and then wiggled her garments up to the top of her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdging the exposed bandage to the side, she began the slow task of unwinding the material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond knelt down beside her when the bandage was removed. Madelyne noticed a dark shadow beneath his left eye then. She wondered how he\u0027d come by the bruise, and then jumped to the conclusion that one of his brothers was probably responsible. What hateful people, she told herself, even when she noticed Edmond was being very gentle as he removed the sticky threads from her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, it doesn\u0027t feel any worse than a pinch, Edmond,\" Madelyne said with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan had walked over to stand next to the bed. He looked ready to pounce if she moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was awkward, having both men staring at her thigh. She soon became embarrassed again. Thinking to turn Duncan\u0027s attention, she said the first thing that came into her mind. \"Why are there locks on each side of the door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" He did look perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The slat of wood that slides into the loops to lock the door,\" Madelyne rushed on. \"You\u0027ve built loops on both sides. Why is that, do you suppose?\" she asked, feigning great interest in such a ridiculous topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer strategy worked, however. Duncan turned, stared at the door, and then looked back at her. He was staring at her face now, ignoring, for the moment, her exposed thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" she challenged. \"Were you so confused when you built the door you couldn\u0027t decide on which side to put the bars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madelyne,\u0027tis the same reason the staircase is built on the left,\" Duncan bantered. There was a definite sparkle in his eye. Madelyne was pleased by the change it made in his appearance. He wasn\u0027t nearly as worrisome when he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what is that reason?\" Madelyne asked, smiling in spite of herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I prefer it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A paltry reason, that,\" Madelyne announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept smiling until she realized she had hold of his hand. Madelyne quickly pulled free and turned to stare at Edmond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle brother was looking at Duncan. He stood up then and said, \"It has healed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne looked down at the ugly jagged line that marked her thigh. She grimaced over the horrible scar. Yet she quickly gained control, ashamed by her shallow reaction. Why, she wasn\u0027t a vain woman. \"Thank you, Edmond,\" she said as she pulled the cover over her leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan hadn\u0027t seen the results of Edmond\u0027s work. He leaned forward to pull the animal skin away. Madelyne pushed his hand away and then pressed the edge of the cover against the bed. \"He said it has healed, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obviously wanted to see for himself. Madelyne let out a startled yelp when Duncan ripped the cover away. She tried to push her gown down, but Duncan grabbed hold of her hands and slowly, deliberately, pushed the chainse up until all of her thigh was exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t any infection,\" Edmond remarked to Duncan, watching the scene from the other side of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, it has healed,\" Duncan announced with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he let go of Madelyne\u0027s hands, she smoothed her gown and asked, \"You didn\u0027t believe your own brother?\" She sounded appalled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan and Edmond exchanged a look Madelyne couldn\u0027t interpret. \"Of course you don\u0027t,\" she muttered. \"Probably gave him the black eye as well,\" she added, letting her disgust show. \" \u0027Tis what I would expect from the Wexton brothers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan showed his exasperation by turning and walking toward the door. His loud sigh followed him. Edmond stood there, frowning at Madelyne for another minute or so, and then followed his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne repeated her gratitude. \"I know you were ordered to care for my injury, Edmond, but I thank you all the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne was certain the sour man would abuse her compliment, and readied herself for his insults. No matter what vile thing he said to her, she\u0027d humbly turn the other cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond didn\u0027t bother to say anything. Madelyne was disappointed. How could she show the Wextons that she was a gentle maiden if they didn\u0027t give her the chance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dinner will be in one hour\u0027s time, Madelyne. You may join us in the hall when Gilard comes for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan walked out the doorway after making his announcement. Edmond, however, paused and then slowly turned around to look at Madelyne again. He seemed to be pondering some decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is Polyphemus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne\u0027s eyes widened. What a strange question. \"Why, he was a giant, the leader of the Cyclops in Homer\u0027s ancient tale,\" she answered. \"Polyphemus was a horribly deformed giant with one huge eye right in the center of his forehead. He ate Odysseus\u0027s soldiers for his supper,\" she added with a dainty shrug of her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond didn\u0027t like her answer. \"For God\u0027s sake,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t be taking God\u0027s name in vain,\" Madelyne called out. \"And why would you be asking me who Polyphemus was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne surmised, by the sound of fading footsteps, that Edmond wasn\u0027t going to answer her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet even the rudeness of the middle brother didn\u0027t diminish Madelyne\u0027s pleasure. She bounded off the bed and let out a laugh. Lord, she was finally going to get out of this room. She did not believe for one second that the door had been unlocked all week. Duncan had told her that only to get her upset. Yes, he\u0027d have me believe I\u0027m dimwitted if I allowed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne dug through her satchel. She wished she had a pretty gown to wear and then realized the foolishness of the wish. She was their captive, for heaven\u0027s sake, not their invited guest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took her all of five minutes to prepare. She paced the room a long while and then walked over to the door to see how securely it was barred. With the first pull, the door opened wide, nearly knocking Madelyne down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan had obviously left the door open just to trick her. She wanted to believe that story—until she remembered that he\u0027d left before Edmond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds floated up through the open stairway, drawing Madelyne to the landing. She leaned over the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estrained to hear the conversation, but the distance proved too great to catch a clear word. Madelyne finally gave up and turned back to go into her room. She spotted the long wooden slat propped against the stone wall and on impulse took hold of it and dragged it inside her bedroom. She hid the slat beneath her bed, smiling to herself over her bold action. \"I just might be inclined to lock you out, Duncan, instead of letting you lock me in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if she could allow much of anything, she thought. Lord, she\u0027d been confined in this room for too long a period and surely that was the pitiful reason she found such amusement in her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard did take forever to come for her. Madelyne had already jumped to the conclusion that Duncan had lied to her. He was just being cruel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Madelyne heard the sound of footsteps, she smiled with relief and ran over to stand next to the window. Smoothing her gown and her hair into place, she forced a tranquil expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard wasn\u0027t frowning. That was a surprise. He looked fit this evening, attired in the color of the forest in spring. The warm green made him look handsome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was tenderness in his voice when he spoke. \"Lady Madelyne, I would have a word with you before we go downstairs,\" he announced in lieu of a greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard gave her a worried glance, clasped his hands behind his back, and proceeded to pace a path directly in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adela will probably join the family; She knows you\u0027re here and she—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is unhappy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, though more than just unhappy. She hasn\u0027t said anything, but the look in her eyes makes me uneasy.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-15.html","bookId":1841,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
