He’d caught Maya and Emily in a more-than-just-friends moment at Noel’s party on Friday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed into the empty hallway that led to the girls’ and boys’ locker rooms, thinking again about A’s latest note. It was weird, but when Emily read the text in Maya’s hotel bathroom, it was almost like she could hear Ali’s voice. Except that was impossible, right? Besides, Ben was the only person who knew about Maya. Maybe he’d somehow found out that Emily had tried to kiss Ali. Could…could Ben be A?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily whirled around. Ben had followed her into the hall. “Hey.” Emily tried to smile. “What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen was wearing his shredded Champion sweats—he thought they brought him good luck, so he wore them to every meet. He’d re-buzzed his hair over the weekend. It made his already angular face look severe. “Nothing’s up,” he answered nastily, his voice echoing off the tile walls. “I thought you were quitting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shrugged. “Yeah, well, I guess I changed my mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? You were so into it Friday. Your girlfriend seemed so proud of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily looked away. “We were drunk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.” He took a step toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Think what you want.” She turned for her locker room. “And that text you sent didn’t scare me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen furrowed his eyebrows. “What text?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped. “The text that says you’re going to tell everyone,” she said, testing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t write you any texts.” Ben tilted his chin. “But…I might tell everyone. You being a dyke is a juicy little story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not gay,” Emily said through her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah?” Ben took a step closer. His nostrils flared in and out. “Prove it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily barked out a laugh. This was Ben. But then he lunged forward, wrapped his hand around Emily’s wrist, and pushed her against the water fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe breathed in sharply. Ben’s breath was hot on her neck and smelled like grape Gatorade. “Stop it,” she whispered, trying to squirm away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen needed just one strong arm to hold her down. He pressed his body up against hers. “I said, prove it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ben, stop.” Frightened tears came to her eyes. She swatted at him tentatively, but his movements just became more forceful. He ran his hand up her chest. A small squeak escaped her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There a problem?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen stepped back suddenly. Behind them on the far side of the hall stood a boy in a Tate Prep warm-up jacket. Emily squinted. Was that…?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s none of your business, man,” Ben said loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What isn’t any of my business?” The boy stepped closer. It was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToby Cavanaugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude.” Ben twisted around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToby’s eyes moved down to Ben’s hand on Emily’s wrist. He nudged his chin up at Ben. “What’s the deal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen glared at Emily, then let go of her. She shot away from him, and Ben used his shoulder to shove open the boys’ locker room door. Then, silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You all right?” Toby asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily nodded, her head down. “I think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily sneaked a peek at Toby. He was really tall now, and his face was no longer rodentlike and guarded but, well, high-cheekboned and dark-eyed gorgeous. It made her think of the other part of A’s note. Although most of us have totally changed…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer knees felt wobbly. It couldn’t be…could it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go,” she mumbled, and ran, her arms outstretched, into the girls’ locker room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEVEN TYPICAL ROSEWOOD BOYS SOUL-SEARCH\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuesday afternoon as Aria was driving home from school, she passed the lacrosse field and recognized the lone figure sprinting around the goal area, his lacrosse stick cradled in front of his face. He kept switching directions and sliding in the wet, muddy grass. Ominous gray clouds had gathered overhead, and now it was starting to sprinkle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria pulled over. “Mike.” She hadn’t seen her brother since he’d stormed out of the Victory yesterday. A few hours afterward, he’d called home saying he was having dinner at his friend Theo’s house. Then, later, he called to say he was staying overnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother looked up from across the field and frowned. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike trudged across the close-cropped, not-a-weed-in-sight grass. “Get in,” Aria commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m practicing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t avoid this forever. We have to talk about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talk about what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised a perfectly arched eyebrow. “Um, what we saw yesterday? At the bar?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike picked at one of the rawhide straps on his lacrosse stick. Raindrops bounced off the canvas top of his Brine cap. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Aria narrowed her eyes. But Mike wouldn’t even look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.” She shifted into reverse. “Be a wuss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Mike wrapped his hand around the window frame. “I…I don’t know what I’ll do,” he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria pressed the brake. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If they get divorced, I don’t know what I’ll do,” Mike repeated. The vulnerable, embarrassed expression on his face made him look as if he were about ten years old. “Blow myself up, maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears came to her eyes. “It’s not going to happen,” she said shakily. “I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike sniffed. She reached out for him, but he jerked away and ran down the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria decided to go, slowly rolling down the twisty, wet road. Rain was her favorite kind of weather. It reminded her of rainy days, back when she was nine. She’d sneak over to her neighbor’s parked sailboat, climb under the tarp, and snuggle into one of the cabins, listening to the sound of the rain hitting the canvas and writing entries in her Hello Kitty diary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt like she could do her best thinking on rainy days, and she definitely needed to think now. She could have dealt with A telling Ella about Meredith if it had been in the past. Her parents could talk through it, Byron could say it would never happen again, yadda yadda yadda. But now that Meredith was back, well, that changed everything. Last night, her father hadn’t come home for dinner—because of the, um, papers he had to grade—and Aria and her mom had sat on the couch in front of Jeopardy! with bowls of soup in their laps. They were both totally silent. The thing was, she didn’t know what she’d do if her parents divorced, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing a particularly steep hill, Aria gunned the engine—the Subaru always needed an extra push on inclines. But instead of revving forward, the interior lights flickered out. The car began to roll backward down the hill. “Shit,” Aria whispered, jerking up the e-brake. When she tried the ignition again, the car wouldn’t even start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down the empty, two-lane country road. Thunder broke overhead, and the rain started to hurtle down from the sky. Aria searched through her bag, figuring she needed to call a tow truck or her parents to come get her, but after rooting around the bottom, she realized she’d left her Treo at home. The rain was falling so violently, the windshield and windows blurred. “Oh God,” Aria whispered, feeling claustrophobic. Spots formed in front of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria knew this anxious feeling: It was a panic attack. She’d had them a few times before. One was after The Jenna Thing, one was after Ali went missing, and one was when she was walking down Laugavegur Street in Reykjavík and saw a girl on a billboard that looked exactly like Meredith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalm down, she told herself. It’s just rain. She took two cleansing breaths, stuck her fingers in her ears, and started singing “Frère Jacques”—for some reason, the French version did the trick. After she went through three rounds, the spots began to disappear. The rain had let up from hurricane-force to merely torrential. What she needed to do was walk back to the farmhouse she’d passed and ask to use their phone. She thrust open the car door, held her Rosewood Day blazer over her head, and started to run. A gust of wind blew up her miniskirt, and she stepped in an enormous, muddy puddle. The water seeped right through the gauzy straps of her stacked-heel sandals. “Damn it,” she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was only a hundred feet from the farmhouse when a navy-colored Audi passed. It splashed a wave of puddle water at Aria, then stopped at the dead Subaru. It slowly backed up until it was right next to her. The driver’s window glided down. “You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria squinted, raindrops dripping off the tip of her nose. Hanging out the driver’s side was Sean Ackard, a boy in her class. He was a typical Rosewood boy: crisp polo, moisturized skin, All-American features, expensive car. Only he played soccer, not lacrosse. Not the kind of person she wanted to see right now. “I’m fine,” she yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, you’re soaked. Need a ride?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria was so wet, she felt like her face was pruning. Sean’s car looked dry and snuggly. So she slid into the passenger seat and shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean told her to throw her soaked blazer into the back. Then he reached over and turned up the heat. “Where to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria pushed her matted-down, fringey black bangs off her forehead. “Actually, I’ll just use your cell phone and then be out of your way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right.” Sean dug through his backpack to find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria sat back and looked around. Sean hadn’t plastered his car with band stickers like some guys did, and the interior didn’t reek of boy sweat. Instead, it smelled like some combination of bread and a freshly shampooed dog. Two books sat on the passenger-side floor: Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and The Tao of Pooh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You like philosophy?” Aria moved her legs so she wouldn’t get them wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean ducked his head. “Well, yeah.” He sounded embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I read those books, too,” Aria said. “I also got really into French philosophers this summer, when I was in Iceland.” She paused. She’d never really spoken to Sean. Before she left, Rosewood boys terrified her—which was probably partly why she hated them. “I, um, was in Iceland for a while. My dad was on sabbatical.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” Sean gave her a crooked smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stared at her hands. “Oh.” There was an awkward pause. The only sound was the hurtling rain and the windshield wipers’ rhythmic whaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you read, like, Camus and stuff?” Sean asked. When Aria nodded, he smirked. “I read The Stranger this summer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” Aria jutted her chin into the air, certain he hadn’t understood it. What would a typical Rosewood boy want with deep philosophy books, anyway? If this were an SAT analogy, it would be “typical Rosewood boy: reading French philosophers:: American tourists in Iceland: eating anywhere but McDonald’s.” It just didn’t happen. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/flawless-pretty-little-liars-2/page-9.html","bookId":2379,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:05 AM"}
