They\u0027re very cheap. Just... Isn\u0027t the money enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sunglasses. Give them now,\" he grunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the Wayfarers off and hand them to him. Maybe I really did kill a Solly, though I\u0027m positive that any cabdrivers I\u0027ve killed lately were not American. I probably did. There probably is a wanted poster of me at... where, the taxi - the place where all the taxis congregate? What\u0027s it called? The driver tries the sunglasses on, looks at himself in the rearview mirror and then takes them off. He folds the glasses and puts them in his jacket pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a dead man.\" I smile grimly at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re a yuppie scumbag,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a dead man, Abdullah,\" I repeat, no joke. \"Count on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? And you\u0027re a yuppie scumbag. Which is worse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts the cab up and pulls away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile walking back to the highway I stop, choke back a sob, my throat tightens. \"I just want to...\" Facing the skyline, through all the baby talk, I murmur, \"keep the game going.\" As I stand, frozen in position, an old woman emerges behind a Threepenny Opera poster at a deserted bus stop and she\u0027s homeless and begging, hobbling over, her face covered with sores that look like bugs, holding out a shaking red hand. \"Oh will you please go away?\" I sigh. She tells me to get a haircut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Harry\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a Friday evening, a group of us have left the office early, finding ourselves at Harry\u0027s. Group consists of Tim Price, Craig McDermott, myself, Preston Goodrich, who is currently dating a total hardbody named, I think, Plum - no last name, just Plum, an actress/model, which I have a feeling we all think is pretty hip. We\u0027re having a debate over where to make reservations for dinner: Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, 220, Counterlife, Michael\u0027s, SpagoEast, Le Cirque. Robert Farrell is here too, the Lotus Quotrek, a portable stock-quotation device, in front of him on the table, and he\u0027s pushing buttons while the latest commodities flash by. What are people wearing? McDermott has on a cashmere sport coat, wool trousers, a silk tie, Hermes. Farrell is wearing a cashmere vest, leather shoes, wool cavalry twill trousers, Garrick Anderson. I\u0027m wearing a wool suit by Armani, shoes by Allen-Edmonds, pocket square by Brooks Brothers. Someone else has on a suit tailored by Anderson and Sheppard. Someone who looks like Todd Lauder, and may in fact be, gives thumbs-up from across the room, etc., etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions are routinely thrown my way, among them: Are the rules for wearing a pocket square the same as for a white dinner jacket? Is there any difference at all between boat shoes and Top-Siders? My futon has already flattened out and it\u0027s uncomfortable to sleep on - what can I do? How does one judge the quality of compact discs before buying them? What tie knot is less bulky than a Windsor? How can one maintain a sweater\u0027s elasticity? Any tips on buying a shearling coat? I am, of course, thinking about other things, asking myself my own questions: Am I a fitness junkie? Man vs. Conformity? Can I get a date with Cindy Crawford? Does being a Libra signify anything and if so, can you prove it? Today I was obsessed with the idea of faxing Sarah\u0027s blood I drained from her vagina over to her office in the mergers division at Chase Manhattan, and I didn\u0027t work out this morning because I\u0027d made a necklace from the bones of some girl\u0027s vertebrae and wanted to stay home and wear it around my neck while I masturbated in the white marble tub in my bathroom, grunting and moaning like some kind of animal. Then I watched a movie about five lesbians and ten vibrators. Favorite group: Talking Heads. Drink: J\u0026amp;B or Absolut on the rocks. TV show: Late Night with David Letterman. Soda: Diet Pepsi. Water: Evian. Sport: Baseball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversation follows its own rolling accord - no real structure or topic or internal logic or feeling; except, of course, for its own hidden, conspiratorial one. Just words, and like in a movie, but one that has been transcribed improperly, most of it overlaps. I\u0027m having a sort of hard time paying attention because my automated teller has started speaking to me, sometimes actually leaving weird messages on the screen, in green lettering, like \"Cause a Terrible Scene at Sotheby\u0027s\" or \"Kill the President\" or \"Feed Me a Stray Cat,\" and I was freaked out by the park bench that followed me for six blocks last Monday evening and it too spoke to me. Disintegration - I\u0027m taking it in stride. Yet the only question I can muster up at first and add to the conversation is a worried \"I\u0027m not going anywhere if we don\u0027t have a reservation someplace, so do we have a reservation someplace or not?\" I notice that we\u0027re all drinking dry beers. Am I the only one who notices this? I\u0027m also wearing mock-tortoiseshell glasses that are nonprescription. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-168.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
