Thank goodness!\" he said. \"We must hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a step back, startled to see the silvery white wolf sitting quietly by the tsarevitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it beautiful?\" he asked. \"It just showed up this evening. It won\u0027t come inside the chapel, but it won\u0027t leave either.\" The Gothic Chapel was a tiny square building with beautiful rose windows on each side. This was the imperial family\u0027s private chapel when they stayed at Peterhof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, the empress stood next to her husband in the chapel hall, smiling tightly. \"Katerina Alexandrovna,\" she addressed me. I knew she was terrified for her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI curtsied low. \"Your Imperial Majesties.\" I forced myself to look up into my sovereign\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tsar stared at me hard. Even seated in an ordinary wooden chair, he seemed majestic. When he stood up and towered over me, I thought my heart would burst in fright. There was a reason he was called Sasha the Bear by the Dark Court. \"The time has come for you to accept your responsibilities as a princess of the imperial blood,\" he said. \"Although your family belongs to the Dark Court, you still owe your all egiance to me, your tsar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Your Imperial Majesty,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A necromancer is the only one able to summon the bogatyr when Russia has need of him. My son tells me you have the dark gift.\" I glanced at the grand duke, whose face betrayed nothing. \"I have the gift\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-or curse,\" I said. \"But I do not know the ritual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The patriarch will instruct you,\" the tsar answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost like the ascension ritual of the Montenegrin Vladiki. Three priests stood chanting in front of the icon-covered doors. Only they wore white robes, with golden embroidery, instead of black ones. Incense burned, creating a smoky haze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heavy wooden chest was carried into the chapel by two young pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sprinkled with holy water, then anointed with oill as the patriarch chanted prayers over me. He did the same with the tsar and his sons, only the prayers for them were much longer. The tsar, who had been kneeling, stood up stiffly. The empress discreetly assisted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young pages opened the chest and the patriarch lifted out a bundle wrapped in linen. Inside the linen was a jeweled medal ion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered. Another talisman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patriarch\u0027s voice boomed across the chapel. \"Katerina Alexandrovna, walker among the paths of the dead, place your left hand upon the amulet of His Imperial Majesty the tsar Pavel and place your right hand in the hand of His Imperial Majesty the Sovereign Emperor, Alexander Alexandrovich.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same medal, a Maltese Cross, the symbol of the Order of St.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn of Jerusalem, that I\u0027d seen in the portrait of Tsar Pavel. Trying not to shake or tremble, I did as the patriarch instructed. I felt a tingling as something cold flowed through me from the amulet into the tsar\u0027s hand. But I was thankful this ritual did not require my blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tsar let out a roar as the cold hit him. I cringed, and tried to break off but the tsar gripped my hand tightly. He appeared to grow two feet taller, looking even more like a bear than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the summoning was complete, he finally let go of my hand. I stumbled back into the grand duke, who put out his hands to steady me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tsarevitch handed his father a large sword that looked very old. And very deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy wooden doors to the chapel burst open. A bitterly cold wind blew in, extinguishing all the candles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patriarch continued his chanting. The other priests rang bells and sprinkled more holy water on the tsar, now imbued with the spirit of the bogatyr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking the sign of the cross, the patriarch stepped back. A holy light blazed within the tsar\u0027s eyes. I dropped to my knees, bowing my head, as he strode past me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bogatyr stormed out of the chapel, his voice booming across the gardens. \"Konstantin Pavlovich!\" he bell owed. \"You are no longer welcome in Russia!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrand Duke George Alexandrovich helped me stand before joining his father and brother. The light burned in his eyes as well. A holy light I never wanted to taint with my curse. I hurried after them to the arched doorway and looked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin the Deathless stood unnaturally tall, like the bogatyr. Closing in behind him were the undead knights of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. The Dekebristi. Johanna\u0027s last gift for her vampire lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin had been a short, ugly man in his time. Death, and undeath, had not been kind to his body either. \"Alexander Alexandrovich, stand down, or you and your sons will die horribly,\" he warned. \"As did your guards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mon Dieu!\" I whispered. Could it be that every last one of the tsar\u0027s men who had been guarding the chapel had been killed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Imperial Majesty! We come to serve you!\" the Montenegrin king shouted as he ran toward us. He had arrived in a carriage with Danilo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen Milena stepped out of the carriage after them, looking pale, with a bandage wrapped around her neck. She had been fed upon. No doubt by both father and son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not see Militza, who must have been using all her shaky new influence to keep the vampires out of the fight. Or perhaps she feared losing control of them if they saw Konstantin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tsar barely acknowledged the Montenegrin king, who took a position safe behind his wife. The tsar raised his sword high and glared at Konstantin the Deathless. \"No blood drinker will ever sit on the throne of Russia,\" he declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tsarevitch and the grand duke held their swords ready. I was frightened for them as well. The silver wolf kept close to the tsarevitch, fangs bared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo stood smiling, an evil gleam in his eye. He did not bother to raise his sword as an undead soldier advanced toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen Milena muttered some kind of incantation under her breath and the undead soldier fell to the ground, motionless. The queen turned toward me with a vicious smile. I knew no incantations to fight with. Except the spell of shadows. My gift of necromancy would be no help on this battlefield. I shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low rumble alerted me that we were about to have company. The undead soldiers were closing in on us. \"George!\" I shouted, praying that protocol infractions were forgivable in the middle of a life-or-death battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The undead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe undead soldiers trampled toward us. I wanted to cry when I saw the poor creatures, but I knew they shared no such human compassion. They were intent on feeding and were under the control of the false tsar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"KILL THEM ALL!\" Konstantin Pavlovich snarled, adding what sounded like a spell in an ancient language. He was locked in combat with the true tsar, who, although larger and stronger than the lich tsar, was not as fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin had already drawn first blood, piercing the bogatyr\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the undead tried to pull me away from the fight. It was Prince Demidov.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a feral growl, he lunged for my throat. His foul breath almost made me gag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen Milena lay on the ground, too weak to get up after expending all her powers, but she smiled as she watched me struggle with the undead prince. She drew something out of the bodice of her gown. It was the Talisman of Isis, which hung around her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kicked and threw the undead prince off balance. He let go of me only for a moment, but it was enough for me to move out of his reach. I started toward the queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrowed, and she whispered something in an unfamiliar language. Two more undead soldiers marched toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart pounded in my throat. I realized I was going to die. In a most horrible fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two soldiers suddenly stopped, and their heads became curiously detached from their bodies. Behind them I saw George Alexandrovich, holding a bloodied sword. \"Get the talisman!\" he shouted at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not have time to thank him for saving my life. I ran toward the queen again and we rolled in the dirt. I was hurting, and my dress was filthy, but I did not care. I did not want to touch the tainted talisman, but I couldn\u0027t leave it in Queen Milena\u0027s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Foolish girl, you will destroy everything!\" she spat. \"The Romanov court will never accept you! Your place is with us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would rather die,\" I said, prying the talisman from her bloody fingers. I was about to damn myself. To accept the darkness I\u0027d struggled against all my life. In order to save the tsar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held the talisman high over my head and shouted as loud as I could,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blood of Isis, the strength of Isis, and the power of Isis is mine!\" A chilly wind roared in my ears. It seemed to rise inside of me, threatening to overtake me. I closed my eyes and concentrated on the talisman in my hands. When the roaring stopped, I opened my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, the undead soldiers in front of me laid down their weapons and turned their pale faces to me. All kneeled, rather wobbly, on one knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t stop all the undead, but I was safe for the moment. I turned to see if I could help the tsarevitch and his brother. The wolf was ferociously defending both of them. Snarling and snapping, it tore through the vampire who attacked the tsarevitch from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"THIS IS NOT OVER!\" Konstantin the Deathless shouted. Fangs bared, he charged the bogatyr with his sword. The bogatyr anticipated him and stepped back, unbalancing the false tsar. But Konstantin took the bogatyr down with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold light surrounding Konstantin grew larger. The bogatyr struggled stoically, but I knew he was suffering from the cold touch of the deathless tsar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth sons of the bogatyr were fighting another wave of undead soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKing Nikola and Crown Prince Danilo were protecting Queen Milena from three more of the Dekebristi. No one was able to help the bogatyr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Konstantin\u0027s cold light wrap around the bogatyr. It was draining his soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to scream. The talisman had not affected Konstantin at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut shadows could destroy light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven a cold light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheult Anubis,\" I said, the sick feeling of dark magic beginning to rise in my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened at first. The bogatyr and Konstantin continued to struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheult Anubis,\" I repeated, a little stronger this time as the shadows began to close in around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spoke the words a third time and concentrated on pushing the shadows toward Konstantin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a weak effort, but the shadows distracted him just long enough for the bogatyr to roll away and stand again. Konstantin was caught off guard as the bogatyr charged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped in a puddle of blood and slid toward the Montenegrin queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKing Nikola pulled his wife out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bogatyr pointed his sword at Konstantin\u0027s neck. \"Yield, blood drinker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"NEVER!\" Konstantin spat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bogatyr drew back his sword to deal the death blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe false tsar laughed. \"This is not the end, Alexander Alexandrovich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throne of Russia belongs to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chilling wind blew and the ground began to shake. I could barely stand up, but Nicholas Alexandrovich held out his arm to assist me. Then, suddenly, the wind disappeared, taking Konstantin the Deathless with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bogatyr swore disgustedly as his sword came down with a heavy clang upon nothing but dry earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the devil?\" the tsarevitch said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Konstantin!\" the bogatyr roared. But the false tsar was gone. An eerie silence fell across the churchyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it over?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bogatyr\u0027s gaze swept across the bloody field. With a satisfied grunt, he nodded and sheathed his sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a weak voice calling out. \"Mistress ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not Count Chermenensky, but Prince Demidov. I found him lying in a tangled heap, his left arm sliced off. I was nervous approaching him, but he was under my control now, thanks to the talisman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently, he held something out to me. \"He lived to serve you, Mistress.\" I stepped back with a cry. It was Count Chermenensky\u0027s head in the crook of his right arm. The undead count had been killed while trying to protect me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Alexandrovich was at my side immediately and put his hand on my arm to steady me. \"He served his mistress well,\" he said. It took everything I had not to faint. I could not stop the tears from rolling down my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grand duke bent down and clasped the undead prince\u0027s remaining hand. \"This war is not over yet, friend. We ask that you lead the other undead soldiers and fight for Russia against Konstantin the Deathless.\" Prince Demidov nodded and stiffly saluted the grand duke. \"If the mistress wills it, it shal be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped the tears out of my eyes. I\u0027d hoped to find a way to return the poor count and the others to their eternal rest. At least the count would no longer suffer. But if the tsar wanted the others to remain as revenants, there was nothing I could do. I stood up to hand the talisman to the bogatyr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a frown he shook his head. \"Only a necromancer may wield the Talisman of Isis. Will you bear this burden? Will you serve your tsar?\" I hesitated. All my hopes and dreams for my future had already slipped away. I bowed my head. \"I will, Your Imperial Majesty,\" I whispered. I would embrace my dark powers, to protect the tsar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bogatyr\u0027s voice boomed over the bloodied field. \"I do hereby recognize the undead knights of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. From this day forward, you will belong to the Order of St. Lazarus.\" The priests who had been standing in the hall of the chapel chanting prayers now rang their bells and said prayers for the newly created order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mysterious silver wolf had vanished. If it hadn\u0027t been for the ghost of Tsar Pavel mentioning wolf-folk, I might have believed that I\u0027d imagined the beautiful creature. I wondered if the wolf was someone I knew. The creature had kept very close to the tsarevitch throughout much of the fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bogatyr retreated into the chapel, where the empress waited, and the priests led me in after them to complete the ritual. It was time to send the bogatyr\u0027s spirit back and relieve the tsar of his supernatural burden. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-56.html","bookId":2654,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM"}
