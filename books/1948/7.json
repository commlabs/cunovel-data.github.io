I’m walking away because I’m the one who’s hurting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And therefore the one least qualified to be making this kind of decision,” her mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother, don’t you see…” Linnette began. She sighed. “It’s time for me to do something that’s more…out of my comfort zone. My life is so regimented, so…so, I don’t know, so perfect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In other words, you’re looking for a way to screw it up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made Linnette smile. “No. I’m looking for a way to escape. I’m seeking adventure,” she said grandly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you’ve always been so responsible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly my point,” Linnette told her. “I’m tired of meeting all these expectations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother’s eyes narrowed. “Your father and I never meant—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom.” Linnette leaned across the table and placed a hand on her mother’s arm. “It’s not your expectations I’m talking about but my own. I’m the one who put them on myself. As of right now, I’m taking a long, hard look at my life. I’m setting out to discover what I really want. All I know is that it isn’t in Cedar Cove.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother seemed about to break into tears. “And you have to run away from your family?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” It was the simple, straightforward truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Corrie picked up her tea and her lips trembled as she bent to take a sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinnette understood how difficult this was for her mother. “Think about the positive side, Mom,” she said, forcing a note of cheerful optimism into her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s positive about my daughter running away?” Corrie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, this’ll be a wonderful opportunity for you and Gloria to get to know each other without me there always directing the conversation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother’s eyes widened. The situation with Gloria remained awkward, although everyone was trying to make her feel like part of the family. Gloria had been given up for adoption as an infant and then found her biological family. She was a full-blooded sister Linnette had never known she had—or at least not until two years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little while before that, Linnette had moved practically next door to her own sister and they’d struck up a friendship. Gloria had been a tremendous comfort to Linnette since her breakup with Cal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you both equally,” her mother said in low tones. “I always have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course you do, Mom, but you don’t really know Gloria. Like I said, this is your chance to bond without me being there.” So far, it’d always been the three of them. Now, both Gloria and their mother could benefit from some private time together. Without Linnette who, as she readily acknowledged, tended to be the center of attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finished her tea and, feeling a little stronger—perhaps the tea had helped—she brought her cup to the sink. Her mother stood, too. “I should go. Your father expected me back at the office half an hour ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m surprised that he didn’t call your cell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorrie smiled. “I suspect he knew where I was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was probably right. Linnette admired her parents’ marriage and the way they understood each other, the way they worked together. It was what she wanted for her own marriage and was determined to have one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother left soon afterward. Linnette hugged her, and they both managed to smile, despite Corrie’s disappointment. Everything she’d said was true, and yet nothing was going to change. Linnette instinctively knew she’d made the right decision. She needed to leave Cedar Cove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rinsed out the cups and set them in the dishwasher. She’d just returned to her packing when the doorbell rang again. It would be either her brother, Mack, or Gloria, she figured. Most likely Gloria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Linnette was in for a shock. Vicki Newman, the woman Cal loved, stood on the other side of the screen door. For a long moment the two women did nothing but stare at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you don’t mind that I’ve come,” Vicki said shyly, her brown eyes imploring Linnette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does Cal know you’re here?” Linnette couldn’t help glancing over the woman’s shoulder. Then she looked back at Vicki, with her plain face—there was no other word for it—and her carelessly braided hair. And yet Linnette had begun to realize why Cal loved her so much. For one thing they shared a view of the world, including their passion for animals; Vicki was a veterinarian and Cal a horse-trainer who worked for Grace Harding’s husband. The way it had all happened, though—Linnette still found that hard to believe. But she respected him for caring so deeply that he was willing to stand up to the barrage of criticism directed at him because of the pain he’d caused Linnette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to Linnette’s question, Vicki shook her head. “Cal wouldn’t like it if he found out I’d stopped by.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing him as well as she did, Linnette agreed. Unlatching the screen door, she pushed it open to allow the other woman inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Vicki walked into the apartment, her gaze darted about the room, taking in the boxes that littered the floor. “So it’s true. You are moving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinnette ignored her comment and gestured toward the sofa. “Would you like to sit down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki declined with a shake of her head. She gazed down at the carpet. “I heard you were leaving, and I just wanted to tell you how…how sorry I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry that I’m leaving?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No…sorry that I hurt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…” Vicki looked up then and seemed to reach some decision. “I’ve been in love with Cal for a long time,” she said. “Long before he met you. He didn’t know it and I…I didn’t know how to tell him, so I said nothing. I never thought he could possibly love me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s because of Cal that you volunteered to help with the mustang rescue, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki nodded. “Well…partly. The cause is important to me too, of course. Anything to do with horses…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand.” After a brief silence, she asked, “You knew about me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki nodded again. “I tried not to love him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinnette wasn’t sure of the other woman’s purpose in confronting her. Perhaps she felt guilty. Perhaps because of that she was hoping Linnette would yell at her, curse her, condemn her for taking the man Linnette loved. A week earlier, that was exactly what might have happened. Not now. “I’m the one who’s trying not to love him,” Linnette whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure there’ll be lots of other opportunities for you. You’ll find someone else to love—someone who’ll love you,” Vicki said urgently. “But for me…” She cleared her throat. “I communicate better with animals than I do with people. I always have. As soon as I met Cal, I felt we should be together. He has the same feeling about animals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinnette suddenly had a sharp clear memory of the time she’d come to visit Cal and overheard him crooning to an injured horse. He hadn’t known she was there. Linnette had felt as if she was intruding on a private moment, a private world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cal’s asked me to marry him,” Vicki said in a low voice. “I want to…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you should,” Linnette said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We both feel so guilty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t, please.” She reached out to touch Vicki’s arm. In the beginning she’d hated this woman, but she no longer felt that way. “I want you both to be happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean that?” Vicki asked, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With all my heart.” Linnette took a deep breath. “If you’ve come looking for my absolution, then you have it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I tell Cal we’ve talked?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinnette nodded. “You’re right, you know. I will find someone else.” For the first time she actually believed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the Saturday evening of the dreaded family dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri couldn’t stop fidgeting. She checked the ham roasting in the oven, along with a huge casserole of scalloped potatoes. She’d chosen fresh green beans for the vegetable; they were simmering on the stove. Although it was summer, ham had always been served on special occasions, and Teri wasn’t about to break with tradition. The table was set with her formal dishes—even the concept of “formal” and “everyday” dishes was a new one for her—and sparkling crystal glasses. Nothing but the best for Mom, Christie and the gang, she thought with no small degree of irony. Against her better judgment, Teri was introducing her family, such as it was, to her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bobby,” she called, leaving the kitchen and pulling off the apron she’d donned to protect her pale-green shirt. She’d worn it for confidence, since Bobby loved that color on her. When he came toward her, she drew in a calming breath. “Remember what I told you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband regarded her blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About Christie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudging by the blank look he gave her, he didn’t recall a word. She’d wanted to warn him so he’d be prepared. Her sister, slim and lovely, would do everything in her power to attract him—and steal him away if she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri suspected that Christie had coerced Johnny into arranging this meeting just so she could prove yet again that any man would prefer her. Christie was thinner, prettier, sexier, and she made sure Teri knew it. Not for a minute did Teri discount her sister’s charms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed at Johnny’s naiveté. She didn’t really blame him for engineering this…this fiasco-to-be; her little brother desperately wanted them all to live in peace and harmony—as though they actually liked each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed again. “My family will be here any minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby stared back at her, then slowly smiled. “I love you, remember.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not the one who needs to be reminded.” Christie could be subtle while she was busy flattering some unsuspecting man. She’d be completely absorbed in Bobby, hang on his every word. He’d fall for it, too, she thought grimly. It seemed that every guy she’d loved had been lured away by her sister. Whenever Christie met any man in Teri’s life, he was no longer interested in her. Even if Christie had a boyfriend at the time, she had to take her sister’s, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had mattered to Teri as much as Bobby. If Christie assumed she could waltz into Teri’s home and play her games, then her little sister had a real surprise awaiting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me their names again,” Bobby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mother’s name is Ruth and her husband, my stepfather, is Donald.” Teri had to stop and think. “No, sorry, Johnny phoned and told me Mom’s left Donald and now she’s planning to marry Mike. I haven’t met him yet.” She shook her head. Out of seven men, Ruth had yet to pick a decent one as far as Teri could tell, and she doubted Mike would be the exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ruth and Mike,” Bobby dutifully repeated. “And your sister’s Christie.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/74-seaside-avenue-cedar-cove-7/page-7.html","bookId":1948,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:25 AM"}
