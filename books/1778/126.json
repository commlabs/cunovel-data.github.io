And I also haven’t been with Novo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long silence was a surprise, but Axe didn’t really care one way or another. “We done here? FYI, I’m not going to cut you or anything. I don’t want anything to fucking do with you, but that hasn’t changed since orientation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her father called me. She’s moving out of the house. He’s requested that I keep an eye out for her and I’ve agreed to do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise was leaving home? Holy shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept then Axe reminded himself that it wasn’t really his business anymore, was it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you got what you want.” Axe got to his feet. “Congratulations. Then again, shit always works out for people like you, doesn’t it—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNovo came up the short steps and leaned into the bus. “Are you two killing each other or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAxe shook his head. “Nope. We’re good—oh, but he thinks I fucked you three nights ago—or whenever it was we went to the club.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You heard me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNovo stared at Peyton. “Axe put me up for membership. That’s why he took me there. And it was because I asked him to—oh, and Axe shut me down when I asked him if he wanted to be with me. Turned me down flat. Jesus, Peyton, could you be any more of an asshole?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAxe walked forward, shaking his head. “It doesn’t matter. S’all good. Moving on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing past Novo, he stepped off the bus, went over to the door that had been propped open, and entered the training center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he headed for the gym, where they were going to be sparring, he was aware of a whole lot of things: He was exhausted, for one thing, but he had a feeling he needed to get used to that. He was in pain, but yeah, file that along with the former.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his head, he was monitoring each and every thought he had, checking for signs that he was going to crash and burn as his father had. It was like he was searching for cracks in his foundation, waiting for his superstructure to collapse, anticipating the paralysis that he had watched for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already crippled on the inside. Surely the outside was going to go, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the truly pathetic thing? He had bonded with Elise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, as she had pointed out, it had been only a matter of nights, but—as he had so often heard, and never truly believed—when it came to males and their soul mates? It didn’t take time; it took the right female.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Elise was right for him even if he was wrong for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yeah, he was crippled and going to remain that way for the rest of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what the hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d already been crippled before. He was used to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as some people were destined to be happy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers simply didn’t win that lottery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the evening, as everyone at the Brotherhood mansion came together and took their seats in the dining room, Rhage waited for Mary to give him the cue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when she did, just as the feast of Last Meal was being served, he turned to Bitty, who was next to him. “Hey, will you come with me and your mom for a second? Nothing is wrong, we just need to talk to you about something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure!” The little girl was up and at ’em, ready to go. “Uncle Ruhn, I’m going to be right back. You stay with the BABUs!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male blinked in confusion. “I’m sorry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLassiter leaned in. “Buffoons. She has a speech impediment. It’s really sad—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitty nailed the angel in the arm. “Bad-Ass Big Uncles. And will you stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nevaaaaaaaaaaah!” the angel cackled. Before giving Bitty a playful tug on her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Bitty skipped out ahead and Rhage drew Mary in against him, he called out, “The library, okay? Bit, we’re going in the library.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roger that,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ready?” he whispered to his shellan. As she nodded, he murmured, “It’s going to be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were all in there together, he shut the doors. Man, it felt like he was back in his own skin, his own life, his own ocean, swimming freely with the current instead of against it. And Mary was the same way—Dearest Virgin Scribe, it was good to see the light back in his shellan’s eyes and the smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as for Ruhn? The guy was a gem. Quiet, dignified in himself, not a pansy, either. He had insisted on carrying his things up to the guest room he’d been given down the hall of statues. And was already looking for projects to fix, clean, or improve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFritz was going to learn to hate the motherfucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” Bitty said—before she got distracted by the Christmas tree. “Oh, my—we need to celebrate your holiday, Mom. But not yet. Ruhn needs presents. We need to … we need to figure out what he likes and I have an allowance. I can get him some myself—but you guys need to, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary laughed and drew the girl over to the sofa. “Absolutely, we will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yay! So what’s going on—Father, we need to watch Deadpool with him. He hasn’t seen any movies. Like, ever. Not even Jaws. I have a draft list, and I want you to go through it with me. We’ll set up a viewing schedule just like we did for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhage nodded. “Absolutely. That kind of deficit is more important than literacy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary put her head in her hands. “You two are insane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhage put his palm out for a high five and Bit slapped it with her own. “Nailed it,” Rhage said. “Now, we need to get serious. Your mom has something she needs to tell you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-vow-black-dagger-legacy-2/page-126.html","bookId":1778,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:46 AM"}
