At that area, the sky was dark and there were many devil clouds floating in the sky.

When the crowd saw this sight, their hearts began to shudder in fear. This was because they knew that this light barrier was their final line of defence.

It was Wu Xuan, the chief of the Demonic Wind Cave. Back then, he had a grudge with Lin Dong.

The leader of the Gu clan, Gu Tong, smiled bitterly and said, “In the past, though we were able to enter the Chaotic Tower, we could not reach the final level. However, we were unable to enter the tower ever since that deep yellow light barrier appeared.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It seems as though that elder does not wish to be disturbed.” The leader of the Xu clan nodded and said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Why don’t… all of you try again?” Wu Xuan thought for a moment before he said.

Outside the deep yellow light barrier, all of them could spot a couple of figures standing in the sky.
