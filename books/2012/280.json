All I ever wanted – feel it slip away, slip away .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoman, you should never have let me go. I should have given you that power over me. If I had, you would’ve understood. You would have believed my love for you. And if you had believed, in that moment … I would have believed, too. How could I not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is my fault. I saw that then and I see it now. My fault .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStonny, my love, I am sorry .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime, that stretched behind him for ever, that closed in and became solid, that beckoned ahead with a darkness almost within reach, then ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she staggered to his side, she saw that he was dead. Sembled into her Imass form, she sat down weakly beside his carcass, lifted her gaze to the empty, dust-wreathed sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last of them, gone now. Out into the world. She had known that there would be hundreds of them, but still, the sight of that exodus had stunned her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood pooled beneath her, mixing with that of Gruntle, this noble fool lying so still beside her. There was nothing more heartbreaking than to look upon a dead beast, a thing stripped of its terrible strength, its perfect majesty. And there was something still crueller when that beast was a hunter, a predator. A rival . Not killed for food. No. Killed for existing, killed for the presumption of competition. The predator fights to the last. It refuses to surrender. Hunt it down. Corner it. See those bared fangs. Listen to its fury and its fear and its noble defiance .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou understood all of this, Gruntle. You understood the inescapable, profound tragedy that is the beast that hunts, that dares to challenge our domination .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not mean to take your life .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she was badly hurt. She knew she might not survive this. Even without the power of his god – whom she had kept away until the dragon’s arrival – he had been … extraordinary. Had he not turned upon the Eleint … yes, he would have killed me .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGruntle, I will remember you. This I swear. Here, in the cracks in my heart. I will curse Trake until the end of my days, but you, brother of the hunt, I will remember .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing a scrabble of stones, she lifted her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pair of emlava had returned, and now edged towards her. She sensed their distress. Their grief. ‘He lives,’ she whispered. ‘My husband lives. For now. As for what comes …’ I wish I had an answer .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe realm was dying on all sides. Disintegrating into dust, as all dreams must do, when the last dreamer is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she leaned back, closed her eyes, she felt the world shifting beneath her. So … gentle now, sweet as the rocking of a ship. Husband. Was I wrong to do this? She looked over to see the two sabre-toothed cats lying down beside Gruntle’s carcass. As if to give him warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to make him their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER NINETEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not even the dead know the end to war.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIskar Jarak\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘WHAT ARE YOU DOING?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal cinched tight the last straps, and reached for the black-scaled gauntlets. ‘I can’t just sit here any more,’ he said. ‘Since it seems we’re all going to die anyway.’ He glanced up at her, and shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips were dry, chapped. Her eyes were ringed in red, hollowed with exhaustion. ‘What of me?’ she asked in a whisper. ‘You will leave me … alone?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sand, there are no chains on that throne—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ But there are! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. And there’s no law says you got to sit there until the end. Why give them the glory of dragging you down from it, their delight at seeing fresh Andiian blood splashing the dais steps? Piss on them! Come with me. Die with the ones giving their lives to defend you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away. ‘I do not know how to fight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Doesn’t matter,’ he said, rising from where he’d been sitting on the stone steps at the base of the throne. He took up the heavy mace he’d found – along with this arcane armour – in a dust-thick crypt far below the palace. ‘Look at me. Too old for this by half.’ He picked up the shield, slipping his arm through the straps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did look at him then. ‘That’s not Andiian armour.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Didn’t think it was,’ he replied, ‘else it would never have fitted me. Better yet, it’s not the kind that needs two people to put on. And the leather bindings – they don’t seem to have aged at all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How could I bear it, Withal? Seeing them die.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You sit here fighting your own war, Sand. If their dying in your imagination is easier for you to bear, it’s because you don’t see the blood. You don’t hear the cries. The price they’re paying you won’t even deign to witness.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-280.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
