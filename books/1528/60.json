Two other staff members had also been killed. Painter checked his watch. The second hand swept past the twelve, crossing the fail-safe deadline set for one o’clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his breath, but nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, after setting the fail-safe, he had fled to the mechanical room and manually disabled the electronic sparking system. He had needed the levels flooded with the accelerant gas, but Mapplethorpe had been right. Painter could not let the men and women captured by the commando team die, not even to protect the girl. So he had set the trap instead, localizing the firestorm to the one room and luring Mapplethorpe and his team to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a majority of the soldiers dispatched and its leader killed, the others would likely disperse and vanish into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa leaned against him. “Will the fires spread?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer came from above. Sprinklers engaged and rained both water and foam over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it over?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter nodded. “Right here it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Painter knew things elsewhere were far from settled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:53 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePripyat, Ukraine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray sprinted toward the closing steel door at the back end of the massive hangar. He pounded down the roadway between the tall rails. He passed the bodies of two dead workers, shot in the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart thundered in his ears, but he still heard cheers echoing from the distant grandstands, as if this were a track meet and he was sprinting for the finish line in the four-hundred-meter dash. Only in this race, the spectators’ lives depended on him crossing the finish line in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a final burst of speed, he reached the hatchway and dove on his belly under the descending door. It was like entering a crawl space beneath a house. The door was yards thick, composed of plates of steel. He scrabbled forward as the edge continued to drop, pressing down on him. Panic fired his heart. He kicked and paddled, worming his way forward as he was flattened farther under the thick door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he reached the end and rolled out into a cavernous space. He took in the sight in a heartbeat: a vast interior, lined by scaffolding, enclosing a ten-story blocky structure of concrete and blackened steel. It was the infamous Sarcophagus, the gravestone over reactor four. By now, the hangar had been hauled almost completely over the crypt. Beyond the Sarcophagus rose a wall of concrete. The hangar would end its crawl and butt up against that wall, sealing the Sarcophagus completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for now, an arch of sunlight spanned the Sarcophagus like a fiery rainbow. It was all that was left open to the world. As Gray stared, the sunlit rainbow grew incrementally narrower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff to the left, Gray heard someone speaking in Russian outside the hangar, proud and bold, broadcasted loudly from the grandstands. He also heard the continual steady drone of the hydraulic jacks as they pulled the hangar the last few feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen to the right, a pistol fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray pictured the bodies outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicolas was leaving an easy trail of bread crumbs to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Gray sprinted in that direction, he kept low as he dodged around several stacks of plate steel, a pile of broken concrete, and a forklift. The air smelled of oil and tasted rusty. As he reached the corner of the Sarcophagus, he freed the pistol from his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeering around the corner, he spotted a figure limping toward the narrowing arch of sunlight. He was about twenty yards from escaping. Gray leveled his pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nicolas!” Gray barked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, the man tripped around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t move!” Gray shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicolas searched for a second, then turned and fled. Gray could not risk killing the man. Not until he found out what was planned. So he took careful aim and shot. Nicolas’s good leg went out from under him. He sprawled onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray rushed toward him, but a man such as Nicolas did not rise to his height of power by folding under stress. The senator rolled behind a stack of steel I-beams. Shots fired back at Gray, forcing him to duck to the side. He took shelter behind a pallet of lumber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chyort! Rodilsya cherez jopu!” Nicolas cursed at him in Russian, his voice edging toward hysteria. He yelled at Gray. “We can’t stay here, you svoloch! We have less than three minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the man’s hiding place, Gray watched the sliver of sunlight between the massive concrete wall and the trundling hangar pinch ever closer together. There was only four feet of space left. No wonder Nicolas was in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then tell me how to stop Operation Uranus!” Gray called back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no way to stop it! It’s all been set in motion. All we can do is get out of the way…now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what you’ve done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine! Concussion charges! Planted inside the pillars on the other side of the Sarcophagus. They’ll rip a wall down and expose everyone on that side to a lethal dose of radiation. There’s no way to defuse them. We MUST go now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray attempted to digest what he’d heard, trying to seek a solution. Even if he ran outside and screamed for an evacuation, it would be too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no reason for us to die with them,” Nicolas continued. “The world needs a new direction. Needs strong men. Like myself. Like you. Our group’s goal is to better the state of mankind, to forge a new Renaissance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray remembered the senator’s earlier discussion about propping up a new prophet onto the world stage. So this is how he planned to do it, creating world chaos, then offering a solution, one promoted by a figurehead who was guided by the prescience and knowledge of augmented children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even if we die here,” Nicolas pressed, “it won’t be the end. Plans are already in motion that cannot be stopped. Our deaths would serve no purpose. Join us. We can use such men as yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, Gray could think of no way to stop what was to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond Nicolas, the walls continued to close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two minutes!” he called to Gray. “There’s a lead-lined control booth just outside. We can still make it if we leave right now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicolas shifted behind his hiding place, plainly considering making a run for it. But with a twisted ankle on one side and a wounded leg on the other, he must know that path was certain death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, so was staying here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicolas finally tossed out his pistol and stepped into the open. He faced Gray, arms out to either side, tottering on his legs. “If this is the only way to live, so be it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray cursed under his breath. Unable to stop the deaths to come, his only recourse was to apprehend the mass murderer who had orchestrated the deadly operation. Gray stepped out into the open with his pistol leveled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, the drone of the hydraulic pumps climbed into a screaming roar. With a groan of twenty thousand tons, the massive arch began to shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was happening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski stepped over the dead soldier to join Elena at the control panel. While Gray had fled on foot, Elena had driven the motorcycle like a NASCAR driver on crack. Kowalski had clung so hard to the sidecar’s handles that his fingers still trembled. They had rocketed to the rear side of the steel archway and sailed up to a concrete bunker that trailed big cables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the control shack for the hydraulic jacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fierce but brief firefight followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski had tried to help, but Elena spun like a ballerina with a machine gun. She danced and pirouetted through a hail of bullets as if anticipating each shot. She took out four soldiers. Kowalski managed to kill only one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicolas’s men, Elena had said once the gunfight ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside, Elena had set to work. Bent over the control board, she pushed the hydraulics toward the redline, seeking to close the hangar faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust outside the shack’s window, one of the towering motors smoked, looking ready to blow. On one of the screens, flashing red warning signs blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat couldn’t be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski stepped out of Elena’s way and stared at a row of monitors. They displayed video feed from inside the hangar. On the middle screen, Kowalski spotted two tiny figures on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray and the Russian guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the angle of the camera, Kowalski could see what Gray could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, crap!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elena!” he called out. “A little help here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned in time to see her suddenly slump toward the floor. He reached out and caught her around the waist. His hand found the shirt under her dark jacket soaking and hot. He parted the coat and saw her entire left side drenched in blood. It seemed her dancing had not been as flawless as he’d thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t you say something?” he said with an ache in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved to the monitors. “Show me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray struggled to comprehend the sudden acceleration of the hangar’s closure. The momentum of twenty thousand tons was not easy to get moving quickly, but it was definitely closing faster, accompanied by the scream of hydraulic motors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Nicolas cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray realized the anguish in his voice was twofold: fear that he now had even less time to escape, and dismay that his plans would be ruined if the hangar sealed too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go!” Gray said, pointing his pistol at the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicolas lowered his outstretched arms—and revealed what was hidden behind the pile of I-beams. The man’s hand had been out of view until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt pointed at Gray’s belly and fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray managed to twist sideways, but the bullet still burned a line of fire across his stomach. He pointed his own weapon and fired. The shot, thrown off by the sudden attack, ricocheted harmlessly off the floor. Even worse, the pistol’s slide popped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of bullets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same could not be said for Nicolas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Russian drew a dead bead upon Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a consequence of his concentration, Nicolas missed the movement along the roof of the arched hangar. A massive yellow trolley crane swept above them and dropped a giant hook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whistling as it plummeted finally drew Nicolas’s eye. He glanced up as the massive steel hook, large enough to anchor ships, slammed into the pile of beams next to him. He tried to leap aside, but the impact knocked half the pile over, pinning his legs. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-oracle-sigma-force-5/page-60.html","bookId":1528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM"}
