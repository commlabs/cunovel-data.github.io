{"id":109067,"no":85,"title":"Page 85","content":"\u003cp\u003eAll this was never explained to me till I was in my teens and there was this great woman who lived in my home town, Edith Neisser, dead now, and she wrote terrific books about how we screw up our children—Brothers and Sisters was one of her books, The Eldest Child was another. Published by Harper. Edith doesn’t need the plug, seeing, like I said, as she’s no longer with us, but if there are any amongst you who are worried that maybe you’re not being perfect parents, pick up one of Edith’s books while there’s still time. I knew her ‘cause her kid Ed got his haircuts from my pop, and she was this writer and by my teens I knew, secretly, that was the life for me too, except I couldn’t tell anybody. It was too embarrassing—barber’s sons, if they hustled, maybe got to be IBM salesmen, but writers? No way. Don’t ask me how, but eventually Edith discovered my shhhhhh ambition and from then on, sometimes, we would talk. And I remember once we were having iced tea on the Neisser porch and talking and just outside the porch was their badminton court and I was watching some kids play badminton and Ed had just shellacked me, and as I left the court for the porch, he said, ‘Don’t worry, it’ll all work out, you’ll get me next time’ and I nodded, and then Ed said, ‘And if you don’t, you’ll beat me at something else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the porch and sipped iced tea and Edith was reading this book and she didn’t put it down when she said, ‘That’s not necessarily true, you know,’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, ‘How do you mean?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s when she put her book down. And looked at me. And said it: ‘Life isn’t fair, Bill. We tell our children that it is, but it’s a terrible thing to do. It’s not only a lie, it’s a cruel lie. Life is not fair, and it never has been, and it’s never going to be.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould you believe that for me right then it was like one of those comic books where the light bulb goes on over Mandrake the Magician’s head? ‘It isn’t!’ Isaid, so loud I realty startled her. ‘You’re right. It’s not fair.’ I was so happy if I’d known how to dance, I’d have started dancing. ‘Isn’t that great, isn’t it just terrific?’ I think along about here Edith must have thought I was well on my way toward being bonkers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it meant so much to me to have it said and out and free and flying—that was the discontent I endured the night my father stopped reading, I realized right then. That was the reconciliation I was trying to make and couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s what I think this book’s about. All those Columbia experts can spiel all they want about the delicious satire; they’re crazy. This book says ‘life isn’t fair’ and I’m telling you, one and all, you better believe it. I got a fat spoiled son—he’s not gonna nab Miss Rheingold. And he’s always gonna be fat, even if he gets skinny he’ll still be fat and he’ll still be spoiled and life will never be enough to make him happy, and that’s my fault maybe—make it all my fault, if you want—the point is, we’re not created equal, for the rich they sing, life isn’t fair. I got a cold wife; she’s brilliant, she’s stimulating, she’s terrific; there’s no love; that’s okay too, just so long as we don’t keep expecting everything to somehow even out for us before we die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook. (Grownups skip this paragraph.) I’m not about to tell you this book has a tragic ending, I already said in the very first line how it was my favorite in all the world. But there’s a lot of bad stuff coming up, torture you’ve already been prepared for, but there’s worse. There’s death coming up, and you better understand this: some of the wrong people die. Be ready for it. This isn’t Curious George Uses the Potty. Nobody warned me and it was my own fault (you’ll see what I mean in a little) and that was my mistake, so I’m not letting it happen to you. The wrong people die, some of them, and the reason is this: life is not fair. Forget all the garbage your parents put out. Remember Morgenstern. You’ll be a lot happier. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-85.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
