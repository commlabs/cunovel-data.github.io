The trio had gathered near a cloth stand, feigning interest in the stacked fabric rolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the next corner ahead, when we’re momentarily out of sight, I’ll head down a side street. You two rush to the front of the hotel. Let them see you going inside, cause some commotion. Hopefully they’ll believe I’ve already entered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the furrow between Seichan’s eyebrows, she had little confidence in his plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for her hand and gave her fingers a quick squeeze. It was a reflex move, more intimate than he intended. “I’ll be fine,” he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf nothing else, the brief and surprising contact left her speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go,” Gray said before any further discussion could start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed together down the street, sauntering at a leisurely pace. Once Gray passed around the next corner, he hurried to the mouth of another alleyway ahead. If the map was correct, he should be able to circle back and join up with Captain Wayne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he turned away, Seichan’s last glance remained unreadable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski was more blunt. “Watch your ass out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe planned on doing just that. Behind him, Seichan and Kowalski rushed headlong, aiming for the broad steps to Hotel Jubba at the end of the block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least they knew how to take orders. He prayed Tucker Wayne would do the same. But with each step, Gray hurried faster, knowing that was not likely. Tucker was as much a creature of instinct as his furry partner. The man would react before thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially if his dog was in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane huddles in the shadows under a protruding slab of broken concrete. Beyond his hiding place, the night around him is a complex weave of scent trails, echoing sounds, and movement. He stares unblinking at it all, allowing the landscape to build before him, as much a map of the present as the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whispery crunch of a stone under boot …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leathery tap of a rifle strap on cloth …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy pant of excitement of a predator closing in on prey …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis original prey remains clustered with his pack, deaf to the danger approaching. Kane tracks the newcomers as they cut through old scent trails, even his own, creating a new one, stinking of man. It fully circles the others now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen draws tighter as they move in on their prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane stays in his hiding place, unmoving, placing his trust in shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:22 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker crouched outside the fence, hidden behind a Dumpster, his attention fixed to the feed from Kane’s camera. Still following his original instructions, the dog remained focused on Amur’s group, who continued to discuss where to spend the money in hand, where to eat a late dinner, and how to get more payments out of Commander Pierce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the while, a deadly noose tightened around them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Kane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker dared not risk calling his partner back to him. The movement would draw the commandos’ attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if the dog had heard his silent worry, the view on the screen shifted as Kane glanced backward, over his shoulder. The angle turned enough to reveal a commando in black body armor closing toward Kane’s position. The shepherd remained at his post, as Tucker had ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane thinks he’s hidden well enough, Tucker realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dog was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight-vision goggles hid the approaching commando’s eyes. Kane’s shadowy shelter offered no protection from such technology. In a moment, the shepherd would easily be spotted, along with the foreign vest—then all hell would break loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker glanced up and down the street. Commander Pierce was nowhere in sight, and he had to do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisting around, he dove for the fence, to the gap along the bottom where Kane had crawled through. It was too small for him, but coils of razor wire blocked the way over the top. With no other choice, he placed his phone on the ground and dug with both hands into the hard-packed sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the while, he stared at the phone beside him, watching the commando draw closer to Kane. He dug faster, scooping out sand, deepening the hole, bloodying his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, unable to wait any longer, he squirmed his way through the gap. The loose tunic ripped on the fangs of the fence’s lower end, exposing his Kevlar vest beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached back and grabbed his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe view of the video feed stopped his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the screen, the grainy image of the commando jerked to a stop, plainly startled. And the reason was obvious. The soldier shifted his rifle and pointed it directly toward the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectly at Kane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:23 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn that fool …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan moved briskly, angrily, into the tiled lobby of the Hotel Jubba.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski followed at her heels. She hated abandoning Gray and hated that it bothered her so much, but in the end, she also recognized the necessity. The pair had succeeded in drawing their tail to the steps of the building, hopefully leaving them unaware of Gray’s disappearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she could not relax the tense knot between her shoulder blades. Gray shouldn’t have gone out there alone. If they’d taken an extra few moments to plan, some other ruse could have been calculated to fool the ones tailing them. Instead, his action had been unusually rash, even reckless. And not just here. They’d come close to losing Tucker Wayne and his dog back in Zanzibar. Not a mistake Gray would normally make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she could guess the cause. A deep current of fury and frustration still flowed through his core. She recognized it in the storm-gray of his eyes, in the hard set to his jaw, in the clipped edge to his conversations. There was a manic edge to Gray that she’d never seen before, and it made her nervous. Not for herself, but for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was too soon for him to be out in the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they were committed, and there was no retreating from here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski slipped out a cigar and set about lighting it. A thick pall of smoke already filled the lobby, making her eyes sting. A soccer match played on a large-screen television in the hotel restaurant, drawing in a boisterous crowd that spilled into the lobby and obstructed the way toward the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer partner nodded back toward the hotel’s entrance. “Looks like our friends are setting up camp out there. Making sure we don’t leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan glanced over at the trio who had followed them. They sat at a coffeehouse that offered a view of the hotel’s front steps. Clearly Amur intended to protect his investment, ensuring no other informant intruded on his territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud cheer drew her attention back to the restaurant. The match between Brazil and Germany was heating up. A group of German patrons began singing their national anthem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s get out of here,” she said, intending to return to their rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski lingered, puffing on his cigar, adding to the pollution in the lobby. His eyes had drifted to the soccer match on the television. His legs drew him toward the machismo camaraderie of the live sportscast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least that should keep him out of trouble for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin a few steps, he bumped into a harried waiter holding aloft a huge tray full of teacups and pots of steaming water. The tray went flying, crashing into the mass of men crowded at the entrance to the restaurant. Shouts and curses erupted as scalding water splashed over those closest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a push became a shove, and a fist struck a nose. In a matter of seconds, bedlam broke out. The restaurant emptied into the lobby, escalating into a full brawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski backed Seichan in a corner as a bottle flew past his nose and shattered against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you do?” Seichan scolded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski grinned back at her, keeping the stogie crushed between his teeth as he spoke. “There’s a rear exit through the kitchen. Let me get this party going full swing, and you can duck back into the streets unseen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe locked eyes with her. She read the sharp glimmer buried within that dim exterior. So she wasn’t the only one worried about their partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, which made his grin spread wider, a terrifying sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roar, he turned and leaped into the raucous fray, a veritable bull let loose among the others. In moments, the fighting rolled like a tide toward the hotel’s front doors and spilled out into the streets, spreading the commotion and chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan twisted in the opposite direction, slipping out a scarf and wrapping her head and most of her face. Kowalski bellowed behind her—sounding disturbingly happy, finally in his true element.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow to find Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had Tucker Wayne’s call sign and last position noted on her own phone’s navigation system. That’s where Gray would be headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe burst out the rear door, leaving behind the clatter of pots and pans from the kitchen, and into the dark silence of the back alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could take a step, a bright light speared her, blinding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA harsh voice with a thick British accent accosted her, punctuated by the cocking of a pistol. “Take another step, and I’ll put a bullet through your pretty skull.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 1, 9:24 P.M. East Africa Time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoosaaso, Somalia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding by the fence, Tucker watched the rifle lower toward Kane. The grainy image on the phone set his heart to pounding. He’d never reach his partner in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacting instinctively, he yanked out his pistol, a black SIG Sauer, pointed it into the air, and fired two rounds. The gun blasts stung his ears and echoed across the empty construction site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the screen, the soldier’s aim shifted away as he dropped low, startled by the gunfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker was already moving, heading toward Kane’s hiding place. On his phone, he pressed a green icon in the shape of a small ear and lifted the phone to his lips. He spoke two commands, transmitting them to the receiver behind Kane’s left ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“TAKEDOWN! DISARM!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image on the screen blurred into chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker continued to sprint, staying low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m coming, buddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane tastes blood, feels the crack of bone under the power of his jaws. He holds tight as a pained cry pierces the night. Then a booted blow to his ribs finally knocks him loose. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline-sigma-force-8/page-11.html","bookId":1527,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM"}
