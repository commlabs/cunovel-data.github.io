(2)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing shook his head without hesitation, his gaze not leaving Tian’er’s face. “I believe in Tian’er. Besides myself, Tian’er will never fall for anyone else. If anyone can evoke her memories, it will only be me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXue AoTian gave him a long searching look before turning back to Gu Yingbing. “Yingbing, this is your last chance. Although I know that you were originally Tian’er’s fiance and all of today’s tests may seem unfair to you… I have no choice but to admit that some of Zhou Weiqing’s words had been right earlier. I have not been a good father, and I have never really thought of her interests deep enough. As such, this time, in the final choice, I want to leave the choice to her. I do not want her to suffer for the rest of her life. Do you know? This time, Tian’er had already made the preparation to marry you in order to cement to alliance between the relationship between the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Lion Tribe… and then she would leave us forever... permanently. This is not something I wish to see. If today you can move Tian’er with your words and get her to choose you, then I will not unSeal her memories, and let her be your wife like this. Otherwise, Master can only say sorry to you. I hope you can understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yingbing saw the hint of apology in Xue AoTian’s eyes, and nodded gravely. “Master, I can understand your feelings. I will do my best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXue AoTian nodded and said: “Alright, let us begin then. I will give you five minutes first.” As he said that, Xue AoTian raised his right hand, and a layer of faint gold light spread out, enveloping the family of three along with Gu Yingbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the outside, Zhou Weiqing and Long Shiya could not hear anything, but they could still clearly see what was going on inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes. The last five minutes that would decide if he could spend the rest of his life with his love. In that instant, Gu Yingbing’s forehead was filled with sweat. Even when he had torn off his own arm earlier, he did not have such an expression, his eyes filled with hope, yet more unease and anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a small step forward, Gu Yingbing knelt before Tian’er on a single knee. Right at that moment, Xue AoTian also released his spiritual control over Tian’er, allowing her to resume consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tian’er, it is me. I am your Big Bro Gu!” Gu Yingbing said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTian’er looked vacantly at Gu Yingbing. Currently, her heart was at a loss, with most of her memory vanished. She only had the memory of everything before five years old, as well as her base instincts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally, Xue AoTian had already set his resolve to allow Tian’er to marry Zhou Weiqing. However, when he saw Gu Yingbing tear off his own arm, it had affected him greatly. After all, Gu Yingbing was the disciple that he had raised all these years, and his actions proved that he truly loved Tian’er. Who was to say that Yingbing could not bring happiness to Tian’er? At least, he was not such a ‘playboy’ like Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, Xue AoTian had decided to leave Tian’er with a five year old memory. This also meant that she would know who Gu Yingbing was, but not who Zhou Weiqing was. Without question, this gave Gu Yingbing an obvious advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTowards her husband’s decision, the Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia did not say anything, allowing him to do as he wished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big Bro Gu.” A tender voice rang out from Tian’er, sounding so moving and sweet to Gu Yingbing’s ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yingbing was overjoyed, moving forward slightly in excitement. “Tian’er, it is me! I am your Big Bro Gu! Big Bro Gu loves you so much, do you remember? I brought you to catch those little snow wolves, you were so scared then, just not long ago. You promised Big Bro Gu that when you grow old, you will become Big Bro Gu’s wife. You won’t go back on your word right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTian’er looked absently at Gu Yingbing. “Become Big Bro Gu’s wife? But… Big Bro Gu, why have you become so old?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yingbing started. Even Xue AoTian was helplessly left not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Indeed, he had only left his daughter with her memory of five years. However, that also meant that she had regressed to a mental age of five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow… at thirty years old, how could Gu Yingbing possibly looks like when he was fifteen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a dazed moment, Gu Yingbing quickly said: “Because Big Bro Gu and Tian’er have both grown up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Papa, I am a bit scared. Big Bro Gu… he seems to have changed.” Tian’er muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXue AoTian gently stroked his daughter’s hair. In that instant, he seemed to see the precious young daughter who had also stuck by his side, unwilling to part from him. Every time he entered closed door cultivation, she would pout and stare at him unwillingly. In that moment, his heart was filled with love and tenderness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tian’er, then do you like your Big Bro Gu? Big Bro Gu treats you so well, will you be his wife?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like Big Bro Gu.” Tian’er said without hesitation. “Big Bro Gu always protects me, so I like him!” Hearing her words, tears streamed down Gu Yingbing’s face in joy. “I… I… right? Let me always protect you forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTian’er blinked innocently. “But… liking Big Bro Gu means I have to marry Big Bro Gu? Papa, I do not understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yingbing froze, the hope that had suddenly blazed in his heart crushed in such a massively heavy blow. He could only stare at Tian’er dazedly. For a while, he did not know what to say. Currently, she was just like a little girl, and no matter what he said, she would not leave her father’s arms to enter his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing was watching from outside the shield of light. The expression on his face was calm and confident, but in truth, his hands were gripped tightly in fists. In this final moment, how could he not be nervous? No matter how much confidence he had, how could it be absolute?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he saw that Tian’er was speaking, and that Gu Yingbing’s expression grew more flurried and anxious, Zhou Weiqing did not grow relaxed at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFive minutes, why did it seem so slow!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if an entire century had passed before Gu Yingbing finally seemed to be unable to control himself, standing up and moving right in front of Tian’er, pouring out his heart. Alas for him, almost at the same time, the Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia, who had been standing beside Xue AoTian, suddenly gave a soft sigh, clapping her husband’s shoulder. The five minutes was now up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gold light vanished, and Gu Yingbing was still standing there crying out anxiously: “Tian’er, I am your Big Bro Gu who will protect you forever! Why won’t you marry me? Big Bro Gu won’t force you, let me hug you please? Just like when we were young.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Tian’er seemed to be in a fright, refusing to leave her father’s arms as she clung tight to him, not even looking at Gu Yingbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, the Lion King Gu Site’s face was ashen. Looking at his son, he sighed and said softly: “Foolish child, you were too anxious and impatient. Even if you had a chance, you have thrown it away now.” As the saying goes, ‘a bystander sees things with a clear mind’. Seeing his son’s anxious and flurried look, and looking at Tian’er who had lost most of her memory and was in a fragile state. Being pressed like that, how could she not be afraid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yingbing, enough. If Zhou Weiqing does not gain Tian’er’s approval, you will have a second chance later.” Xue AoTian sighed, trying to comfort him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yingbing’s body swayed, his face paling suddenly. With a *Wah* sound, he suddenly vomited out a mouthful of blood as he staggered back a few steps. He suddenly felt like Tian’er was leaving him further and further. If not for the Tiger King Xue Aoying quickly stepping forward to support him, he would have fallen to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXue AoTian turned his gaze to Zhou Weiqing. To be honest, he did not wish to see this sight, the precious disciple that he had raised and groomed with all his effort, now taking such a huge blow from his daughter. Worse still, he might not be able to get back up from this setback. All of this was because of this young man in front of him, Zhou Weiqing. No matter how outstanding and talented he was, how could he easily replace Gu Yingbing in Xue AoTian’s heart, whom he had raised since young! As such, Xue AoTian’s heart was truly complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is your turn.” Xue AoTian said calmly to Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing nodded, moving to five yards from Tian’er before he stopped. At this moment, his fists unclenched again, as he gazed tenderly at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike Gu Yingbing, he did not seem agitated at all. On the contrary, he just stood there, staring at Tian’er calmly. Currently, Zhou Weiqing had already changed to a fresh new set of clothes, and he had reined in all his Heavenly Energy, not a hint of aura leaking out. He just stood there simply, looking at Tian’er, his gaze tender and clearly filled with love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally hiding in her father’s embrace, Tian’er seemed to sense something, and she slowly lifted her head to look at Zhou Weiqing. In that instant when her gaze finally met his, her entire body trembled slightly. Although she still seemed puzzled and confused, her heart had somehow started racing. This strange looking person in front of her, whom she had no memory of, was somehow tugging at her heartstrings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning, her gaze was trying to escape, until it slowly turned dull and sluggish. Tian’er just continued staring back at Zhou Weiqing, as if trying very hard to remember something, yet just being unable to do so. Slowly, a pained expression crossed her beautiful features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fat Cat.” Zhou Weiqing said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that instant, amongst the entire group gathered there, four people froze at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs everyone knew, tigers were part of the cat family, perhaps the strongest amongst the cat family. Amongst the entire group, four of them were tigers! Besides Tian’er, the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian, the Entropic Nether Tiger Phelia, and the Tiger King Xue Aoying, weren’t they all of a Tiger bloodline? With that single phrase ‘Fat Cat’, the three of them almost vomited blood out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-22-chapter-181-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-22-chapter-181-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-22-chapter-181-02","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
