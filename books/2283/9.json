There was a curl to his lip. He did have a sense of humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I started off the usual way. I was into nudes,” she said drily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a full-fledged smile at that. “Sorry. I guess I did ask that rather caustically.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I always drew, and I had a flair for faces. When I was in college, one of my professors was asked to help with a reconstruction on a burn victim. I was fascinated by his ability to take a skull and return it to life through the image he created. I didn’t go right into forensics, though. I graduated, and then apprenticed on an anthropological dig in Mexico. And...well, Texas is a big state. I helped various departments fairly frequently. Logan was approached by a man named Jackson Crow, who managed the first Krewe, and I was called in. We worked a sad and gritty case in San Antonio, and next thing I knew, I was in the academy at Quantico.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Life does take us along unexpected paths sometimes,” he said. He sounded far more open than he’d been earlier in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You seemed disturbed by my sketch,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “I can’t put my finger on it, but your sketch reminded me of someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At this point it’s not really accurate, you know. It’s just the way I work. Tomorrow, I’ll have measurements, do a second sketch and begin to build up the face. With what we know and what we can guess, that should give us a better sense of a person’s appearance. Some of it remains guesswork, of course, but you’ll have more of a likeness when I’m done. But you can’t know the woman. The skull is over a hundred years old. If it was from someone more recently dead, it wouldn’t be as delicate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I haven’t been around for a hundred-plus years,” he said with a slight laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True, but I understand you’ve been in law enforcement for quite a while. Did you always want to be a cop?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re from here. However, you started your career in Texas?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I went to Texas A \u0026amp; M University and then into the academy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You left Houston to come back here,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My parents died when I was a kid. I was raised by my grandfather. He was dying. I came home to be with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. He had a good life and lived well. Didn’t deserve to die the way he did, but then no one does. The cancer was brutal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you stayed here in Lily,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a rueful smile that could almost be described as charming. “Well,” he mused slowly. “I took the job of sheriff. Right now they’d be stretching to find someone to take my place. I have deputies who’ll be up to it soon enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still...Houston, Texas. Lily, Arizona. You must’ve become accustomed to dealing with gangs, murder...you name it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lily is a change,” he agreed. “In a way, a damned nice change. Back in the very early days—the Civil War and after—you had a fair share of bar brawls, shoot-’em-ups and rancher-outlaw entanglements. Then, a decade or two after the war, there were men working the silver mines out in the caverns. Those were rough days. There was a sheriff way back—but no real sheriff’s department, and the sheriff had to be an ex-outlaw himself to handle the trigger-happy gunfighters out here. Now, of course, we have our small-town department and the larger county department. The towns had their own sheriffs back then and county help amounted to praying that the militia might be on hand or the regular military if things went really badly. But then the outlaw days pretty much petered out in the twenties. We had a few more modern bank-robber types pass through in the thirties. In the forties, when a lot of local men went off to war, the town almost closed down. Now...” He paused with a shrug. “Now, we get a few bar brawls, a few fender benders, occasionally a domestic situation. But Lily’s a safe place. We have law-abiding citizens and tourists for the most part.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you stay because you love Lily, you love the peace and tranquility or...?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or I burned out in Houston?” he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t say that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s easy to burn out in Houston,” he said mildly. “But no, I didn’t burn out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you were friends with Logan and worked with him, you were probably pretty intense as a cop,” Jane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Intense? I think it’s a requirement. Anyway, I liked working in Houston. And I don’t mind being the sheriff in Lily. There is a lot here that’s good. I like the history, and the fact that my family’s from this area. Anyway, who knows what the future will hold?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe velvet curtains were drawn back by an usher as they spoke; people surged out of the theater area and into the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time for me to go,” Logan said, rising. He dug into his pocket and left a large bill on the table. “I’ll pick you up in the morning. Eight-thirty? We have a car you can use while you’re here if you want, but it’s down at the sheriff’s office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. I’ll build up the skull tomorrow, get a more realistic look at measurements and have a more accurate image of soft-tissue depth, at least,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” he said. “You should see the show while you’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did watch a few minutes of it before you arrived. It’s really cute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Catch the haunted hayride, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds like fun. Maybe I will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople were spilling out of the theater. He glanced at the crowd and grimaced. “Kind of a long day. I’m out of here. Good night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a quick escape, and Jane soon realized why. It had been a full house and forty or fifty people were milling in the bar. It seemed a nice crowd; the show made people laugh and put them in a pleasant mood. Some people were going across the street to the saloon—too crowded at the Gilded Lily. She could see that the theater was good for all the businesses in the area. It brought those who then stayed at the Old Jail or other local bed-and-breakfast places or hotels and it brought people to shop and visit restaurants and use the stables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz came sailing by to ask her if she wanted anything else before the crowd got crazy. Jane said no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you, you’re totally on the house,” Liz said, looking at the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sloan left that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That man!” Liz groaned. “He always tips way too much. Well, Lily is his town, and he tries to make sure we all do well here. Wish he’d stay around!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t think he’s going to stay in Lily?” Jane asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz shook her head. “No. Not forever, anyway. He’s popular here. He’s a man’s man, you know?” She laughed. “He doesn’t smoke, but I could’ve seen him as the Marlboro Man, sexy and rugged and good-looking. Don’t you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a very attractive man,” she replied, trying to sound noncommittal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be still, my heart!” Liz said, and then laughed again. “Oh, well. You sure you don’t want anything else—more tea, some coffee or maybe decaf?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, I’m fine, thank you. I’m going to call it a night.” She reached for her purse; her food might be free, but she wasn’t letting a server work for nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you dare leave money. Next time, you can give me a tip if you want. Sloan tipped enough for five tables,” Liz told her. “Seriously, don’t you put down a dime!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane didn’t want to insult the woman and she was afraid that insisting might just do so. “All right, thank you. But, please—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next time!” Liz said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz moved on, efficiently taking orders from the crowd now seeking chairs and bar stools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane didn’t see Henri Coque, Jennie or any of the actors yet—just the people who’d been in the audience. She headed for the stairs. She glanced around to see if the slightest hint of an apparition might appear; none did. She was convinced, however, that she’d seen the image of a woman there earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost in her room? The spirit of Sage McCormick?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd had Sage been busy in the bedroom while she was gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane turned the key in her lock, opened her door, flipped on the light and looked around. Nothing seemed to have changed in the room. “Hello,” she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shout came from the hall. Startled, Jane swung around. Brian Highsmith was opening the door to the room beside hers. “You all right, Jane? Were you expecting to greet the resident ghost? If you’re worried, I can check out the room for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian was serious; he seemed worried that she might be frightened, even though he knew she was an FBI agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just because you know how to use a gun,” he said, walking down the hall toward her, “doesn’t mean you might not be afraid of the theater’s reputation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brian, I’m pretty sure every old building has a reputation for being haunted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But this is Lily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes, it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused, looking a little disappointed. “You don’t understand. This town...well, it saw a lot of violence. The whole place is haunted, inside and out. Are you positive you don’t want me to check that there’s nothing—no one—in your room?” He leaned against the wall, presenting her with a come-on smile. Was he trying to use this as a pickup line? Did he think she’d ask him to protect her, so he could offer to sleep by her side?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was dark and handsome, and although he played the villain, he had a pretty-boy flair to him. She was disturbed to realize she was comparing him to Sloan Trent. Trent was far more seductive, even in his awkward courtesy when he’d pondered opening a door for her. She liked his looks, but she was still debating his reversal, from hostility to polite and genial conversation this evening. Well, he’d wanted a seat to have dinner. It could be as simple as that. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-watching-krewe-of-hunters-9/page-9.html","bookId":2283,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:46:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:46:53 PM"}
