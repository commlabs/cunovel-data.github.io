I\u0027m looking forward to visiting Caitlin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you see in the woman.\" Jonas glanced over his shoulder to check traffic, then swung the wheel of the car. \"She gives me the creeps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what I see in her,\" Verity said quietly. \"I see a strong, lonely woman in need of friendship. Why shouldn\u0027t I be her friend? After all, Caitlin and I have a few things in common.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You what? \" The car whipped around a curve in an arc that was a little too tight. Jonas corrected the maneuver with a disgusted oath. \"Are you out of your tiny little mind? You\u0027ve got nothing in common with Caitlin Evanger. Nothing at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity leaned back into her corner. \"I\u0027m not so sure. Oh, I\u0027ll admit I don\u0027t have her artistic talent. My skills are a lot more mundane. But there is something about her and the way she lives that has a familiar feel to it. Have you ever had a glimpse of the future and discovered that it looked familiar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" The single word was clipped as Jonas concentrated on the narrow road. \"Only the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity wrinkled her nose in a question. \"What do you mean by that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas stifled a soft curse. \"Nothing much. Just that I guess it\u0027s possible to say the past has a familiar feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, it exists. Has existed. It has tentacles that reach into the present. We\u0027re all victims of it. But it makes no sense to say the same about the future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it does. I look at Caitlin and I see the woman I may be in another couple of years. Minus the artistic genius, of course. She has carved out a space for herself and she occupies it completely. She\u0027s strong. I know she employs Tavi to handle the day-to-day problems of life, but you always have a sense that Caitlin would do just fine without Tavi if it was necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Verity, Evanger is one cold fish. Trust me. A man knows that kind of woman when he sees one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity shrugged. \"You see that because she makes it clear she has no need for a man. What\u0027s wrong with that? It gives her a kind of freedom that many women will never know. She\u0027s not dependent on a man for anything, least of all her own happiness. She takes care of herself and finds satisfaction in doing so. I should think you would admire a woman like Caitlin. She\u0027s the kind of woman who would never make demands on a man. She would never try to tie him down or turn him into something he\u0027s not. In short, the perfect female.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t put words in my mouth, Verity. It\u0027s obvious you\u0027ve got a bad case of hero-worship, but don\u0027t try to drag me into the congregation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a question of hero-worship. I like her. I think she needs friends and I have no objection to being her friend. That\u0027s all there is to it.\" Verity smiled wryly and stared out the window. \"Maybe we\u0027d better change the subject.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we\u0027d better, since you\u0027re not making much sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas, I\u0027m warning you, if you don\u0027t behave yourself I\u0027m going to fire you on the spot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, your majesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opted not to respond to that piece of provocation. Jonas had been in an unreadable mood ever since he had told her he had decided to give her time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was very thoughtful of him, Verity had decided. The . problem was, she was coming to the conclusion that she didn\u0027t really want any more time. With a man such as Jonas, a woman had to accept the fact that she wouldn\u0027t have him around for long. It was beginning to occur to Verity that it was a shame to waste what time she did have with him. Like her father, he would take off one of these days. And it was, after all, her father who had taught her to enjoy what life offered when it was offered because there were never any guarantees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe developed a queasy feeling in the pit of her stomach every time she thought of how much Jonas and Emerson had in common. Several times a day she told herself it was better if the brief affair she had begun with Jonas was nipped in the bud. The last thing she needed in her life was a relationship with a man who shared none of her own values.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, given her advancing age and future prospects, surely she had a right to at least one interesting sexual fling, she decided wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, here we are,\" Jonas announced as he parked the car in a wide, graveled drive. \"I don\u0027t see anyone rushing out to greet us. Maybe no one\u0027s home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t sound so hopeful.\" Verity opened her door and got out. The wind off the sea whipped her hair into an instant tangle. The jeans and plaid shirt she had put on that morning in Sequence Springs were not proof against the crisp, snapping breeze, so she reached into the backseat for the bright yellow windbreaker she had brought along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she fastened her jacket, the door slammed on the other side of the car. Jonas stood, one arm resting casually on the roof of the car while he eyed the forbidding structure in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One half-expects someone named Igor to open the door,\" he said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Verity could respond, Tavi Monahan opened the wide, gray door. She stood at the top of the concrete steps leading up to the house and looked at them with an unreadable expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caitlin will be pleased to know you\u0027re here,\" Tavi said very quietly. Tavi herself looked a little less than pleased. Verity thought there was a sense of anxiety beneath that serene, elegant facade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad somebody is pleased,\" Jonas muttered as he pulled his duffel bag and Verity\u0027s small suitcase from the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, Verity decided to pretend she hadn\u0027t overheard the crack. Sometimes the only thing a woman could do with someone like Jonas was ignore him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed Tavi down a hallway paved in gray and black stone. Everything in the house seemed to have been finished in gray and black. Verity silently decided that Jonas was right. Some designer had gotten a little carried away with the theme of concrete and steel. The unusual windows at the front of the house that had looked so much like insect eyes from a distance allowed light in on three levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaitlin\u0027s home was large and as untraditional inside as it was out. The floor plan of the three-story home did not seem to follow any familiar pattern. A steel-banistered staircase connected the various levels, but the rooms Verity saw as she followed Tavi to the top floor seemed strangely shaped. Walls curved and assumed odd angles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a second, narrower staircase that connected the levels from some point at the rear of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavi opened a door in the center of a long, battleship-gray corridor and revealed a granite-colored room that had a wall of angled glass on the ocean side. A huge four-poster bed dominated the room, but it was unlike any four-poster Verity had ever seen before. Instead of being fashioned from heavy oak or mahogany, it was metal. The four posts were stark, monolithic pillars pushing toward the ceiling. A gray and black quilt covered the bed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-38.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
