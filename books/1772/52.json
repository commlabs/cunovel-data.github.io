I hadn’t realized just how tightly I was being choked to death yesterday—I think it was yesterday—and I only now realize just how much it hurts to swallow. I take a sharp breath and push past the mirrors. I need to find a way to get out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens at my touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around the hallway for any sign of life. I don’t have any idea what time of day it is or what I’ve gotten myself into. I don’t know if anyone exists in this house except for Anderson—and whoever it was that helped me in the bathroom—but I have to assess my situation. I have to figure out exactly how much danger I’m in before I can devise a plan to fight my way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to tiptoe quietly down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stairs creak and groan under my weight and I hardly have a chance to backpedal before I hear him call my name. He’s downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson is downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be shy,” he says. I hear the rustle of something that sounds like paper. “I have food for you and I know you must be starving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is suddenly beating in my throat. I wonder what choices I have, what options I have to consider and I decide I can’t hide from him in his own hideout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meet him downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s the same beautiful man he was before. Hair perfect and polished, clothing crisp, clean, expertly pressed. He’s sitting in the living room in an overstuffed chair with a blanket draped over his lap. I notice a gorgeous, rustic-looking, intricately carved walking stick leaning against the armrest. He has a stack of papers in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smell coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” he says to me, not at all surprised by my strange, wild appearance. “Have a seat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you feeling?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up. I don’t answer him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. “Yes, well, I’m sure you’re very surprised to see me here. It’s a lovely little house, isn’t it?” He looks around. “I had this preserved shortly after I moved my family to what is now Sector 45. This sector was supposed to be mine, after all. It turned out to be the ideal place to store my wife.” He waves a hand. “Apparently she doesn’t do very well in the compounds,” he says, as if I’m supposed to have any idea what he’s talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStore his wife?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know why I allow anything out of his mouth to surprise me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson seems to catch my confusion. He looks amused. “Am I to understand that my love-struck boy didn’t tell you about his beloved mother? He didn’t go on and on and on about his pathetic love for the creature that gave birth to him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” is the first word I speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am truly shocked,” Anderson says, smiling like he’s not shocked at all. “He didn’t bother to mention that he has a sick, ailing mother who lives in this house? He didn’t tell you that’s why he wanted the post here, in this sector, so desperately? No? He didn’t tell you anything about that?” He cocks his head. “I am just so shocked,” he lies again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m trying to keep my heart rate down, trying to figure out why on earth he’s telling me this, trying to stay one step ahead of him, but he’s doing a damn good job of confusing the hell out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I was chosen as supreme commander,” he goes on, “I was going to leave Aaron’s mother here and take him with me to the capital. But the boy didn’t want to leave his mother behind. He wanted to take care of her. He didn’t want to leave her. He needed to be with her like some stupid child,” he says, raising his voice at the end, forgetting himself for a moment. He swallows. Regains his composure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaiting for the anvil he’s preparing to drop on my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did he tell you how many other soldiers wanted be in charge of Sector 45? How many fine candidates we had to choose from? He was only eighteen years old!” He laughs. “Everyone thought he’d gone mad. But I gave him a chance,” Anderson says. “I thought it might be good for him to take on that kind of responsibility.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep, contented sigh. “Did he ever tell you,” Anderson says, “what he had to do to prove he was worthy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did he ever tell you what I made him do to earn it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel so dead inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Anderson says, eyes bright, too bright. “I suspect he didn’t want to mention that part, did he? I bet he didn’t include that part of his past, did he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to hear this. I don’t want to know this. I don’t want to listen anymore—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry,” Anderson says. “I won’t spoil it for you. Best to let him share those details with you himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not calm anymore. I’m not calm and I’ve officially begun to panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be heading back to base in just a bit,” Anderson says, sorting through his papers, not seeming to mind having an entirely one-sided conversation with me. “I can’t stand to be under the same roof as his mother for very long—I do not get on well with the ill, unfortunately—but this has turned out to be a convenient little camp under the present circumstances. I’ve been using it as a base from which to oversee all that’s going on at the compounds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bloodshed and Adam and Kenji and Castle and everyone I’ve left behind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could I forget\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horrifying, terrifying possibilities are flashing through my mind. I have no idea what’s happened. If they’re okay. If they know I’m still alive. If Castle managed to get Brendan and Winston back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anyone I know has died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes are crazed, darting around. I get to my feet, convinced that this is all just an elaborate trap, that perhaps someone is going to maul me from behind or someone is waiting in the kitchen with a cleaver, and I can’t catch my breath, I’m wheezing and I’m trying to figure out what to do what to do what to do and I say “What am I doing here? Why did you bring me here? Why haven’t you killed me yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson looks at me. He cocks his head. He says, “I am very upset with you, Juliette. Very, very unhappy.” He says, “You have done a very bad thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” seems to be the only question I know how to ask. “What are you talking about?” For one crazy moment I wonder if he knows about what happened with Warner. I almost feel myself blush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he takes a deep breath. Grabs the cane resting against his chair. He has to use his entire upper body to get to his feet. He’s shaking, even with the cane to support him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s crippled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says, “You did this to me. You managed to overpower me. You shot me in my legs. You almost shot me in the heart. And you kidnapped my son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I gasp, “that wasn’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did this to me.” He cuts me off. “And now I want compensation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSIXTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing. I have to remember to keep breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s quite extraordinary,” Anderson says, “what you were able to do entirely on your own. There were only three people in that room,” he says. “You, me, and my son. My soldiers were watching that entire area for anyone else who might’ve come with you, and they said you were utterly alone.” A pause. “I actually thought you’d come with a team, you see. I didn’t think you’d be brave enough to meet me by yourself. But then you single-handedly disarmed me and stole back your hostages. You had to carry two men—not including my son—out to safety. How you managed to do it is entirely beyond my comprehension.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it hits me: this choice is simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI either tell him the truth about Kenji and Adam and risk having Anderson go after them, or I take the fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I meet Anderson’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. I say, “You called me a stupid little girl. You said I was too much of a coward to defend myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks uncomfortable for the very first time. Seems to realize that I could probably do the same thing to him again, right now if I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I think, yes, I probably could. What an excellent idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for now, I’m still strangely curious to see what he wants from me. Why he’s talking to me. I’m not worried about attacking him right away; I know that I have an advantage over him now. I should be able to overtake him easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson clears his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was planning on returning to the capital,” he says. He takes a deep breath. “But it’s clear that my work here is not yet finished. Your people are making things infinitely more complicated and it’s becoming harder and harder to simply kill all the civilians.” A pause. “Well, no, actually, that’s not true. It’s not hard to kill them, it’s only that it’s becoming impractical.” He looks at me. “If I were to kill them all, I wouldn’t have any left to rule over, would I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe actually laughs. Laughs as if he’s said something funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want with me?” I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes a deep breath. He’s smiling. “I must admit, Juliette—I’m thoroughly impressed. You alone were able to overpower me. You had enough foresight to think of taking my son hostage. You saved two of your own men. You caused an earthquake to save the rest of your team!” He laughs. He laughs and laughs and laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t bother telling him that only 2 of those things are true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see now that my son was right. You could be invaluable to us, especially right now. You know the inside of their headquarters better than anything Aaron is able to remember.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Warner has been to see his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s shared our secrets. Of course he has. I can’t imagine why I’m so surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You,” Anderson says to me, “could help me destroy all of your little friends. You could tell me everything I need to know. You could tell me all about the other freaks, what they’re capable of, what their strengths and weaknesses are. You could take me to their hideout. You would do whatever I asked you to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to spit in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would sooner die,” I tell him. “I’d rather be burned alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I highly doubt that,” he says. He shifts his weight onto the cane to better hold himself up. “I think you’d change your mind if you actually had the opportunity to feel the skin melt off your face. But,” he says, “I am not unkind. I certainly won’t rule it out as an option, if you’re really that interested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorrible, horrible man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles, wide, satisfied by my silence. “Yes, I didn’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door flies open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t move. I don’t turn around. I don’t know if I want to see what’s about to happen to me but then I hear Anderson greet his visitor. Invite him in. Ask him to say hello to their new guest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner steps into my line of vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m suddenly weak through the bone, sick and slightly mortified. Warner doesn’t say a word. He’s wearing his perfect suit with his perfect hair and he looks exactly like the Warner I first met; the only difference now is the look in his eyes. He’s staring at me in a state of shock so debilitating he actually looks ill. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unravel-me-shatter-me-2/page-52.html","bookId":1772,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:06 AM"}
