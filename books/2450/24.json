We run from the mob of zombies, tear along the corridor, knowing we don\u0027t have much time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we pass an open door to a classroom, Linzer ducks inside. \"I\u0027m hiding!\" she screams, slamming the door shut on the rest of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeths starts to slow but Stagger Lee bellows at him, \"Leave her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe press on. My heart\u0027s hammering. I\u0027m finding it hard to breathe. I was never the fittest - too many helpings of fries and not enough exercise. I start to drift towards the rear of the group. We turn a corner, then another. I\u0027ve lost track of where we are. The zombies are drawing closer. The mutants in hoodies must be with them because I hear an occasional whistle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m rushing past a window when I catch a glimpse of open space. I stop and yell to the others, \"We\u0027re next to a courtyard. I\u0027m jumping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know what\u0027s down there,\" Trev roars. \"It could be full of zombies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin ghoulishly. \"Only one way to find out.\" I back up from the window, then hurl myself at the glass, covering my face with my arms. There\u0027s a good chance I\u0027ll slice open a vein or artery, but I\u0027d rather bleed to death than be devoured by the living dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smash through the window and whoop insanely, half-terrified, half-buzzing. My arms snap open and flap wildly. A brief glimpse of the ground coming fast towards me. Then I land in an untidy heap and roll awkwardly. The air\u0027s knocked out of me. Shards of glass nick my hands and knees. But I\u0027m alive. I\u0027m not badly injured. And the courtyard\u0027s empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" I shout at the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeez follows first, bursting through another pane of glass. There\u0027s a wide hole now and the rest can jump cleanly. They pile after us, landing hard, picking themselves up, a few cuts and bruises but no broken ankles or severed arteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuze and Ballydefeck are last. Suze stares at the drop with terror. She\u0027s crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry up,\" Ballydefeck says, grabbing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes him off. \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027m afraid of heights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that bloody high!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scream from a window on the other side of the courtyard stops her. We all look. Linzer is pressed against the glass, her face contorted. Zombies are bunched around her. They yank her out of sight. Looks like Cass might have been right about them having a keen nose for the living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get down and drop, then,\" Ballydefeck barks, getting to his knees and backing out, holding on to the sill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Suze moans, shutting her eyes. \"But I can\u0027t look. You tell me where I have to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a blur of motion. A zombie tackles Suze and she\u0027s gone before she can scream. Ballydefeck yelps and lets go. But hands snake out and grab his arms. He\u0027s hauled back into the room, roaring and cursing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral zombies lean out through the shattered windows, and I\u0027m sure they\u0027re going to jump in and finish us off. But the sunlight unnerves them. They wince, cover their eyes and back away into the gloom. Before hungrier or braver zombies can take their place, we find the nearest door and race back inside, stumbling slightly, feet stinging from the jump, but delighted to be alive, all too aware that we could have very easily gone the same way as Linzer, Suze and Ballydefeck. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-24.html","bookId":2450,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:45 PM"}
