I\u0027ll scrounge around outside for something to eat, some ice to melt, before the storm gets any worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was gone, swallowed by the sheets of snow rippling and twisting like linens on a line. The cave doubled in size without his shoulders and booming voice. So much for professional distance to carry her through this night alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped her mittens to the slick black ground. She unzipped her parka and released the bark and needles into a pile near the mouth of the cavern to vent the smoke. From a pill bottle, she extracted a Vaseline-soaked cotton ball and dropped it on top of the kindling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKneeling, she struck her survival knife against the magnesium stick, launching sparks. She swooped again and again until the cotton ball poofed with flames. Kindling crackled, warmed. Acrid smoke singed the air and her lungs. Once the fire roared, she clicked off the flashlight to save the battery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entrance sealed closed. She startled, knife drawn, then relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh filled the entryway again, logs in his arms. \"I set traps. We\u0027ll shoot hoops to decide who cooks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoser skins Thumper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she not smile at the reference to their old hoops ritual? All the same, she could have done without the reminder of Josh\u0027s better qualities. Smart. Funny. Hot. Air sense in the plane that left people of all ranks bowing in worship. And oh yeah, hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer traitorous gaze skipped over to him as he dumped the wood. Hard, angular features gave him a raw appeal, softened just short of scary by long dark eyelashes. A scar along his jawline provided a touch of humanity to his godlike perfection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it was his humanity that scared her most of all. \"Left or right side?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon?\" He squatted down in front of the fire, stripping off his mittens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Left or right side of the rock bed? After we eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh glanced up at her, eyes clear with understanding of her unstated boundaries. He flipped back his hood. \"Right side, by the light, so I can read myself to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obviously wanted an easygoing tone, too, like with the shooting-hoops comment. Still, tension lines radiating from the corners of his eyes sprinkled guilt all over her. She couldn\u0027t squelch the desire to smooth her fingers over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanger zone. Back off notions of touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opted to be up front. Dodging the obvious wasn\u0027t helping, anyway. \"Kinda tense, huh? Being here together. Things will be better once we\u0027re both settled at work. We won\u0027t see each other so much. Ops officer duties will have you hopping, being called out to the flight line every time there\u0027s an emergency. I\u0027ll be busy giving check rides and filling out form eights. Even when we do see each other, we\u0027ll both be too exhausted to notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Sounds great.\" He brought a longer log down over his knee. The frozen brittle wood snapped in half, the crack echoing. Crouching, he dropped one piece, then the second onto the fledgling fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparks showered up, blazing higher to throw dancing shadows along Josh\u0027s beard-stubbled face. He so didn\u0027t deserve the pain she\u0027d brought to his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inched closer to him, woodsy smoke teasing her nose on its curling path outside. \"You can have the apartment if you want. I\u0027ll look for somewhere else to live. I know you\u0027ll be busy keeping everyone current and spun up in case things flare in Cantou again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted, still staring down into the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh? We have to learn to be civil. This isn\u0027t the only time we\u0027ll be working together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\" His face snapped up. \"Glad you\u0027re ready to talk. Let\u0027s start with why the hell we ever got married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoa! Scream on the brakes. Blood rushed to her head as if she were pulling G-forces. She was thinking more along the lines of \"You get the blender and I\u0027ll take the food processor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opted for the simple answer. \"Your biological clock was ticking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"A guy\u0027s clock doesn\u0027t run down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever.\" He\u0027d wanted babies and she\u0027d wanted to give them to him. So why hadn\u0027t she been able to just go for it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a long stick, he prodded the fire, stoking. \"So why did you marry me?\" \"My biological clock was ticking.\" Partial truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis incredulous look shouted a louder answer than any he could have shot her way. Okay, so she\u0027d delayed having children. Again. And again, even though originally they\u0027d agreed to start a family right away, both of them impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen their final explosive argument while unpacking in their new apartment had ended everything. She\u0027d turned the spare bedroom into an office. He\u0027d been planning more along the lines of a nursery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t stop thinking how damned scared she was to take that final commitment step, because someday he would demand answers to questions she saw crowding his eyes about her past. She hadn\u0027t told him, but she suspected he knew at least a part of the story thanks to her blabbermouth younger sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh pitched a final branch into the fire. With deliberate, predatory intent, he leaned forward. She should move away, but couldn\u0027t find the will. No surprise around Josh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked aside her hood, exposing her face to the grazing knuckles of his caress. \"It\u0027s a damned shame we couldn\u0027t get our clocks in synch, because you know there\u0027s nothing I would have enjoyed more than giving you a baby for Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia held herself still under his touch, unable to pull away, unable to move forward. Her heart twisted with longing. She\u0027d had such hopes for their first holiday season as husband and wife. Her gift for him remained wrapped, hidden, an antique sextant for her navigator husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heat of his fingers scorched her chilled face, stirring the hunger that simmered inside her anytime he touched her. She couldn\u0027t ignore it, but she refused to act on that hunger. \"You really need to stop with the sexual innuendos. It\u0027s going to be uncomfortable enough sleeping next to each other tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared back at her, inscrutable thoughts scrolling across his eyes. Would he push?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he just smiled, letting her off the hook for now. \"I\u0027d much rather sleep beside you than a bear.\" \"Thanks, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand fell away. \"But you\u0027re right. This sucks, being stuck out here together. I\u0027m sorry it had to be this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want him to be nice, especially not now when they faced a final night together. She\u0027d already cheated him of so much. He deserved better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the start, she\u0027d known he was only getting half a person after what happened eight years ago. She\u0027d hoped that maybe if she loved him enough, went through the motions of normalcy, everything would work. He would never know that she couldn\u0027t give him a hundred percent of herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia rocked back on her heels, suddenly certain she could not curl up next to him and hold firm to her resolve. \"Maybe we shouldn\u0027t sleep at the same time after all. Once we finish eating, we could take turns sitting guard to keep the fire going. You should sleep first since you walked the lead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith some luck, they could take turns sleeping until morning, never awake at the same time for long. And somehow forget that they were stranded together during one of the longest nights of the Alaskan winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen hours later on the longest night of his life, Josh held a branch-rigged torch overhead to add to the flashlight rays. Still, the beams barely pierced a dark deeper than outside. While Alicia slept, he wanted to scout around the cave. He needed to work off restless energy after his four-hour power nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d eaten, drunk melted ice, all silently. The talk of babies for the holidays had axed right through any hope of joking away the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo her biological clock was ticking, which meant she just didn\u0027t want his babies. That delivered a kick in the seat of the pants harder than an afterburner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe focused on the task at hand, surveying their surroundings, scouring for anything that might help their survival situation, like animal furs or food. So far, he\u0027d only found an empty rabbit\u0027s nest and a few rats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a surprising lack of anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther wildlife should have taken up residence in this shelter. Yet he couldn\u0027t find so much as a footprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cave floor looked as immaculate as his mother\u0027s fresh-mopped kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one was here now, but his instincts blared that someone had been recently. And that someone didn\u0027t want anyone else to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jerked to look over his shoulder, torch swooshing around to light an empty corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh? It\u0027s just me.\" Alicia\u0027s voice bounced around a corner a second before her flashlight beam\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ericocheted off the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned before she could draw closer. \"Careful about sneaking up on me.\" \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoft regret carried on her single word, the sentiment obviously for so many more things between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sleep-husky tones tempted him to hold her, shake her, kiss her, insist they give things another chance. But did he really want to keep trying to repair their broken relationship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot if she wasn\u0027t willing to be straight up with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d had a bellyful of people holding back from him. Hell, it wasn\u0027t like his brain made him a mind reader. Yet even while he mainstreamed enough to fit in, people always kept up walls with him as if his intelligence allowed him an understanding of their inner secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he could do that, then he wouldn\u0027t have his crap dumped at the BOQ. \"Go back to sleep. It\u0027ll be an ex hausting trek with the extra snowfall. You\u0027ve got maybe four hours left before we start out.\" He raised his torch to illuminate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood silhouetted by the halo of light, her hood flopped back to reveal blond hair, spiky, tousled, as if mussed from his hands during sex. Her unzipped parka flapped open to her sides, revealing soft curves encased in her flight suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat surged south with unerring navigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHitching the torch ahead, he charged past toward the last corridor left unexplored. Four steps in, his instincts blared an undeniable warning. He eyed the irregular hacks in the cave walls, fresh indentions that had nothing to do with nature and everything to do with human intervention. The mine wasn\u0027t abandoned anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite suits dangled from pegs in the wall beside a tarp-draped mound no bigger than the new dining room table he and Alicia had bought the day before their split.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh? Is something wrong?\" Alicia asked from a step behind him and, hell, but he hadn\u0027t even heard her approach this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just hoping I\u0027m not seeing what I think I\u0027m seeing.\" And now he intended to keep Alicia plastered to his side until he knew for certain. \"Stick close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIllumination swelled in the small rock chamber as they walked deeper inside. He strode past the canvas-covered bulk to the white suit bags dangling like ghostly apparitions from a Dickens tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia\u0027s gasp behind him echoed his realization. \"Protective clothing and breathing apparatus. God, Josh, these are better quality than the chemical gear we\u0027re issued and new. What the hell\u0027s going on here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swept aside the tarp to reveal boxlike machinery with levered doors and gauges. And thanks to a stint at the nuclear-weapons officer course at Sandia Labs at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico, he knew exactly what he was seeing. None of it good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently someone has set up a small-time mining operation here. This machine—\" he gestured to the device on the left\"—measures mass of the rock. The one on the right measures radioactivity. Combine those two machines and they perform radiometric sorting, which separates preferred uranium from rock and lesser uranium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa. Uranium? Hold on. This mine\u0027s supposed to be shut down.\" She hooked her hands on her hips, spinning a slow circle. \"Wouldn\u0027t someone have noticed all the activity from hacking out so much rock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Usually with uranium to rock mass, you have to haul away a helluva lot of rock.\" He knelt on one knee in front of the black metal stretch of machinery, flicked a dial gauge. \"Unless I miss my guess, they\u0027ve struck a vein of pure uranite, probably a highly concentrated form. Uranite can be up to eighty-five percent concentrated, which makes small parcels. A mom and pop operation could pull this off without their activity being detected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this uranite has been sitting in a training base backyard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People see what they expect to see. Up to five seconds ago, I thought the only place to find this particular ore was in Blind River, Canada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may not be a genius, but even I know Canada\u0027s mighty darn close to Alaska.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re probably taking out maybe a grocery-bag-size amount per day, then using a small plane or helicopter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia stared at the suits. \"I\u0027m guessing a helicopter since we didn\u0027t see tracks outside other than the rab bits\u0027.\" She filled in the blanks as quickly as he thought them. \"Helicopter blades would blow away footprints upon take off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good guess.\" Damn, why couldn\u0027t they figure out marriage this easily? \"Granted, it\u0027s raw uranium and has to be enriched. But it\u0027s enough uranium to build a bomb the size used in World War II.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So with that grocery bag, either paper or plastic, we could be totally screwed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fingered the Geiger counter attached to one of the suits. \"That\u0027s not even taking into account skipping the enrichment process and building a dirty bomb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis skin tingled at just the thought of radium exposure even as the Geiger counter in his hand told him they\u0027d been exposed to less than an X ray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia backed away from the suits. \"Rose-Bud, as enlightening as this discussion is, I think it\u0027s time we took it outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFair enough. Radiation may not be a major concern, but the people who inhabited those ghostly suits could do some serious real-life haunting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh doused the torch, the flashlight more than adequate for hauling ass out. He clasped her hand and tugged her along behind him, grip tight. He wasn\u0027t risking losing her in the maze of tunnels. \"We\u0027ll call from the radio once we\u0027re outside and can pick up a frequency. Hopefully the weather\u0027s cleared enough to send a chopper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What an excuse to get out of finishing the class.\" \"It\u0027ll make the logbooks for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stumbled behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" he called over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tripped over something in the dark. I\u0027m fine.\" Tripped? Trip. Trip wire. Ah, hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sixth-sense premonition burned over him a half second before rumbling echoed behind them. A collapse? No. More of a squeak. Rolling. Opening. Like a gate or door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/soldier-s-christmas-wingmen-warriors-8/page-3.html","bookId":2640,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:46 PM"}
