He pounded his fist on the small table in the back room of the Copper Ante. It was still the one place in Calimport where he could feel reasonably secure from the ever-prying eyes of Rai-guy and Kimmuriel- and how often he had felt those eyes watching him of late! \"So many layers that they roll back onto each other in a never-ending loop!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwahvel Tiggerwillies leaned back in her chair and studied the man curiously. In all the years she had known Artemis Entreri, she had never seen him so animated or so angry-and when Artemis Entreri was angry, those anywhere in the vicinity of the assassin did well to take extreme care. Even more surprising to the halfling was the fact that Entreri was so angry so soon after killing the hated Domo. Usually killing a wererat put him in a better mood for a day at least. Dwahvel could understand his frustration, though. The man was dealing with dark elves, and though Dwahvel had little real knowledge of the intricacies of drow culture, she had witnessed enough to understand that the dark elves were the masters of intrigue and deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many layers,\" Entreri said more calmly, his rage played out. He turned to Dwahvel and shook his head. \"I am lost within the web within the web. I hardly know what is real anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are still alive,\" Dwahvel offered. \"I would guess, then, that you are doing something right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fear that I erred greatly in killing Domo,\" Entreri admitted, shaking his head. \"I have never been fond of wererats, but this time, perhaps, I should have let him live, if only to provide some opposition to the growing conspiracy against Jarlaxle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not even know if Domo and his wretched, lying companions were speaking truthfully when they uttered words about the drow conspiracy,\" Dwahvel reminded. \"They may have been doing that as misinformation that you would take back to Jarlaxle, thus bringing about a rift in Bregan D\u0027aerthe. Or Domo might have been sputtering for the sake of saving his own head. He knows your relationship with Jarlaxle and understands that you are better off as long as Jarlaxle is in command.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri just stared at her. Domo knew all of that? Of course he did, the assassin told himself. As much as he hated the wererat, he could not dismiss the creature\u0027s cunning in controlling that most difficult of guilds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is irrelevant anyway,\" Dwahvel went on. \"We both know that the ratmen will be minor players at best in any internal struggles of Bregan D\u0027aerthe. If Rai-guy and Kimmuriel start a coup, Domo and his kin would do little to dissuade them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri shook his head again, thoroughly frustrated by it all. Alone he believed that he could outfight or out- think any drow, but they were not alone, were never alone. Because of that harmony of movement within the band\u0027s cliques, Entreri could not be certain of the truth of anything. The addition of the Crystal Shard was merely compounding matters, blurring the truth about the source of the coup-if there was a coup-and making the assassin honestly wonder if Jarlaxle was in charge or was merely a slave to the sentient artifact. As much as Entreri knew that Jarlaxle would protect him, he understood that the Crystal Shard would want him dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dismiss all that you once learned,\" Dwahvel remarked, her voice soothing and calm. \"The drow play no games beyond those that Pasha Pook once played-or Pasha Basadoni, or any of the others, or all of the others together. Their dance is the same as has been going on in Calimport for centuries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the drow are better dancers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwahvel smiled and nodded, conceding the point. \"But is not the solution the same?\" she asked. \"When all is a facade....\" She let the words hang out in the air, one of the basic truths of the streets, and one that Artemis Entreri surely knew as well as anyone. \"When all is a facade...?\" she said again, prompting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri forced himself to calm down, forced himself to dismiss the overblown respect, even fear, he had been developing toward the dark elves, particularly toward Rai- guy and Kimmuriel. \"In such situations, when layer is put upon layer,\" he recited, a basic lesson for all bright prospects within the guild structures, \"when all is a facade, wound within webs of deception, the truth is what you make of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwahvel nodded. \"You will know which path is real, because that is the path you will make real,\" she agreed. \"Nothing pains a liar more than when an opponent turns one of his lies into truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri nodded his agreement, and indeed he felt better. He knew that he would, which was why he had slipped out of House Basadoni after sensing that he was being watched and had gone straight to the Copper Ante.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe Domo?\" the halfling asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri considered it for a moment, and nodded. \"The hourglass has been turned, and the sand is flowing,\" he stated. \"Have you the information I requested?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwahvel reached under the low dust ruffle of the chair in which she was sitting and pulled out a portfolio full of parchments. \"Cadderly,\" she said, handing them over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What of the other item?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the halfling\u0027s hand went down low, this time producing a small sack identical to the one Jarlaxle now carried on his belt, and, Entreri knew without even looking, containing a block of crystal similar in appearance to Crenshinibon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri took it with some trepidation, for it was, to him, the final and irreversible acknowledgment that he was indeed about to embark upon a very dangerous course, perhaps the most dangerous road he had ever walked in all his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no magic about it,\" Dwahvel assured him, noting his concerned expression. \"Just a mystical aura I ordered included so that it would replicate the artifact to any cursory magical inspection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri nodded and hooked the pouch on his belt, behind his hip so that it would be completely concealed by his cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could just get you out of the city,\" Dwahvel offered. \"It would have been far cheaper to hire a wizard to teleport you far, far away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri chuckled at the thought. It was one that had crossed his mind a thousand times since Bregan D\u0027aerthe had come to Calimport, but one that he had always dismissed. How far could he run? Not farther than Rai-guy and Kimmuriel could follow, he understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay close to him,\" Dwahvel warned. \"When it happens, you will have to be the quicker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri nodded and started to rise, but paused and stared hard at Dwahvel. She honestly cared how he managed in this conflict, he realized, and the truth of that- that Dwahvel\u0027s concern for him had little to do with her own personal gain-struck him profoundly. It showed him something he\u0027d not known often in his miserable existence-a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t leave the Copper Ante right away but went into an adjoining room and began ruffling through the reams of information that Dwahvel had collected on the priest, Cadderly. Would this man be the answer to Jarlaxle\u0027s dilemma and thus Entreri\u0027s own?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustration more than anything else guided Jarlaxle\u0027s movements as he made his swift way back to Dallabad, using a variety of magical items to facilitate his silent and unseen passage, but not-pointedly not-calling upon the Crystal Shard for any assistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was it, the drow leader realized, the true test of his newest partnership. It had struck Jarlaxle that perhaps the Crystal Shard had been gaining too much the upper hand in their relationship, and so he had decided to set the matter straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe meant to take down the crystalline tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrenshinibon knew it, too. Jarlaxle could feel the artifact\u0027s unhappy pulsing in his pouch, and he wondered if the powerful item might force a desperate showdown of willpower, one in which there could emerge only one victor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle was ready for that. He was always willing to share in responsibility and decision-making, as long as it eventually led to the achievement of his own goals. Lately, though, he\u0027d come to sense, the Crystal Shard seemed to be altering those very goals. It seemed to be bending him more and more in directions not of his choosing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon after the sun had set, a very dark Calimshan evening, Jarlaxle stood before the crystalline tower, staring hard at it. He strengthened his resolve and mentally bolstered himself for the struggle that he knew would inevitably ensue. With a final glance around to make certain that no one was nearby, he reached into his pouch and took out the sentient artifact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Crenshinibon screamed in his thoughts, the shard obviously knowing exactly what it was the dark elf meant to do. I forbid this. The towers are a manifestation of my- of our strength and indeed heighten that strength. To destroy one is forbidden!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForbidden? Jarlaxle echoed skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not in the best interests of-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7 decide what is in my best interests, Jarlaxle strongly interrupted. And now it is in my interest to tear down this tower. He focused all his mental energies into a singular and powerful command to the Crystal Shard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so it began, a titanic, if silent, struggle of willpower. Jarlaxle, with his centuries of accumulated knowledge and perfected cunning, was pitted squarely against the ages-old dweomer that was the Crystal Shard. Within seconds of the battle, Jarlaxle felt his will bend backward, as if the artifact meant to break his mind completely. It seemed to him as if every fear he had ever harbored in every dark corner of his imagination had become real, stalking inexorably toward his thoughts, his memories, his very identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow naked he felt! How open to the darts and slings of the mighty Crystal Shard!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle composed himself and worked very hard to separate the images, to single out each horrid manifestation and isolate it from the others. Then, focusing as much as he possibly could on that one vividly imagined horror, he counterattacked, using feelings of empowerment and strength, calling upon all of those many, many experiences he had weathered to become this leader of Bregan D\u0027aerthe, this male dark elf who had for so long thrived in the matriarchal hell that was Menzoberranzan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne after another the nightmares fell before him. As his internal struggles began to subside, Jarlaxle sent his willpower out of his inner mind, out to the artifact, issuing that singular, powerful command:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTear down the crystalline tower!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow came the coercion, the images of glory, of armies falling before fields of crystalline towers, of kings coming to him on their knees, bearing the treasures of their kingdoms, of the Matron Mothers of Menzoberranzan anointing him as permanent ruler of their council, speaking of him in terms previously reserved for Lady Lolth herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis second manipulation was, in many ways, even more difficult for Jarlaxle to control and defeat. He could not deny the allure of the images. More importantly, he could not deny the possibilities for Bregan D\u0027aerthe and for him, given the added might that was the Crystal Shard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt his resolve slipping away, a compromise reached that would allow Crenshinibon and Jarlaxle both to find all they desired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was ready to release the artifact from his command, to admit the ridiculousness of tearing down the tower, to give in and reform their undeniably profitable alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was no partnership, for the Crystal Shard was no partner, no real, controllable, replaceable and predictable partner. No, Jarlaxle reminded himself. It was an artifact, an enchanted item, and though sentient it was a created intelligence, a method of reasoning based upon a set and predetermined goal. In this case, apparently, its goal was the acquisition of as many followers and as much power as its magic would allow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Jarlaxle could sympathize, even agree with that goal, he reminded himself pointedly and determinedly that he would have to be the one in command. He fought back against the temptations, denied the Crystal Shard its manipulations as he had beaten back its brute force attack in the beginning of the struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt it, as tangible as a snapping rope, a click in his mind that gave him his answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle was the master. His were the decisions that would guide Bregan D\u0027aerthe and command the Crystal Shard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew then, without the slightest bit of doubt, that the tower was his to destroy, and so he led the shard again to that command. This time, Jarlaxle felt no anger, no denial, no recriminations, only sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beaten artifact began to hum with the energies needed to deconstruct its large magical replica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle opened his eyes and smiled with satisfaction. The fight had been everything he had feared it would be, but in the end, he knew without doubt he had triumphed. He felt the tingling as the essence of the crystalline tower began to weaken. Its binding energy would be stolen away. Then the material bound together by Crenshinibon\u0027s magic would dissipate to the winds. The way he commanded it-and he knew that Crenshinibon could comply-there would be no explosions, no crashing walls, just fading away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle nodded, as satisfied as with any victory he had ever known in his long life of struggles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pictured Dallabad without the tower and wondered what new spies would then show up to determine where the tower had gone, why it had been there in the first place, and if Ahdahnia was, therefore, still in charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" he commanded the artifact. \"The tower remains, by my word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe humming stopped immediately and the Crystal Shard, seeming very humbled, went quiet in Jarlaxle\u0027s thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle smiled even wider. Yes, he would keep the tower, and he decided in the morning he would construct a second one beside the first. The twin towers of Dallabad. Jarlaxle\u0027s twin towers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now the mercenary leader did not fear those towers, nor the source that had inspired him to erect the first one. No, he had won the day and could use the mighty Crystal Shard to bring him to new heights of power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jarlaxle knew it would never threaten him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArtemis Entreri paced the small room he had rented in a nondescript inn far from House Basadoni and any of the other street guilds. On a small table to the side of the bed was his black, red-stitched gauntlet, with Charon\u0027s Claw lying right beside it, the red blade gleaming in the candlelight,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri was not certain of this at all. He wondered what the innkeeper might think if he came in later to find Entreri\u0027s skull-headed corpse smoldering on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a very real possibility, the assassin reminded himself. Every time he used Charon\u0027s Claw, it showed him a new twist, a new trick, and he understood sentient magic well enough to understand that the more powers such a sword possessed, the greater its willpower. Entreri had already seen the result of a defeat in a willpower battle with this particularly nasty sword. He could picture the horrible end of Kohrin Soulez as vividly as if it had happened that very morning, the man\u0027s facial skin rolling up from his bones as it melted away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had to do this and now. He would soon be going against the Crystal Shard, and woe to him if, at that time, he was still waging any kind of mental battle against his own sword. With just that fear in mind, he had even contemplated selling the sword or hiding it away somewhere, but as he considered his other likely enemies, Rai-guy and Kimmuriel, he realized that he had to keep it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to keep it, and he had to dominate it completely. There could be no other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri walked toward the table, rubbing his hands together, then bringing them up to his lips, and blowing into them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around before he reached the sword, thinking, thinking, seeking some alternative. He wondered again if he could sell the vicious blade or hand it over to Dwahvel to lock in a deep hole until after the dark elves had left Calimport and he could, perhaps, return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last thought, of being chased from the city by Jarlaxle\u0027s wretched lieutenants, fired a sudden anger in the assassin, and he strode determinedly over to the table. Before he could again consider the potential implications, he growled and reached over, snapping up Charon\u0027s Claw in his bare hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the immediate tug-not a physical tug, but something deeper, something going to the essence of Artemis Entreri, the spirit of the man. The sword was hungry-how he could feel that hunger! It wanted to consume him, to obliterate his very essence simply because he was bold enough, or foolish enough, to grasp it without that protective gauntlet. Oh, how it wanted him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a twitching in his cheek, an excitement upon his skin, and wondered if he would combust. Entreri forced that notion away and concentrated again on winning the mental battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sentient sword pulled and pulled, relentlessly, and Entreri could hear something akin to laughter in his head, a supreme confidence that reminded him that Charon\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaw would not tire, but he surely would. Another thought came, the realization that he could not even let go of the weapon if he chose to, that he had locked in this combat and there could be no turning back, no surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the ploy of the devilish sword, to impart a sense of complete hopelessness on the part of anyone challenging it, to tell the challenger, in no uncertain terms, that the fight would be to the bitter and disastrous end. For so many before Entreri, such a message had resulted in a breaking of the spirit that the sword had used as a springboard to complete its victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with Entreri, the ploy only brought forth greater feelings of rage, a red wall of determined and focused anger and denial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are mine!\" the assassin growled through gritted teeth. \"You are a possession, a thing, a piece of beaten metal!\" He lifted the gleaming red blade before him and commanded it to bring forth its black light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did not comply. The sword kept attacking Entreri as it had attacked Kohrin Soulez, trying to defeat him mentally that it might burn away his skin, trying to consume him as it had so many before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are mine,\" he said again, his voice calm now, for while the sword had not relented its attack, Entreri\u0027s confidence that he could fend that attack began to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a sudden sting within him, a burning sensation as Charon\u0027s Claw threw all of its energy into him. Rather than deny it he welcomed that energy and took it from the sword. It mounted to a vibrating crescendo and broke apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black light appeared in the small room, and Entreri\u0027s smile gleamed widely within it. The light was confirmation that Entreri had overwhelmed Charon\u0027s Claw, that the sword was indeed his now. He lowered the blade, taking several deep breaths to steady himself, trying not to consider the fact that he had just come back from the very precipice of obliteration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat did not matter anymore. He had beaten the sword, had broken the sword\u0027s spirit, and it belonged to him now as surely as did the jeweled dagger he wore on his other hip. Certainly he would ever after have to take some measure of care that Charon\u0027s Claw would try to break free of him, but that was, at most, a cursory inconvenience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are mine,\" he said again, calmly, and he commanded the sword to dismiss the black light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was again bathed in only candlelight. Charon\u0027s Claw, the sword of Artemis Entreri, offered no arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle thought he knew. Jarlaxle thought that he had won the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Crenshinibon made him think that. Because Crenshinibon wanted the battle between the mercenary leader and his upstart lieutenants to be an honest one, so that it could then determine which would be the better wielder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crystal Shard still favored Rai-guy, because it knew that drow to be more ambitious and more willing, even eager, to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the possibilities here with Jarlaxle did not escape the artifact. Turning him within the layers of deception had been no easy thing, but indeed, Crenshinibon had taken Jarlaxle exactly to that spot where it had desired he go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt dawn the very next morning, a second crystalline tower was erected at Dallabad Oasis. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-13.html","bookId":2138,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:35 PM"}
