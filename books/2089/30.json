Strange things happen on that night. Ask any cop, ER worker, any third-shift waitress or bartender. Full moon equals a very busy night. A year ago I was in the Arkansas hills.

He really was a pig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d planned on staying awhile. I could get several full moons\u0027 worth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice flattened; his eyes went distant; his face was the mask it had been when I first met him, devoid of emotion and life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They lived alone. Existed hand-to-mouth. They were perfect, and they were mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The full moon came, so beautiful and bright. The harvest moon. September. Warm days, cool nights, clear skies. I changed and ran, the wind in my fur, the grass beneath my feet. I ran until I was starving, and then I went back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice shook on the last word. He scrubbed his fingers through his hair and his hand shook, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien - \" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored me. \"She always sat outside once she got the kids to bed.

I didn\u0027t give a shit about sacrifice, mother\u0027s love, anything but meat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d have killed them all, but for one thing. The child said my human name while I was in wolf form.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t work - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to change a werewolf\u0027s form, but it works pretty damned well to curse him.

The most important thing had already been done. Sacrifice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said you didn\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just because I didn\u0027t kill that child doesn\u0027t make her sacrifice any less heroic. I could have run, but I was paralyzed, confused. A being that thrives on selfishness is confronted with total sacrifice. I might have been a wolf, but I still had my brain and it was on overload. I stood there while the mother yanked her child away from me. Her face was wet with tears as she cut her own wrist - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood, tears, sacrifice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The usual,\" he murmured, echoing words of my own that he\u0027d never even heard. \"Then she cursed, or maybe she blessed, me. I\u0027m still not sure. She said, \u0027Damien, from this day on your soul is yours again.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I became a werewolf, my soul was possessed by evil.

Why he never smiled and rarely laughed. Understood but didn\u0027t forgive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You chose to be one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you start to hunt your own kind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I left Arkansas for obvious reasons. Went to Florida, hid in the Everglades. I was haunted by fifty years of faces. Yet the next month, when the full moon came, I hunted. I had no choice. The hunger is a burning, painful thing. You can\u0027t think past it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you shoot yourself before the next full moon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted a brow. \"I wasn\u0027t quite that desperate. Yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think the gun behind the toilet tank was for, Leigh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it wasn\u0027t yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. He\u0027d lied about the gun. But what was one more lie? What disturbed me was how well he\u0027d lied. I\u0027d believed him completely. As completely as I\u0027d believed he loved me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is it now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somewhere safe. In case I need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used the bullet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I can always get more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can\u0027t touch silver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t know someone who can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of a hidden gun with a single silver bullet, just in case, disturbed me, and I wasn\u0027t sure why. I still might shoot him myself. I pushed the thought aside for later analysis. I had enough on my plate already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you went hunting in the Everglades - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miami, actually. A lot more people. But despite the hunger, I couldn\u0027t do it. The very thought of killing and eating a person suddenly nauseated me. Then I came upon another like me and the sickness disappeared. I could kill them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;With every werewolf destroyed I\u0027d be saving lives, and maybe I could atone a little bit for all the deaths.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure if I believed him. What if he was the power eater? What if he was the white wolf and the brown? What if he was Hector? What if he wasn\u0027t? I wasn\u0027t truly certain my nemesis was here - except for the weird stinging of my back. Which just might mean I was halfway to crazy again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to try a frontal assault. \"You won\u0027t get away with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK. Whatever it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed as confused as I was, but he\u0027d seemed a lot of things and none of them were true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you here?\" I asked. \"There has to be a reason you came to Crow Valley instead of any other burg on the planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked. \"You don\u0027t know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured that was why you were here, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to feel uneasy. \"What the hell are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crow Valley. You don\u0027t know why it\u0027s called that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because there are a lot of crows, though I\u0027ve only seen one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were a lot of crows, back when the town began. Because this place was wolf haven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now it\u0027s werewolf run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When this town was founded there were a lot of crows and wolves. But when werewolves move in - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Real wolves move out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the regular folks don\u0027t notice the difference. Until it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying that Crow Valley has a higher than average population of shape-shifters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich would explain why the power eater was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me how you get more powerful from killing them. How can you eat your own kind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eat my - What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bullshit me, Damien. I\u0027m here because there\u0027s a werewolf killing other werewolves - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And eating them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face went blank. \"Not me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you no longer crave human flesh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t mean I crave werewolf meat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what do you eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cheeseburgers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d think he was kidding, but he so rarely was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien glanced away as if embarrassed. \"The blood-lust seems to be satisfied by killing them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying you aren\u0027t trying to become the supreme alpha on the night of the hunter\u0027s moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze returned to mine. \"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. There are two of you running around these woods killing other wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flickered in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027ve been a lot of disappearing lycanthropes.

Or was Damien working with him and lying to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to believe. I didn\u0027t know what to do.
