The Elder God so fixed on saving his foolish mortal companion, blundering forward into such a simple trap. A relief to have the meddling bastard out of the way, serving as a kind of counter-balance to the lurid acquisitiveness of Feather Witch, whose disgusting company the Errant had just left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now he stood in the dark corridor. Alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We will have our Mortal Sword,’ she had announced from her perch on the altar that squatted like an island amidst black floodwater. ‘The idiot remains blind and stupid.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich idiot would that be, Feather Witch? Our imminent Mortal Sword?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I do not understand your sarcasm, Errant. Nothing has gone astray. Our cult grows day by day, among the Letherii slaves, and now the Indebted-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disaffected, you mean. And what is it you are promising them, Feather Witch? In my name?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The golden age of the past. When you stood ascendant among all other gods. When yours was the worship of all the Letherii. Our glory was long ago, and to that we must return.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was never a golden age. Worship of me to the exclusion of all other gods has never existed among the Letherii. The time you speak of was an age of plurality, of tolerance, a culture flowering-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never mind the truth. The past is what I say it is. That is the freedom of teaching the ignorant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had laughed then. The High Priestess stumbles upon a vast wisdom. Yes, gather your disaffected, ignorant fools, then. Fill their heads with the noble glory of a non-existent past, then send them out with their eyes blazing in stupid-but comforting-fervour. And this will begin our new golden age, an exultation in the pleasures of repression and tyrannical control over the lives of everyone. Hail the mighty Errant, the god who brooks no dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What you do with your power is up to you. I know what I plan to do with mine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas has rejected you, Feather Witch. You have lost the one you wanted the most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had smiled. ‘He will change his mind. You will see. Together, we shall forge a dynasty. He was an Indebted. I need only awaken the greed within him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeather Witch, listen well to your god. To this modest sliver of wisdom. The lives of others are not yours to use. Offer them bliss, yes, but do not be disappointed when they choose misery-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecause the misery is theirs, and in deciding to choose someone else’s path or their own, they will choose their own. The Shake have a saying: ‘Open to mem your hand to the shore, watch them walk into the sea.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No wonder they were wiped out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeather Witch-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Listen to my wisdom now, Errant. Wisdom the Shake should have heeded. When it comes to using the lives of others, the first thing to take from them is the privilege of choice. Once you have done that, the rest is easy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had found his High Priestess. Indeed. Bless us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen to them your hand to the shore, watch them walk into the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePress upon them all they need, see them yearn for all they want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGift to them the calm pool of words, watch them draw the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBless upon them the satiation of peace, see them starve for war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant them darkness and they will lust for light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeliver to them death and hear them beg for life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeget life and they will murder your kin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe as they are and they see you different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShow wisdom and you are a fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shore gives way to the sea. And the sea, my friends,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes not dream of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– Shake Prayer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother Hood-damned village, worse than mushrooms after a rain. Proof, if they’d needed it-and they didn’t-that they were drawing ever closer to the capital. Hamlets, villages, towns, traffic on the roads and cart trails, the thundering passage of horses, horns sounding in the distance like the howl of wolves closing in for the kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Best life there is,’ Fiddler muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sergeant?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled onto his back and studied his exhausted, cut-up, blood-stained, wild-eyed excuses for soldiers. What were they now? And what, as they stared back at him, were they seeing? Their last hope, and if that isn’t bad news…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered if Gesler and his squad were still alive. They’d been neatly divided the night before by a clever thrust in strength of Edur, bristling with weapons and sniffing the air like the hounds they had become. Edur on their trail, delivering constant pressure, pushing them ever forward, into what Fiddler damn well knew was a wall of soldiers somewhere ahead-no slipping past when that time came. No squeezing north or south either-the Edur bands filled the north a dozen to a copse and not too far away on the south was the wide Lether River grinning like the sun’s own smile. Finally, aye, someone on the other side had got clever, had made the necessary adjustments, had turned this entire invasion into a vast funnel about to drive the Malazans into a meat-grinder. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-355.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
