Lacordaire explained that the ancestors of the Prince de Polignac had been very great people, and had therefore required culinary performances on a great scale.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then the woman began to chatter something about an oracle of Apollo. \u0026nbsp;There was, she said, a hole in the rock, from which in past times, perhaps more than a hundred years ago, the oracle used to speak forth mysterious words.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There,” she said, pointing to a part of the rock at some distance, “was the hole. \u0026nbsp;And if the ladies would follow her to a little outhouse which was just beyond, she would show them the huge stone mouth out of which the oracle used to speak.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lilian and Mimmy both declared at once for seeing the oracle, but Mrs. Thompson expressed her determination to remain sitting where she was upon the turf. \u0026nbsp;So the guide started off with the young ladies; and will it be thought surprising that M. Lacordaire should have remained alone by the side of Mrs. Thompson?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It must be now or never, Mrs. Thompson felt; and as regarded M. Lacordaire, he probably entertained some idea of the same kind. \u0026nbsp;Mrs. Thompson’s inclinations, though they had never been very strong in the matter, were certainly in favour of the “now.” \u0026nbsp;M. Lacordaire’s inclinations were stronger. \u0026nbsp;He had fully and firmly made up his mind in favour of matrimony; but then he was not so absolutely in favour of the “now.” \u0026nbsp;Mrs. Thompson’s mind, if one could have read it, would have shown a great objection to shilly-shallying, as she was accustomed to call it. \u0026nbsp;But M. Lacordaire, were it not for the danger which might thence arise, would have seen no objection to some slight further procrastination. \u0026nbsp;His courage was beginning, perhaps, to ooze out from his fingers’ ends.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I declare that those girls have scampered away ever so far,” said Mrs. Thompson.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Would madame wish that I should call them back?” said M. Lacordaire, innocently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, no, dear children! let them enjoy themselves; it will be a pleasure to them to run about the rock, and I suppose they will be safe with that woman?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, yes, quite safe,” said M.

Lacordaire was standing immediately before her. \u0026nbsp;He had in his hand a little cane with which he sometimes slapped his boots and sometimes poked about among the rubbish. \u0026nbsp;His hat was not quite straight on his head, having a little jaunty twist to one side, with reference to which, by-the-bye, Mrs. Thompson then resolved that she would make a change, should ever the gentleman become her own property. \u0026nbsp;He still wore his gloves, and was very smart; but it was clear to see that he was not at his ease.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope the heat does not incommode you,” he said after a few moments’ silence. \u0026nbsp;Mrs. Thompson declared that it did not, that she liked a good deal of heat, and that, on the whole, she was very well where she was. \u0026nbsp;She was afraid, however, that she was detaining M. Lacordaire, who might probably wish to be moving about upon the rock. \u0026nbsp;In answer to which M. Lacordaire declared that he never could be so happy anywhere as in her close vicinity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are too good to me,” said Mrs. Thompson, almost sighing. \u0026nbsp;“I don’t know what my stay here would have been without your great kindness.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is madame that has been kind to me,” said M.

Lacordaire; and, as he said it, much more was expressed in his face than in his words. \u0026nbsp;But, then, you can neither accept nor reject a gentleman by what he says in his face. \u0026nbsp;He blushed, too, up to his grizzled hair, and, turning round, walked a step or two away from the widow’s seat, and back again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Thompson the while sat quite still. \u0026nbsp;The displaced fragment, lying, as it did, near a corner of the building, made not an uncomfortable chair. \u0026nbsp;She had only to be careful that she did not injure her hat or crush her clothes, and throw in a word here and there to assist the gentleman, should occasion permit it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Madame!” said M.

Madame, with all my heart and soul I love you. \u0026nbsp;Madame, I offer to you the homage of my heart, my hand, the happiness of my life, and all that I possess in this world;” and then, taking her hand gracefully between his gloves, he pressed his lips against the tips of her fingers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If the thing was to be done, this way of doing it was, perhaps, as good as any other. \u0026nbsp;It was one, at any rate, which left no doubt whatever as to the gentleman’s intentions. \u0026nbsp;Mrs. Thompson, could she have had her own way, would not have allowed her lover of fifty to go down upon his knees, and would have spared him much of the romance of his declaration. \u0026nbsp;So also would she have spared him his yellow gloves and his polished boots. \u0026nbsp;But these were a part of the necessity of the situation, and therefore she wisely took them as matters to be passed over with indifference. \u0026nbsp;Seeing, however, that M. Lacordaire still remained on his knees, it was necessary that she should take some step toward raising him, especially as her two children and the guide would infallibly be upon them before long.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “M. Lacordaire,” she said, “you surprise me greatly; but pray get up.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But will madame vouchsafe to give me some small ground for hope?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The girls will be here directly, M. Lacordaire; pray get up. \u0026nbsp;I can talk to you much better if you will stand up, or sit down on one of these stones.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n M. Lacordaire did as he was bid; he got up, wiped the knees of his pantaloons with his handkerchief, sat down beside her, and then pressed the handle of his cane to his heart.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You really have so surprised me that I hardly know how to answer you,” said Mrs. Thompson. \u0026nbsp;“Indeed, I cannot bring myself to imagine that you are in earnest.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah, madame, do not be so cruel! \u0026nbsp;How can I have lived with you so long, sat beside you for so many days, without having received your image into my heart? \u0026nbsp;I am in earnest! \u0026nbsp;Alas! \u0026nbsp;I fear too much in earnest!” \u0026nbsp;And then he looked at her with all his eyes, and sighed with all his strength.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Thompson’s prudence told her that it would be well to settle the matter, in one way or the other, as soon as possible. \u0026nbsp;Long periods of love-making were fit for younger people than herself and her future possible husband. \u0026nbsp;Her object would be to make him comfortable if she could, and that he should do the same for her, if that also were possible. \u0026nbsp;As for lookings and sighings and pressings of the hand, she had gone through all that some twenty years since in India, when Thompson had been young, and she was still in her teens.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But, M. Lacordaire, there are so many things to be considered. \u0026nbsp;There! \u0026nbsp;I hear the children coming! \u0026nbsp;Let us walk this way for a minute.” \u0026nbsp;And they turned behind a wall which placed them out of sight, and walked on a few paces till they reached a parapet, which stood on the uttermost edge of the high rock. \u0026nbsp;Leaning upon this they continued their conversation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There are so many things to be considered,” said Mrs. Thompson again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, of course,” said M. Lacordaire. \u0026nbsp;“But my one great consideration is this;—that I love madame to distraction.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am very much flattered; of course, any lady would so feel. \u0026nbsp;But, M.

Lacordaire, as he uttered these words, did not look, as the saying is, at his best. \u0026nbsp;But Mrs. Thompson forgave him. \u0026nbsp;She knew that elderly gentlemen under such circumstances do not look at their best.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But if I consented to—to—to such an arrangement, I could only do so on seeing that it would be beneficial—or, at any rate, not injurious—to my children; and that it would offer to ourselves a fair promise of future happiness.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah, madame; it would be the dearest wish of my heart to be a second father to those two young ladies; except, indeed—” and then M.

Lacordaire, perhaps, did feel that Mrs. Thompson’s prudence was of a strong, masculine description; but he hardly liked her the less on this account. \u0026nbsp;To give him his due he was not desirous of marrying her solely for her money’s sake. \u0026nbsp;He also wished for a comfortable home, and proposed to give as much as he got; only he had been anxious to wrap up the solid cake of this business in a casing of sugar of romance. \u0026nbsp;Mrs. Thompson would not have the sugar but the cake might not be the worse on that account.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, madame, not as yet; but they shall all be made open and at your disposal,” said M.

Lacordaire of being false, and so far the matter sounded well.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And what is the business?” she asked, in a tone of voice intended to be indifferent, but which nevertheless showed that she listened anxiously for an answer to her question.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They were both standing with their arms upon the wall, looking down upon the town of Le Puy; but they had so stood that each could see the other’s countenance as they talked. \u0026nbsp;Mrs. Thompson could now perceive that M. Lacordaire became red in the face, as he paused before answering her. \u0026nbsp;She was near to him, and seeing his emotion gently touched his arm with her hand. \u0026nbsp;This she did to reassure him, for she saw that he was ashamed of having to declare that he was a tradesman. \u0026nbsp;As for herself, she had made up her mind to bear with this, if she found, as she felt sure she would find, that the trade was one which would not degrade either him or her. \u0026nbsp;Hitherto, indeed,—in her early days,—she had looked down on trade; but of what benefit had her grand ideas been to her when she had returned to England? \u0026nbsp;She had tried her hand at English genteel society, and no one had seemed to care for her. \u0026nbsp;Therefore, she touched his arm lightly with her fingers that she might encourage him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He paused for a moment, as I have said, and became red; and then feeling that he had shown some symptoms of shame—and feeling also, probably, that it was unmanly in him to do so, he shook himself slightly, raised his head up somewhat more proudly than was his wont, looked her full in the face with more strength of character than she had yet seen him assume; and then, declared his business.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Madame,” he said, in a very audible, but not in a loud voice, “madame—je suis tailleur.” \u0026nbsp;And having so spoken, he turned slightly from her and looked down over the valley towards Le Puy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was nothing more said upon the subject as they drove down from the rock of Polignac back to the town. \u0026nbsp;Immediately on receiving the announcement, Mrs. Thompson found that she had no answer to make. \u0026nbsp;She withdrew her hand—and felt at once that she had received a blow. \u0026nbsp;It was not that she was angry with M. Lacordaire for being a tailor; nor was she angry with him in that, being a tailor, he had so addressed her. \u0026nbsp;But she was surprised, disappointed, and altogether put beyond her ease. \u0026nbsp;She had, at any rate, not expected this. \u0026nbsp;She had dreamed of his being a banker; thought that, perhaps, he might have been a wine merchant; but her idea had never gone below a jeweller or watchmaker. \u0026nbsp;When those words broke upon her ear, “Madame, je suis tailleur,” she had felt herself to be speechless.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the words had not been a minute spoken when Lilian and Mimmy ran up to their mother. \u0026nbsp;“Oh, mamma,” said Lilian, “we thought you were lost; we have searched for you all over the chateau.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We have been sitting very quietly here, my dear, looking at the view,” said Mrs. Thompson.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But, mamma, I do wish you’d see the mouth of the oracle. \u0026nbsp;It is so large, and so round, and so ugly. \u0026nbsp;I put my arm into it all the way,” said Mimmy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But at the present moment her mamma felt no interest in the mouth of the oracle; and so they all walked down together to the carriage. \u0026nbsp;And, though the way was steep, Mrs. Thompson managed to pick her steps without the assistance of an arm; nor did M. Lacordaire presume to offer it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The drive back to town was very silent. \u0026nbsp;Mrs. Thompson did make one or two attempts at conversation, but they were not effectual. \u0026nbsp;M. Lacordaire could not speak at his ease till this matter was settled, and he already had begun to perceive that his business was against him. \u0026nbsp;Why is it that the trade of a tailor should be less honourable than that of a haberdasher, or even a grocer?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They sat next each other at dinner, as usual; and here, as all eyes were upon them, they both made a great struggle to behave in their accustomed way. \u0026nbsp;But even in this they failed. \u0026nbsp;All the world of the H?tel des Ambassadeurs knew that M. Lacordaire had gone forth to make an offer to Mrs. Thompson, and all that world, therefore, was full of speculation. \u0026nbsp;But all the world could make nothing of it. \u0026nbsp;M. Lacordaire did look like a rejected man, but Mrs. Thompson did not look like the woman who had rejected him. \u0026nbsp;That the offer had been made—in that everybody agreed, from the senior habitué of the house who always sat at the head of the table, down to the junior assistant gar?on. \u0026nbsp;But as to reading the riddle, there was no accord among them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the dessert was done, Mrs. Thompson, as usual, withdrew, and M. Lacordaire, as usual, bowed as he stood behind his own chair. \u0026nbsp;He did not, however, attempt to follow her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But when she reached the door she called him. \u0026nbsp;He was at her side in a moment, and then she whispered in his ear—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And I, also—I will be of the same business.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When M. Lacordaire regained the table the senior habitué, the junior gar?on, and all the intermediate ranks of men at the H?tel des Ambassadeurs knew that they might congratulate him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2902/80026.html","bookId":1106,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:24:25 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:24:25 AM"}
