He had already been delayed here for too long. The wealth of the Jagged Slope Mountain Branch Division was likely protected by array formations that would take time to break through.

Still, he could twist space and allowed the chaotic power of space to hide all of his energy, and even make light curve around him as to create a visual blind spot where martial artists couldn’t see him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Eh?

He curbed all of his energy and even stopped his breath and heartbeat. He traced his spatial ring, ready to attack at any given moment. With his strength, once he desired it he could instantly kill this squad in front of him. But, he was in a very dangerous area right now. It was possible that there was a Supreme Elder form the Asura Divine Kingdom on their way here.
