Hey Beau!\" I call up. \"Make sure all the monitors are either on that virtual-reality videotape or for god\u0027s sake MTV or something. I passed a screen that had VH1 on it, and some fat hick in a ten-gallon hat was weeping-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you meet Chloe at Flowers-sorry, Metro CC?\" Beau yells down. \"Because I\u0027m not gonna lie anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you\u0027ll lie,\" I scream up. \"That\u0027s all you ever do.\" Then, after glancing casually at the Details girl: \"Ask Chloe if she\u0027s bringing Beatrice and Julie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence from upstairs makes me cringe, then Beau asks, thoroughly annoyed, \"Do you mean Beatrice Arthur and Julie Hagerty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I shout, gritting my teeth. \"Julie Delpy and Beatrice Dalle. Spare me. Just do it, Beau.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beatrice Dalle\u0027s shooting that Ridley Scott-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The speck thing has really gotten to me. You know why?\" I ask the Details girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because there were... a lot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Because I\u0027m a perfectionist, baby. And you can write that down. In fact I\u0027ll wait a minute while you do so.\" Suddenly I rush back to the panel beneath the bar, everyone rushing back with me up the stairs, and I\u0027m wailing, \"Specks! Holy Christ! Help me, somebody, please? I mean everyone\u0027s acting like there\u0027s a question as to whether these specks are an illusion or a reality. I think they\u0027re pretty goddamn real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reality is an illusion, baby,\" JD says soothingly. \"Reality is an illusion, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one says anything until I\u0027m handed an ashtray, in which I stub out the cigarette I just lit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s, uh, pretty heavy,\" I say, looking at the girl reporter. \"That\u0027s pretty heavy, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs, rotates her shoulders, doodles again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My reaction exactly,\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, before I forget,\" JD says. \"Jann Wenner can\u0027t make it, but he wants to send a\"-JD glances at his notepad-\"check anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A check? A check for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a\"-JD glances at his pad again-\"a, um, check?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh god. Beau! Beau!\" I call up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think people are wondering why we don\u0027t have a whatchamacallit,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton says. Then, after much finger snapping, \"Oh yeah, a cause!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A cause?\" I moan. \"Oh god, I can only imagine what kind of cause you\u0027d want. Scholarship fund for Keanu. Find Marky Mark a g*y brain. Send Linda Evangelista to the rain forest so we can pounce on Kyle MacLachlan. No thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, shouldn\u0027t we have a cause?\" JD says. \"What about global warming or the Amazon? Something. Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Passe. Passe. Passe.\" I stop. \"Wait-Beau! Is Suzanne DePasse coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about AIDS?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Passe. Passe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breast cancer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh groovy, far out,\" I gasp before slapping him lightly on the face. \"Get serious. For who? David Barton? He\u0027s the only one with tits anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I\u0027m trying to say, Victor,\" JD says. \"Something like Don\u0027t Bungle the Jungle or-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, don\u0027t bungle my jungle, you little mo.\" I consider this. \"A cause, hmm? Because we can\"-I mindlessly light another cigarette-\"make more money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And let people have some fun,\" JD reminds me, scratching at a tattoo of a little muscle man on his bicep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and let people have some fun.\" I take a drag. \"I\u0027m considering this, you know, even though the opening is in, oh, less than twenty-four hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what, Victor?\" Peyton asks slyly. I\u0027m getting the, ah, perverse temptation, baby, to, ah-now don\u0027t get scared, promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if you don\u0027t tell me who you\u0027ve slept with in the last week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWide-eyed, Peyton claps his hands together and gushes, \"Keep the specks.\" Then, after seeing my face contort, more timidly offers, \"Save... the specks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Save the specks?\" JD gasps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, save the specks,\" Peyton says. \"Damien wants techno, and those little fellas can definitely be construed as techno.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all want techno, but we want techno without specks,\" JD moans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camcorder guy zooms in on the specks, and it\u0027s very quiet until he says, yawning, \"Far out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People people people.\" I lift my hands up. \"Is it possible to open this club without humiliating ourselves in the process?\" I start to walk away. \"Because I\u0027m beginning to think it\u0027s not possible.
